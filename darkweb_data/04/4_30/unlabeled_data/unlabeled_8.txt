ha! that was the one i was looking for but couldnt find. and it is true, there are much easier ways to find out what you are encrypting than breaking the encryption. brute force is useless so i dont even see why its used as an example.

the subject of passwords and passphrases has been discussed in considerable detail over the last two decades. let me attempt to boil things down as it were: one of the most fundamental concepts in information theory is that of order versus randomness. in order for a message to be meaningful, it must contain some information, meaning that it has both structure as well as content. for example:   it is a beautiful day today, the sky is blue, the birds are singing. the above string (sentence) has structure; it has both order and meaning.   1usmgjtins6xv2lb1ozp/axmwz8utcsb1u39+t+jlcm1j0k64eowi/a+pxov7glwin contrast, this string has no structure; it has neither order nor meaning -- it is essentially random noise. the object of cryptography is to take the first string of characters (english sentence) and using some method (usually based on a mathematical function), transform it into something resembling the second, random string of characters, in order to keep the information out of the hands of unauthorized persons. over the centuries, a variety of methods have been devised to accomplish this -- one of the more common in use today is the cipher. a cipher is a method (usually based on mathematical principles or functions) for transforming data into apparent gibberish. some of the most common ciphers in use today (in pgp) are: aes, the advanced encryption standard, triple-des (often abbreviated as 3des), cast5 and idea. the strength of ciphers (and passphrases) are frequently expressed in bits, thus we have 3 variants on the aes cipher: aes-128, aes-192, and aes-256, where the keys used in these ciphers are 128-bits, 192-bits, and 256-bits respectively. other ciphers used in pgp are also 128-bit: idea and cast5. an exception is 3des at 112-bits. ciphers of 128-bits (or more) are considered unbreakable by brute force attack. here is an interesting note from pgps jon callas, describing the difficulty of cracking modern 128-bit ciphers: quotemodern cryptographic systems are essentially unbreakable, particularly if an adversary is restricted to intercepts. we have argued for, designed, and built systems with 128 bits of security precisely because they are essentially unbreakable. it is very easy to underestimate the power of exponentials. 2^128 is a very big number. burt kaliski first came up with this characterization, and if he had a nickel for every time i tell it, he could buy a latte or three.    imagine a computer that is the size of a grain of sand that can test keys     against some encrypted data. also imagine that it can test a key in the     amount of time it takes light to cross it. then consider a cluster of     these computers, so many that if you covered the earth with them, they     would cover the whole planet to the height of 1 meter. the cluster of     computers would crack a 128-bit key on average in 1,000 years.if you want to brute-force a key, it literally takes a planet-ful of computers. and of course, there are always 256-bit keys, if you worry about the possibility that government has a spare planet that they want to devote to key-cracking. so, a passphrase with 128-bits (or more) of entropy would appear to be ideal. now we have to deal with the question of how do we determine how much entropy is in a passphrase of a certain length? thankfully, the calculations on this are pretty straightforward. one of the most frequently misleading assertions about passwords is that they must include special characters. this may (or may not) be necessary, depending on the length of the password were discussing. as a general rule, the strength of a password depends on two factors: * the length of the password; and* the search space, or the number of characters comprising the set used in the password (or passphrase)the greater the search space, the shorter your password has to be to afford the same security. if your password allows only lowercase, the search space is: 26 if your password allows lower + uppercase, the search space is: 52 (i.e. 26 + 26),if your password allows lower + uppercase + numerals, the search space is: 62 (i.e. 26 + 26 + 10)there are 32 special characters that are sometimes permitted in passwords -- these are: ( ) ` ~ ! @ # $ % ^ & * - + = | \ { } [ ] : ; "  < > , . ? / _ if your password allows lower + uppercase + numerals + special characters, the search space is: 94 (i.e. 26 + 26 + 10 + 32)in situations where we are restricted to short passwords, e.g. 8-16 characters, the use of special characters in addition to uppercase, lowercase and numerals is highly recommended, due to the short password lengths. let me illustrate by some examples: the typical automated teller machine (atm) allows for a 4-digit pin number; this gives us a search space of 10,000 -- from 0000 through 9999. although this is acceptable for a atm, it would be laughable as a computer password -- any password cracking software would break this within seconds. lets assume that now we are using a system with an 8-character password limitation. such systems still exist, believe it or not. one such is torbox. lets see how it stacks up: upper or lowercase only:                 26^8 = 2.08x10^11 or about 208 billion combinations.         (38 bits of entropy)upper + lowercase only:                  52^8 = 5.34x10^13 or about 53,000 billion combinations       (46 bits of entropy)upper + lowercase + numerals:            62^8 = 2.18x10^14 or about 218,000 billion combinations      (48 bits of entropy)upper + lowercase + numberals + special: 94^8 = 6.09x10^15 or about 6.1 million billion combinations  (52 bits of entropy)you can see from the numbers that the addition of special characters increases the complexity considerably, but we are still constrained by the much too-short password length. the major problem wiht the above example (torbox) is that the allowable password length is simply too short.  more reasonable systems will allow passwords in the 16-35 character limit. as a little aside, you may find it of interest to learn that the fsb (federal security bureau) the russian states successor to the soviet kgb, recommended to their agents that they use a 27-character password on their computers. lets do the math, shall we? 27 characters, lowercase-only: 26^27 = 1.60x10^38 this works out to 127 bits of entropy, or just slightly less than the 128-bits afforded by some of the ciphers in pgp. this is 32,000 times as strong as the 3des cipher, at 112-bits. this should be proof-positive that you do not have to have mixed-case, numerics, or special characters if the password is long enough. lets now look at two more recent examples: tormail, which had a 25-character password limit, and mailtor, which has a 35-character limit. tormail: 25 char limit, upper+lowercase+numerals: 62^25 = 6.45x10^44 which works out to 149 bits of entropy. mailtor: 35 char limit, upper+lowercase+numerals: 62^35 = 5.42x10^62 which works out to 208 bits of entropy. both of these are well in excess of the 128-bits that we set as a goal. now, lets consider the original posters 36 characters: 36 chars, lowercase-only: 26^36 = 8.69x10^50 which works out to 169 bits of entropy. 36 chars, mixed-case: 52^36 = 5.97x10^61 which works out to 205 bits of entropy. 36 chars, mixed-case + numerals: 62^36 = 3.36x10^64 which works out to 214 bits of entropy. 36 chars, mixed-case, numerals + special: 94^36 =  1.07x10^71 which works out to 235 bits of entropy. any way you slice it, the original posters 36 character password is more than sufficiently strong to thwart a brute-force attack. as a final note, id like to excerpt some information from jon callas presentation on cracking pgp which he made at at the 2005 defcon conference. note the last reference, about 2^40 hypotheticals per second -- thats about 1.10x10^12 or 1100 billion password guesses per second. also remember that these remarks were made in 2005 -- i think we can assume that the government is considerably better at it by now, some 9 years later. so, to sum up, in order to thwart dictionary attacks and/or brute-forcing passwords have to be random, with about 128 bits of entropy. quotestart hacking the passphrase* use some cracker* call specialists in this (access data, etc.)* major governments have their own clusters to do this* use psychological modeling based upon browser caches, searches of plaintext* can generate over 2^40 hypotheticals per secondzaphod

btc is down around 10% today.  the other cryptocurrencies are mostly down even more.  i wonder if we're going to see an all out crash one day soon.  considering how much cryptocurrencies prices have gone up in the past year, it wouldn't surprise me.  there must be many people sitting on big profits which they haven't converted to fiat currency, and if a lot of them decide now is the time to take their profits, look out below.
blarhh bitcoin fluctuation is a bitch. us vendors, if we have savings can play it smart and cash out at the right times. usually it works out well for me. this time however, i am forced to sell low. oh well, no-biggie.

27 characters, lowercase-only: 26^27 = 1.60x10^38 this works out to 127 bits of entropy, or just slightly less than the 128-bits afforded by some of the ciphers in pgp. this is 32,000 times as strong as the 3des cipher, at 112-bits. this should be proof-positive that you do not have to have mixed-case, numerics, or special characters if the password is long enough. lets now look at two more recent examples: tormail, which had a 25-character password limit, and mailtor, which has a 35-character limit. tormail: 25 char limit, upper+lowercase+numerals: 62^25 = 6.45x10^44 which works out to 149 bits of entropy. mailtor: 35 char limit, upper+lowercase+numerals: 62^35 = 5.42x10^62 which works out to 208 bits of entropy. both of these are well in excess of the 128-bits that we set as a goal. now, lets consider the original posters 36 characters: 36 chars, lowercase-only: 26^36 = 8.69x10^50 which works out to 169 bits of entropy. 36 chars, mixed-case: 52^36 = 5.97x10^61 which works out to 205 bits of entropy. 36 chars, mixed-case + numerals: 62^36 = 3.36x10^64 which works out to 214 bits of entropy. 36 chars, mixed-case, numerals + special: 94^36 =  1.07x10^71 which works out to 235 bits of entropy. any way you slice it, the original posters 36 character password is more than sufficiently strong to thwart a brute-force attack. as a final note, id like to excerpt some information from jon callas presentation on cracking pgp which he made at at the 2005 defcon conference. note the last reference, about 2^40 hypotheticals per second -- thats about 1.10x10^12 or 1100 billion password guesses per second. also remember that these remarks were made in 2005 -- i think we can assume that the government is considerably better at it by now, some 9 years later. so, to sum up, in order to thwart dictionary attacks and/or brute-forcing passwords have to be random, with about 128 bits of entropy. quotestart hacking the passphrase* use some cracker* call specialists in this (access data, etc.)* major governments have their own clusters to do this* use psychological modeling based upon browser caches, searches of plaintext* can generate over 2^40 hypotheticals per secondzaphod

quote from: thedude on march 31, 2014, 07:42:14 amquote from: rounded on march 30, 2014, 01:28:42 pmi have a 36-character strong password and full disk encryption. you need at least 37 to be strong.dude, while i realize that your intent was to be humorous, you nevertheless raise an excellent question, even if only by inference: just how many characters do you need to be secure? the subject of passwords and passphrases has been discussed in considerable detail over the last two decades. let me attempt to boil things down as it were: one of the most fundamental concepts in information theory is that of order versus randomness. in order for a message to be meaningful, it must contain some information, meaning that it has both structure as well as content. for example:   it is a beautiful day today, the sky is blue, the birds are singing. the above string (sentence) has structure; it has both order and meaning.   1usmgjtins6xv2lb1ozp/axmwz8utcsb1u39+t+jlcm1j0k64eowi/a+pxov7glwin contrast, this string has no structure; it has neither order nor meaning -- it is essentially random noise. the object of cryptography is to take the first string of characters (english sentence) and using some method (usually based on a mathematical function), transform it into something resembling the second, random string of characters, in order to keep the information out of the hands of unauthorized persons. over the centuries, a variety of methods have been devised to accomplish this -- one of the more common in use today is the cipher. a cipher is a method (usually based on mathematical principles or functions) for transforming data into apparent gibberish. some of the most common ciphers in use today (in pgp) are: aes, the advanced encryption standard, triple-des (often abbreviated as 3des), cast5 and idea. the strength of ciphers (and passphrases) are frequently expressed in bits, thus we have 3 variants on the aes cipher: aes-128, aes-192, and aes-256, where the keys used in these ciphers are 128-bits, 192-bits, and 256-bits respectively. other ciphers used in pgp are also 128-bit: idea and cast5. an exception is 3des at 112-bits. ciphers of 128-bits (or more) are considered unbreakable by brute force attack. here is an interesting note from pgps jon callas, describing the difficulty of cracking modern 128-bit ciphers: quotemodern cryptographic systems are essentially unbreakable, particularly if an adversary is restricted to intercepts. we have argued for, designed, and built systems with 128 bits of security precisely because they are essentially unbreakable. it is very easy to underestimate the power of exponentials. 2^128 is a very big number. burt kaliski first came up with this characterization, and if he had a nickel for every time i tell it, he could buy a latte or three.    imagine a computer that is the size of a grain of sand that can test keys     against some encrypted data. also imagine that it can test a key in the     amount of time it takes light to cross it. then consider a cluster of     these computers, so many that if you covered the earth with them, they     would cover the whole planet to the height of 1 meter. the cluster of     computers would crack a 128-bit key on average in 1,000 years.if you want to brute-force a key, it literally takes a planet-ful of computers. and of course, there are always 256-bit keys, if you worry about the possibility that government has a spare planet that they want to devote to key-cracking. so, a passphrase with 128-bits (or more) of entropy would appear to be ideal. now we have to deal with the question of how do we determine how much entropy is in a passphrase of a certain length? thankfully, the calculations on this are pretty straightforward. one of the most frequently misleading assertions about passwords is that they must include special characters. this may (or may not) be necessary, depending on the length of the password were discussing. as a general rule, the strength of a password depends on two factors: * the length of the password; and* the search space, or the number of characters comprising the set used in the password (or passphrase)the greater the search space, the shorter your password has to be to afford the same security. if your password allows only lowercase, the search space is: 26 if your password allows lower + uppercase, the search space is: 52 (i.e. 26 + 26),if your password allows lower + uppercase + numerals, the search space is: 62 (i.e. 26 + 26 + 10)there are 32 special characters that are sometimes permitted in passwords -- these are: ( ) ` ~ ! @ # $ % ^ & * - + = | \ { } [ ] : ; "  < > , . ?

ok so i am freaking out right now. i went to move some coin around between a couple of my wallets. i routinely receive coins into a blockchain.info wallet, and then use share send to push them into other wallets when i am not going to be cashing them out. so about 9 hours ago i went to move just about 2btc and initially the transaction popped up onto blockchain with a medium priority expected to confirm within 6 blocks. no big deal this is how it usually goes. but hours later no coins have arrived in my wallet so i started poking around. now when i put the btc address into blockchain i get this message "warning! this bitcoin address contains transactions which may be double spends. you should be extremely careful when trusting any transactions to or from this address."my best guess is that someone else using share coin screwed up, or tried to pull a fast one, but now this transaction seems hopelessly lost, and to make it worse theres about 5k worth of other sends included in this transaction to other addresses. so not only am i getting screwed it looks like about a dozen others are fucked also.has anyone seen this before? is there anything that can be done?

hey, thanks, zaph. i can see cause for concern. in your first reference there was reference to trucrypt being cracked for the mac. i was happy to see in the schneir reference that a scholarly paper indicated that filevault 2 could not be broken. so i have mixed feelings now. i was also hoping for someone to chime in on the use of encrypted disk images in mavericks. its an enrypted partition on my disk. that way, if they accessed the hard drive somehow, i would still have a small partition that would be 256-bit encrypted with a strong password.

thought id pass this along to the community. if you use torchat you may be interested in this.https://github.com/special/torsionheres what the dev wrote on the tor-talk mailing list.torsion is a ready-to-use hidden service instant messaging client with bigger goals and better implementation than the previous work on this concept.the goal [2] is to have a real solution for anonymous chat, with no servers to trust with your communication habits, that any reasonable person can use safely. i think this is a better way to meet those goals than the endless list of server-based encrypted messengers, including those that can integrate with tor. the current version is a substantial improvement over (and not related to) torchat, and i intend to quickly improve it from here to be more secure and more appealing to a broad audience.it’s usable now; there are packages [3] for windows and os x [4], a configuration wizard similar to tbb, contact requests, and a protocol i hopefully won’t regret. i’m looking for people to try it out, validate my ideas and implementation, and help plan the future. i’ve met my first milestones; where to go from here is a decision i’d like to make with the interested community.if you’re intrigued, please give it a try and add torsion:rs7ce36jsj24ogfw. i’m also responsive to email, github issues, and on oftc as ‘special’. i’ve documented the major points of the design at [2], but i’m happy to answer questions and discuss.

yes yes....thank you much my brotha
ok i quit being lazy for a second, and just looked up how to default this off for all new members. this just tested out successfully for a new user on a test forum. edit the file, sources/register.phparound line 400, right above "// registration options are always default options...",  add this:$regoptions['extra_register_vars']['show_online'] = 0;it already knew that was a potential possible registration option so maybe there's a simpler way to do it, but it works. so that would obviously cover all new user registrations, but you would still want to run that query to disable it for all existing users just once:    update smf_members set show_online=0;(obviously use whatever your forum table prefix is if not smf_)i try to forget how horrible php is, so hopefully someone actually runs with this and the 5 minutes it took to check this out wasn't in vain ;-)

quote from: playground on april 02, 2014, 03:47:25 amhi firelight, hi owockeznan,why would you want to be connected to a keyserver ?i understand that in the non-darknet world it is convenient.but why would you want to publish your darknet public keys ?leo can easily access them.  leo doesnt need to go to the troubleof busting a vendor or a buyer to pick up pieces of a puzzle theycan put together later.  if leo raids a keyserver, wont they have access to the logs for the keyserver ? perhaps those logs identify the ip address of: (1) the original submitter of the key(s) and (2) those who chose to access your keys later.and what are the essential differences between firelights keysever setup and owockeznans keyserver setup ?thanks for your help.. have a nice day.playground.oh.. and be happy :-)why would you want to be connected? say one wanted to verify their download of software from the clearnet. the keyserver would make it a lot easier to establish trust with their keys. im certainly not going around publishing every key that i generate or grab. another difference between my setup and firelights is that im using a pool of keyservers. looking at the pool status pages, there are about 20 keyservers that i could pull from. as far as leo, having public keys is not criminal. looking for public keys is not criminal. if one is a very security-oriented person, making connections over tor often and doing searches of keyservers would be normal activity.

ok so i am freaking out right now. i went to move some coin around between a couple of my wallets. i routinely receive coins into a blockchain.info wallet, and then use share send to push them into other wallets when i am not going to be cashing them out. so about 9 hours ago i went to move just about 2btc and initially the transaction popped up onto blockchain with a medium priority expected to confirm within 6 blocks. no big deal this is how it usually goes. but hours later no coins have arrived in my wallet so i started poking around. now when i put the btc address into blockchain i get this message "warning! this bitcoin address contains transactions which may be double spends. you should be extremely careful when trusting any transactions to or from this address."my best guess is that someone else using share coin screwed up, or tried to pull a fast one, but now this transaction seems hopelessly lost, and to make it worse theres about 5k worth of other sends included in this transaction to other addresses. so not only am i getting screwed it looks like about a dozen others are fucked also.has anyone seen this before? is there anything that can be done?

hello siblings,heres an opportunity for savvy entrepreneurs...http://www.coindesk.com/lamassu-ceo-atms-will-soon-become-portals-bitcoin-services/if you read the article, its clear that anyone.. can just order one of these machines.you could rent some space in a shopping center, restaurant,.. and fix it next to the cigarette machines or on a wall next to other atms.probably, it would see more business in a town center or city center.a kanny move.. would be to put one of these up in a night club or restaurant.in particular, this idea might appeal to vendors or market owners.by promoting the distribution of bitcoins, youre promoting the abilityof prospective customers to buy your product.the next step in the evolution of the bitcoin assault on the corrupt bankstersis to link these or similar atms to a bitcoin bank somewhere.and naturally, the atm price of bitcoins is always way above the spot price.so you make a margin on each sale.also note this new and interesting website:http://bitcoinatmmap.com/have a nice day .. and be happyplayground :-)

i seriously think all the people who havent had their balls removed should get together in an effort to bring sr2 and every other sr themed site down. it is the cancer of the deepweb.i honeslty could give a fuck about what an sr clone scam site thinks about another sr clone scam site. i just want all of them and all of their sheep to get the fuck out of here. this isnt a place for ignorant cunts.
http://silkroad5v7dywlc.onion/index.php?topic=34925father tedquote can someone pm me a link please , must try and see if its vulnerable to sql injection . dr cluquoteted - there is nothing worth even trying (i did). doesnt look like it is even functional, but i own the front page now: http://silkroad3wqdnifp.onion do not use real creds a vendor named clu just spammed the market with at least 100 listings that have the sr2.0 url in then and various obsceneties.
this makes me think that it really was dpr who threatened backopy over a url and paid a hacker to try and hack agora over a url.   clu acts as if the url is a weapon or something.  he uses it to attack the other market so he would consider it an attack if he saw a url on his market.

lol  i think clu messed up!  he got so angry that he forgot he had recently claimed he didnt have a botnet to attack agora with.  now we have pgp signed proof that it was a lie because how can he ddos attack sr3 yet he is unable to ddos attack agora?
both dr clu and father ted tried various exploits on the market and none of them worked!  all they can do is spam but they are spamming the hell out of the market.   before clu was banned his listings were very sexually explicit and now other vendor accounts are making categories like "dick" and uploading porn.

we have proof clu is a liar too because recently when he was accused on sr2 forum of ddosing agora with his botnet he said he no longer was in control of a botnet.   he just threatened to use it on sr3.
i dont have clus pgp key to verify it but he cant deny sending the threat if he pgp signed it.  well he can but nobody will believe him like when he said the dnm mods were police as soon as he learned that they banned sr2.0.

this makes me think that it really was dpr who threatened backopy over a url and paid a hacker to try and hack agora over a url.   clu acts as if the url is a weapon or something.  he uses it to attack the other market so he would consider it an attack if he saw a url on his market.

lol  i think clu messed up!  he got so angry that he forgot he had recently claimed he didnt have a botnet to attack agora with.  now we have pgp signed proof that it was a lie because how can he ddos attack sr3 yet he is unable to ddos attack agora?
both dr clu and father ted tried various exploits on the market and none of them worked!  all they can do is spam but they are spamming the hell out of the market.   before clu was banned his listings were very sexually explicit and now other vendor accounts are making categories like "dick" and uploading porn.

we have proof clu is a liar too because recently when he was accused on sr2 forum of ddosing agora with his botnet he said he no longer was in control of a botnet.   he just threatened to use it on sr3.

i seriously think all the people who havent had their balls removed should get together in an effort to bring sr2 and every other sr themed site down. it is the cancer of the deepweb.i honeslty could give a fuck about what an sr clone scam site thinks about another sr clone scam site. i just want all of them and all of their sheep to get the fuck out of here. this isnt a place for ignorant cunts.
i dont have clus pgp key to verify it but he cant deny sending the threat if he pgp signed it.  well he can but nobody will believe him like when he said the dnm mods were police as soon as he learned that they banned sr2.0.

hello siblings,heres an opportunity for savvy entrepreneurs...http://www.coindesk.com/lamassu-ceo-atms-will-soon-become-portals-bitcoin-services/if you read the article, its clear that anyone.. can just order one of these machines.you could rent some space in a shopping center, restaurant,.. and fix it next to the cigarette machines or on a wall next to other atms.probably, it would see more business in a town center or city center.a kanny move.. would be to put one of these up in a night club or restaurant.in particular, this idea might appeal to vendors or market owners.by promoting the distribution of bitcoins, youre promoting the abilityof prospective customers to buy your product.the next step in the evolution of the bitcoin assault on the corrupt bankstersis to link these or similar atms to a bitcoin bank somewhere.and naturally, the atm price of bitcoins is always way above the spot price.so you make a margin on each sale.also note this new and interesting website:http://bitcoinatmmap.com/have a nice day .. and be happyplayground :-)

i love how sr2.0 acts like sr3 is copying them as if they arent both copies of the site "silk road".
this makes me think that it really was dpr who threatened backopy over a url and paid a hacker to try and hack agora over a url.   clu acts as if the url is a weapon or something.  he uses it to attack the other market so he would consider it an attack if he saw a url on his market.

lol  i think clu messed up!  he got so angry that he forgot he had recently claimed he didnt have a botnet to attack agora with.  now we have pgp signed proof that it was a lie because how can he ddos attack sr3 yet he is unable to ddos attack agora?
both dr clu and father ted tried various exploits on the market and none of them worked!  all they can do is spam but they are spamming the hell out of the market.   before clu was banned his listings were very sexually explicit and now other vendor accounts are making categories like "dick" and uploading porn.

we have proof clu is a liar too because recently when he was accused on sr2 forum of ddosing agora with his botnet he said he no longer was in control of a botnet.   he just threatened to use it on sr3.

hello siblings,heres an opportunity for savvy entrepreneurs...http://www.coindesk.com/lamassu-ceo-atms-will-soon-become-portals-bitcoin-services/if you read the article, its clear that anyone.. can just order one of these machines.you could rent some space in a shopping center, restaurant,.. and fix it next to the cigarette machines or on a wall next to other atms.probably, it would see more business in a town center or city center.a kanny move.. would be to put one of these up in a night club or restaurant.in particular, this idea might appeal to vendors or market owners.by promoting the distribution of bitcoins, youre promoting the abilityof prospective customers to buy your product.the next step in the evolution of the bitcoin assault on the corrupt bankstersis to link these or similar atms to a bitcoin bank somewhere.and naturally, the atm price of bitcoins is always way above the spot price.so you make a margin on each sale.also note this new and interesting website:http://bitcoinatmmap.com/have a nice day .. and be happyplayground :-)

this makes me think that it really was dpr who threatened backopy over a url and paid a hacker to try and hack agora over a url.   clu acts as if the url is a weapon or something.  he uses it to attack the other market so he would consider it an attack if he saw a url on his market.

lol  i think clu messed up!  he got so angry that he forgot he had recently claimed he didnt have a botnet to attack agora with.  now we have pgp signed proof that it was a lie because how can he ddos attack sr3 yet he is unable to ddos attack agora?
both dr clu and father ted tried various exploits on the market and none of them worked!  all they can do is spam but they are spamming the hell out of the market.   before clu was banned his listings were very sexually explicit and now other vendor accounts are making categories like "dick" and uploading porn.

we have proof clu is a liar too because recently when he was accused on sr2 forum of ddosing agora with his botnet he said he no longer was in control of a botnet.   he just threatened to use it on sr3.

i seriously think all the people who havent had their balls removed should get together in an effort to bring sr2 and every other sr themed site down. it is the cancer of the deepweb.i honeslty could give a fuck about what an sr clone scam site thinks about another sr clone scam site. i just want all of them and all of their sheep to get the fuck out of here. this isnt a place for ignorant cunts.
i dont have clus pgp key to verify it but he cant deny sending the threat if he pgp signed it.  well he can but nobody will believe him like when he said the dnm mods were police as soon as he learned that they banned sr2.0.

do you have proof you are who you say you are?
has any recently been able to log onto darknet nation - its not coming up

nope, nothing worked so far. i submitted a support ticket, but afaik thats ~2btc down the drain. such is life i guess.

i created two accounts. clu and clu2. i used the former to spam with sr2 links and when both of those accounts were banned, i created doctorclu. from that account, i only sent a message to who i am assuming to be you/nw nugs/your dpr.do you have any proof whatsoever that cp was uploaded from the clu account? when skimming your html, i saw that the image urls had a random base code before the actual uploaded file name. so as the operator, you should be able to tell me the name of the file uploaded to your site as my avatar.im a far cry from a good man, but am very against child pornography/pedophilia.
repost from r/dnm:the only images i uploaded were of my own avatar when i spammed the site with sr2 links. not sure where the cp bullshit comes into play. i dont nor will i ever possess that disgusting material.that signed message was sent to their "dpr". i will have to track that back and see who originally posted it. they are likely running this new site.i also didnt ddos agora. i ddosd tormarket, yes but have not done anything to agora.
i sent him a message so i think he means he sent messages to both me and dpr3 not that i am dpr3.

@owockeznancan you post a step by step instruction for noobs for installing electrum and connection via ssl? would be very useful!peace
since most of you are familiar with the current bazaar setup, here are some of the changes youd notice: - no more bitcoin link on the navigation panel. - instead of topping up to a wallet address to pay for funds, which leaves the scope for hacks and theft by hackers and maket operator, multisignature transactions are now standard, for up-front payment or escrow. - vendors can chose enter a list of public keys (**) in advance for accepting orders, or will be prompted to enter keys if they have none available when accepting an order. - buyers must enter public keys on a per-order basis (**). - in the new system once funds leave a multisig address, they pay directly to the users key that was used to create the address. - users will then need to sign multisignature transactions. as explain in detail below.* we recommend electrum as a bitcoin client, as its the only deterministic key derivation algorithm that sees mainstream use. (**)** - forcing users to enter a list of keys, or individually, or solely from an mpk, sucks. however, this is an acceptable solution until clients adopt bip32 library, which will be the case for the next version of electrum, and eventually all the others as well. so its a start.*** - since vendors/buyers/admins can go missing during an order, 2 of 3 multisignature addresses are used for escrow and up-front payments, so funds are recoverable.so, whats multisig?multisignature addresses are bitcoin addresses controlled by more than one person. they are created with a set of requirements, that dictate how the funds in the address can be moved between parties.2-of-3 signature addresses are jointly controlled by 3 people, the market, the buyer and the seller, but funds can only be moved if two people authorize and sign a transaction.users will be expected to sign transactions for themselves. while current clients leave much to be desired regarding support for multisignature transactions, we believe the best way is by increasing the adoption in it into day-to-day life, and watch the situation improve from there.currently, the only unmodified client which supports signing multisignature transactions is bitcoin core. otherwise, users can use an offline copy of https://coinb.in/multisig to sign in their browser.it kinda sucks that bitcoin core is the only client that lets us do this as of now, but were very much looking forward to a lighter client that supports it out of the box in the days to come.training users to use multisigmultisig can seem complicated, but weve tried to make the process as smooth as practicality can be done and with the neccessary security measures in place. and can only improve from here.completing an order doesnt require many complicated steps at once, but rather it is a gradual process where users are guided doing the transaction. if users have any experience with an electrum offline wallet, the process is very similar - take unsigned transaction, sign, broadcast. heres a more detailed explanation.order process:step 0: buyer choses their items, as normal. when theyre ready, they enter a public key, and their address, and confirm their order.step 1: vendor receives the new order, then must decide to proceed either vis escrow, or up-front payment (fe), based on ratings etc. if the vendor has pre-entered public keys in advance with their listings they can skip to step below, but if not.. they will be prompted to do so here.step 2: awaiting payment: once the order is accepted by the vendor, and the terms are selected (up-front or escrow), the multisig address will be created, and available to all users. a redeemscript is then given, allowing users to verify that the address is one they have control over (which contains their public key). the buyer then needs to pay to the address to continue. once the market has seen enough incoming transactions to this address to cover for the order, it will progress the order to the next step, which is of signing it. first, both users need to import the address to their wallet. a copy/paste command will be shown to help them with that.step 3:  up-front orders only - await buyer signature. if the order is up-front, then the buyer signs the unsigned transaction. they paste the partially signed transaction onto the order page and submit, where it will be verified, and the order progressed to step 4. if the order is escrow, then the process skips this step, and the vendor signs/dispatches first.      step 4: waiting for vendor to deliver goods. the vendor signs to indicate they have dispatched.if the order is up-front, then the vendor will now sign, and broadcast the transaction. once the market sees this transaction in blockchain, then the order is moved to step 5. if the order is escrow, the vendor will add the first signature to the transaction, and paste the partially signed transaction onto the order page. step 5: order has been dispatched. await buyer to sign & broadcast (escrow), or click received (up-front).if its up-front, the buyer simply clicks the received button, and the order is completed (step 7). otherwise, the buyer can raise a dispute.if its escrow, when the goods arrive the buyer signs & broadcasts the transaction paying the vendor, the order is marked as completed (step 7). otherwise, the buyer or the vendor can raise a dispute.step 6: disputed orderif a dispute is raised, and the order was escrow, the market administrator will be able to craft a new raw transaction, which pays the buyer/vendor an appropriate amount at their discretion. ideally, both users should be satisfied with the outcome, but the admin can sign, and wait for the second signature, and the transaction to be broadcast, before the dispute is automatically closed, and the order marked complete.step 7: completed orderat this point, the buyer and seller will be asked to leave feedback for the other. a buyer will leave feedback for the vendor, and then the items. a vendor will leave feedback for the buyer.if the order was disputed, this will mark each review on the page as disputed, allowing users to read what happened.leaving feedback:vendors can rate buyers on qualities like cooperation and communication, from 1-5.buyers can rate vendors on qualities like shipping, and communication, from 1-5. they also rate the items on an order, on item quality, and if it matches description as on the listing.when buyers leave feedback for an order with more than one item, they can choose to rate all the items with the same score, and comments, or else fill in ratings/comments individually.all users can leave comments about the vendor/buyer/item. these can be from a list of prepared statements (to mask peoples writing styles), or else a bespoke comment can be written. also, feedback takes on average 12 hours to show up and are updated in bulk to keep them anonymous- all feedback will have a timestamp of 12pm the following day, so they appear in a batch.now wed be thoroughly testing out these features over the next week with select market users.. before we go live. and all those whod wanted to participate have been invited to a seperate board on the subject on how to get started. so as we go long more posts and pics will be updated every now and then.

beware of ordering from vapor_pen. i ordered about a week ago and sent my pgp encrypted address, only to have him respond that he couldnt decrypt it. no one else ever has problems with my pgp. so, come to find out he uses "igolder.com" for pgp - a service that is very questionable, security-wise. he wanted me to send my address via privnote (not secure) and email (please). none of these security issues are disclaimed in his vendor profile or i never wouldve ordered.most infuriatingly, despite my repeated please to just cancel the order so the coins would come back out of escrow, he just wouldnt, for a week just kept asking me to send my address via privnote or email.i was starting to wonder if he was just waiting for it to autofinalize. finally bsm support canceled it for me.vapor_pen is either really really stupid or clever enough to appear stupid, and most importantly he does not utilize accepted standards of secure communication! dont expose yourself to danger needlessly. dont patronize him. if he cant use pgp, what other dangerous practices is he engaging in with your personal information?

await buyer signature. if the order is up-front, then the buyer signs the unsigned transaction. they paste the partially signed transaction onto the order page and submit, where it will be verified, and the order progressed to step 4. if the order is escrow, then the process skips this step, and the vendor signs/dispatches first.      step 4: waiting for vendor to deliver goods. the vendor signs to indicate they have dispatched.if the order is up-front, then the vendor will now sign, and broadcast the transaction. once the market sees this transaction in blockchain, then the order is moved to step 5. if the order is escrow, the vendor will add the first signature to the transaction, and paste the partially signed transaction onto the order page. step 5: order has been dispatched. await buyer to sign & broadcast (escrow), or click received (up-front).if its up-front, the buyer simply clicks the received button, and the order is completed (step 7). otherwise, the buyer can raise a dispute.if its escrow, when the goods arrive the buyer signs & broadcasts the transaction paying the vendor, the order is marked as completed (step 7). otherwise, the buyer or the vendor can raise a dispute.step 6: disputed orderif a dispute is raised, and the order was escrow, the market administrator will be able to craft a new raw transaction, which pays the buyer/vendor an appropriate amount at their discretion. ideally, both users should be satisfied with the outcome, but the admin can sign, and wait for the second signature, and the transaction to be broadcast, before the dispute is automatically closed, and the order marked complete.step 7: completed orderat this point, the buyer and seller will be asked to leave feedback for the other. a buyer will leave feedback for the vendor, and then the items. a vendor will leave feedback for the buyer.if the order was disputed, this will mark each review on the page as disputed, allowing users to read what happened.leaving feedback:vendors can rate buyers on qualities like cooperation and communication, from 1-5.buyers can rate vendors on qualities like shipping, and communication, from 1-5. they also rate the items on an order, on item quality, and if it matches description as on the listing.when buyers leave feedback for an order with more than one item, they can choose to rate all the items with the same score, and comments, or else fill in ratings/comments individually.all users can leave comments about the vendor/buyer/item. these can be from a list of prepared statements (to mask peoples writing styles), or else a bespoke comment can be written. also, feedback takes on average 12 hours to show up and are updated in bulk to keep them anonymous- all feedback will have a timestamp of 12pm the following day, so they appear in a batch.now wed be thoroughly testing out these features over the next week with select market users.. before we go live. and all those whod wanted to participate have been invited to a seperate board on the subject on how to get started. so as we go long more posts and pics will be updated every now and then.

beware of ordering from vapor_pen. i ordered about a week ago and sent my pgp encrypted address, only to have him respond that he couldnt decrypt it. no one else ever has problems with my pgp. so, come to find out he uses "igolder.com" for pgp - a service that is very questionable, security-wise. he wanted me to send my address via privnote (not secure) and email (please). none of these security issues are disclaimed in his vendor profile or i never wouldve ordered.most infuriatingly, despite my repeated please to just cancel the order so the coins would come back out of escrow, he just wouldnt, for a week just kept asking me to send my address via privnote or email.i was starting to wonder if he was just waiting for it to autofinalize. finally bsm support canceled it for me.vapor_pen is either really really stupid or clever enough to appear stupid, and most importantly he does not utilize accepted standards of secure communication! dont expose yourself to danger needlessly. dont patronize him. if he cant use pgp, what other dangerous practices is he engaging in with your personal information?

is this already implemented?i assume it is all just the latest version of bitwasp?
this is unsettling.. all tba clients are advised to update any related security patches and/or applications.clearnet source at: https://blog.torproject.org/blog/openssl-bug-cve-2014-0160a new openssl vulnerability on 1.0.1 through 1.0.1f is out today, which can be used to reveal memory to a connected client or server. if youre using an older openssl version, youre safe. note that this bug affects way more programs than just tor — expect everybody who runs an https webserver to be scrambling today. if you need strong anonymity or privacy on the internet, you might want to stay away from the internet entirely for the next few days while things settle.here are our first thoughts on what tor components are affected:clients: tor browser shouldnt be affected, since it uses libnss rather than openssl. but tor clients could possibly be induced to send sensitive information like "what sites you visited in this session" to your entry guards. if youre using tbb well have new bundles out shortly; if youre using your operating systems tor package you should get a new openssl package and then be sure to manually restart your tor.relays and bridges: tor relays and bridges could maybe be made to leak their medium-term onion keys (rotated once a week), or their long-term relay identity keys. an attacker who has your relay identity key can publish a new relay descriptor indicating that youre at a new location (not a particularly useful attack). an attacker who has your relay identity key, has your onion key, and can intercept traffic flows to your ip address can impersonate your relay (but remember that tors multi-hop design means that attacking just one relay in the clients path is not very useful). in any case, best practice would be to update your openssl package, discard all the files in keys/ in your datadirectory, and restart your tor to generate new keys.hidden services: tor hidden services might leak their long-term hidden service identity keys to their guard relays. like the last big openssl bug, this shouldnt allow an attacker to identify the location of the hidden service, but an attacker who knows the hidden service identity key can impersonate the hidden service. best practice would be to move to a new hidden-service address at your convenience.directory authorities: in addition to the keys listed in the "relays and bridges" section above, tor directory authorities might leak their medium-term authority signing keys. once youve updated your openssl package, you should generate a new signing key. long-term directory authority identity keys are offline so should not be affected (whew). more tricky is that clients have your relay identity key hard-coded, so please dont rotate that yet. well see how this unfolds and try to think of a good solution there.tails is still tracking debian oldstable, so it should not be affected by this bug.orbot looks vulnerable; well try to publish more details here soon.it looks like most of the webservers in the https://www.torproject.org/ rotation need upgrades too, and maybe well need to throw away our torproject ssl web cert and get a new one — hopefully well deal with all that soon.
the new grams (http://grams7enufi7jmdl.onion/) search engine pulls and indexes listings from agora, pandora, and silk road 2 and will add more markets in weeks to come, enabling anyone on tor to easily search across markets without joining first. what do you think, good idea or bad?
im not sure i understand the disdane for sr... granted, i was not around for the sr1 days but, i have been present for all of sr2.  i have had countless successful transactions and consider it the safest play of the markets i have visited.  are you guys aware that they are paying back every bitcoin lost??  they have the largest selection of all the dw.  you are doing yourself a dis-service by crossing them off your list.  just my two cents.
have you considered making a market announcement to get listed on reddit.com/r/darknetmarkets?
as the title says ive been waiting 3 weeks for an answer from support, for a simple yes no question.a part from that the site looks really good.
i am unable to register.  keep getting the same error that is mentioned above.  your captcha has expired. please try again.

as the title says ive been waiting 3 weeks for an answer from support, for a simple yes no question.a part from that the site looks really good.
edit: now resolvedoriginal op:i logged in less than an hour ago and now the exact same credentials result in "the password or username does not exist". so i reset my password using the secret code decrypted with my private key and the new password i made still resulted in "the password or username does not exist". i sent a support ticket the day i oppenned my account because my pin wouldnt work, and i use the same three pins for all my accounts everywhere in real life, the dark net, clear net, everywhere i use a combination of three different pins and none of them worked. support told me i couldnt change or reset my pin and i could only spend my balance down to zero. they told me that if i insisted on resetting the pin i could have the option of waiting ten days. well i found a vendor that i spent my balance down to zero with but this vendor turned out to be my go-to guy for cocaine, tocoolforschool14. this last batch of cocaine i bought was really ugly and i decided not to buy from him again and couldnt find any other vendors with descent prices. so this morning i sent a support ticket asking for the option to wait ten days for my pin to be reset.        and less than an hour later my account is gone! i mean fucking vanished. i made a clone account and my support tickets about my deleted account are not being answered at all. i believe bluesky stole my coins. i am not a troll. this is not bullshit. my account and coins are gone. i am straight up accusing bluesky of deleting my account and they are not defending themselves or even answering me. everyone look at the signs of how sketchy this market is: no forum, no reseting pin, no new pins, negative feedback doesnt show up at all, support cherry picking which tickets to answer...allot of red flags now that my coins and account are gone without a trace. my private key is still in the system tho. that is the proof that this had to be done by bluesky admin. because i can still reset my password, but no new password brings back the deleted account. 1.29btc stolen by bluesky marketplace.

im not sure i understand the disdane for sr... granted, i was not around for the sr1 days but, i have been present for all of sr2.  i have had countless successful transactions and consider it the safest play of the markets i have visited.  are you guys aware that they are paying back every bitcoin lost??  they have the largest selection of all the dw.  you are doing yourself a dis-service by crossing them off your list.  just my two cents.

this is some seriously bad jujuthis is a security clusterfuck of the first order. if the richter scale applied to security issues, this one would be a 11.  in a nutshell, this vulnerability in openssl, allowed an attacker to grab 64k chunks of memory on the system they were attacking. this 64k chunk could include ssl private keys, passwords, or other sensitive information. you will remember that on one of the snowden slide, it said, "ssl removed here".  i dont know if this is what they were talking about or not.  there is no way to know which sites have been attacked, or had their private keys stolen. every site using ssl is going to have to generate a new ssl keypair (hopefully 2048-bit) and have it signed by a certificate authority.  this is going to make the debian ssl debacle look like a picnic. quoterisk assessment / security & hacktivismcritical crypto bug in openssl opens two-thirds of the web to eavesdroppingexploits allow attackers to obtain private keys used to decrypt sensitive data.by dan goodin - apr 8, 2014 12:10 am utc for a more detailed analysis of this catastrophic bug, see this update, [1] which went live about 18 hours after ars published this initial post.researchers have discovered an extremely critical defect in the cryptographic software library an estimated two-thirds of web servers use to identify themselves to end users and prevent the eavesdropping of passwords, banking credentials, and other sensitive data.the warning about the bug in openssl coincided with the release of version 1.0.1g of the open-source program, [2] which is the default cryptographic library used in the apache and nginx web server applications, as well as a wide variety of operating systems and e-mail and instant-messaging clients. the bug, which has resided in production versions of openssl for more than two years, could make it possible for people to recover the private encryption key at the heart of the digital certificates used to authenticate internet servers and to encrypt data traveling between them and end users. attacks leave no traces in server logs, so theres no way of knowing if the bug has been actively exploited. still, the risk is extraordinary, given the ability to disclose keys, passwords, and other credentials that could be used in future compromises."bugs in single software or library come and go and are fixed by new versions," the researchers who discovered the vulnerability wrote in a blog post published monday. [3] "however this bug has left a large amount of private keys and other secrets exposed to the internet. considering the long exposure, ease of exploitations and attacks leaving no trace this exposure should be taken seriously."the researchers, who work at google and software security firm codenomicon, said even after vulnerable websites install the openssl patch, they may still remain vulnerable to attacks. the risk stems from the possibility that attackers already exploited the vulnerability to recover the private key of the digital certificate, passwords used to administer the sites, or authentication cookies and similar credentials used to validate users to restricted parts of a website. fully recovering from the two-year-long vulnerability may also require revoking any exposed keys, reissuing new keys, and invalidating all session keys and session cookies. members of the tor anonymity project have a brief write-up of the bug here, [4] and a this analysis provides useful technical details. [5]openssl is by far the internets most popular open-source cryptographic library and tls implementation. it is the default encryption engine for apache, nginx, which according to netcraft runs 66 percent of websites. [6] openssl also ships in a wide variety of operating systems and applications, including the debian wheezy, ubuntu, centos, fedora, openbsd, freebsd, and opensuse distributions of linux. the missing bounds check [7] in the handling of the transport layer security (tls) heartbeat extension affects openssl 1.0.1 through 1.0.1f.the bug, which is officially referenced as cve-2014-0160, makes it possible for attackers to recover up to 64 kilobytes of memory from the server or client computer running a vulnerable openssl version. nick sullivan, a systems engineer at cloudflare, a content delivery network that patched the openssl vulnerability last week, [8] said his company is still evaluating the likelihood that private keys appeared in memory and were recovered by attackers who knew how to exploit the flaw before the disclosure. based on the results of the assessment, the company may decide to replace its underlying tls certificate or take other actions, he said.attacking from the outsidethe researchers who discovered the vulnerability, however, were less optimistic about the risks, saying the bug makes it possible for attackers to surreptitiously bypass virtually all tls protections and to retrieve sensitive data residing in the memory of computers or servers running openssl-powered software."we attacked ourselves from outside, without leaving a trace," they wrote. "without using any privileged information or credentials we were able steal from ourselves the secret keys used for our x.509 certificates, user names and passwords, instant messages, emails and business critical documents and communication."they called on white-hat hackers to set up "honeypots" of vulnerable tls servers designed to entrap attackers in an attempt to see if the bug is being actively exploited in the wild. the researchers have dubbed the vulnerability heartbleed because the underlying bug resides in the openssl implementation of the tls heartbeat extension as described in rfc 6520 of the internet engineering task force. [9]the openssl vulnerability is the latest to threaten the https scheme thats the default and often only method for cryptographically protecting websites, e-mail, an other internet communications from attacks that allow hackers to eavesdrop on end users or impersonate trusted websites. last month, developers of the gnutls library disclosed an equally catastrophic bug that left hundreds of open-source applications open to similar attacks. [10] and in february, apple fixed an extremely critical vulnerability in the ios and os x operating systems that also made it possible for hackers to bypass https protections.

definitely seems like a great idea, but it seems too good to be true.
blue sky market support is always responsive and always knows exactly what to do. it may take 48 hours but bsm will never "steal coins." best support ive worked with in any of the markets.
to the op may i suggest you change the title of this thread i have merge the other into one and you have apologized but the title is very misleading for someone skimming over the forum, its only fair as you were wrong that you alter this i reckon dont you? would have deleted it but some positive feedback for bsm on here so this is the reason it has stayed put.
bad juju indeed
yea ill take screen shots. stand by.
yea ill take screen shots. stand by.

now it says "sorry, 3 attempts were already made to reset that users password in the last 24 hours.please try again later." and i cant take a screen shot of the pgp message to decrypt it. but i decrypted it 3 times and used 3 new passwords on it and still doesnt recognize the account. not a wrong password or captcha, the account is gone (inactivated) but the ability to change the password is still available. the fact that my private key can still change the password but no new password will access the account is proof bluesky deactivated the account. i even tried making a new password with my clone account to make sure there wasnt a glitch in the password resetting procedure and i was able to change that password and login with the new one just fine.
support is usually on point, got to give them time, it seems to me like its just one person behind the scenes.they always get shit done though.

yea ill take screen shots. stand by.
they contacted me on my clone account. im sorry for the spaz. i was wrong. this was all done at my request to reset my pin. i just had no idea my accound would vanish without notice.please dont troll me, this is my apology.

this is some seriously bad jujuthis is a security clusterfuck of the first order. if the richter scale applied to security issues, this one would be a 11.  in a nutshell, this vulnerability in openssl, allowed an attacker to grab 64k chunks of memory on the system they were attacking. this 64k chunk could include ssl private keys, passwords, or other sensitive information. you will remember that on one of the snowden slide, it said, "ssl removed here".  i dont know if this is what they were talking about or not.  there is no way to know which sites have been attacked, or had their private keys stolen. every site using ssl is going to have to generate a new ssl keypair (hopefully 2048-bit) and have it signed by a certificate authority.  this is going to make the debian ssl debacle look like a picnic. quoterisk assessment / security & hacktivismcritical crypto bug in openssl opens two-thirds of the web to eavesdroppingexploits allow attackers to obtain private keys used to decrypt sensitive data.by dan goodin - apr 8, 2014 12:10 am utc for a more detailed analysis of this catastrophic bug, see this update, [1] which went live about 18 hours after ars published this initial post.researchers have discovered an extremely critical defect in the cryptographic software library an estimated two-thirds of web servers use to identify themselves to end users and prevent the eavesdropping of passwords, banking credentials, and other sensitive data.the warning about the bug in openssl coincided with the release of version 1.0.1g of the open-source program, [2] which is the default cryptographic library used in the apache and nginx web server applications, as well as a wide variety of operating systems and e-mail and instant-messaging clients. the bug, which has resided in production versions of openssl for more than two years, could make it possible for people to recover the private encryption key at the heart of the digital certificates used to authenticate internet servers and to encrypt data traveling between them and end users. attacks leave no traces in server logs, so theres no way of knowing if the bug has been actively exploited. still, the risk is extraordinary, given the ability to disclose keys, passwords, and other credentials that could be used in future compromises."bugs in single software or library come and go and are fixed by new versions," the researchers who discovered the vulnerability wrote in a blog post published monday. [3] "however this bug has left a large amount of private keys and other secrets exposed to the internet. considering the long exposure, ease of exploitations and attacks leaving no trace this exposure should be taken seriously."the researchers, who work at google and software security firm codenomicon, said even after vulnerable websites install the openssl patch, they may still remain vulnerable to attacks. the risk stems from the possibility that attackers already exploited the vulnerability to recover the private key of the digital certificate, passwords used to administer the sites, or authentication cookies and similar credentials used to validate users to restricted parts of a website. fully recovering from the two-year-long vulnerability may also require revoking any exposed keys, reissuing new keys, and invalidating all session keys and session cookies. members of the tor anonymity project have a brief write-up of the bug here, [4] and a this analysis provides useful technical details.

"without using any privileged information or credentials we were able steal from ourselves the secret keys used for our x.509 certificates, user names and passwords, instant messages, emails and business critical documents and communication."they called on white-hat hackers to set up "honeypots" of vulnerable tls servers designed to entrap attackers in an attempt to see if the bug is being actively exploited in the wild. the researchers have dubbed the vulnerability heartbleed because the underlying bug resides in the openssl implementation of the tls heartbeat extension as described in rfc 6520 of the internet engineering task force.

quote from: trolltergeist on april 09, 2014, 01:43:14 amand there is a new tor update today. not addressing the current issue at hand.ive already updated.  here is what the tor project had to say on their blog: openssl bug cve-2014-0160posted april 7th, 2014 by armain    openssl    security advisorya new openssl vulnerability on 1.0.1 through 1.0.1f is out today, which can be used to reveal memory to a connected client or server.if youre using an older openssl version, youre safe.note that this bug affects way more programs than just tor — expect everybody who runs an https webserver to be scrambling today. if you need strong anonymity or privacy on the internet, you might want to stay away from the internet entirely for the next few days while things settle.here are our first thoughts on what tor components are affected:1.    clients: the browser part of tor browser shouldnt be affected, since it uses libnss rather than openssl. but the tor client part is: tor clients could possibly be induced to send sensitive information like "what sites you visited in this session" to your entry guards. if youre using tbb well have new bundles out shortly; if youre using your operating systems tor package you should get a new openssl package and then be sure to manually restart your tor.2.    relays and bridges: tor relays and bridges could maybe be made to leak their medium-term onion keys (rotated once a week), or their long-term relay identity keys. an attacker who has your relay identity key can publish a new relay descriptor indicating that youre at a new location (not a particularly useful attack). an attacker who has your relay identity key, has your onion key, and can intercept traffic flows to your ip address can impersonate your relay (but remember that tors multi-hop design means that attacking just one relay in the clients path is not very useful). in any case, best practice would be to update your openssl package, discard all the files in keys/ in your datadirectory, and restart your tor to generate new keys. (you will need to update your myfamily torrc lines if you run multiple relays.)3.    hidden services: tor hidden services might leak their long-term hidden service identity keys to their guard relays. like the last big openssl bug, this shouldnt allow an attacker to identify the location of the hidden service, but an attacker who knows the hidden service identity key can impersonate the hidden service. best practice would be to move to a new hidden-service address at your convenience.   4.    directory authorities: in addition to the keys listed in the "relays and bridges" section above, tor directory authorities might leak their medium-term authority signing keys. once youve updated your openssl package, you should generate a new signing key. long-term directory authority identity keys are offline so should not be affected (whew). more tricky is that clients have your relay identity key hard-coded, so please dont rotate that yet. well see how this unfolds and try to think of a good solution there.5.    tails is still tracking debian oldstable, so it should not be affected by this bug.6.    orbot looks vulnerable; they have some new packages available for testing.7.    the webservers in the https://www.torproject.org/ rotation needed (and got) upgrades. maybe well need to throw away our torproject ssl web cert and get a new one too.zaphod

blue sky market support is always responsive and always knows exactly what to do. it may take 48 hours but bsm will never "steal coins." best support ive worked with in any of the markets.
to the op may i suggest you change the title of this thread i have merge the other into one and you have apologized but the title is very misleading for someone skimming over the forum, its only fair as you were wrong that you alter this i reckon dont you? would have deleted it but some positive feedback for bsm on here so this is the reason it has stayed put.

(you will need to update your myfamily torrc lines if you run multiple relays.)3.    hidden services: tor hidden services might leak their long-term hidden service identity keys to their guard relays. like the last big openssl bug, this shouldnt allow an attacker to identify the location of the hidden service, but an attacker who knows the hidden service identity key can impersonate the hidden service. best practice would be to move to a new hidden-service address at your convenience.   4.    directory authorities: in addition to the keys listed in the "relays and bridges" section above, tor directory authorities might leak their medium-term authority signing keys. once youve updated your openssl package, you should generate a new signing key. long-term directory authority identity keys are offline so should not be affected (whew). more tricky is that clients have your relay identity key hard-coded, so please dont rotate that yet. well see how this unfolds and try to think of a good solution there.5.    tails is still tracking debian oldstable, so it should not be affected by this bug.6.    orbot looks vulnerable; they have some new packages available for testing.7.    the webservers in the https://www.torproject.org/ rotation needed (and got) upgrades. maybe well need to throw away our torproject ssl web cert and get a new one too.zaphod

good to see youre going to join the bsm family llamasocks.dont worry, support on bsm is fair and on point most of the time.consider it might just be one person on the back end.
support is usually on point, got to give them time, it seems to me like its just one person behind the scenes.they always get shit done though.
thanks obama.
so the ones who are using tails is safe?this is for all of the web? like regular clearnet sites are all compromised right now?
theyre calling it heartbleed this sounds like an appropriate name
yea ill take screen shots. stand by.
they contacted me on my clone account. im sorry for the spaz. i was wrong. this was all done at my request to reset my pin. i just had no idea my accound would vanish without notice.please dont troll me, this is my apology.

now it says "sorry, 3 attempts were already made to reset that users password in the last 24 hours.please try again later." and i cant take a screen shot of the pgp message to decrypt it. but i decrypted it 3 times and used 3 new passwords on it and still doesnt recognize the account. not a wrong password or captcha, the account is gone (inactivated) but the ability to change the password is still available. the fact that my private key can still change the password but no new password will access the account is proof bluesky deactivated the account. i even tried making a new password with my clone account to make sure there wasnt a glitch in the password resetting procedure and i was able to change that password and login with the new one just fine.

this is some seriously bad jujuthis is a security clusterfuck of the first order. if the richter scale applied to security issues, this one would be a 11.  in a nutshell, this vulnerability in openssl, allowed an attacker to grab 64k chunks of memory on the system they were attacking. this 64k chunk could include ssl private keys, passwords, or other sensitive information. you will remember that on one of the snowden slide, it said, "ssl removed here".  i dont know if this is what they were talking about or not.  there is no way to know which sites have been attacked, or had their private keys stolen. every site using ssl is going to have to generate a new ssl keypair (hopefully 2048-bit) and have it signed by a certificate authority.  this is going to make the debian ssl debacle look like a picnic. quoterisk assessment / security & hacktivismcritical crypto bug in openssl opens two-thirds of the web to eavesdroppingexploits allow attackers to obtain private keys used to decrypt sensitive data.by dan goodin - apr 8, 2014 12:10 am utc for a more detailed analysis of this catastrophic bug, see this update, [1] which went live about 18 hours after ars published this initial post.researchers have discovered an extremely critical defect in the cryptographic software library an estimated two-thirds of web servers use to identify themselves to end users and prevent the eavesdropping of passwords, banking credentials, and other sensitive data.the warning about the bug in openssl coincided with the release of version 1.0.1g of the open-source program, [2] which is the default cryptographic library used in the apache and nginx web server applications, as well as a wide variety of operating systems and e-mail and instant-messaging clients. the bug, which has resided in production versions of openssl for more than two years, could make it possible for people to recover the private encryption key at the heart of the digital certificates used to authenticate internet servers and to encrypt data traveling between them and end users. attacks leave no traces in server logs, so theres no way of knowing if the bug has been actively exploited. still, the risk is extraordinary, given the ability to disclose keys, passwords, and other credentials that could be used in future compromises."bugs in single software or library come and go and are fixed by new versions," the researchers who discovered the vulnerability wrote in a blog post published monday. [3] "however this bug has left a large amount of private keys and other secrets exposed to the internet. considering the long exposure, ease of exploitations and attacks leaving no trace this exposure should be taken seriously."the researchers, who work at google and software security firm codenomicon, said even after vulnerable websites install the openssl patch, they may still remain vulnerable to attacks. the risk stems from the possibility that attackers already exploited the vulnerability to recover the private key of the digital certificate, passwords used to administer the sites, or authentication cookies and similar credentials used to validate users to restricted parts of a website. fully recovering from the two-year-long vulnerability may also require revoking any exposed keys, reissuing new keys, and invalidating all session keys and session cookies. members of the tor anonymity project have a brief write-up of the bug here, [4] and a this analysis provides useful technical details. [5]openssl is by far the internets most popular open-source cryptographic library and tls implementation. it is the default encryption engine for apache, nginx, which according to netcraft runs 66 percent of websites. [6] openssl also ships in a wide variety of operating systems and applications, including the debian wheezy, ubuntu, centos, fedora, openbsd, freebsd, and opensuse distributions of linux. the missing bounds check [7] in the handling of the transport layer security (tls) heartbeat extension affects openssl 1.0.1 through 1.0.1f.the bug, which is officially referenced as cve-2014-0160, makes it possible for attackers to recover up to 64 kilobytes of memory from the server or client computer running a vulnerable openssl version. nick sullivan, a systems engineer at cloudflare, a content delivery network that patched the openssl vulnerability last week, [8] said his company is still evaluating the likelihood that private keys appeared in memory and were recovered by attackers who knew how to exploit the flaw before the disclosure. based on the results of the assessment, the company may decide to replace its underlying tls certificate or take other actions, he said.attacking from the outsidethe researchers who discovered the vulnerability, however, were less optimistic about the risks, saying the bug makes it possible for attackers to surreptitiously bypass virtually all tls protections and to retrieve sensitive data residing in the memory of computers or servers running openssl-powered software."we attacked ourselves from outside, without leaving a trace," they wrote. "without using any privileged information or credentials we were able steal from ourselves the secret keys used for our x.509 certificates, user names and passwords, instant messages, emails and business critical documents and communication."they called on white-hat hackers to set up "honeypots" of vulnerable tls servers designed to entrap attackers in an attempt to see if the bug is being actively exploited in the wild. the researchers have dubbed the vulnerability heartbleed because the underlying bug resides in the openssl implementation of the tls heartbeat extension as described in rfc 6520 of the internet engineering task force. [9]the openssl vulnerability is the latest to threaten the https scheme thats the default and often only method for cryptographically protecting websites, e-mail, an other internet communications from attacks that allow hackers to eavesdrop on end users or impersonate trusted websites. last month, developers of the gnutls library disclosed an equally catastrophic bug that left hundreds of open-source applications open to similar attacks.

mods, please delete this thread or change the name. this does not help the market to grow. this is exactly what happened on the sr forums when bsm first started that halted the growth tremendously. op i suspect you have been "raped by silk road" and now you are to quick on the trigger to throw market in the dirt. online feedback is all these mrkets/vendors have and all it takes is a couple of these types of threads to absolutely ruin repuations needlessly.edit* or at least change the title.thanksps. blue sky market has been hands down the most consistent and supportive dnm since sr1 and has even more features (security and functionality wise) than any market to date.
thats strange, i have had a few matters taken care of very quickly recently. in fact i asked if i could delete all of my messages without having to manually do it and within the hour a new feature was put in to "delete all messages". so they not only answer promptly but also implement features at light speed. maybe llama you should try again to reach them. i honestly have not waited longer then 48 hours for a response for months now. and if they don;t respond via message they respond with a change. dont worry llama, im sorry you have been "ignored" but im sure that support will get back to you if you try once more.
trying to my support ticket seems to have dissappeared now.whats the business like on bsm?
firstly, it got "hacked"  :l then the owner starts charging vendors 24% commission and user withdrawals 20%. its going a long, long way down. owner has pissed off both vendors and buyers. i am definitely not going to use this website again. much better alternatives. surprised it hasnt died already because it basically is a dead site. also, there is no support at all.-m

trying to my support ticket seems to have dissappeared now.whats the business like on bsm?
thats strange, i have had a few matters taken care of very quickly recently. in fact i asked if i could delete all of my messages without having to manually do it and within the hour a new feature was put in to "delete all messages". so they not only answer promptly but also implement features at light speed. maybe llama you should try again to reach them. i honestly have not waited longer then 48 hours for a response for months now. and if they don;t respond via message they respond with a change. dont worry llama, im sorry you have been "ignored" but im sure that support will get back to you if you try once more.
firstly, it got "hacked"  :l then the owner starts charging vendors 24% commission and user withdrawals 20%. its going a long, long way down. owner has pissed off both vendors and buyers. i am definitely not going to use this website again. much better alternatives. surprised it hasnt died already because it basically is a dead site. also, there is no support at all.-m

thanks, updated that post again re electrum.$ ldd `which torchat`   not a dynamic executabletorchat is going to depend on the operating system. windows or whichever linux distro and version you use, and whichever version of openssl the maintainers used if you installed it from a repository. best thing to do is compile it from source with a fixed version of openssl on your system.
thanks, updated.putty - the windows ssh client is not vulnerable.[1]winscp - uses openssl and is vulnerable.[2]filezilla - uses gcrypt and is not vulnerable.since there have been a couple git hidden services, i wonder how git handles encryption. ldd doesnt show any linked encryption libraries. the encryption must be baked in and its hard to find documentation on it in google searches of git, openssl and encryption.[1] http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/faq.html#faq-openssh[2] http://sourceforge.net/p/winscp/news/2013/02/winscp-514-released/
i like how the tor devs suggest to change your onion address "at your convenience" as if its convenient for any major hidden service, but considering any relay in any circuit that your hidden service built in the last 2 years could have stolen your private keys, that is the best thing to do. we have zero information that any hidden service has been impersonated other than standard phishing sites but if the nsa didnt know about the bug before they know about it now.
lets compile a list of software that people use over tor and that may be vulnerable to the heartbleed exploit.tor browser - it has 2 components, firefox and tor. firefox uses mozillas nss library for ssl so it is not vulnerable. tor is vulnerable so you should upgrade to the latest tor browser 3.5.4 immediately. an attacker could potentially read your session data, including sites you visit, login cookies (proving you are a specific person logged into a market or forum), etc.ssh - uses openssl and is vulnerable.openvpn - uses openssl and is vulnerable.curl - uses openssl and is vulnerable.wget - uses openssl and is vulnerable.ntp - uses openssl and is vulnerable.all of these dynamically link libssl so the library needs to be upgraded to a fixed version. in the case of sshd, ntp and openvpn which usually run continuously, they should be restarted after updating libssl.pidgin - libpurple uses nss and is not vulnerable.adium - uses libpurple which uses nss so it is not vulnerable.otr - all plugins that i am aware of use gcrypt and are not vulnerable.mirc - havent checked but since its windows only so assuming its not vulnerable.xchat - the linux version and possibly the windows version use openssl for client-to-server encryption. it is vulnerable. the major issue here is if you connected to a hidden service irc server while simultaneously connecting over clearnet to an irc server with ssl. the clearnet server could deanonymize you as a specific user on the hidden service irc. you should update openssl immediately.feel free to add to this list.
pre-built electrum binaries from electrum - built using openssl 0.9.8 and is not vulnerable.electrum ran from python source - dynamically links to openssl version in system; make sure the openssl package is updatedtorchat - uses openssl library, but uncertain which build...... could be vulnerable bitmessage - based on compilation instructions, bitmessage uses openssl and could be vulnerable if the system is using an exploitable buildaccording to thomas voegtlin, one of the developers of electrum, all binaries directly from their official website are built using openssl 0.9.8 and not vulnerable to the exploit.if you run electrum from python source, it will use the version of openssl that is installed your system.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=562263.msg6143561#msg6143561at the moment, i am also trying to ascertain which other applications that use vulnerable openssl libraries.  does anyone know if torchat is built on the vulnerable openssl libraries?any application that provides anonymity and has heartbeat enabled is under fire.  any anonymity application that functions as a server (all p2p applications are server-like) and uses openssl could potentially be exploited and details in the memory could possibly contain information that reveals the real identity of a user.  this is not mentioned much in popular media as it is not the primary concern of the general public but it is a reality for every one in the darknet community.it is best to check all applications used for communication as they are often run directly from the system.  i guess this is a prime example of why using a non-persistent os such as tails is important; even then, running tails with the real ip exposed to the os is at the moment possibly dangerous if a user is using pre-built binaries that do not dynamically link to the systems openssl.
bitcoin-qt - uses openssl and is vulnerable in version 0.9.0 but not any versions before or after. this is particularly nefarious because an attacker could steal your private keys and therefore your coins if they are loaded into ram at some point (like if you broadcast a transaction). version 0.9.1 links against openssl 1.0.1g which fixes the bug so you should upgrade immediately.electrum - uses openssl and is vulnerable on any linux distro that uses the vulnerable versions. the prebuilt windows binaries are not vulnerable.
electrum uses pythons ssl library. pythons ssl implementiation is based on openssl.  ( see https://docs.python.org/2/library/ssl.html )tails electrum users have nothing to fear b/c squeezes openssl is based on a branch without the bug. im not sure, however, what version of ssl the window binary is compiled against to know if that is vunerable or not.
ok. thank you!
mods, please delete this thread or change the name. this does not help the market to grow. this is exactly what happened on the sr forums when bsm first started that halted the growth tremendously. op i suspect you have been "raped by silk road" and now you are to quick on the trigger to throw market in the dirt. online feedback is all these mrkets/vendors have and all it takes is a couple of these types of threads to absolutely ruin repuations needlessly.edit* or at least change the title.thanksps. blue sky market has been hands down the most consistent and supportive dnm since sr1 and has even more features (security and functionality wise) than any market to date.

pre-built electrum binaries from electrum - built using openssl 0.9.8 and is not vulnerable.electrum ran from python source - dynamically links to openssl version in system; make sure the openssl package is updatedtorchat - uses openssl library, but uncertain which build...... could be vulnerable bitmessage - based on compilation instructions, bitmessage uses openssl and could be vulnerable if the system is using an exploitable buildaccording to thomas voegtlin, one of the developers of electrum, all binaries directly from their official website are built using openssl 0.9.8 and not vulnerable to the exploit.if you run electrum from python source, it will use the version of openssl that is installed your system.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=562263.msg6143561#msg6143561at the moment, i am also trying to ascertain which other applications that use vulnerable openssl libraries.  does anyone know if torchat is built on the vulnerable openssl libraries?any application that provides anonymity and has heartbeat enabled is under fire.  any anonymity application that functions as a server (all p2p applications are server-like) and uses openssl could potentially be exploited and details in the memory could possibly contain information that reveals the real identity of a user.  this is not mentioned much in popular media as it is not the primary concern of the general public but it is a reality for every one in the darknet community.it is best to check all applications used for communication as they are often run directly from the system.  i guess this is a prime example of why using a non-persistent os such as tails is important; even then, running tails with the real ip exposed to the os is at the moment possibly dangerous if a user is using pre-built binaries that do not dynamically link to the systems openssl.
bitcoin-qt - uses openssl and is vulnerable in version 0.9.0 but not any versions before or after. this is particularly nefarious because an attacker could steal your private keys and therefore your coins if they are loaded into ram at some point (like if you broadcast a transaction). version 0.9.1 links against openssl 1.0.1g which fixes the bug so you should upgrade immediately.electrum - uses openssl and is vulnerable on any linux distro that uses the vulnerable versions. the prebuilt windows binaries are not vulnerable.
electrum uses pythons ssl library. pythons ssl implementiation is based on openssl.  ( see https://docs.python.org/2/library/ssl.html )tails electrum users have nothing to fear b/c squeezes openssl is based on a branch without the bug. im not sure, however, what version of ssl the window binary is compiled against to know if that is vunerable or not.
thats strange, i have had a few matters taken care of very quickly recently. in fact i asked if i could delete all of my messages without having to manually do it and within the hour a new feature was put in to "delete all messages". so they not only answer promptly but also implement features at light speed. maybe llama you should try again to reach them. i honestly have not waited longer then 48 hours for a response for months now. and if they don;t respond via message they respond with a change. dont worry llama, im sorry you have been "ignored" but im sure that support will get back to you if you try once more.

thanks, updated that post again re electrum.$ ldd `which torchat`   not a dynamic executabletorchat is going to depend on the operating system. windows or whichever linux distro and version you use, and whichever version of openssl the maintainers used if you installed it from a repository. best thing to do is compile it from source with a fixed version of openssl on your system.
thanks, updated.putty - the windows ssh client is not vulnerable.[1]winscp - uses openssl and is vulnerable.[2]filezilla - uses gcrypt and is not vulnerable.since there have been a couple git hidden services, i wonder how git handles encryption. ldd doesnt show any linked encryption libraries. the encryption must be baked in and its hard to find documentation on it in google searches of git, openssl and encryption.[1] http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/faq.html#faq-openssh[2] http://sourceforge.net/p/winscp/news/2013/02/winscp-514-released/

here is the message now being displayed when you use the original agora url: (unfortunately, the new url they give, doesnt work currently)quote-----begin pgp signed message-----hash: sha1agora announcement 2014-04-11earlier this week the details of a serious bug in the openssl library were made public. this bug, which affected a large number of web servers and devices was popularly referred to as heartbleed. the bug allows anybody connecting to a vulnerable service to reveal the contents of memory on the server - and thus reveal secret keys, user information, passwords, etc.there is more information about the bug and the versions of openssl that are affected at the website setup for the bug:http://heartbleed.com/agora is a hidden service served on the tor network, and while agora itself does not use the vulnerable library, the tor software that makes up the network was affected by this bug in some instances since it integrates the openssl library. the tor project wrote a blog post about how this bug affects various aspects of the tor service:https://blog.torproject.org/blog/openssl-bug-cve-2014-0160for users of the tor browser bundle you should upgrade to the latest release version immediately, as the bundled version of tor is vulnerable to the attack. get the latest tor browser bundle version from http://torproject.orgfor agora as a hidden service, we have investigated the possibilities of exploitation and to our current best knowledge, the most an attacker could hope to gain in a hypothetical situation of successful exploitation, is the ability to impersonate the hidden service.the tor blog post on this subject states:"like the last big openssl bug, this shouldnt allow an attacker to identify the location of the hidden service, but an attacker who knows the hidden service identity key can impersonate the hidden service."at this time even an attack like that is looking unlikely and we havent seen any signs of it being successfully executed. however, since the underlying bug is very serious and has been in the wild for an unclear amount of time, we will be taking the necessary precautions and shall hereby recycle all our previously used hidden service keys.effectively this means that we need to change the address of the market.additionally we have decided to take the market down for some time so we can fully investigate the effects and change all servers used by it in order to fully protect ourselves from any hypothetical damage or information leaks. we estimate that this process will be complete by the end of the week. we do understand that this is a big inconvenience for many of you, but please understand that we do this for the sake of your anonymity as well. the new address to be used from now on to access agora when its available will be:http://agorahooawayyfoe.onionthe address to access agora forums is: http://lacbzxobeprssrfx.onionwe are constantly vigilant about new threats and the security of our market and users and are taking these steps as a precaution. -----begin pgp signature-----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e2zd-----end pgp signature-----

as far as i know, the nsa and dea and so on have been illegally implanting malware and spyware into all of our computers, cellphones, ect, without the need for a warrant since shortly after 9/11; stealing our private pgp keys and the like as they choose. i believe the patriot act and other bills has granted them all such privilages in the united states at least, although im certain things arent that much different in the uk, eu, asia, ect. just keep your guard up! be prepared!thank you for for this website. i havent been here much, but so far i like it. - majik

as far as i know, the nsa and dea and so on have been illegally implanting malware and spyware into all of our computers, cellphones, ect, without the need for a warrant since shortly after 9/11; stealing our private pgp keys and the like as they choose. i believe the patriot act and other bills has granted them all such privilages in the united states at least, although im certain things arent that much different in the uk, eu, asia, ect. just keep your guard up! be prepared!thank you for for this website. i havent been here much, but so far i like it. - majik

hi all,ive used lsd for years now, but this site has opened me up to terms ive not heard before.what does body loading mean? is there a glossery that defines all the lingo used in relation to acid?during most trips, i develop lower back pain. ive spoken to a friend about this and hes never had this symptom. however, ive read that back pain can be a side effect. any comments on this would be greatly appreciated ...i love this site!
oops, i just noticed a thread in off topic that covers the lingo, but if anyone can comment on the back pain, that would be great.
the site admins would have at least a few grand to play with ,which could be used to get the main site going.i donated total a $1 so far,not much, but after this next order im going to toss $10 becos i love this place and all of you so much while we are at it, be thankful and donate to(if you can):tor projectthe gpg encyption software developersif it was not for these layers of technology that have been researched and manifested by brilliant,dedicated minds,we would not be here, this could not happen this way.always be humble,always be thankful-love and light

is this something we need to be worried about?there were no posts on the forum indicating this was or has happened... the forum redirects to a new url and the market is not coming up at all "problem loading page"...
i know one thing for sure, agora and the forum are down. im glad now that i always demand fe and that i just transfered all coin from my account.

quote from: angel eyes on april 11, 2014, 06:28:04 amwhats the pi for?  is it to make sure all internet traffic that travels through your modem is  via tor?in large part yes. there is no direct path to the internet for the workstation (or laptop) - so even if it was completely 100% owned it would not be able to de-anonymize you through ip address leakage. it is  in this case not possible for your laptop to create surreptitious  connections to anything on the internet unless it is via tor.but also it moves the tor process off your secure workstation onto an independent and  isolated system so if the tor software ever exposes a significant flaw which can lead to disclosure of information (this week being a good example) or even remote code execution then the impact is restricted to the pi only which, while serious, is far less serious than a breach of your workstation which contains passwords, data, private keys etc.ideally you should also be running your browser on another pi away from your keys and data and just copy/pasting between your browser window and your desktop.all about making an attackers life harder...

quotehowdy vendors! weve just gotten around tying up the load ends with the new multisig bazar.. it processes all orders through multisig for both standard fe and multisig. all tba account user information - such as user details, logins, items etc have been migrated across - as off 5th april 2014. any items that been added/modified deleted etc will need your action to update them accordingly. and all users/vendors whove registered after the above mentioned date will need to re-register and setup their listings.pls feel free to login and have a look around, though pls note its still not live to the general public. as we want to spend the next few days testing out the multisig codes so that vendors and users can familiarize themselves with the sales process in the interim. also vendors accounts now have an extra input tab in their account page, to add one or more bitcoin public keys, which will be used to process your received orders.or they can chose to add one after having received an order. buyers will only need to add a pubkey while placing an order and not before. right now the codes work seamlessly with bitcoind. so any vendors already having bitcoind installed. pls let me know as wed be more then happy to walk you through one or more test sale. shoot me any questions you have or write them in here.. and we can discuss how best to help each other with this new setup.link to the bazaar - http://bazaarlv2a7i3uyn.onion/wed posted this exclusively to tba vendors a few days back, and have made some test sales with bitcoin core client (bitcoind) and a few step by step instructions have been posted both at the bazaar as well as on the forum to help users through every step of the process. based on the few test sales weve done so far we feel fairly confident with sharing the multisig bazaar site.as mentioned above the beta marketplace can be accessed at http://bazaarlv2a7i3uyn.onion/though note all existing alpha bazaar users as on/before 5th april have been migrated over to the new bazaar, so most off you will not need to re-register. any users whove registered after the date will be required to do so. this includes vendors and their listings. also as a special launch offer were not charging for any vendor registrations on the multisig bazaar throughout the month of april. *this is exclusive to tbb market only! so feel free to pass the url around.. also should you need help getting started with multisig do not hesitate to contact us. we totally recommend you install bitcoind/bitcoinqt as the codes work seamless around it and is a complete no brainer which only requires to copy/past codes which are prompted to both buyers and vendors through their my orders page to walk users through the entire sale process. posting it here as well for later referencing.how to get started using 2/3 multi-sig transactions on the beta bazaarvendors can now set up their accounts by adding one or more pubkeys through their account tab. which would then enable them to accept  multisig escrow payments from clients in addition to requesting for an fe. or can chose to add pubkeys for each other as and when received.buyers will be requested to generate their share of pubkeys and add them to the orders while confirming to purchase items. this can be done through bitcoin core or through https://coinb.in/multisig/ where transactions can also be verified and/or signed for release of funds.the bazaar is set to automatically generate its own share of the public keys to create a 2/3 mult-isig address. buyers would then need to send funds to this address and once the transaction is confirmed by the bazaar the vendor updated accordingly and requested to update order status to dispatched etc.create your public and private key with your bitcoin client.*open your bitcoind clients debug console and type the following commands:        getnewaddress bazaar_key*copy the address from output screen and add it to following command:        validateaddress [paste_here_the_previously_generated_address]it will return wallet address details. youll find your public under "pubkey" section. *for vendors: once you have the public key(s), upload them to your bazaar account.*for buyers: use it while placing an order.then get your private key details and store it somewhere safe.        dumpprivkey [paste_here_the_previously_generated_address]this key will be used for validating terms of the trade and for signing the release of escrow.once an order has been placed, both buyers and vendors will be able to follow.. each step of the order through their my orders" page at the bazaar.* once buyers submit their public key to place an order, the vendor is noticed of the new order.* the vendor can chose for payment upfront or for multi-sig escrow.* once vendors have decided on the payment method, buyers will be notified on how to proceed further. now the my orders page would have a multisig payment address assigned for that specific order, to which buyers need to send the funds to, and as soon as one confirmation has been received, the order will be marked as paid and the vendor notified.the vendor will then on their bitcoind debug console, input the following commands..

little hobbits... where, oh where, is your splendid shire of security?anxiously awaiting a reply from middle__earth, or middle_earth2.-whom

if you check the tor blog you will find that what agora has done is exactly what they needed to do to protect us from spoofing attacks.  i am a bit disgusted at the way theyve done it and that the site will be down for a day or two with no forenotice.  that said, they are generally horrible at communication on agora so im not terribly surprised.  and that being said, if they had to be good at programming and site security or communication i certainly prefer the former.  defcon is great at communication.  does anyone want to see agora turn into sr2 ?
newbies need to chill, agora vendors are not going apeshit, we appreciate agora admin being proactive on security. read the announcement, take agora at their word, just be patient for a few days. lelantos mail did the same thing, was offline for almost two days, now back to normal.

can somebody explain to me, why agora is the only market that seems to be effected by heartbleed?
thanks ill check out outlaw too. trying to comeback to service my people.
looks very nice and clean
they are changing urls i think.. or something like that. almost every ssl was effected by it i think but most changed urls and consequently ssls. agora is just slow on the draw i guess.
too bad the atms require you to give absolute pruff of who you are, like finger prints and things like thatarnt the bitcoin atms in canada way less intrusive into your privacy, anybody know?
im a bit surprised by the optimism here.there hasnt been a word from agora on the forums.  its absurd.  i fear theyve followed all the other markets and run off to enjoy a nice retirement with our btc.i hope im wrong... but they have done nothing to communicate with the vendors and buyers and thats just insane.  i dont care how small a team they are - it doesnt take much to post 2 times a day to update the people who are making you rich.this was very badly handled... if they found something that critical that they had to shut down - thats fine, but you dont do that and then say nothing beyond a webpage message.  the only organization that i know of that did that - was mtgox!

i dont see anybody panicking...but i think its foolish to assume that everything is ok and act like you know it as a fact.  nobody knows anything about anyone in this world... thats the beautiful thing that makes it all possible.  it is also the ugly thing that makes it possible for anyone to do anything and never be accountable for it.so until agora goes back up - or doesnt... i will not assume everything on that webpage is true.  nor will i assume theyve run off with the money.ive been alive for more than half a century... i learned a long time ago that one can never be too sure of anyone, especially when they are protected by anonymity.its fine to be optimistic - but dont be certain... because unless you personally know these people and are sitting beside them.  you cant be certain of anything.quote from: axa on april 12, 2014, 04:24:42 amnewbies need to chill, agora vendors are not going apeshit, we appreciate agora admin being proactive on security. read the announcement, take agora at their word, just be patient for a few days. lelantos mail did the same thing, was offline for almost two days, now back to normal.
