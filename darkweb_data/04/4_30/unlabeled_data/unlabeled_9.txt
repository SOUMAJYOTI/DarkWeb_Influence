suppose their plan is to have everything remotely monitored using vpro extensions, wouldnt some kind of stand alone firewall defeat their plan? like filtering everything malicious before reaching your desktop nic?

website a is reference to a cp forum hidden service that was called pedoforum. it was run by the same guy who ran cam-a-lot apparently, the site that just made the news for having been busted a year or so ago, that collected videos of teenagers jacking off on webcams (they called cam-a-lot website b). from the wording of that it sounds like they didnt target casual browsers of the forum, but only people who registered accounts. in any case, we should have expected them to do things like this. the best defense is having two computers dedicated for anonymous activity, one being a tor router on some secure os like openbsd, and the other being a hardened system for browsing on. physical isolation is the diamond standard for protecting from this sort of attack, and obviously they are going to keep doing this type of attack more and more, so it is time for people to rapidly start using physical isolation. throw in a vm still though to hide hardware serial numbers. another technique to protect from attacks like this is to use virtual machine based isolation by itself. you can also protect from attacks like this with software and/or hardware firewalls, and with process level firewalls like mandatory access controls. so pretty much if this concerns you, the things to look into are how to protect from this sort of attack with:a. firewalls (complicated, often requires extensive knowledge of exactly how it needs to be configured, both the firewall and the system itself)b. mandatory access controls (similar to firewalls, also requires extensive knowledge)c. physical isolation (requires much less knowledge, and much less to go wrong as well. its a very powerful technique)d. virtual isolation (requires the least amount of knowledge, trivial to configure, provides significant protection but not as much as physical isolation)you also need to know how to harden your browser. like, disable javascript on tor browser for sure. if you dont need them, disable images too, so long as you understand that this could increase linkability risk, though this wont matter much if you only go to a few websites, or only go to websites you do illegal things on. not using windows is one of the biggest favors you can do for yourself as well, use some distribution of linux instead, or maybe even some bsd distro. think of how you can add amnesia in as well, so even if you are compromised the attackers foothold is lost after some period of time. tails has amnesia built into it for example, and has protection from this sort of attack via the firewall method, the firewall having been configured by professionals. whonix goes with the virtual isolation technique for protecting from this sort of attack, but it doesnt have amnesia so an attacker can still gain a permanent foothold they just cant easily get your real ip address (though they can spy on your entire vm besides that, so you will deanonymize yourself if you send an address in plaintext for example). you could get amnesia by using a stable operating system without many updates for it, and loading it from a read only medium into memory or something, maybe from a hard drive with a write blocker. and only load it in a writable format when updating the software on it intentionally, never when in the process of doing sensitive things. you could also use snapshots to do the same thing for virtual isolation. the biggest thing to also keep in mind, for our threat model, is the risk of an attacker deanonymizing you with your plaintext address even if they cant get your ip address. to protect from this your address needs to be encrypted before it passes through exposed security domains. the best way to do this is with air gaps, or virtual air gaps at least. security on this level is really hard to get into, and even harder to maintain. but if you follow the already known best practices, you can make it extremely unlikely that an fbi level attacker can pwn you with this technique. nsa tao is a different story though!
never mind about the rise up email i just read axas thread on secure email and got me a lelantos account.

hello boys and girls, do you know if the money on the wallet agora can pick them? and the money referall still apply? i did enroll approximately 30 people every week and gain $ 80 (sometimes even $ 100) ... someone can answer me?thanks brothers and sisters!ah sorry if my english is bad...im italian:)totò
your best bets are lbc, bitstamp, or buying on one of the markets via prepaid visa.
how come there is no love for evo?  i feel like im missing part of the picture.  my only problem with it is i have little traffic over there.
hey i have shit t do on agora.. i have attempted to access agora using the new urls they have posted all over the dark web.. but it never loads the login page..dose any one know how long untill its up and running? when can we go back to work??i tried to warn every one trade your email with your business associates because any day agora could crash like the others...and today no one can access agora, they say this bug could have fucked agora up.. its a really unfortuante case of the law of impermanance...they really fuck the univeral community of subsatnce users when they toasted silk rd1..that was the most awsome creation i ever got to experience.. the world will never be as freely organised as it was when silk rd ran its course.. i feel so blessed to have been apart of it..i worked so hard to earn coin to  invest in silk rd 1 i was their number 1 fan supporter and believer.. i invested every thing i had and could earn into silk rd..i was scammed over 65btc.. but for a while there as a vendor i was earning 10k aud a week..my faith in it paid off i was supermn lucky.. others lost big dillars..but trial and error i gambeled every penny i had.... i miss you silk rd1 you were my ultimate window in to the universal sub culture of users and abusers.. iwill never forget you..
im in contact with them too, im on edge about whether or not to trust them.
hmm yh they seem to be legit, there is one way to know if they are being legityou could ask them to put you into contact with one of their customers and see if it matches u with the same one i spoke to and go from there, he is listed on the wiki tor as a scam but dosent say as to why only that discount cards dont exist when i confronted him about this he said it was probably due to the green machine (mr fungi) and he even told me mr fungi plays some part in what is put on the hidden wiki(at least the old one anyway) and that he is very good at scamming people.so this house of cards seems legit but then dosent at the same time, i think maybe its best to stick to evolution and the established market places with escrow just to be safe, although ask him to put you into contact with another one of his customers and get back to me on here when he has done that and we can collaborate from here.thanksanonymous solja!
i cant access outlaw with the main link. their site seems to be down. i know they have multiple links to access their site, anyone have them?

this was our take on pi middle boxes last year and other than a read only file-system we dont have much to add to it. wifi used for one of the interfaces (either).we would like to see a build script than could be applied to a vanilla fresh rasbian build. it wouldnt be that much work for somebody.quotewe have taken a slightly different approach with this in the past, one that provides a little additional security at the cost of a little usability. we provide it here for information - it may be useful for some.the fundamental difference is that rather than transparently route all traffic from the secure box and into tor we only route explicitly defined traffic.the middle boxa simple tor client dual-homed host, ideally on a physical host. it will have two network interfaces, a public interface which connects to the internet (ideally through a natting router or firewall) and a private interface. this system must be hardened because it will be able to establish arbitrary connections to the internet. it will run tor in client mode and will expose the socks proxy to the private network only. ideally it should be hard-coded to connect to trusted guard nodes, preferably ones that you either run or know to be safe. at the least the guard nodes should be local to you in network terms. this system should be configured to drop all inbound connections on the public interface regardless of any upstream firewalls. the system should also be configured to drop all traffic on and out on the private interface except inbound traffic to the local socks proxy port (9050/tcp or similar). for good measure the middle box should also drop all outbound udp traffic to the internet.the private networkthis network exists purely between the middle box and the secure box.  ideally this should be a simple cross-over cable which connects the two systems. wireless is acceptable but the key thing is that the private network cannot route anywhere other then between the middle and secure boxes and it will be carrying plain-text, sensitive traffic and thus must be protected from eavesdropping. the private network must have no default gateway and no dns.the secure boxthe key tenet of this system is that it does not know where it is or have any way of finding out where it is. this system has a single network interface on the private network. again, there must be no default gateway, no dns nothing. just a simple static ip address and no more. the local firewall (iptables) should be configured on this system to drop all inbound traffic and block all outbound traffic except outbound to the socks port on the middle box. the browser on this system should be configured to use the socks proxy on the middle box. if there is a requirement to use any other application other than the browser then it must explicitly be configured to use socks or, failing that, executed using torsocks which again will use the socks proxy on the middle box. ideally the hostname of this system should be computer or server and only one user should be configured called user, ensure the mac address of the system is modified from the hardware default at boot time - ideally randomized each boot. in terms of os, anything that is non persistent is nearly always better such as tails. the systems should have no microphone, no camera, no gps and ideally no wireless (wlan, bluetooth, gsm, etc). nothing that allows it to interact with the real world in any way except via that socks proxy.when looking at the hardening of the secure box, imagine you are a bad guy somewhere who has gained unrestricted access to the system and ask yourself:a) can you break out of it in any way that will cause you to generate network traffic that will not go through the socks port and into tor? if you can then something is wrong, rethink.b) can you extract anything from the system that provides irl identity information - for instance address details that you might use to copy/paste into order forms? if you can find anything of value then something is wrong, rethink.this model can be virtualized easily enough but at the cost of some security. if virtualized then make sure file sharing from guest to host is disabled, shared clipboards etc. the virtualization software should be configured to provide as much isolation between the guest and host systems as possible.our preferred setup for this is simple and uses a rasberry pi as the middle box and an old laptop connected via a cross-over ethernet cable. the pi connects wirelessly to the local broadband router.internet-------[router]---------[pi middle box]---------[secured laptop]

seems like everyone around my area never has any coins. its so hard to find them why!!!!!!!dam coins im going to hunt you down and find you wherever you are hiding. anyone have any leads on where to get coins anonymously besides local bitcoins. ive used that place up lol.
using a middle box requires two network interfaces on the middle box and pi has only one. anyway i believe a tutorial on using pi for this purpose is needed. maybe the use of pi as a middle box isolates the various intel chipset rootkits though i would still be very sceptical about any intel chipset these days.
hello boys and girls, do you know if the money on the wallet agora can pick them? and the money referall still apply? i did enroll approximately 30 people every week and gain $ 80 (sometimes even $ 100) ... someone can answer me?thanks brothers and sisters!ah sorry if my english is bad...im italian:)totò

that's an awesome promotion jc, i've pm'd you!
have you guys had many donations yet?
amazing jc, thanks for helping to keep the site rolling!
how come there is no love for evo?  i feel like im missing part of the picture.  my only problem with it is i have little traffic over there.
this was our take on pi middle boxes last year and other than a read only file-system we dont have much to add to it. wifi used for one of the interfaces (either).we would like to see a build script than could be applied to a vanilla fresh rasbian build. it wouldnt be that much work for somebody.quotewe have taken a slightly different approach with this in the past, one that provides a little additional security at the cost of a little usability. we provide it here for information - it may be useful for some.the fundamental difference is that rather than transparently route all traffic from the secure box and into tor we only route explicitly defined traffic.the middle boxa simple tor client dual-homed host, ideally on a physical host. it will have two network interfaces, a public interface which connects to the internet (ideally through a natting router or firewall) and a private interface. this system must be hardened because it will be able to establish arbitrary connections to the internet. it will run tor in client mode and will expose the socks proxy to the private network only. ideally it should be hard-coded to connect to trusted guard nodes, preferably ones that you either run or know to be safe. at the least the guard nodes should be local to you in network terms. this system should be configured to drop all inbound connections on the public interface regardless of any upstream firewalls. the system should also be configured to drop all traffic on and out on the private interface except inbound traffic to the local socks proxy port (9050/tcp or similar). for good measure the middle box should also drop all outbound udp traffic to the internet.the private networkthis network exists purely between the middle box and the secure box.  ideally this should be a simple cross-over cable which connects the two systems. wireless is acceptable but the key thing is that the private network cannot route anywhere other then between the middle and secure boxes and it will be carrying plain-text, sensitive traffic and thus must be protected from eavesdropping. the private network must have no default gateway and no dns.the secure boxthe key tenet of this system is that it does not know where it is or have any way of finding out where it is. this system has a single network interface on the private network. again, there must be no default gateway, no dns nothing. just a simple static ip address and no more. the local firewall (iptables) should be configured on this system to drop all inbound traffic and block all outbound traffic except outbound to the socks port on the middle box. the browser on this system should be configured to use the socks proxy on the middle box. if there is a requirement to use any other application other than the browser then it must explicitly be configured to use socks or, failing that, executed using torsocks which again will use the socks proxy on the middle box. ideally the hostname of this system should be computer or server and only one user should be configured called user, ensure the mac address of the system is modified from the hardware default at boot time - ideally randomized each boot. in terms of os, anything that is non persistent is nearly always better such as tails. the systems should have no microphone, no camera, no gps and ideally no wireless (wlan, bluetooth, gsm, etc). nothing that allows it to interact with the real world in any way except via that socks proxy.when looking at the hardening of the secure box, imagine you are a bad guy somewhere who has gained unrestricted access to the system and ask yourself:a) can you break out of it in any way that will cause you to generate network traffic that will not go through the socks port and into tor? if you can then something is wrong, rethink.b) can you extract anything from the system that provides irl identity information - for instance address details that you might use to copy/paste into order forms? if you can find anything of value then something is wrong, rethink.this model can be virtualized easily enough but at the cost of some security. if virtualized then make sure file sharing from guest to host is disabled, shared clipboards etc. the virtualization software should be configured to provide as much isolation between the guest and host systems as possible.our preferred setup for this is simple and uses a rasberry pi as the middle box and an old laptop connected via a cross-over ethernet cable. the pi connects wirelessly to the local broadband router.internet-------[router]---------[pi middle box]---------[secured laptop]
im in contact with them too, im on edge about whether or not to trust them.
hmm yh they seem to be legit, there is one way to know if they are being legityou could ask them to put you into contact with one of their customers and see if it matches u with the same one i spoke to and go from there, he is listed on the wiki tor as a scam but dosent say as to why only that discount cards dont exist when i confronted him about this he said it was probably due to the green machine (mr fungi) and he even told me mr fungi plays some part in what is put on the hidden wiki(at least the old one anyway) and that he is very good at scamming people.so this house of cards seems legit but then dosent at the same time, i think maybe its best to stick to evolution and the established market places with escrow just to be safe, although ask him to put you into contact with another one of his customers and get back to me on here when he has done that and we can collaborate from here.thanksanonymous solja!

website a is reference to a cp forum hidden service that was called pedoforum. it was run by the same guy who ran cam-a-lot apparently, the site that just made the news for having been busted a year or so ago, that collected videos of teenagers jacking off on webcams (they called cam-a-lot website b). from the wording of that it sounds like they didnt target casual browsers of the forum, but only people who registered accounts. in any case, we should have expected them to do things like this. the best defense is having two computers dedicated for anonymous activity, one being a tor router on some secure os like openbsd, and the other being a hardened system for browsing on. physical isolation is the diamond standard for protecting from this sort of attack, and obviously they are going to keep doing this type of attack more and more, so it is time for people to rapidly start using physical isolation. throw in a vm still though to hide hardware serial numbers. another technique to protect from attacks like this is to use virtual machine based isolation by itself. you can also protect from attacks like this with software and/or hardware firewalls, and with process level firewalls like mandatory access controls. so pretty much if this concerns you, the things to look into are how to protect from this sort of attack with:a. firewalls (complicated, often requires extensive knowledge of exactly how it needs to be configured, both the firewall and the system itself)b. mandatory access controls (similar to firewalls, also requires extensive knowledge)c. physical isolation (requires much less knowledge, and much less to go wrong as well. its a very powerful technique)d. virtual isolation (requires the least amount of knowledge, trivial to configure, provides significant protection but not as much as physical isolation)you also need to know how to harden your browser. like, disable javascript on tor browser for sure. if you dont need them, disable images too, so long as you understand that this could increase linkability risk, though this wont matter much if you only go to a few websites, or only go to websites you do illegal things on. not using windows is one of the biggest favors you can do for yourself as well, use some distribution of linux instead, or maybe even some bsd distro. think of how you can add amnesia in as well, so even if you are compromised the attackers foothold is lost after some period of time. tails has amnesia built into it for example, and has protection from this sort of attack via the firewall method, the firewall having been configured by professionals. whonix goes with the virtual isolation technique for protecting from this sort of attack, but it doesnt have amnesia so an attacker can still gain a permanent foothold they just cant easily get your real ip address (though they can spy on your entire vm besides that, so you will deanonymize yourself if you send an address in plaintext for example). you could get amnesia by using a stable operating system without many updates for it, and loading it from a read only medium into memory or something, maybe from a hard drive with a write blocker. and only load it in a writable format when updating the software on it intentionally, never when in the process of doing sensitive things. you could also use snapshots to do the same thing for virtual isolation. the biggest thing to also keep in mind, for our threat model, is the risk of an attacker deanonymizing you with your plaintext address even if they cant get your ip address. to protect from this your address needs to be encrypted before it passes through exposed security domains. the best way to do this is with air gaps, or virtual air gaps at least. security on this level is really hard to get into, and even harder to maintain. but if you follow the already known best practices, you can make it extremely unlikely that an fbi level attacker can pwn you with this technique. nsa tao is a different story though!

the pirate market has now added a vacation mode for vendors! when a vendor hasnt signed into the market for 7 days, vacation mode is enabled which hides their items from the product list and basically puts their account into hibernation.when the vendor signs back into their account, s/he can disable vacation mode and their account returns to normal. this eliminates any extra time spent fishing out inactive vendors -the pirate markethttp://yjhzeedl5osagmmr.onion/
tmg doesnt use ssl it seems, so theyre unaffected. not sure which, if any, darknet sites do use ssl, but i imagine itd be a huge hassle. you could self-sign but that would alarm so many people when their browsers start yelling at them about it, and i imagine itd be hard to get one signed for an onion domain from the various cas out there.
how is it better than torchat?

agora has just come back online under its new url: http://agorahooawayyfoe.onionthe forums are also online under a new url: http://lacbzxobeprssrfx.onion/these are the correct urls as confirmed by agoras pgp-signed message:code: [select]-----begin pgp signed message-----hash: sha1agora announcement 2014-04-11earlier this week the details of a serious bug in the openssl library were made public. this bug, which affected a large number of web servers and devices was popularly referred to as heartbleed. the bug allows anybody connecting to a vulnerable service to reveal the contents of memory on the server - and thus reveal secret keys, user information, passwords, etc.there is more information about the bug and the versions of openssl that are affected at the website setup for the bug:http://heartbleed.com/agora is a hidden service served on the tor network, and while agora itself does not use the vulnerable library, the tor software that makes up the network was affected by this bug in some instances since it integrates the openssl library. the tor project wrote a blog post about how this bug affects various aspects of the tor service:https://blog.torproject.org/blog/openssl-bug-cve-2014-0160for users of the tor browser bundle you should upgrade to the latest release version immediately, as the bundled version of tor is vulnerable to the attack. get the latest tor browser bundle version from http://torproject.orgfor agora as a hidden service, we have investigated the possibilities of exploitation and to our current best knowledge, the most an attacker could hope to gain in a hypothetical situation of successful exploitation, is the ability to impersonate the hidden service.the tor blog post on this subject states:"like the last big openssl bug, this shouldnt allow an attacker to identify the location of the hidden service, but an attacker who knows the hidden service identity key can impersonate the hidden service."at this time even an attack like that is looking unlikely and we havent seen any signs of it being successfully executed. however, since the underlying bug is very serious and has been in the wild for an unclear amount of time, we will be taking the necessary precautions and shall hereby recycle all our previously used hidden service keys.effectively this means that we need to change the address of the market.additionally we have decided to take the market down for some time so we can fully investigate the effects and change all servers used by it in order to fully protect ourselves from any hypothetical damage or information leaks. we estimate that this process will be complete by the end of the week. we do understand that this is a big inconvenience for many of you, but please understand that we do this for the sake of your anonymity as well.the new address to be used from now on to access agora when its available will be:http://agorahooawayyfoe.onionthe address to access agora forums is:http://lacbzxobeprssrfx.onionwe are constantly vigilant about new threats and the security of our market and users and are taking these steps as a precaution.-----begin pgp signature-----iqicbaebagagbqjtseztaaojelckzxcnk9yvmtmp/irzgrhvg3ghdqn0ikj5lssgcwtritbj2bschvxn6yp3ctqqys/ynbecj6clyqi2u7bzl2k4lwarlsntghzbqiifx3bvg7yzv1s5gtvoeiwgwmw2mwpsecqn0dfj/zvyjkg/alsah7f/5uugnsg3kber4ewsp99q480ncwuwyrqa0x29ntdq1ajxfscnoik/0ydtyw+0/va1glmdr5bqcn7tmwebq3jxii+gvircltrds5l9zzcbs8pv9nzvyma4pxjcgsxbb6tpml3muyx4sopay2hc6cnykmsqct6zl79iykg+hrzm9enxxv1hupfn7cqq6oetseku2euaikfkpusoz9qukwmqmhmkbakre3ffbfo3rmkedqc56b5hc6duoevtvc2ipzo80rusowjv42qn1ukjc0tfptydr/uuodustmjlqcaljczp/lxpxablq5vv0bofrfelgzzokmv9ucdjiu0vc2wm935ypv7buyhdqzbrkfb++vhlent21am59y+jnvjyvktuw3anxoblyrhz22cyaupewx0gdnyi2nm6qwf3km/cm7e+jceg24vryiuf2tgwdlfmwa4brd20tt1g1lgzde6988cuidyengrhrh/kxxgh7xkhq0kvibsaet5bhzouxk1enohilvqkthjvfeidklxzdb4wnckjeidp=e2zd-----end pgp signature-----

ive noticed tails makes a connection startting u to sites like:clients1.google.com:80gtglobal-ocsp.geotrust.com:80do others ex[erience this to? does anyone know why?
now that agoras down, probably for the count...if you get this message digital, pm me. it would be awesome to know which market you are returning to, if youre returning. just a message from a loyal customer.
title says it all.i kept expecting a thread like this to pop up.change password and carry on? or will there be a change of url?
nice, did you have the post ready and hit refresh for 3 days? cause that was a super fast post i check 5 mins before and nothing. thanks for the update,
quote from: cousinmolly on april 14, 2014, 06:26:04 pmnice, did you have the post ready and hit refresh for 3 days?lol nope. i just have a copy of the pgp signed message and when the market came back online i passed along the info.
hope not. i have no sales so no loss to me. just set up on evolution as well.
does anyone know whats happening. the new link doesnt work...
now now.this aint your average trolly trash talk thread.i for 3 would like very much to hear from agora admin on the subject.its prolly all over reddit but not a word down here.maybe even a quick mention on their forums. but i know that just causes issues too. look at what happened when clu opened his mouth.
i hope they come back soon.   they should at least give an update.
message from hydroblowback  today - not sure. theres been a bug on the system for a unknown amount of time. site should be up in a weeks time!so that sucks big time!
you are on the ball arent you now?they said by weeks end and it ended about 15 minutes ago.so i guess they never lied because i am sure they will have it back up by the weeks end.
we know that the old url posted a message saying that they were  moving servers and that they said it would be back up by the end of the week.  we dont know which week they meant when they said that... or if they are indeed doing what the message said.  we know that they have not posted a single message since the site was taken down and that, thus far, no new information has been provided.  we also know that someone logged into the agora forum account several hours after the site was taken off-line (without posting any additional information), but since then there has been no sight of agora admins or staff.hopefully, if the site is not up again soon, they will provide some sort of update.  until then - we really know nothing.  we hope, we think, we believe - but we do not know.

the pirate market has now added a vacation mode for vendors! when a vendor hasnt signed into the market for 7 days, vacation mode is enabled which hides their items from the product list and basically puts their account into hibernation.when the vendor signs back into their account, s/he can disable vacation mode and their account returns to normal. this eliminates any extra time spent fishing out inactive vendors -the pirate markethttp://yjhzeedl5osagmmr.onion/
i think i finally got electrum figured out. if you cant click on the red network button to change the settings, restart the program. turn on socks5, set to 127.0.0.1 port 9050. try switching servers periodically if it wont connect. sometimes it just takes forever to connect though.

hi gang!we always referred to the body load as "that stomach thing".......like something in your stomach reaching up and yanking on your ears...for 5 or 7 hours.......usually accompanied by mild jaw clenching, other general tension....we found that a little bit of benzo - either .25mg xanax or 5mg valium - will kill it dead...too much benzo can unwantedly cap a trip, over .5 xanax or 10mg valium......and only those two, klonipin, dalmane, cenax, etc, just doesnt work.if you usually experience discomfort doing acid, try it!weve been doing it that way for 30+ years.... ..reading the old literature, even leary used librium for his "experiments" sometimes....people respond differently, though--any amount of benzo kills some peoples trips almost entirely...--lf
tmg doesnt use ssl it seems, so theyre unaffected. not sure which, if any, darknet sites do use ssl, but i imagine itd be a huge hassle. you could self-sign but that would alarm so many people when their browsers start yelling at them about it, and i imagine itd be hard to get one signed for an onion domain from the various cas out there.
please do not direct people to email, pm or any other direct message system for the purpose of trade. also, do not advertise goods or link to your marketplace before you are verified as a vendor at http://thehubaoydxrommh.onion/index.php?topic=12.0.- captain jack

nice, did you have the post ready and hit refresh for 3 days? cause that was a super fast post i check 5 mins before and nothing. thanks for the update,
how is it better than torchat?
wanna know something interesting.. i have not once been accused of posting cp on sr3. know why? because i never started fucking with a market i should not have been fucking with!
hope not. i have no sales so no loss to me. just set up on evolution as well.
ok thanks.
we know that the old url posted a message saying that they were  moving servers and that they said it would be back up by the end of the week.  we dont know which week they meant when they said that... or if they are indeed doing what the message said.  we know that they have not posted a single message since the site was taken down and that, thus far, no new information has been provided.  we also know that someone logged into the agora forum account several hours after the site was taken off-line (without posting any additional information), but since then there has been no sight of agora admins or staff.hopefully, if the site is not up again soon, they will provide some sort of update.  until then - we really know nothing.  we hope, we think, we believe - but we do not know.
you are on the ball arent you now?they said by weeks end and it ended about 15 minutes ago.so i guess they never lied because i am sure they will have it back up by the weeks end.
message from hydroblowback  today - not sure. theres been a bug on the system for a unknown amount of time. site should be up in a weeks time!so that sucks big time!
i hope they come back soon.   they should at least give an update.
now now.this aint your average trolly trash talk thread.i for 3 would like very much to hear from agora admin on the subject.its prolly all over reddit but not a word down here.maybe even a quick mention on their forums. but i know that just causes issues too. look at what happened when clu opened his mouth.
does anyone know whats happening. the new link doesnt work...
i am increasingly getting customers whos pgp name/comment do not match their tmg nym. this makes it extremely hard for me to send out payment information and shipping updates. depending on what version of pgp you use it is extremely easy to change the name and signatures on your public keys and then re upload them. have also started to get tons of plaintext orders which i will not tolerate. come on people this is life or death freedom or jail shit we are talking here.
i am not sure how to do it from gpa but from terminal you could do gpg  --edit-key inanna   (where inanna is whatever y0u put for your pgp nym)then do:adduid (hit enter and you can enter your tmg nym and email address and a comment)from there you can use the command remuid to get rid f one of your names or just have both of them on there. i am sure it is easy to change from gpa i just do not know how to do it. signing a new key would also be an option.
the public key would change but would still be verifiable once re imported so you would not need to sign it or anything.

ah, gotcha. once a uid is added/removed from a key, does the key itself change? i.e. would i need to then update the key that's currently linked in my signature?
if your client doesn't support it (which i haven't found the option to change any key info in gnu privacy assistant), the easiest solutionwould be to generate a new key with the correct name and sign your old one with the new one when re-posting it in the thread?plaintext pms are just a no-no always, it's a little bit of a learning curve for vast amounts of safety and security. like you saidquote from: inannathis is life or death freedom or jail shit we are talking here
no plaintext messages for me yet. (here at least, got one i had to cancel on agora recently) that is very scary. yes ideally your pgp key should be your name here. i have simply started saving certs by the name of the poster on an encrypted drive and running "gpg --import name" each time to get the pgp key right.

ive noticed tails makes a connection startting u to sites like:clients1.google.com:80gtglobal-ocsp.geotrust.com:80do others ex[erience this to? does anyone know why?

quote from: cousinmolly on april 14, 2014, 06:26:04 pmnice, did you have the post ready and hit refresh for 3 days?lol nope. i just have a copy of the pgp signed message and when the market came back online i passed along the info.
nice, did you have the post ready and hit refresh for 3 days? cause that was a super fast post i check 5 mins before and nothing. thanks for the update,
how is it better than torchat?
wanna know something interesting.. i have not once been accused of posting cp on sr3. know why? because i never started fucking with a market i should not have been fucking with!
hope not. i have no sales so no loss to me. just set up on evolution as well.
ok thanks.
we know that the old url posted a message saying that they were  moving servers and that they said it would be back up by the end of the week.  we dont know which week they meant when they said that... or if they are indeed doing what the message said.  we know that they have not posted a single message since the site was taken down and that, thus far, no new information has been provided.  we also know that someone logged into the agora forum account several hours after the site was taken off-line (without posting any additional information), but since then there has been no sight of agora admins or staff.hopefully, if the site is not up again soon, they will provide some sort of update.  until then - we really know nothing.  we hope, we think, we believe - but we do not know.
you are on the ball arent you now?they said by weeks end and it ended about 15 minutes ago.so i guess they never lied because i am sure they will have it back up by the weeks end.
message from hydroblowback  today - not sure. theres been a bug on the system for a unknown amount of time. site should be up in a weeks time!so that sucks big time!
i hope they come back soon.   they should at least give an update.
now now.this aint your average trolly trash talk thread.i for 3 would like very much to hear from agora admin on the subject.its prolly all over reddit but not a word down here.maybe even a quick mention on their forums. but i know that just causes issues too. look at what happened when clu opened his mouth.
does anyone know whats happening. the new link doesnt work...

you want to know how to get bitcoins anonymously and pay 0% fees?   go open an account on evoluton and go down to the store that sells pre-paid debit cards.  look at the cards they sell and list those on evoluton for the amount of bitcoin you want.   then when somebody buys the card from you, go to the store and buy it with cash then send it out anonymously.
confirmed... deposits and withdrawals still seem to need some work, but its up and running.was perfect timing for me as one of my deliveries arrived and i was able to confirm and release the payment right on schedule.
just a heads up. agora just sent out a message to all vendors. withdraws may be delayed for 48 hours while they change over to a new more secure withdraw system. im going on vacation till this is sorted.

you want to know how to get bitcoins anonymously and pay 0% fees?   go open an account on evoluton and go down to the store that sells pre-paid debit cards.  look at the cards they sell and list those on evoluton for the amount of bitcoin you want.   then when somebody buys the card from you, go to the store and buy it with cash then send it out anonymously.
apologies. it is the newest version of tails that was verified, after tails says that the tor network is ready in the little black box in the upper right hand corner, i open the network map, and then iceweasel. it is then i see the connections in the network map.thanks for the reply.

sorry for the noob question but thats not completely clear to me. if i configure claws mail on tails to a hidden service e-mail provider like mail2tor or mailtor is there a need for ssl to theyr imap or smtp server or does tors end-to-end encryption also work in this case?peace
bitcoinclassifieds net has cash by mail, does it get anymore anonymous?
also never use that password again
i put the link to the blog on tor about the problem.using ssl on a hidden service is stupid and unnecessary as tor makes it a https connection by default.the problem is (from my understanding) that openssl is used to generate the private key or how it hands  the private key to the primary relay node. but if you were using a server that had openssl pre  or generated your key using openssl pre  then you were unsafe.for the hack to work. the server would have had to directly connect to a node that was compromised (an attacker). the chances of that happening with the little time the bug was out meant that all of our servers were not identified, but the locations were changed just to be safe. and new urls were generated with proper openssl.

quotelaw enforcement is increasingly finding ways to thwart websites intended to mask the identities of its users and administrators. andrew grossman reports on digits. photo: getty images.washington—law-enforcement agencies are increasingly finding ways to unmask users of a popular web browser designed to hide identities and allow individuals to exist online anonymously.to keep their identities secret, users and administrators of a recently shuttered child-pornography website used a browser called tor that obscures the source of web traffic, authorities said in march. agents from homeland security investigations tracked many of them down anyway, largely because of mistakes that even some of the most sophisticated users eventually make.tor and other programs designed to hide users identity online have grown in popularity as people try to protect their privacy in an age of digital surveillance. when paired with bitcoin or other virtual currencies that dont use the banking system, tor can help hide the identities of people behind financial transactions. such programs also have become a tool for those seeking to evade the law, including child-pornography traders, hackers and other criminals, creating challenges for law enforcement.but officials are becoming more confident that tors shield of anonymity isnt impenetrable."theres not a magic way to trace people [through tor], so we typically capitalize on human error, looking for whatever clues people leave in their wake," said james kilpatrick, one of the hsi agents who is part of operation round table, a continuing investigation into a tor-based child-pornography site that has so far resulted in 25 arrests and the identification of more than 250 victims, all children.a typical browser sends data along a direct route, making it relatively easy to figure out who is visiting a website, sending messages or downloading material. tor, which stands for "the onion router," sends data through layers of intermediary computers that cant be peeled back, making it nearly impossible for law enforcement and private companies to track internet browsing."two years ago…if they ran into tor, they said, its hopeless, " said andrew lewman, executive director of the nonprofit group that oversees tor, called tor project. but after meetings with agencies including the federal bureau of investigation and the department of homeland security, he noticed their perception started changing. "they finally realized tors not this impenetrable thing. users make mistakes."law-enforcement officials are reluctant to talk about specific techniques they use to identify tor users, but researchers and court documents provide some clues.some of the mistakes are old-fashioned: the administrator of the child-pornography site at the center of operation round table was first identified by postal inspectors because he was "sending sex objects through the mail to juveniles," said mr. kilpatrick. that site administrator pleaded guilty last week to federal charges that come with a prison sentence of at least 20 years.digital forensics were crucial to catching other people allegedly involved in the site, which involved individuals posing as young girls in order to convince boys in their early teens to make sexually explicit videos. in one case, law-enforcement officials said they were able to catch an australian man who logged into his fake facebook profile and his real profile once without using tor or other anonymizing tools.that man, mark warren, is charged in manhattan federal court with production and receipt of child pornography and extortion, and he is in australia pending extradition. information about his lawyer couldnt be obtained."most people dont have the discipline to not make a mistake," mr. kilpatrick said. "the average person is too worried about doing their business to never make a mistake."tor relies on a large set of relay servers between an end user and the site he is trying to visit. data takes a constantly shifting path between a few of those servers on its way to and from the users computer, masking the unique internet protocol, or ip, address law enforcement needs to match a virtual identity to one in the real world.homeland security chief jeh johnson after a march news conference on operation round table. agence france-presse/getty imagessome law-enforcement officials and security researchers say the shakiness of that network itself, which relies on volunteers to use their machines to route data, presents opportunities for authorities to trace users.tor project tries to fix any technical vulnerabilities, but it said staffers have briefed law enforcement on the software, helping them better understand its limitations.source: online.wsj.com/news/articles/sb10001424052702303949704579461641349857358

quotelaw enforcement is increasingly finding ways to thwart websites intended to mask the identities of its users and administrators. andrew grossman reports on digits. photo: getty images.washington—law-enforcement agencies are increasingly finding ways to unmask users of a popular web browser designed to hide identities and allow individuals to exist online anonymously.to keep their identities secret, users and administrators of a recently shuttered child-pornography website used a browser called tor that obscures the source of web traffic, authorities said in march. agents from homeland security investigations tracked many of them down anyway, largely because of mistakes that even some of the most sophisticated users eventually make.tor and other programs designed to hide users identity online have grown in popularity as people try to protect their privacy in an age of digital surveillance. when paired with bitcoin or other virtual currencies that dont use the banking system, tor can help hide the identities of people behind financial transactions. such programs also have become a tool for those seeking to evade the law, including child-pornography traders, hackers and other criminals, creating challenges for law enforcement.but officials are becoming more confident that tors shield of anonymity isnt impenetrable."theres not a magic way to trace people [through tor], so we typically capitalize on human error, looking for whatever clues people leave in their wake," said james kilpatrick, one of the hsi agents who is part of operation round table, a continuing investigation into a tor-based child-pornography site that has so far resulted in 25 arrests and the identification of more than 250 victims, all children.a typical browser sends data along a direct route, making it relatively easy to figure out who is visiting a website, sending messages or downloading material. tor, which stands for "the onion router," sends data through layers of intermediary computers that cant be peeled back, making it nearly impossible for law enforcement and private companies to track internet browsing."two years ago…if they ran into tor, they said, its hopeless, " said andrew lewman, executive director of the nonprofit group that oversees tor, called tor project. but after meetings with agencies including the federal bureau of investigation and the department of homeland security, he noticed their perception started changing. "they finally realized tors not this impenetrable thing. users make mistakes."law-enforcement officials are reluctant to talk about specific techniques they use to identify tor users, but researchers and court documents provide some clues.some of the mistakes are old-fashioned: the administrator of the child-pornography site at the center of operation round table was first identified by postal inspectors because he was "sending sex objects through the mail to juveniles," said mr. kilpatrick. that site administrator pleaded guilty last week to federal charges that come with a prison sentence of at least 20 years.digital forensics were crucial to catching other people allegedly involved in the site, which involved individuals posing as young girls in order to convince boys in their early teens to make sexually explicit videos. in one case, law-enforcement officials said they were able to catch an australian man who logged into his fake facebook profile and his real profile once without using tor or other anonymizing tools.that man, mark warren, is charged in manhattan federal court with production and receipt of child pornography and extortion, and he is in australia pending extradition. information about his lawyer couldnt be obtained."most people dont have the discipline to not make a mistake," mr. kilpatrick said. "the average person is too worried about doing their business to never make a mistake."tor relies on a large set of relay servers between an end user and the site he is trying to visit. data takes a constantly shifting path between a few of those servers on its way to and from the users computer, masking the unique internet protocol, or ip, address law enforcement needs to match a virtual identity to one in the real world.homeland security chief jeh johnson after a march news conference on operation round table. agence france-presse/getty imagessome law-enforcement officials and security researchers say the shakiness of that network itself, which relies on volunteers to use their machines to route data, presents opportunities for authorities to trace users.tor project tries to fix any technical vulnerabilities, but it said staffers have briefed law enforcement on the software, helping them better understand its limitations.source: online.wsj.com/news/articles/sb10001424052702303949704579461641349857358

is your pin working?  i tried to withdraw 1.3 bitcoins yesterday and my pin is different than what i thought it was.   i went through the pin change process but am waiting on the last part of the process where defcon apparently changes it personally.  i figured ill wait another day or 2 and then try to get the money out with the help of somebody with a vendor account that is able to do withdrawls.

if its the pin, it will show you an error message at the top after the withdrawal fails but its kind of small so you might miss it.   does it show you any error message at the top?
its been a long payback - i know others are in process of being reimbursed we were lucky and received 100% back - we hope they man-up to all that were stolen fromdoes that mean all forgot -  no ... but at least we got out btcs back amd hope other vendors due as well

its been a long payback - i know others are in process of being reimbursed we were lucky and received 100% back - we hope they man-up to all that were stolen fromdoes that mean all forgot -  no ... but at least we got out btcs back amd hope other vendors due as well
if its the pin, it will show you an error message at the top after the withdrawal fails but its kind of small so you might miss it.   does it show you any error message at the top?

as down as your syndrome if cant even fucking read the last few comments in the first thread in this section before opening a new one.p.s. its up again right now but my word play wouldnt have worked if i said it straight away
i would love to get involved in this but unfortunately i dont quite have the basics down yet. a friend and i started trying to figure it out a while ago but it just confused the balls out of us. think i need to find a person i can play face to face to get my head round it first. give me a wee bit of time and i will be back to take that lsd of you!
alright so you want to play some go? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/go_%28game%29 we will be using the fairly standard chess like notation a-t on one side(i skipped), and 1-19 on the other.i am about 19kyu, so beginner, but good enough that i can try to make a game interesting. if you are just starting out, this is probably not the best format to play go, as games played this way tend to stretch on for very long. in the very beginning it is best to get as many games done as fast as reasonable. you are best off probably learning the basics else where. i will try to accommodate any skill level however, feel free to challenge me regardless of skill. go is easy to handicap, so feel free to suggest a handicap in your or my favor.lets start with a 13x13 game. black has a considerable advantage so challenger can go first.oh and if there is real interest, i would like to offer a prize of some lsd for future games.
seriously??  get a life!
on "allowing for multisig escrow", its a tricky concept. any wallet will allow you to pay in to a multisig address. the problem comes when you have to provide your signature to allow the spending from the address. most wallets today do not give an easy interface for users to do that. for example it can be done on bitcoind, but on the command line, and for a non-expert would be difficult. other wallets have bits and pieces of the necessary functionality but not in a nice, bundled way. there are python libraries that make it a breeze for developers, but that doesnt help much if youre not a developer.some services are offering web-based escrow and web-wallets (e.g. greenaddress.it) using multisig, but they are just using multisig "internally" to their architecture to give some defence against thefit, which is not quite what you need when interacting with a dark net market. so the marketplace itself would have to provide you with at least some "hand holding", by providing you with the payout transaction to sign and then giving you detailed instructions on how to sign it and send it back to them (constituting your agreement to the payout). thats the problem; wallets should be doing that part for you. you should be able to click a button "sign/authorize this transaction". but the standard ones dont, yet.darkwallet for example is in development and is apparently offering this feature.take what i say with caution though, as ive only been somewhat involved in bitcoin-related development recently, and i dont actually know exactly what the various darknet markets are doing. thats the main reason im here, actually, to find out.edit: in my further reading i found this: quotemultisignature addresses are addresses controlled by more than one person. they are created with a set of requirements, that dictate how the funds in the address can be moved.2-of-3 signature addresses are jointly controlled by 3 people, say the site operator, the buyer, and the seller, but funds can only be moved if two people authorize and sign a transaction.users will be expected to sign transactions for themselves. while client’s leave much to be desired regarding support for multisignature transactions, i believe the best way to increase their adoption is to bring them into day-to-day life, and watch the situation improve from there.currently, the only unmodified client which supports signing multisignature transactions is bitcoin core. otherwise, users can use an offline copy of https://coinb.in/multisig to sign in their browser.it sucks that bitcoin core is the only client that lets us do this. i’m very much looking forward to a light client that supports it out of the box.at : http://www.deepdotweb.com/2014/04/04/bitwasp-now-offering-built-in-multi-signature-transactions/.. which more or less seems to confirm what i was saying.
i must admit that the multi-sig explanation is a little daunting when first read but after going back and reading it all again i am liking it more and more. thanks for focusing on the main issues that most other markets only claim to fix.

i was a buyer at sr since july 2011, and in my two years as a customer (not very active though) i didnt witness any theft, any hacking, althought by that times it shouldnt have so good security. if sr2 is suppossed to be its successor, then why did it got its coins lost? why all that fe force shit? im not really into bitcoins security as i blindly trust it, so i dont know what transaction maleability is, but if bitcoin had a flaw that allowed these kind of robbing, wouldnt it be massively tried/accomplished? i dont want to be evil-minded, but i smell a rat in the new dpr.
interesting... thank you

appreciate the heads up, the new forums come right up, the market on the other hand is taking some time to respond.  i guess they are still working some of the bugs out... :-)

alright so you want to play some go? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/go_%28game%29 we will be using the fairly standard chess like notation a-t on one side(i skipped), and 1-19 on the other.i am about 19kyu, so beginner, but good enough that i can try to make a game interesting. if you are just starting out, this is probably not the best format to play go, as games played this way tend to stretch on for very long. in the very beginning it is best to get as many games done as fast as reasonable. you are best off probably learning the basics else where. i will try to accommodate any skill level however, feel free to challenge me regardless of skill. go is easy to handicap, so feel free to suggest a handicap in your or my favor.lets start with a 13x13 game. black has a considerable advantage so challenger can go first.oh and if there is real interest, i would like to offer a prize of some lsd for future games.
appreciate the heads up, the new forums come right up, the market on the other hand is taking some time to respond.  i guess they are still working some of the bugs out... :-)

i must admit that the multi-sig explanation is a little daunting when first read but after going back and reading it all again i am liking it more and more. thanks for focusing on the main issues that most other markets only claim to fix.
seriously??  get a life!

interesting... thank you
on "allowing for multisig escrow", its a tricky concept. any wallet will allow you to pay in to a multisig address. the problem comes when you have to provide your signature to allow the spending from the address. most wallets today do not give an easy interface for users to do that. for example it can be done on bitcoind, but on the command line, and for a non-expert would be difficult. other wallets have bits and pieces of the necessary functionality but not in a nice, bundled way. there are python libraries that make it a breeze for developers, but that doesnt help much if youre not a developer.some services are offering web-based escrow and web-wallets (e.g. greenaddress.it) using multisig, but they are just using multisig "internally" to their architecture to give some defence against thefit, which is not quite what you need when interacting with a dark net market. so the marketplace itself would have to provide you with at least some "hand holding", by providing you with the payout transaction to sign and then giving you detailed instructions on how to sign it and send it back to them (constituting your agreement to the payout). thats the problem; wallets should be doing that part for you. you should be able to click a button "sign/authorize this transaction". but the standard ones dont, yet.darkwallet for example is in development and is apparently offering this feature.take what i say with caution though, as ive only been somewhat involved in bitcoin-related development recently, and i dont actually know exactly what the various darknet markets are doing. thats the main reason im here, actually, to find out.edit: in my further reading i found this: quotemultisignature addresses are addresses controlled by more than one person. they are created with a set of requirements, that dictate how the funds in the address can be moved.2-of-3 signature addresses are jointly controlled by 3 people, say the site operator, the buyer, and the seller, but funds can only be moved if two people authorize and sign a transaction.users will be expected to sign transactions for themselves. while client’s leave much to be desired regarding support for multisignature transactions, i believe the best way to increase their adoption is to bring them into day-to-day life, and watch the situation improve from there.currently, the only unmodified client which supports signing multisignature transactions is bitcoin core. otherwise, users can use an offline copy of https://coinb.in/multisig to sign in their browser.it sucks that bitcoin core is the only client that lets us do this. i’m very much looking forward to a light client that supports it out of the box.at : http://www.deepdotweb.com/2014/04/04/bitwasp-now-offering-built-in-multi-signature-transactions/.. which more or less seems to confirm what i was saying.

alright so you want to play some go? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/go_%28game%29 we will be using the fairly standard chess like notation a-t on one side(i skipped), and 1-19 on the other.i am about 19kyu, so beginner, but good enough that i can try to make a game interesting. if you are just starting out, this is probably not the best format to play go, as games played this way tend to stretch on for very long. in the very beginning it is best to get as many games done as fast as reasonable. you are best off probably learning the basics else where. i will try to accommodate any skill level however, feel free to challenge me regardless of skill. go is easy to handicap, so feel free to suggest a handicap in your or my favor.lets start with a 13x13 game. black has a considerable advantage so challenger can go first.oh and if there is real interest, i would like to offer a prize of some lsd for future games.
i love the idea, although frankly i would rather play go. not that i am very good at either.
http://bm26rwk32m7u7rec.onion/index.php?topic=425.msg5714#msg5714made a thread for go.
i was a buyer at sr since july 2011, and in my two years as a customer (not very active though) i didnt witness any theft, any hacking, althought by that times it shouldnt have so good security. if sr2 is suppossed to be its successor, then why did it got its coins lost? why all that fe force shit? im not really into bitcoins security as i blindly trust it, so i dont know what transaction maleability is, but if bitcoin had a flaw that allowed these kind of robbing, wouldnt it be massively tried/accomplished? i dont want to be evil-minded, but i smell a rat in the new dpr.

interesting... thank you
on "allowing for multisig escrow", its a tricky concept. any wallet will allow you to pay in to a multisig address. the problem comes when you have to provide your signature to allow the spending from the address. most wallets today do not give an easy interface for users to do that. for example it can be done on bitcoind, but on the command line, and for a non-expert would be difficult. other wallets have bits and pieces of the necessary functionality but not in a nice, bundled way. there are python libraries that make it a breeze for developers, but that doesnt help much if youre not a developer.some services are offering web-based escrow and web-wallets (e.g. greenaddress.it) using multisig, but they are just using multisig "internally" to their architecture to give some defence against thefit, which is not quite what you need when interacting with a dark net market. so the marketplace itself would have to provide you with at least some "hand holding", by providing you with the payout transaction to sign and then giving you detailed instructions on how to sign it and send it back to them (constituting your agreement to the payout). thats the problem; wallets should be doing that part for you. you should be able to click a button "sign/authorize this transaction". but the standard ones dont, yet.darkwallet for example is in development and is apparently offering this feature.take what i say with caution though, as ive only been somewhat involved in bitcoin-related development recently, and i dont actually know exactly what the various darknet markets are doing. thats the main reason im here, actually, to find out.edit: in my further reading i found this: quotemultisignature addresses are addresses controlled by more than one person. they are created with a set of requirements, that dictate how the funds in the address can be moved.2-of-3 signature addresses are jointly controlled by 3 people, say the site operator, the buyer, and the seller, but funds can only be moved if two people authorize and sign a transaction.users will be expected to sign transactions for themselves. while client’s leave much to be desired regarding support for multisignature transactions, i believe the best way to increase their adoption is to bring them into day-to-day life, and watch the situation improve from there.currently, the only unmodified client which supports signing multisignature transactions is bitcoin core. otherwise, users can use an offline copy of https://coinb.in/multisig to sign in their browser.it sucks that bitcoin core is the only client that lets us do this. i’m very much looking forward to a light client that supports it out of the box.at : http://www.deepdotweb.com/2014/04/04/bitwasp-now-offering-built-in-multi-signature-transactions/.. which more or less seems to confirm what i was saying.

there is really no reason for you to need ssl encryption to a hidden service; the only exception i could think of is if you had one tor client that acted on behalf of a network, and you didnt want anybody in the local network to see your packets.on the other hand, the only things that should be going out in plain text anyway are the headers, username, and password. everything else should be encrypted using pgp-mime or the like.
im game. given the average lifetime of dark net markets, i suggest we make it 9x9. how about japanese rules, you take black, no komi? gg hf
hello pigeon,yeah.. just dismiss me as a competitor, thats easier than makingany changes right ?get the password rules changed.there is absolutely no justification, on a darknet site,for imposing password character limitations.if it looks like a scam, and they act like scammers, its probably a scam.  if youre a legit market, youll be happy to keep yourprospective clients happy, right? ... so do these two things:1. extend the max password length to 50+ characters.2. accept any utf-8 characters.so what are you guys going to do now ?have a nice day ... and be happyplayground :-)
it can be a pain in the ass, but think about this scenario. feds break down your door, no time to hide anything incriminating, and the only thing stopping them from reading all your messages, is that one single password. not that it would come down to that, just the principle that your password is to stop someone else from reading your messages if they get on your cpu.

there is really no reason for you to need ssl encryption to a hidden service; the only exception i could think of is if you had one tor client that acted on behalf of a network, and you didnt want anybody in the local network to see your packets.on the other hand, the only things that should be going out in plain text anyway are the headers, username, and password. everything else should be encrypted using pgp-mime or the like.
ive used bit blender a couple times and was very impressed with ease of use and speed.
hello pigeon,yeah.. just dismiss me as a competitor, thats easier than makingany changes right ?get the password rules changed.there is absolutely no justification, on a darknet site,for imposing password character limitations.if it looks like a scam, and they act like scammers, its probably a scam.  if youre a legit market, youll be happy to keep yourprospective clients happy, right? ... so do these two things:1. extend the max password length to 50+ characters.2. accept any utf-8 characters.so what are you guys going to do now ?have a nice day ... and be happyplayground :-)

quote from: axa on april 26, 2014, 12:45:10 amnot using ssl when connecting to a hidden service mail server could leave your username/password vulnerable to a man in the middle attack.the only place that could be in the middle is between you and the tor client, and between the hidden services tor client and the actual box hosting it. there is a tor circuit between you and the rp, and the rp and the hidden service have another tor circuit, and you have done a d-h key exchange that is based on the rsa key the tor client has, and the onion address is based on a hash of the rsa key. where, exactly, is this mitm attack going to come from?

quote from: owockeznan on april 25, 2014, 11:05:02 pmthere is really no reason for you to need ssl encryption to a hidden service; the only exception i could think of is if you had one tor client that acted on behalf of a network, and you didnt want anybody in the local network to see your packets.on the other hand, the only things that should be going out in plain text anyway are the headers, username, and password. everything else should be encrypted using pgp-mime or the like.not using ssl when connecting to a hidden service mail server could leave your username/password vulnerable to a man in the middle attack.
right before an update to tails was required i copied and pasted all files from my usb to another one in case the upgrade didnt go well. it didnt and i was forced to do a clean install of tails. i can no longer access the old pgp (.asc?) that i had saved. this is pretty frustrating since i had that pgp tied to an sr account. id like those funds back if possible. can anyone give me tips on how to use the saved info to get my old pgp back? keep in mind i didnt correctly export it so i need a work around. thanks!

i found this read from bruce scheiners blog rather interesting, even though it is a few years old. its not something ive ever really seen discussed anywhere else.snooping on text by listening to the keyboard: https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2005/09/snooping_on_tex.htmlfascinating research out of berkeley. ed felten has a good summary:    li zhuang, feng zhou, and doug tygar have an interesting new paper showing that if you have an audio recording of somebody typing on an ordinary computer keyboard for fifteen minutes or so, you can figure out everything they typed. the idea is that different keys tend to make slightly different sounds, and although you dont know in advance which keys make which sounds, you can use machine learning to figure that out, assuming that the person is mostly typing english text. (presumably it would work for other languages too.)read the rest.the paper is on the web. heres the abstract:    we examine the problem of keyboard acoustic emanations. we present a novel attack taking as input a 10-minute sound recording of a user typing english text using a keyboard, and then recovering up to 96% of typed characters. there is no need for a labeled training recording. moreover the recognizer bootstrapped this way can even recognize random text such as passwords: in our experiments, 90% of 5-character random passwords using only letters can be generated in fewer than 20 attempts by an adversary; 80% of 10-character passwords can be generated in fewer than 75 attempts. our attack uses the statistical constraints of the underlying content, english language, to reconstruct text from sound recordings without any labeled training data. the attack uses a combination of standard machine learning and speech recognition techniques, including cepstrum features, hidden markov models, linear classification, and feedback-based incremental learning.

right before an update to tails was required i copied and pasted all files from my usb to another one in case the upgrade didnt go well. it didnt and i was forced to do a clean install of tails. i can no longer access the old pgp (.asc?) that i had saved. this is pretty frustrating since i had that pgp tied to an sr account. id like those funds back if possible. can anyone give me tips on how to use the saved info to get my old pgp back? keep in mind i didnt correctly export it so i need a work around. thanks!
hello siblings,what i would like, is some encryption facility that i can load onto my usb key,that will give me access to encrypted files, or an encrypted vault of files,that will work equally well if i plug it into a windows machine or a linux machine.i presume this will be a c++/c program, so i guess i will need to have twoversions of it, one that executes from a usb key on windows, and one thatexecutes from a usb key on ubuntu.both versions, linux and windows, need to be looking at the same set of encrypted files (or vault of files).  so that i have access to these files whether im using a linux machine or a windows machine.if anyone knows of such a program, please let me know. :-)three additional related questions:1.  does a bootable linux os .. held on a usb stick, boot up normally when you plug it into a windows machine ?2.  vice versa, does a bootable windows os ... held on a usb stick, boot upnormally when you plug it into a linux machine ?3.  are you guys formatting your usb drives to fat32 ?  thanks for your help.have a nice day .. and be happy :-)playground
i know the community is very worried, but this thing of pre accusing everyone of scammers and le must stop.it is very offensive to hear those things when you are legit and it generates more panick and paranoia among this anonymous community.2fa login is on our todo list since the first day. it will be implemented.we may offer multi-sig futurely but as an option, we wont force its use. we are thinking about the huge number of customers that still do not use hidden markets and so we want to make things as simple as possible, everything was thought and built around simplicity.  if you look at our help page it is very newbie oriented because of that reason.there are no plans for litecoin. regarding your scam worries. it is no different than amazon.com or any market you trust. you decide to trust or not, it is up to you. you can also take personal measures to lower risks. there is absolutely no protection of this kind in any kind of payment/escrow, even no escrow. by the way we do allow fe by any user, it is up to them to decide who they prefer to trust, the market or the seller. no restrictions on fe.

quote from: axa on april 26, 2014, 12:45:10 amnot using ssl when connecting to a hidden service mail server could leave your username/password vulnerable to a man in the middle attack.the only place that could be in the middle is between you and the tor client, and between the hidden services tor client and the actual box hosting it. there is a tor circuit between you and the rp, and the rp and the hidden service have another tor circuit, and you have done a d-h key exchange that is based on the rsa key the tor client has, and the onion address is based on a hash of the rsa key. where, exactly, is this mitm attack going to come from?

to add on to tts post. one can also purchase through local bitcoins with cash via online methods.  look for listings that offer cash deposit at certain bank branches.these require you to go to the bank branch of choice and fill out an "out of state deposit slip"you fill this form out and give the cash to the teller, and they deposit it into the account of the btc seller.  your btcs are then released to you.you dont even have to be a member of the bank!  bank of america has always been very fast and hassle free.  also with this method, you usually arent charged a ridiculous price for your cryptocurrency.just remember to tumble your coins to an intermediate wallet before using them to purchase from a vendor.  blockchain.info (accessed through tor) allows for the quick creation of a wallet that can be used to tumble the coins.
there are many different things that you could use to possibly satisfy this requirement. perhaps the easiest would simply be a 7zip file that has been password protected. of course, ive never done an audit nor seen one of the codebase to ensure that the crypto in that system doesnt have any implentation bugs. there are many other functionally similar methods of doing the same thing. this would be the encrypted tarball approach.the second approach would be to mount the file as an actual disk. this has the advantage of being easy to work with -- it looks and feels just like a native volume.there are a few contenders that have both *nix and windows compatabality in this domain. the two ones that come to mind are truecrypt and luks/dmcrypt there are others as well ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/comparison_of_disk_encryption_software ), but i dont think nearly as much effort has been put into the review of those.
when you say i pasted all my files from one usb to the other do you mean you pasted the entire contents of /live/persistence/tailsdata_unlocked/ ?if so, you should just be able to paste your keyring files, located in in the gnupg folder of that information into ~/.gnupg and restart (assuming you set upgnupg persistence on your new persistence partition).
the vendor portal for deepify wont load anymore, so i cant edit my store. yesterday i gave up and became a vendor on evolution.
