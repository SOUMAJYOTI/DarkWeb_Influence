localbitcoins.comfind someone selling btc for "vanilla"go to cvs/riteaid/walmart/etc and put your cash onto a vanilla reload card.give the seller your 10 digit vanilla reload code.you will have your btc in a matter of moments.no idea how you could be having trouble getting btc. . . you can also meet someone and purchase with cash locally.
to add on to tt's post. one can also purchase through local bitcoins with cash via online methods.  look for listings that offer cash deposit at certain bank branches.these require you to go to the bank branch of choice and fill out an "out of state deposit slip"you fill this form out and give the cash to the teller, and they deposit it into the account of the btc seller.  your btc's are then released to you.you don't even have to be a member of the bank!  bank of america has always been very fast and hassle free.  also with this method, you usually aren't charged a ridiculous price for your cryptocurrency.just remember to tumble your coins to an intermediate wallet before using them to purchase from a vendor.  blockchain.info (accessed through tor) allows for the quick creation of a wallet that can be used to tumble the coins.

hi, i am seriously having trouble finding a way to buy my btc in the us, without attaching my bank account to the service. does anyone know of a way i can use an anonymous card loaded with cash to purchase my btc? without this knowledge i have been unable to order, and it is killing me inside slowly....lol.

there are many different things that you could use to possibly satisfy this requirement. perhaps the easiest would simply be a 7zip file that has been password protected. of course, ive never done an audit nor seen one of the codebase to ensure that the crypto in that system doesnt have any implentation bugs. there are many other functionally similar methods of doing the same thing. this would be the encrypted tarball approach.the second approach would be to mount the file as an actual disk. this has the advantage of being easy to work with -- it looks and feels just like a native volume.there are a few contenders that have both *nix and windows compatabality in this domain. the two ones that come to mind are truecrypt and luks/dmcrypt there are others as well ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/comparison_of_disk_encryption_software ), but i dont think nearly as much effort has been put into the review of those.
the vendor portal for deepify wont load anymore, so i cant edit my store. yesterday i gave up and became a vendor on evolution.
when you say i pasted all my files from one usb to the other do you mean you pasted the entire contents of /live/persistence/tailsdata_unlocked/ ?if so, you should just be able to paste your keyring files, located in in the gnupg folder of that information into ~/.gnupg and restart (assuming you set upgnupg persistence on your new persistence partition).

thank you guys for the response, and i am sure the question sounded stupid. i am very new and reading as much as i can. i obviously need to learn a bit more before i go any further. once again thank you for the great advice.

ok, i have done 1 trade with a senior member on bitcointalk using greendot moneypak and no escrow. his repuatation and general demeanor made me trust him, and the trade was successful. he will do moneypak trades at bitstamp rate +7% ($107 for $100 in btc). a better deal than lbc any day. also, looking into cash in the mail options as well. i want to help keep our btc world seperate from our drug world, so i wont be posting his contact details publicly, pm me for the info if youre interested, and please dont post it publicly.im not saying trust this guy with thousands of dollars, im saying i trusted him with a few hundred, and it worked out fine. proceed at your own risk. he also offers a fee free escrow service, but that is kind of a moot point if the trade is with him. i would trust him with more $ for my next trade, but proceed at your own risk.for what its worth, he seems like a pretty established btc trader, and i think his coins are freshly mined as well.

glad to see this being discussed. most of us walk around with a very powerful microphone....a cellphone. ga tech researchers were able to detect keystrokes based of vibrations from the accelerometer a few years ago. these are only in most modern, touch screen, phones. their originally used to detect the orientation of the phone to flip the screen automatically, orientation in gps and some games. this application of pickup vibrations is limited to when the phone is on the same surface as the keyboard. three letter agencies wouldnt sink much money into this but...this new application of using the microphone to decifer keystrokes is a huge step towards to supreme mass surveilance. they could theoretically sample all the keyboards in the world, which wouldnt be so far fetched since most brands feel(sound) very similar. they wouldnt even have to be exact with the words. most of you guys have seen taht eamil wehre letres dnot hvae to be in correct order to understand them. very negative development indeed. all phones pickup more sound than one hears via the speaker on phones. the more advanced phones seem to pickup a subtantial amount of sound from the microphones compared to older models. how many of you guys have a phone in a rather close proximity of your computer (cellphone or landline)? most people can test whether or not your celllphone are vulnerable to these types of surveilance. using a voice recording app thats available on most modern phones would be one way, or make a dummy phone call with another phone. building or buying a faraday enclosure (google it) for ones cell phone can make sure they arent able to monitor your keystrokes. unless they were amazing and able to record offline keystrokes as well. a person would have to be rather high on their shit list to receive that kind of treatment though...totally possible though. fun stuff!!

pm me if you want the name of a btc trader on bitcointalk.org (the main hub of info for btc). he will do greendot moneypak codes for btc at bitstamp rate +7% ($107 cash= $100 btc). dont talk about darknet stuff with him, all youre doing is buying btc. you can buy moneypak at most grocery and convience stores. make sure you get the reload card, not the debit card, it looks like a phone card. i trusted him with a couple hundred dollars, and it went fine, hes a senior member, and has a good trust rating. he could still rip you off though, so proceed with caution.

pm me if you want the name of a btc trader on bitcointalk.org (the main hub of info for btc). he will do greendot moneypak codes for btc at bitstamp rate +7% ($107 cash= $100 btc). dont talk about darknet stuff with him, all youre doing is buying btc. you can buy moneypak at most grocery and convience stores. make sure you get the reload card, not the debit card, it looks like a phone card. i trusted him with a couple hundred dollars, and it went fine, hes a senior member, and has a good trust rating. he could still rip you off though, so proceed with caution.

ok, i have done 1 trade with a senior member on bitcointalk using greendot moneypak and no escrow. his repuatation and general demeanor made me trust him, and the trade was successful. he will do moneypak trades at bitstamp rate +7% ($107 for $100 in btc). a better deal than lbc any day. also, looking into cash in the mail options as well. i want to help keep our btc world seperate from our drug world, so i won't be posting his contact details publicly, pm me for the info if you're interested, and please don't post it publicly.i'm not saying trust this guy with thousands of dollars, i'm saying i trusted him with a few hundred, and it worked out fine. proceed at your own risk. he also offers a fee free escrow service, but that is kind of a moot point if the trade is with him. i would trust him with more $ for my next trade, but proceed at your own risk.for what its worth, he seems like a pretty established btc trader, and i think his coins are freshly mined as well.

posted this to a reply in the shipping forum but it seemed to fit nicely here. would love to get a discussion going on this topic, thanks.its highly probable and somewhat documented, that a/all lettered agency/s are using all the information they can gather to make risk assesments on all people world wide. we all create fingerprints online. even when were offline, our fingerprints are still there...it is very difficult to mask them and we can rarely prevent them. they are made up of every single click, time between task (click, scroll, etc), words you type, how you type them and where you type them. imagine it like an event log of every little tedious detail to form a fingerprint. using that information lets them unmask you and reveal your "anonymous" self. people think creating different nyms (usernames) online and hiding behind each different one allows you to become a "new person". just like in real life, our fingerprints tell our true identity and theyve very hard to remove. they are moving towards a future where its rather hard to hide ones fingerprints (ipv6).that being said and if i was a gambling candy bar and one was to order "a foodsaver machine, foodsaver bags, baggies, rolling papers, smoking related products..etc on ebay and amazon" they are going to be labeled as a person who possibly saves weed for long term usage, highly likely smokes said weed, and isnt afraid to tie their legal name to such actions. your most definitely going to be put on a list. this person also isnt a very big threat because they dont seem like they are distributing said weed and are stupid enough to lead us to the trail. but thats only if they dont know your other fingerprints, which they most likely do...we all leave a trail, one way or another. the best thing we can do is try to deminish that trail. we can try our best but i feel if we keep going on the same train we currently are on, it doesnt look positive.some things a person can do to stretch the trail making to more difficult to track crumbs (metadata, fingerprints) is by using "anonymous" . why quote anonymous there? if said three letter agency really wanted to track those crumbs, they most definitely have the means, manpower and money to find those crumbs leading back to you. so a few key factors that most likely wont put you on their shit list are: do not tie your legit/legal name to illegal activities or things that invlolve illegal acitivies, do not open discuss those illegal activities with others (in real life and especially online, become the lurkness monster), and try your best to stay away from people that openly partake/discuss  illegal activities. if you feel like in the past you might fit one or all of these criteria, its sad to say, we have a shit list winner. the most successful vendors/buyers stay below the radar and dont want attention. hopefully the shitbarometer is broken and there wont be a shitpocalipse but only time will tell...

glad to see this being discussed. most of us walk around with a very powerful microphone....a cellphone. ga tech researchers were able to detect keystrokes based of vibrations from the accelerometer a few years ago. these are only in most modern, touch screen, phones. their originally used to detect the orientation of the phone to flip the screen automatically, orientation in gps and some games. this application of pickup vibrations is limited to when the phone is on the same surface as the keyboard. three letter agencies wouldnt sink much money into this but...this new application of using the microphone to decifer keystrokes is a huge step towards to supreme mass surveilance. they could theoretically sample all the keyboards in the world, which wouldnt be so far fetched since most brands feel(sound) very similar. they wouldnt even have to be exact with the words. most of you guys have seen taht eamil wehre letres dnot hvae to be in correct order to understand them. very negative development indeed. all phones pickup more sound than one hears via the speaker on phones. the more advanced phones seem to pickup a subtantial amount of sound from the microphones compared to older models. how many of you guys have a phone in a rather close proximity of your computer (cellphone or landline)? most people can test whether or not your celllphone are vulnerable to these types of surveilance. using a voice recording app thats available on most modern phones would be one way, or make a dummy phone call with another phone. building or buying a faraday enclosure (google it) for ones cell phone can make sure they arent able to monitor your keystrokes. unless they were amazing and able to record offline keystrokes as well. a person would have to be rather high on their shit list to receive that kind of treatment though...totally possible though. fun stuff!!

playground, the biggest difference between ccrypt and gpg is the way they handle plaintext files.  in particular, ccrypt encrypts files in-place whereas gpg does not. lets assume you are encrypting a text file, mytext.txt. if you encrypt that file with gpg, you will be left with the encrypted file mytext.gpg, as well as the original file, mytext.txt. in contrast, with ccrypt, the original file mytext.txt is transformed into mytext.txt,cpt -- the original file is overwritten; with gpg the original file is left intact. depending on your point of view, this may (or may not) be a good thing. from the point of view of file deletion/destruction, ccrypt has the advantage in this regard, as there is only one file to wipe, as opposed to two (the original and the encrypted file) with gpg. zaphod

welcome to evolutionour market has now been open since january, 2014. given the fact that we are new, our user base has grown exponentially over the past few months. according to the deep dot web (http://www.deepdotweb.com/), we are the 4th largest market on the darkweb. to me that says a lot, given the fact that evolution frst opened its doors a little over 3 months ago. what makes evolution so popular? i will explain to you why.the purpose of evolution is to provide a safe place to conduct sales with a full-functioning automatic escrow system. the operators of evolution are by no means new to onion markets. they have plenty of experience and knowledge with escrow markets. since they have been running an escrow market since june of 2012. the staff are very dedicated to making evolution one of the best darknet markets in existence by constantly adding new features and making the appropriate upgrades in order to make the market more reliable.the evolution philosophy is congruent with that of tors: free speech and anonymity. as long as subject is within appropriate boundaries and not explicit (i.e trolling, cp, murder), people are free to discuss their beliefs and market freely without any discrimination, judgement and/or hindrance by staff. staff do not act in any biased manner. there is no favoritism with vendors, and everyone is treated equally regardless of seniority. evolution will not even censor competitor market names or links. so you do not have to worry about typing in code when mentioning another site. we just believe users have to the right to discuss as they wish.evolutions community and forums is one the features that makes this market truly stand out. it is very active with user discussions about products, reviews, and general talk. i must admit, they are funny as hell everybody has fun =) even the staff are very active in the fourms not only with regulations, but also participate in general discussion as well. you will even notice the owners presence in the forums just about every day. they offer a true passion when it comes to customer service. contact and support issues are always replied to promptly and resolved immediately. especially the scam reports thread. this is someting that the staff take very seriously and act upon immediately. the staffs continual presence leaves a high moral with current members to the point that most non-staff members are always helping out others in a manner how staff would handle it.i want to wrap up by stating that this is truly a wonderful community to be a part of. feel free to ask me any questions or if you have any comments, i will gladly respond to you. thank you for taking the time to read my post. take care =)~boogie tl:dr - come check us out to see for yourselves =)market: k5zq47j6wd3wdvjq.onionforum:  http://i25c62nvu4cgeqyz.onion

on flash-based memory, either you have to hope the controller supports the ata secure erase command correctly (most do not), or you have to blank the entire thing with 0s. you cant run shred or anything like that on a flash system. this paper may prove interesting and speaks more to the subject:https://www.usenix.org/legacy/events/fast11/tech/full_papers/wei.pdfthis is why i would either encrypt the entire partition with the info because encrypted data should look just like normal random data, or use a program to encrypt it all before its on disk. if you really need to work on a document temporarily, you want to mount a partition on a loopback device in memory.

quote from: zaphod on april 29, 2014, 02:52:59 pmplayground, the biggest difference between ccrypt and gpg is the way they handle plaintext files.  in particular, ccrypt encrypts files in-place whereas gpg does not. lets assume you are encrypting a text file, mytext.txt. if you encrypt that file with gpg, you will be left with the encrypted file mytext.gpg, as well as the original file, mytext.txt. in contrast, with ccrypt, the original file mytext.txt is transformed into mytext.txt,cpt -- the original file is overwritten; with gpg the original file is left intact. depending on your point of view, this may (or may not) be a good thing. from the point of view of file deletion/destruction, ccrypt has the advantage in this regard, as there is only one file to wipe, as opposed to two (the original and the encrypted file) with gpg. zaphodhi zaphod,yes.. youre right. ccrypt definitely has it virtues.have a nice day .. and be happyplayground :-)
there is literally zero reason to re-invent the wheel here and many reasons not to. use gpg for files or truecrypt for volumes.
i followed the instructions to install electrum in persistens here and want to add bitmessage so persistent config. is "hacked". i would like to clone everything as it is on the "optimized" stick without installing everything again.are the commands that can handle this?

are there any bitcoin exchanges which you can register on and sell your bitcoin for us dollars or euros and hold the money on the site. then buy bitcoin at a later stage and withdraw the bitcoin. but do this without linking a bank account. maybe no id aswell (though, id could be faked i guess).i would like to do this as a way of hedging small amounts of bitcoin for short periods between times i can cash out. so lets say i have 2 bitcoins worth us $900 i could sell them and hold the us $900 on the site. then i could buy bitcoins for us $900. clean the coins and then sell them with my real bank account or cash.i posted this in security as a way of securitying the money i have vested in bitcoins. basically selling the bitcoins at market value straight away as a means of hedging them against the dollar or euro until its suitable for me to effectively move and clean them to my real account or sell them for cash in person. and also forfeit any loses (or gains) that bitcoin fluctuations that may occur.also, are there any services that can provide fake credentials or accounts that i could use for this? or anything relevant to hedging the value of bitcoin for short periods of time?

during my years on tor, i have seen countless scam attempts and many sad faces of those who were ripped off. lets face it. here in the deep web, scammers will always exist, plain and simple. no matter how hard we all try to bust them down, their presence will always remain. you will find them on forums, their own websites, and throughout all major and established dark markets. now that we all have accepted this sad issue, lets discuss the many methods to help prevent you from falling into this trap.first and foremost, the number one rule when doing business on the deep web is to always trust your instinct. im sure all of you heard this old saying before: if its too good to be true, it probably is. i know its very cliche, but it still holds a lot of merit. most scam victims fail to follow this quote and go with their impulses instead. they see a product or deal at a astounding price, that they dont think of anything else but having the items in their hands. its like being hypnotized in a sense. dont worry, im not talking down on anyone. its human nature to follow with impulses. just remember that next time you see an amazing deal, think it through and see if this can be realistic.now that we covered the golden rule. im now going to discuss the different types of scam methods that are present thought the deep web. please post if i left anything out or if you have any questions or comments.the hidden wiki (thw)thw is probably one of the oldest sites still in existance on tor. it is more then likely one of the first sites many people new to tor visit. it can be quite an amazing discovery seeing all the differnt businesses selling drugs, weapons, fraud items, stolen electronics, etc. for a lack of words, its really awesome to see that you now have access to pretty much anything you want when you didnt prior to setting up tor.now the problem here is that thw can be moderated by pretty much anyone who has registered an account. some of the nefarious hidden wiki staff are very aware of the many new comers to th deep web. this is why it is safe to that just about every commercial site on thw are scams. plan and simple. even legitimate and well known markets featured on thw are more then likely phishing sites set up to steal your account information.long story short, avoid the hidden wiki when searching for market links.example of phishing site for sr 2.0 (do not login!): http://e5wvymnx6bx5euvy.onion/ -best way to tell is that the url is obviously the wrong one.if you need a link to a market site, visit the subreddit darknetmarkets (http://www.reddit.com/r/darknetmarkets/) or the deep dot web (http://www.deepdotweb.com/). these sites provide legitimate market links that are never altered. if anyone knows of any other sites new comers can use to find legit links, please toss them up.non-market commercial sitesjust like the ones listed on thw, pretty much all of the small sites that sell products and services are all pretty much scams. the only exception are sites that operated by established market vendors who are well-recognized and can be verified with their pgp. if anyone needs help verifying someones pgp, you are more then welcome to message me and ill be glad to help. plus, there are a few sites that catalog vendor pgps and offer verification as well. ill show you some examples of sites and how to tell the are rippers.green notes counter: http://67yjqewxrd2ewbtp.onion/here is a site that sells counterfeit coins. sadly they do not accept escrow and give the typical scammer reason that they do not trust escrow sites. but for some ill-logic reason, its okay to trust them. lol -yeah right.double your btc: http://jmkxdr4djc3cpsei.onion/here is a site that "promises" to return to you the double amount of btc you send them. lets think about this, who on earth will give you free money? no one thats who. if they have such a wonderful method on doubling bitcoin, then why would they share it and not just keep it themselves to get rich? well, actually they do have a method for getting rich, its by stealing others coin.carders paradise: http://cardsv4kovqmjr37.onion/oh wow! a site that sells cloned debit cards with a pin# so that you can just easily walk to any atm and cash it out. just like with the double your btc service, who in their right mind would give away free money? why couldnt they just keep the cards and cash them out themselves? these are the question you have to ask and the true simple answer is that they dont have any cards. they just want your coin and bolt.peoples drug store: http://newpdsuslmzqazvr.onion/just another rip-off site that offers no escrow protection and just wants steal from you. same with the other mentioned sites, they state that once payment is received, they will mail you the shipping information. i hate to say it but you will be waiting a long time for that info. important: keep and eye out with other sites using the same format. they are hosted by a pseudo-organization called torshops. avoid all of their sites at all costs!iphones for 50%: http://iphoneavzhwkqmap.onion/im just gonna say it, all of these electronic stores are scams. never have i seen a legit ones. either they feed you a line of shit on why they dont escrow and there are ones that offer a fake "escrow" service. the sites with "escrow accepted" will usually send you a link to a site you probably never heard of and ask you do depoist money and simply release it when you get your item. sadly, the electronic site most likely owns that escrow site and will just take the btc and avoid your emails.i wont go into a lot of detail but the self-operated sites that sell guns and offer hitman services. they are all scams plain and simple. the solution is to just stick to the established markets and use their escrow system. remember, escrow is the main line of defense that protects you from losing your coin. always use it.scammers on commercial marketsthis section will cover how to spot and deal with rippers that use established markets to host their scam. some of them demand fe on everything, others will appear to have outstanding feedback, and there are even some that offer escrow too. crazy, i know. so here are the ways to spot them and some tactics they use to steal your coins.the first and easy ones to spot are the brand new vendors to a site with no reputation and off the bat request fe. they either sell a great variety of different products (red flag) at great price hoping to grab as many customers as possible. or, they have a few big and expensive products and wait until someone takes the bait. when you spot these people, question them on why they dont accept escrow. the most common replies scammers give are "they dont trust escrow" or "btc is too unpredictable". whatever excuse they give you, just walk away. i know, thats a killer deal they offer, but wouldnt you rather be at peace of mind? there are plenty of legit vendors that accept escrow. dont risk it and go with them. i forgot to mention, always check their feedback and the forums to find any reviews the vendor may have. this will give you better assurance whether or not to deal with the vendor.a lot of the time. you will find scammers with amazing feedback. how could this be? well, they use the tactic called feedback stacking. this is when a scammer registers numerous buyer accounts and buy from themselves and leave amazing feedback. here is what to look for when spotting padded feedback: numerous complete orders on the same day, price is extremely low or item was deleted, same username or same comments are used over and over again.example: if you have pandora, login and check out this sellers profile (note: this is not an attack on pandora, it was just an example i found. these are found on every market. sorry pandora)http://pandorajodqp5zrr.onion/profile/c9b9f96216d1eb17ab9b88348bbb5d05scroll all the way down and look at the feedback (long way down. sellers way of hiding it). loot at that. this is probably the most obvious padded feedback ever seen. some are more clever then that, but they always slip up by showing a pattern. youll notice it when you come across it.when you order from a vendor and the item is in escrow, make sure you note the shipping time. a lot of rippers will set a short shipping time hoping that you wont notice so that the order will auto-finalize. just remember when funds are released whether after feing or the order auto-finalized, the first thing that vendor will do is quickly withdraw the coin to their wallet. it is now out of the staffs hands to recover your money.one final note, be careful when posting in the wanted or buyer request section of a markets forum. this is where a lot of rip offs occur. you may get plenty of pms from people who arent even a vendor saying they can help you out. just remember to tell them hell no and wait for a verified vendor to reply. because you know whats gonna if you decide to follow through with that pm offer.well this is what i got so far. pretty long-winded i know. please feel free to ask question or toss in any extra info i forgot to discuss. stay safe out there everyone and remember that golden rule: if its too good to be true, it probably is =)

localbitcions is a great route to go. load up a moneypak or vanilla card. look for a trade. and you usually get your coin in 10-15 mins. just about as quick as depositing cash in their bank account. sellers usually want a ridiculous percentage for the moneypak. but hell, its quick. sellers who accept wu are pretty light on the %.second route., become a vender. then you wont have to worry about buying btc again. you just have to worry about selling it

why couldnt they just keep the cards and cash them out themselves? these are the question you have to ask and the true simple answer is that they dont have any cards. they just want your coin and bolt.peoples drug store: http://newpdsuslmzqazvr.onion/just another rip-off site that offers no escrow protection and just wants steal from you. same with the other mentioned sites, they state that once payment is received, they will mail you the shipping information. i hate to say it but you will be waiting a long time for that info. important: keep and eye out with other sites using the same format. they are hosted by a pseudo-organization called torshops. avoid all of their sites at all costs!iphones for 50%: http://iphoneavzhwkqmap.onion/im just gonna say it, all of these electronic stores are scams. never have i seen a legit ones. either they feed you a line of shit on why they dont escrow and there are ones that offer a fake "escrow" service. the sites with "escrow accepted" will usually send you a link to a site you probably never heard of and ask you do depoist money and simply release it when you get your item. sadly, the electronic site most likely owns that escrow site and will just take the btc and avoid your emails.i wont go into a lot of detail but the self-operated sites that sell guns and offer hitman services. they are all scams plain and simple. the solution is to just stick to the established markets and use their escrow system. remember, escrow is the main line of defense that protects you from losing your coin. always use it.scammers on commercial marketsthis section will cover how to spot and deal with rippers that use established markets to host their scam. some of them demand fe on everything, others will appear to have outstanding feedback, and there are even some that offer escrow too. crazy, i know. so here are the ways to spot them and some tactics they use to steal your coins.the first and easy ones to spot are the brand new vendors to a site with no reputation and off the bat request fe. they either sell a great variety of different products (red flag) at great price hoping to grab as many customers as possible. or, they have a few big and expensive products and wait until someone takes the bait. when you spot these people, question them on why they dont accept escrow. the most common replies scammers give are "they dont trust escrow" or "btc is too unpredictable". whatever excuse they give you, just walk away. i know, thats a killer deal they offer, but wouldnt you rather be at peace of mind? there are plenty of legit vendors that accept escrow. dont risk it and go with them. i forgot to mention, always check their feedback and the forums to find any reviews the vendor may have. this will give you better assurance whether or not to deal with the vendor.a lot of the time. you will find scammers with amazing feedback. how could this be? well, they use the tactic called feedback stacking. this is when a scammer registers numerous buyer accounts and buy from themselves and leave amazing feedback. here is what to look for when spotting padded feedback: numerous complete orders on the same day, price is extremely low or item was deleted, same username or same comments are used over and over again.example: if you have pandora, login and check out this sellers profile (note: this is not an attack on pandora, it was just an example i found. these are found on every market. sorry pandora)http://pandorajodqp5zrr.onion/profile/c9b9f96216d1eb17ab9b88348bbb5d05scroll all the way down and look at the feedback (long way down. sellers way of hiding it). loot at that. this is probably the most obvious padded feedback ever seen. some are more clever then that, but they always slip up by showing a pattern. youll notice it when you come across it.when you order from a vendor and the item is in escrow, make sure you note the shipping time. a lot of rippers will set a short shipping time hoping that you wont notice so that the order will auto-finalize. just remember when funds are released whether after feing or the order auto-finalized, the first thing that vendor will do is quickly withdraw the coin to their wallet. it is now out of the staffs hands to recover your money.one final note, be careful when posting in the wanted or buyer request section of a markets forum. this is where a lot of rip offs occur. you may get plenty of pms from people who arent even a vendor saying they can help you out. just remember to tell them hell no and wait for a verified vendor to reply. because you know whats gonna if you decide to follow through with that pm offer.well this is what i got so far. pretty long-winded i know. please feel free to ask question or toss in any extra info i forgot to discuss. stay safe out there everyone and remember that golden rule: if its too good to be true, it probably is =)

ill be damn. thanks for the warning.sorry that you had to take a loss with campbx (hope it wasnt too much). but you still did a good thing by warning the rest of the community. appreciate it bud.
localbitcions is a great route to go. load up a moneypak or vanilla card. look for a trade. and you usually get your coin in 10-15 mins. just about as quick as depositing cash in their bank account. sellers usually want a ridiculous percentage for the moneypak. but hell, its quick. sellers who accept wu are pretty light on the %.second route., become a vender. then you wont have to worry about buying btc again. you just have to worry about selling it
geat info to know. you can always order the polish iban cards that keep you anonymous. its always good to know other alternatives all well.ive been searching for some u.s ready debit cards that are anonymous. the closest thing i could find is the target amex card and the readydebit. they still require information (up to ssn), but you can use someone elses. well, its not considered fraud if youre just borrowing it and cashing out your own money, right? another site ive been researching on my downtime is this one: http://perfectpay.euyou can get a free online bank account and get a reloadable vcc to spend your money. they even accept bitcoin. you can put any fake information you want when registering and they never verify it. they actually support anonymity. in other words, they are shady as fuck, lol. i cannot vouch for them just yet then i havent tested the vcc. but they will give you one free with $0 balance if you ever need a cc number to verify an account  ill keep yall posted if interested.anywho, thats all i have for now. thanks again for the info.

during my years on tor, i have seen countless scam attempts and many sad faces of those who were ripped off. lets face it. here in the deep web, scammers will always exist, plain and simple. no matter how hard we all try to bust them down, their presence will always remain. you will find them on forums, their own websites, and throughout all major and established dark markets. now that we all have accepted this sad issue, lets discuss the many methods to help prevent you from falling into this trap.first and foremost, the number one rule when doing business on the deep web is to always trust your instinct. im sure all of you heard this old saying before: if its too good to be true, it probably is. i know its very cliche, but it still holds a lot of merit. most scam victims fail to follow this quote and go with their impulses instead. they see a product or deal at a astounding price, that they dont think of anything else but having the items in their hands. its like being hypnotized in a sense. dont worry, im not talking down on anyone. its human nature to follow with impulses. just remember that next time you see an amazing deal, think it through and see if this can be realistic.now that we covered the golden rule. im now going to discuss the different types of scam methods that are present thought the deep web. please post if i left anything out or if you have any questions or comments.the hidden wiki (thw)thw is probably one of the oldest sites still in existance on tor. it is more then likely one of the first sites many people new to tor visit. it can be quite an amazing discovery seeing all the differnt businesses selling drugs, weapons, fraud items, stolen electronics, etc. for a lack of words, its really awesome to see that you now have access to pretty much anything you want when you didnt prior to setting up tor.now the problem here is that thw can be moderated by pretty much anyone who has registered an account. some of the nefarious hidden wiki staff are very aware of the many new comers to th deep web. this is why it is safe to that just about every commercial site on thw are scams. plan and simple. even legitimate and well known markets featured on thw are more then likely phishing sites set up to steal your account information.long story short, avoid the hidden wiki when searching for market links.example of phishing site for sr 2.0 (do not login!): http://e5wvymnx6bx5euvy.onion/ -best way to tell is that the url is obviously the wrong one.if you need a link to a market site, visit the subreddit darknetmarkets (http://www.reddit.com/r/darknetmarkets/) or the deep dot web (http://www.deepdotweb.com/). these sites provide legitimate market links that are never altered. if anyone knows of any other sites new comers can use to find legit links, please toss them up.non-market commercial sitesjust like the ones listed on thw, pretty much all of the small sites that sell products and services are all pretty much scams. the only exception are sites that operated by established market vendors who are well-recognized and can be verified with their pgp. if anyone needs help verifying someones pgp, you are more then welcome to message me and ill be glad to help. plus, there are a few sites that catalog vendor pgps and offer verification as well. ill show you some examples of sites and how to tell the are rippers.green notes counter: http://67yjqewxrd2ewbtp.onion/here is a site that sells counterfeit coins. sadly they do not accept escrow and give the typical scammer reason that they do not trust escrow sites. but for some ill-logic reason, its okay to trust them. lol -yeah right.double your btc: http://jmkxdr4djc3cpsei.onion/here is a site that "promises" to return to you the double amount of btc you send them. lets think about this, who on earth will give you free money? no one thats who. if they have such a wonderful method on doubling bitcoin, then why would they share it and not just keep it themselves to get rich? well, actually they do have a method for getting rich, its by stealing others coin.carders paradise: http://cardsv4kovqmjr37.onion/oh wow! a site that sells cloned debit cards with a pin# so that you can just easily walk to any atm and cash it out. just like with the double your btc service, who in their right mind would give away free money? why couldnt they just keep the cards and cash them out themselves? these are the question you have to ask and the true simple answer is that they dont have any cards. they just want your coin and bolt.peoples drug store: http://newpdsuslmzqazvr.onion/just another rip-off site that offers no escrow protection and just wants steal from you. same with the other mentioned sites, they state that once payment is received, they will mail you the shipping information. i hate to say it but you will be waiting a long time for that info. important: keep and eye out with other sites using the same format. they are hosted by a pseudo-organization called torshops. avoid all of their sites at all costs!iphones for 50%: http://iphoneavzhwkqmap.onion/im just gonna say it, all of these electronic stores are scams. never have i seen a legit ones. either they feed you a line of shit on why they dont escrow and there are ones that offer a fake "escrow" service. the sites with "escrow accepted" will usually send you a link to a site you probably never heard of and ask you do depoist money and simply release it when you get your item. sadly, the electronic site most likely owns that escrow site and will just take the btc and avoid your emails.i wont go into a lot of detail but the self-operated sites that sell guns and offer hitman services. they are all scams plain and simple. the solution is to just stick to the established markets and use their escrow system. remember, escrow is the main line of defense that protects you from losing your coin. always use it.scammers on commercial marketsthis section will cover how to spot and deal with rippers that use established markets to host their scam. some of them demand fe on everything, others will appear to have outstanding feedback, and there are even some that offer escrow too. crazy, i know. so here are the ways to spot them and some tactics they use to steal your coins.the first and easy ones to spot are the brand new vendors to a site with no reputation and off the bat request fe. they either sell a great variety of different products (red flag) at great price hoping to grab as many customers as possible. or, they have a few big and expensive products and wait until someone takes the bait. when you spot these people, question them on why they dont accept escrow. the most common replies scammers give are "they dont trust escrow" or "btc is too unpredictable". whatever excuse they give you, just walk away. i know, thats a killer deal they offer, but wouldnt you rather be at peace of mind?

format wont delete data no matter usb or whatever
quote from: owockeznan on april 30, 2014, 01:22:47 amon flash-based memory, either you have to hope the controller supports the ata secure erase command correctly (most do not), or you have to blank the entire thing with 0s. you cant run shred or anything like that on a flash system. this paper may prove interesting and speaks more to the subject:https://www.usenix.org/legacy/events/fast11/tech/full_papers/wei.pdfthis is why i would either encrypt the entire partition with the info because encrypted data should look just like normal random data, or use a program to encrypt it all before its on disk. if you really need to work on a document temporarily, you want to mount a partition on a loopback device in memory.hi owock,+1  thanks for posting the wei.pdf article. :-)youve lead me on a very productive path.from what i can gather there is _no_way_ to  wipe, or shred, a _single_ file held on a usb flash drive.  the original deleted file remains on the medium.  you cant see it because its not listed, but it remains in situand unless the usb drive is very full, probably _in_tact_ too.there are lots of tools out there that take advantage of this fact by allowing you to recover deleted files from flash drives.  eg, here are two (free) ones that i tried:1. recuva from:  http://www.piriform.com/recuva2. 4cardrecovery from:http://blog4mark.blogspot.ch/2012/12/deleted-files-recovery.htmlrecuva is okay.  it has a nice interface... but it only seems to show you recently created/deleted files.4cardrecovery is really excellent, much better than recuva.  it performs a seemingly exhaustive scan.what did i do ?i have a usb key that i been preparing to receive gpg4usb. some days ago i emptied the usb key by copying its content to another drive and deleting each file... i then cleaned the usb by putting two partitions on it and formatting them individually.one with fat32, the other with ext2.when i ran 4cardrecovery on the ostensibly clean fat32 partitioni was shocked by the number of files, of all types, that it found there.  there were mp4 and mp3 files.  the videos playedperfectly, as did the mp3 files i tested.. completely uncorrupted.some of those files must have been there for over 12 months.  they have survived deletion and disc partitioning and disc formatting. i also found decrypted and raw messages that i recently deletedafter testing the command line gpg.exe app. that ships with gpg4usb.having played with the 4cardrecovery program, its crystal clearto me now that files are not actually deleted from a usb key, theyre simply removed from the directory listing... nothing more.presumably, when leo confiscates your phone/laptop/computer/usb keyand inspects the media for evidence, they use some program like4cardrecovery to see a history of virtually everything you havebeen doing. i did some further tests by encrypting and compressing my gpg4usband secret encryption messages using 7zip... and deleting the originals.now you might imagine this process of compressing and encrypting yoursecret messages would be a nice stealthy way of hiding any incriminating evidence. ... err.. no.the original secret messages are still there, in their pristine encrypted and decrypted formats.   when you create the 7z file, you simply add a newfile to the total files held on the medium... nothing is erased.every time you use your usb key, youre simply accumulating a historyof your activities on the usb drive.this is important, because several usb keys ship within encryption software,the so-called encryption vaults.  youre invited to believe that storingfiles in this vault will keep them safe from prying eyes.complete bullshine! .. as my father would say.if you store a file on your usb drive, and then run the encryption vaultthe software will encrypt it and delete the original, thats true. but theoriginal isnt deleted.  its effectively doing the same thing that i didwith my 7zip encryption and compression experiment mentioned above.presumably it is in recognition of this that some prefer to use wholedrive encryption.  however, even here, on a usb stick, a steady historyof your activities accumulates on the usb drive.  if you decrypt the disk,you will presumably find data images of all the files youve previously deleted (just as occurs in the unencrypted usb drive scenario).the only apparent solution to this history of activity problem seems to be to sanitize the entire usb drive.  but that seems a little excessive.i suppose the simplest solution would be to never use the usb drive for message storage.  use it only for application execution.perhaps you could set the permissions on the usb drive to read and execute (but not write) everywhere, except the directoryin which your pubring, secring & gpg.conf files reside.so you run the encryption software off the usb drive.but you keep the encryption messages on the host machine.when youre done, you encrypt up all the data you want to take withyou and copy it to the usb drive (same folder as pubring/secring/gpg.conf).  you then should use something like wipe or shred on the files you want to delete in your working directory on the host machine.the big lesson for me from all this is to no longer rely on"rm -rf file.txt"  or "del file.txt" commands to delete files(whether on regular magnetic discs or on usb drives).i now understand the need to shred/wipe/sdelete them.perhaps aliasing the rm command would be a good idea.ive just been reading that on windows you can use sdelete (which comes with the sys-internals package)if anyone knows of other good windows utilities... feel free to mention it :-)have a nice day ....  and be happy.playground. :-)thanks again owock :-)

.. as my father would say.if you store a file on your usb drive, and then run the encryption vaultthe software will encrypt it and delete the original, thats true. but theoriginal isnt deleted.  its effectively doing the same thing that i didwith my 7zip encryption and compression experiment mentioned above.presumably it is in recognition of this that some prefer to use wholedrive encryption.  however, even here, on a usb stick, a steady historyof your activities accumulates on the usb drive.  if you decrypt the disk,you will presumably find data images of all the files youve previously deleted (just as occurs in the unencrypted usb drive scenario).the only apparent solution to this history of activity problem seems to be to sanitize the entire usb drive.  but that seems a little excessive.i suppose the simplest solution would be to never use the usb drive for message storage.  use it only for application execution.perhaps you could set the permissions on the usb drive to read and execute (but not write) everywhere, except the directoryin which your pubring, secring & gpg.conf files reside.so you run the encryption software off the usb drive.but you keep the encryption messages on the host machine.when youre done, you encrypt up all the data you want to take withyou and copy it to the usb drive (same folder as pubring/secring/gpg.conf).  you then should use something like wipe or shred on the files you want to delete in your working directory on the host machine.the big lesson for me from all this is to no longer rely on"rm -rf file.txt"  or "del file.txt" commands to delete files(whether on regular magnetic discs or on usb drives).i now understand the need to shred/wipe/sdelete them.perhaps aliasing the rm command would be a good idea.ive just been reading that on windows you can use sdelete (which comes with the sys-internals package)if anyone knows of other good windows utilities... feel free to mention it :-)have a nice day ....  and be happy.playground. :-)thanks again owock :-)

whoops i forgot to mention some ways to catch scammers by their pictures.here are two awesome sites to use at your disposal. google (yes, google): http://www.google.com/imghp - this can be used for reverse image searching. i have caught tons of scammers this way. copy their posting  and upload the picture. you will find where they stole the image they are claiming is their product.foto forensics: http://fotoforensics.com/ - scans the metadata and does a error level analysis. perfect for finding out if they photo shopped that piece of paper with their signature and date on it. hilarious when you see their reaction when you call them out on it ill post more when i think of them.ps: sorry fo the shitty grammar in the op. its not my forte

wonderful tip-offs as usual :)
part 2: vendor protection against scam attemptsbeing a vendor myself, i can fully understand and sympathize for all the hard work and business management they must go through. albeit these instances are less common, they still do happen and pretty much any vendor whose been in the game long is more than likely to have any of the following occur.buyer disputes order stating that it is not what they expected or item did not arrive even though it didas i stated, there are far more awesome and honest buyers than bad apples. but sadly, it does happen mainly with either low lifes, or kids thinking they can pull a fast one. i cannot stress this enough, when creating a new listing be sure to give as much detail as possible. this will prevent any confusion and if a dispute occurs, you can refer the buyer and staff telling them that sold product is in accordance with the description. plus, when you have 50 customers before them saying they were satisfied with the item received, you will have much higher chances winning a dispute.when a buyer claim the package is a no-show, make sure you do either of the following to prevent this. place tracking on all of your items that you ship. for security, try not to give it out unless it is necessary. this is great proof to show staff that you did indeed ship out the item. if you do not use tracking, make sure it is known in your profile that this is the case and you cannot give refunds on lost packages. it would be to the buyers discretion whether or not to order.buyer threatens to leave negative feedback unless given a refundive actually had this happen to me. this was a plain and simple case that he was looking for free stuff and wanted to be an ass and go this route. it really frustrated me because i was very nice and polite to the dude and he decided to pull this shit on me. well, i handled it in a professional manner and backed off. this is what i did and what you can do too in this situation. i basically called his bluff. i explained to him that i have 40+ customers before him (which is true) buy the same product and every single one of them was completely satisfied. given that information, i told him that i wasnt going to give him a refund, and to go ahead and leave the negative feedback if you wish. if he had left the negative feedback, i wouldve retorted that this customer was just a troll looking for free stuff, and given my positive track record with this item i did not feel a refund with in order. he never did leave the feedback and released the escrow, which im happy  also, depending on your market, staff will remove negative feedback if it was unjustified. just report to staff and see what they say.i actually know a vendor who was in the same situation. he actually refunded the buyer and the asshole buyer still left negative feedback. man, did that vendor throw a fit. thankfully the staff took care of it.competitor attacksoccasionally, who will have a unethical and disgruntled vendor that is jealous of your booming business and wants to do something to sabotage it. a lot of the times they will make multiple buyer accounts, buy the cheapest product you sell, and then turn around and either call you a scammer or the product and service was bad. if you are a victim of this, report it to the staff and your customers as soon as possible. let them all know about the situation and given your track record, they will be understanding. most customers can determine if you have either a troll or competitor attacking you and will not think bad of you with the given false feedback. often staff will recognize the attack and ban the shill accounts and remove the feedback. its sad to see vendors sink that low to do such an attack.trolls/disgruntled customersoften times you will come across these when when discussing products and prices about your product. what generally happens is that youll get a buyer that is not happy with your price and then offers some low-ball figure, or you can have buyers that want a freebie tossed their way. you tell them no and the price stands as is. most are understanding of this, while you do have some that act like children and throw a temper tantrum because they cannot get their way. they end up going to the forums and posting false statements calling you a scammer and that your service is terrible, blah, blah, blah. to handle this, just politely and professionally explain the situation that you never even done business with this clown and how on earth could you be a scammer when no coin was exchanged? also explain that their behavior is ridiculous and just wanted something cheap or free. then everybody will realize what an ass this buyer just made of themselves and will easily join your side on this situation.well thats all i have for right now. if any vendor would like to add on and share any of their experiences, i would love to hear them. thanks for reading and stay safe everybody

im sure you are right anarcho that there are some scams there.  the fact that they offer escrow makes it much more attractive to me as a buyer.  thats how i read the ops post.  not that there are no scams over there, but that your coins are safer in escrow.  i tend to believe that is correct.  the buyer is safer if there is escrow.
wonderful tip-offs as usual :)
part 2: vendor protection against scam attemptsbeing a vendor myself, i can fully understand and sympathize for all the hard work and business management they must go through. albeit these instances are less common, they still do happen and pretty much any vendor whose been in the game long is more than likely to have any of the following occur.buyer disputes order stating that it is not what they expected or item did not arrive even though it didas i stated, there are far more awesome and honest buyers than bad apples. but sadly, it does happen mainly with either low lifes, or kids thinking they can pull a fast one. i cannot stress this enough, when creating a new listing be sure to give as much detail as possible. this will prevent any confusion and if a dispute occurs, you can refer the buyer and staff telling them that sold product is in accordance with the description. plus, when you have 50 customers before them saying they were satisfied with the item received, you will have much higher chances winning a dispute.when a buyer claim the package is a no-show, make sure you do either of the following to prevent this. place tracking on all of your items that you ship. for security, try not to give it out unless it is necessary. this is great proof to show staff that you did indeed ship out the item. if you do not use tracking, make sure it is known in your profile that this is the case and you cannot give refunds on lost packages. it would be to the buyers discretion whether or not to order.buyer threatens to leave negative feedback unless given a refundive actually had this happen to me. this was a plain and simple case that he was looking for free stuff and wanted to be an ass and go this route. it really frustrated me because i was very nice and polite to the dude and he decided to pull this shit on me. well, i handled it in a professional manner and backed off. this is what i did and what you can do too in this situation. i basically called his bluff. i explained to him that i have 40+ customers before him (which is true) buy the same product and every single one of them was completely satisfied. given that information, i told him that i wasnt going to give him a refund, and to go ahead and leave the negative feedback if you wish. if he had left the negative feedback, i wouldve retorted that this customer was just a troll looking for free stuff, and given my positive track record with this item i did not feel a refund with in order. he never did leave the feedback and released the escrow, which im happy  also, depending on your market, staff will remove negative feedback if it was unjustified. just report to staff and see what they say.i actually know a vendor who was in the same situation. he actually refunded the buyer and the asshole buyer still left negative feedback. man, did that vendor throw a fit. thankfully the staff took care of it.competitor attacksoccasionally, who will have a unethical and disgruntled vendor that is jealous of your booming business and wants to do something to sabotage it. a lot of the times they will make multiple buyer accounts, buy the cheapest product you sell, and then turn around and either call you a scammer or the product and service was bad. if you are a victim of this, report it to the staff and your customers as soon as possible. let them all know about the situation and given your track record, they will be understanding. most customers can determine if you have either a troll or competitor attacking you and will not think bad of you with the given false feedback. often staff will recognize the attack and ban the shill accounts and remove the feedback. its sad to see vendors sink that low to do such an attack.trolls/disgruntled customersoften times you will come across these when when discussing products and prices about your product. what generally happens is that youll get a buyer that is not happy with your price and then offers some low-ball figure, or you can have buyers that want a freebie tossed their way. you tell them no and the price stands as is. most are understanding of this, while you do have some that act like children and throw a temper tantrum because they cannot get their way. they end up going to the forums and posting false statements calling you a scammer and that your service is terrible, blah, blah, blah. to handle this, just politely and professionally explain the situation that you never even done business with this clown and how on earth could you be a scammer when no coin was exchanged? also explain that their behavior is ridiculous and just wanted something cheap or free. then everybody will realize what an ass this buyer just made of themselves and will easily join your side on this situation.well thats all i have for right now. if any vendor would like to add on and share any of their experiences, i would love to hear them. thanks for reading and stay safe everybody

so has there been no scams, rogue vendors at blue market? we are impartial at the hub and you are suggesting by your post that no one has been scammed there when i happen to know they have!
could not have said it better myself wetdog. everyday i read of another customer scammed on sr. i have been around as a buyer since sr1 and just decided recently to vend because i want to see this community thrive again, especially the us market. there will be growing pains but as all the bad vendors fall and sites the good ones will remain.

part 2: vendor protection against scam attemptsbeing a vendor myself, i can fully understand and sympathize for all the hard work and business management they must go through. albeit these instances are less common, they still do happen and pretty much any vendor whose been in the game long is more than likely to have any of the following occur.buyer disputes order stating that it is not what they expected or item did not arrive even though it didas i stated, there are far more awesome and honest buyers than bad apples. but sadly, it does happen mainly with either low lifes, or kids thinking they can pull a fast one. i cannot stress this enough, when creating a new listing be sure to give as much detail as possible. this will prevent any confusion and if a dispute occurs, you can refer the buyer and staff telling them that sold product is in accordance with the description. plus, when you have 50 customers before them saying they were satisfied with the item received, you will have much higher chances winning a dispute.when a buyer claim the package is a no-show, make sure you do either of the following to prevent this. place tracking on all of your items that you ship. for security, try not to give it out unless it is necessary. this is great proof to show staff that you did indeed ship out the item. if you do not use tracking, make sure it is known in your profile that this is the case and you cannot give refunds on lost packages. it would be to the buyers discretion whether or not to order.buyer threatens to leave negative feedback unless given a refundive actually had this happen to me. this was a plain and simple case that he was looking for free stuff and wanted to be an ass and go this route. it really frustrated me because i was very nice and polite to the dude and he decided to pull this shit on me. well, i handled it in a professional manner and backed off. this is what i did and what you can do too in this situation. i basically called his bluff. i explained to him that i have 40+ customers before him (which is true) buy the same product and every single one of them was completely satisfied. given that information, i told him that i wasnt going to give him a refund, and to go ahead and leave the negative feedback if you wish. if he had left the negative feedback, i wouldve retorted that this customer was just a troll looking for free stuff, and given my positive track record with this item i did not feel a refund with in order. he never did leave the feedback and released the escrow, which im happy  also, depending on your market, staff will remove negative feedback if it was unjustified. just report to staff and see what they say.i actually know a vendor who was in the same situation. he actually refunded the buyer and the asshole buyer still left negative feedback. man, did that vendor throw a fit. thankfully the staff took care of it.competitor attacksoccasionally, who will have a unethical and disgruntled vendor that is jealous of your booming business and wants to do something to sabotage it. a lot of the times they will make multiple buyer accounts, buy the cheapest product you sell, and then turn around and either call you a scammer or the product and service was bad. if you are a victim of this, report it to the staff and your customers as soon as possible. let them all know about the situation and given your track record, they will be understanding. most customers can determine if you have either a troll or competitor attacking you and will not think bad of you with the given false feedback. often staff will recognize the attack and ban the shill accounts and remove the feedback. its sad to see vendors sink that low to do such an attack.trolls/disgruntled customersoften times you will come across these when when discussing products and prices about your product. what generally happens is that youll get a buyer that is not happy with your price and then offers some low-ball figure, or you can have buyers that want a freebie tossed their way. you tell them no and the price stands as is. most are understanding of this, while you do have some that act like children and throw a temper tantrum because they cannot get their way. they end up going to the forums and posting false statements calling you a scammer and that your service is terrible, blah, blah, blah. to handle this, just politely and professionally explain the situation that you never even done business with this clown and how on earth could you be a scammer when no coin was exchanged? also explain that their behavior is ridiculous and just wanted something cheap or free. then everybody will realize what an ass this buyer just made of themselves and will easily join your side on this situation.well thats all i have for right now. if any vendor would like to add on and share any of their experiences, i would love to hear them. thanks for reading and stay safe everybody

im sure you are right anarcho that there are some scams there.  the fact that they offer escrow makes it much more attractive to me as a buyer.  thats how i read the ops post.  not that there are no scams over there, but that your coins are safer in escrow.  i tend to believe that is correct.  the buyer is safer if there is escrow.

im sure you are right anarcho that there are some scams there.  the fact that they offer escrow makes it much more attractive to me as a buyer.  thats how i read the ops post.  not that there are no scams over there, but that your coins are safer in escrow.  i tend to believe that is correct.  the buyer is safer if there is escrow.
so has there been no scams, rogue vendors at blue market? we are impartial at the hub and you are suggesting by your post that no one has been scammed there when i happen to know they have!
could not have said it better myself wetdog. everyday i read of another customer scammed on sr. i have been around as a buyer since sr1 and just decided recently to vend because i want to see this community thrive again, especially the us market. there will be growing pains but as all the bad vendors fall and sites the good ones will remain.

no support and hence no refunds on pandora.  admins are now deleting posts of complainers in the forums.

im sure you are right anarcho that there are some scams there.  the fact that they offer escrow makes it much more attractive to me as a buyer.  thats how i read the ops post.  not that there are no scams over there, but that your coins are safer in escrow.  i tend to believe that is correct.  the buyer is safer if there is escrow.
wonderful tip-offs as usual :)
part 2: vendor protection against scam attemptsbeing a vendor myself, i can fully understand and sympathize for all the hard work and business management they must go through. albeit these instances are less common, they still do happen and pretty much any vendor whose been in the game long is more than likely to have any of the following occur.buyer disputes order stating that it is not what they expected or item did not arrive even though it didas i stated, there are far more awesome and honest buyers than bad apples. but sadly, it does happen mainly with either low lifes, or kids thinking they can pull a fast one. i cannot stress this enough, when creating a new listing be sure to give as much detail as possible. this will prevent any confusion and if a dispute occurs, you can refer the buyer and staff telling them that sold product is in accordance with the description. plus, when you have 50 customers before them saying they were satisfied with the item received, you will have much higher chances winning a dispute.when a buyer claim the package is a no-show, make sure you do either of the following to prevent this. place tracking on all of your items that you ship. for security, try not to give it out unless it is necessary. this is great proof to show staff that you did indeed ship out the item. if you do not use tracking, make sure it is known in your profile that this is the case and you cannot give refunds on lost packages. it would be to the buyers discretion whether or not to order.buyer threatens to leave negative feedback unless given a refundive actually had this happen to me. this was a plain and simple case that he was looking for free stuff and wanted to be an ass and go this route. it really frustrated me because i was very nice and polite to the dude and he decided to pull this shit on me. well, i handled it in a professional manner and backed off. this is what i did and what you can do too in this situation. i basically called his bluff. i explained to him that i have 40+ customers before him (which is true) buy the same product and every single one of them was completely satisfied. given that information, i told him that i wasnt going to give him a refund, and to go ahead and leave the negative feedback if you wish. if he had left the negative feedback, i wouldve retorted that this customer was just a troll looking for free stuff, and given my positive track record with this item i did not feel a refund with in order. he never did leave the feedback and released the escrow, which im happy  also, depending on your market, staff will remove negative feedback if it was unjustified. just report to staff and see what they say.i actually know a vendor who was in the same situation. he actually refunded the buyer and the asshole buyer still left negative feedback. man, did that vendor throw a fit. thankfully the staff took care of it.competitor attacksoccasionally, who will have a unethical and disgruntled vendor that is jealous of your booming business and wants to do something to sabotage it. a lot of the times they will make multiple buyer accounts, buy the cheapest product you sell, and then turn around and either call you a scammer or the product and service was bad. if you are a victim of this, report it to the staff and your customers as soon as possible. let them all know about the situation and given your track record, they will be understanding. most customers can determine if you have either a troll or competitor attacking you and will not think bad of you with the given false feedback. often staff will recognize the attack and ban the shill accounts and remove the feedback. its sad to see vendors sink that low to do such an attack.trolls/disgruntled customersoften times you will come across these when when discussing products and prices about your product. what generally happens is that youll get a buyer that is not happy with your price and then offers some low-ball figure, or you can have buyers that want a freebie tossed their way. you tell them no and the price stands as is. most are understanding of this, while you do have some that act like children and throw a temper tantrum because they cannot get their way. they end up going to the forums and posting false statements calling you a scammer and that your service is terrible, blah, blah, blah. to handle this, just politely and professionally explain the situation that you never even done business with this clown and how on earth could you be a scammer when no coin was exchanged? also explain that their behavior is ridiculous and just wanted something cheap or free. then everybody will realize what an ass this buyer just made of themselves and will easily join your side on this situation.well thats all i have for right now. if any vendor would like to add on and share any of their experiences, i would love to hear them. thanks for reading and stay safe everybody

no support and hence no refunds on pandora.  admins are now deleting posts of complainers in the forums.
could not have said it better myself wetdog. everyday i read of another customer scammed on sr. i have been around as a buyer since sr1 and just decided recently to vend because i want to see this community thrive again, especially the us market. there will be growing pains but as all the bad vendors fall and sites the good ones will remain.
so has there been no scams, rogue vendors at blue market? we are impartial at the hub and you are suggesting by your post that no one has been scammed there when i happen to know they have!

part 2: vendor protection against scam attemptsbeing a vendor myself, i can fully understand and sympathize for all the hard work and business management they must go through. albeit these instances are less common, they still do happen and pretty much any vendor whose been in the game long is more than likely to have any of the following occur.buyer disputes order stating that it is not what they expected or item did not arrive even though it didas i stated, there are far more awesome and honest buyers than bad apples. but sadly, it does happen mainly with either low lifes, or kids thinking they can pull a fast one. i cannot stress this enough, when creating a new listing be sure to give as much detail as possible. this will prevent any confusion and if a dispute occurs, you can refer the buyer and staff telling them that sold product is in accordance with the description. plus, when you have 50 customers before them saying they were satisfied with the item received, you will have much higher chances winning a dispute.when a buyer claim the package is a no-show, make sure you do either of the following to prevent this. place tracking on all of your items that you ship. for security, try not to give it out unless it is necessary. this is great proof to show staff that you did indeed ship out the item. if you do not use tracking, make sure it is known in your profile that this is the case and you cannot give refunds on lost packages. it would be to the buyers discretion whether or not to order.buyer threatens to leave negative feedback unless given a refundive actually had this happen to me. this was a plain and simple case that he was looking for free stuff and wanted to be an ass and go this route. it really frustrated me because i was very nice and polite to the dude and he decided to pull this shit on me. well, i handled it in a professional manner and backed off. this is what i did and what you can do too in this situation. i basically called his bluff. i explained to him that i have 40+ customers before him (which is true) buy the same product and every single one of them was completely satisfied. given that information, i told him that i wasnt going to give him a refund, and to go ahead and leave the negative feedback if you wish. if he had left the negative feedback, i wouldve retorted that this customer was just a troll looking for free stuff, and given my positive track record with this item i did not feel a refund with in order. he never did leave the feedback and released the escrow, which im happy  also, depending on your market, staff will remove negative feedback if it was unjustified. just report to staff and see what they say.i actually know a vendor who was in the same situation. he actually refunded the buyer and the asshole buyer still left negative feedback. man, did that vendor throw a fit. thankfully the staff took care of it.competitor attacksoccasionally, who will have a unethical and disgruntled vendor that is jealous of your booming business and wants to do something to sabotage it. a lot of the times they will make multiple buyer accounts, buy the cheapest product you sell, and then turn around and either call you a scammer or the product and service was bad. if you are a victim of this, report it to the staff and your customers as soon as possible. let them all know about the situation and given your track record, they will be understanding. most customers can determine if you have either a troll or competitor attacking you and will not think bad of you with the given false feedback. often staff will recognize the attack and ban the shill accounts and remove the feedback. its sad to see vendors sink that low to do such an attack.trolls/disgruntled customersoften times you will come across these when when discussing products and prices about your product. what generally happens is that youll get a buyer that is not happy with your price and then offers some low-ball figure, or you can have buyers that want a freebie tossed their way. you tell them no and the price stands as is. most are understanding of this, while you do have some that act like children and throw a temper tantrum because they cannot get their way. they end up going to the forums and posting false statements calling you a scammer and that your service is terrible, blah, blah, blah. to handle this, just politely and professionally explain the situation that you never even done business with this clown and how on earth could you be a scammer when no coin was exchanged? also explain that their behavior is ridiculous and just wanted something cheap or free. then everybody will realize what an ass this buyer just made of themselves and will easily join your side on this situation.well thats all i have for right now. if any vendor would like to add on and share any of their experiences, i would love to hear them. thanks for reading and stay safe everybody

no support and hence no refunds on pandora.  admins are now deleting posts of complainers in the forums.
could not have said it better myself wetdog. everyday i read of another customer scammed on sr. i have been around as a buyer since sr1 and just decided recently to vend because i want to see this community thrive again, especially the us market. there will be growing pains but as all the bad vendors fall and sites the good ones will remain.
so has there been no scams, rogue vendors at blue market? we are impartial at the hub and you are suggesting by your post that no one has been scammed there when i happen to know they have!

stealth that works - ditch the pe food grade vac sealpost by sierraromeo (which i believe he got off the sr forum ~boogie)>>> wake up call --- food grade pe vac sealing is vapor permeable and detectable in fifteen minutes <<<even triple sealing permeates in a few days so clearly when shipping to countries like australia when items can be in transit for anything up to 20+ days vendors need to up their game and improve their standards.so what is the answer? well happily there are a number of options available right now.all you need to know are:* mbb - moisture barrier bags* mylar bags* heat seal foil bagsa non permeable layer must be included, for example when shipping small quantities of powders the layering can consist of a few variations, it may be a good idea to dispense with the zip lock baggy as the zip can be felt through the envelope. the use of double mbb cleaning each thoroughly with isotropic alcohol to remove any particle traces is one very effective method. the final stage must of course be done in a clean environment to avoid transferring any particle residue to the outer packaging, wear gloves and discard before completing this stage.the best stealth is sometimes the simplest, envelopes must be as flat as possible with all the usual norms that make them blend into the thousands of others going through the system. if an envelope is singled out for extra attention its gone, that usually only happens when a dog reacts to it._____________________________________________________________________________________________________vendors already using these methods are listed below>>> please note that the vendors listed below are done so solely on their use of non permeable stealth packaging techniques as advised by the vendor. no other factors have been considered at this time so you are strongly encouraged to fully research any vendor before placing an order <<<=========================================================================================tba***========================================================================================how is mail sorted:when planning your packaging, take into consideration this procedure which is not specific to a particular country (only applies for letters not parcels) -1. mail arrives into said country in a big sack containing hundreds/thousands of letters.2. if arriving from a "flagged" country its directed to sorting area a in which mail undergoes extra scrutiny, if from non-flagged country its directed to sorting area b for normal manual sorting.3. at the designated sorting area, all the mail is poured onto a sorting tray and manually sorted, with the sorter removing anything thats oversize, damaged or suspicious looking (again there would be guidelines the sorters follow based on profiling and gathered intelligence). over-sized items are sent to the parcel area, damaged items are repaired or destroyed and suspicious letters are inspected further (manual, x-ray or dog)4. once manual sorting is done, the mail is sent down a conveyor belt to the automatic sorting machine, while going down the conveyor belt, a drug detection dog runs over all mail heading down and alerts to letters containing whatever the dog is trained to find, these are in turn removed for further inspection (manual or x-ray) the rest carry on to the machine and are sent for distribution around the country.5. any mail that cant be automatically sorted for distribution (usually due to addresses in the wrong format, hand written messily, too thick to fit etc) are manually sorted again.so using the above information, one case see that the risk areas are - the country of origin, the initial manual sorter, the drug detection dog and the final automatic sorting machine.country of origin - the intelligence on which particular countries the receiving country has "flagged isnt made publicly available but one could assume they include - the netherlands, belgium, colombia, bolivia, peru, china, vietnam, thailand among others. as well as countries added based on intelligence received and profiling.initial mail sorter - has to manually sort hundreds of letters at once, so make sure your letter doesnt attract a second glimpse. ensure you use a high quality envelope, not a cheap one thats thin and soft and likely to tear. ensure it looks harmless and boring from the outside, and ensure its as thin as possible and packaged so the contents cannot be felt if handled and so that if handled, it feels like paper inside, not a foil bag!drug detection dog - use moisture barrier bags! pe and foil layered are the best, followed by pe and mylar. you should be doing your packaging in a clean environment because if any molecules from your product end up on the outside of that bag or on the envelope, youve wasted your time and it will be detected.final automatic sorting machine - make sure the address is clearly readable and in the correct format for that country. make sure your envelope is of a standard size. (see the first post of this thread for standard envelope sizes)use the above information and create your letters how you wish, if you still get any no-shows to a particular country, change what your letters look like because your current ones have been photographed and added to a database. this includes the return address and any identifiable logos etc._____________________________________________________________________________________________________how to ensure your mail goes through the sorting machines without needing to be sorted manually by one of those pesky humans (au specific)the info below is taken from the australia post guidelines for international mail, and theyre based around the specs required for mail to go into the auto sorter machines, if a letter falls outside of these guidelines, theres a much bigger chance it will end up being manually sorted by a person. (when you receive a letter than doesnt have one of those faint orange barcodes on it, it means its been manually sorted. this doesnt apply to bulk mail that big companies send out to 1000s of people though)recommended envelope sizes and max weight and thickness -small letter -dl 110 mm × 220 mm 125g maxc6 114 mm × 162 mm 125g maxno more than 5mm thicklarge letter -c5 162 mm × 229 mm 125g maxc4 324 mm × 229 mm 250g maxb4 353 mm × 250 mm 250g maxno more than 20mm thickenvelope quality - white 100gsm paperaddress font - courier or helvetica font - 12 point or 10 pitchit should contain no full stops or commas or other punctuation. you can use / but its recommended not to.there should be no advertising/logos etc near the address.the street number should be 2 spaces away from the unit/suite numberthe suburb and country should be in capitalsthe post code should be 2 spaces away from the statecharacters should be between 2mm & 4mm talland between 0.3mm & 7mm widethe space between lines from 1mm to 2.5mmaddress example -john smithsuite 10 52 silk roadport headland wa 3001australiasome of these things are going to the extreme and probably not necessary, besides, the huge majority of orders make it without any issues anyway but if you want perfection, this is where its at.guideline books (see these for the correct address layouts and where stamps, addresses and logos etc should/shouldnt be placed. -http://auspost.com.au/media/documents/l ... -guide.pdfhttp://auspost.com.au/media/documents/i ... -guide.pdfeducational video about the mail process (clearnet) -http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wumr2qpqp8_____________________________________________________________________________________________________some important info for vendors from farmer bob. very useful in terms of picking the right packaging and cleaning the surface to ensure any traces have been removed.[author=farmerbob link=topic=76.msg62827#msg62827 date=1385533965]im glad to see this is finally getting adopted but theres a lot of misinformation going around.#1 ignore mylar & foil!! only use laminates that were designed and manufactured to be used as moisture barrier bagging. mbbs are a subset of "mylar" but mylar does not equate to mbb. many products that are referred to as mylar and maybe even look and feel just like mbbs are not suitable for use here. beware of product substitution.#2 dont use irons, curling irons, or food vac sealers. they wont give you the consistency & quality of an impulse sealer. get a quality impulse sealer (5mm+ width) and read online how to check seal quality. you should be able to see the outline of the seal-line insulation fabric imprinted on one side. bond some pieces and pull, the bag should tear rather than the seal peeling apart. once you get your heat setting where you like it keep it there but re-check it every few hundred seals.#3 leave some air in the package, clean in in a sink with detergent/soap and rinse in bleachwater. when its in the detergent sink squeeze the bags to look for air leakage, no bubble should come out. before you pull them out of the bleach bucket wash your hands well. at this point neither a bloodhound nor a mass spectrometer will pick up a scent from any enclosed drugs provided you dont re-contaminate the bag or contaminate the mailing materials.#4: purchase mbbs from wherever you like, plutopete, amazon, ebay, etc (anonymously). there are survivalists, hobbyists, and plenty of small businesses that buy these. they went out of style with the big-time smugglers decades ago. purchasing them wont be suspicious and its perfectly legal.removing trace particles properly:[author=farmerbob link=topic=76.msg68691#msg68691 date=1385853735]the "right" way to do it is to ensure you wash off both polar and nopolar surface contaminants.. so detergent wash followed by ipa and/or acetone followed by deionized water rinse would be the technique youd use if you could do it properly. the issue is "do it properly" good cleanroom surface cleaning technique is difficult to master. you have to wipe in one direction only and rotate the rag as you wipe, or you have to spray the bag from the top down and let gravity wash the contamination down. the risk is that most people, even trained "professionals" cleaning with alcohol will simply smear contamination around and not actually remove it.sodium hypochlorite bleach (clorox in north america) is probably a better choice for the masses. bleach will oxidize most organic molecules. residues that are left behind after a detergent wash will react with the bleach in the bucket the oxidized byproducts would likely pass even careful laboratory analysis (ms swab test).an alternative for the lazy is to just throw the packs in your dishwasher with a splash of bleach. ive done that when i was vending and i had a lot of weed orders to go out and didnt feel like spending too much time cleaning them. in my case i used a peroxide bleach but everyone else should be fine with clorox.
hey hubsters i have tons of security tutorials that ive collected over time. i am nerd, and am always a fan of useful guides. i am happy to share with you my collection. ill keep posting as i find them on my computer and when i have time. if you have any, please toss them in. ill try my best to reference them if i can remember ==================================================================================================encrypting your hard drive with truecryptwritten by: verto, owner of evolution market introductionif you save anything on your computer, it is likely that you do not want just anyone to be able to see what you have saved. you want a way to protect that information so that you can access it, and absolutely no one else except those you trust. therefore, it makes sense to set up a system which protects your information and safeguards it against prying eyes.the best such system for this is called “true crypt”. “true crypt” is an encryption software program which allows you to store many files and directories inside of a single file on your harddrive. further, this file is encrypted and no one can actually see what you have saved there unless they know your password.this sounds extremely high tech, but it is actually very easy to set up.setting up truecryptquote1. go to http://www.truecrypt.org/downloads (or go to www.truecrypt.org, and click on “downloads”)2. under “latest stable version”, under “windows 7/vista/xp/2000?, click “download”3. the file will be called “true crypt setup 7.0a.exe” or something similar. run this file.4. if prompted that a program needs your permission to continue, click “continue”.5. check “i accept and agree to be bound by these license terms”6. click “accept”7. ensure that “install” is selected, and click “next”8. click “install”9. you will see a dialog stating “truecrypt has been successfully installed.” click “ok”10. click “no” when asked if you wish to view the tutorial/user’s guide.11. click “finish”at this point, truecrypt is now installed. now we will set up truecrypt so that we can begin using it to store sensitive information.quote1. click the “windows logo”/”start” button on the lower left corner of your screen.2. click “all programs”3. click “truecrypt”4. click the “truecrypt” applicationand now we can begin:quote1. click the button “create volume”2. ensuring that “create an encrypted file container” is selected, click “next”3. select “hidden truecrypt volume” and click “next”.4. ensuring that “normal mode” is selected, click “next”5. click on “select file”note which directory you are in on your computer. look at the top of the dialog that has opened and you will see the path you are in, most likely the home directory for your username. an input box is provided with a flashing cursor asking you to type in a file name. here, you will type in the following filename:random.txt you may of course replace random.txt with anything you like. this file is going to be created and will be used to store many other files inside. do not use a filename for a file that already exists. the idea here is that you are creating an entirely new file.it is also recommended though not required that you “hide” this file somewhere less obvious. if it is in your home directory, then someone who has access to your computer may find it easier. you can also choose to put this file on any other media, it doesn’t have to be your hard disk. you could for example save your truecrypt file to a usb flash drive, an sd card, or some other media. it is up to you.quote6. once you have typed in the file name, click “save”7. make sure “never save history” is checked.8. click “next”9. on the “outer volume” screen, click “next” again.10. the default encryption algorithm and hash algorithm are fine. click “next”11. choose a file size.in order to benefit the most from this guide, you should have at least 10 gigabytes of free disk space. if not, then it is worth it for you to purchase some form of media (such as a removable harddrive, a large sd card, etc.) in order to proceed. truecrypt can be used on all forms of digital media not just your hard disk. if you choose to proceed without obtaining at least ten gigabytes of disk space, then select a size that you are comfortable with (such as 100 mb).ideally, you want to choose enough space to work with. i recommend 20 gb at least. remember that if you do need more space later, you can always create additional truecrypt volumes using exactly these same steps.quote12. now you are prompted for a password. this is very important. read this carefullyread this section carefullythe password you choose here is a decoy password. that means, this is the password you would give to someone under duress. suppose that someone suspects that you were accessing sensitive information and they threaten to beat you or worse if you do not reveal the password. this is the password that you give to them. when you give someone this password, it will be nearly impossible for them to prove that it is not the right password. further, they cannot even know that there is a second password.here are some tips for your password:a. choose a password you will never forget. it may be ten years from now that you need it. make it simple, like your birthday repeated three times.b. make sure it seems reasonable, that it appears to be a real password. if the password is something stupid like “123? then they may not believe you.c. remember that this is a password that you would give to someone if forced. it is *not* your actual password.d. do not make this password too similar to what you plan to really use. you do not want someone to guess your main password from this one.and with all of this in mind, choose your password. when you have typed it in twice, click “next”.quote13. “large files”, here you are asked whether or not you plan to store files larger than 4 gigabytes. choose “no” and click “next”14. “outer volume format”, here you will notice some random numbers and letters next to where it says “random pool”. go ahead and move your mouse around fora bit. this will increase the randomness and give you better encryption. after about ten seconds of this, click “format”.15. depending on the file size you selected, it will take some time to finish formatting.“what is happening?”truecrypt is creating the file you asked it to, such as “random.txt”. it is building a file system contained entirely within that one file. this file system can be used to store files, directories, and more. further, it is encrypting this file system in such a way that without the right password it will be impossible for anyone to access it. to *anyone* other than you, this file will appear to be just a mess of random characters. no one will even know that it is a truecrypt volume.quote16. “outer volume contents”, click on the button called, “open outer volume”an empty folder has opened up. this is empty because you have yet to put any files into your truecrypt volume.do not put any sensitive content herethis is the “decoy”. this is what someone would see if you gave them the password you used in the previous step. this is not where you are going to store your sensitive data. if you have been forced into a situation where you had to reveal your password to some individual, then that individual will see whatever is in this folder. you need to have data in this folder that appears to be sensitive enough to be protected by truecrypt in order to fool them. here are some important tips to keep in mind:a. do not use porn. adult models can sometimes appear to be underaged, and this can cause you to incriminate yourself unintentionally.b. do not use drawings/renderings/writings of porn. in many jurisdictions, these are just as illegal as photographs.c. good choices for what to put here include: backups of documents, emails, financial documents, etc.d. once you have placed files into this folder, *never* place any more files in the future. doing so may damage your hidden content.generally, you want to store innocent data where some individual looking at it would find no cause against you, and yet at the same time they would understand why you used truecrypt to secure that data.now, go ahead and find files and store them in this folder. be sure that you leave at least ten gigabytes free. the more the better.when you are all done copying files into this folder, close the folder by clicking the “x” in the top right corner.quote17. click “next”18. if prompted that “a program needs your permission to continue”, click “continue”19. “hidden volume”, click “next”20. the default encryption and hash algorithms are fine, click “next”21. “hidden volume size”, the maximum available space is indicated in bold below the text box. round down to the nearest full unit. for example, if 19.97 gbis available, select 19 gb. if 12.0 gb are available, select 11 gb.22. if a warning dialog comes up, asking “are you sure you wish to continue”, select “yes”23. “hidden volume password”important read thishere you are going to select the real password. this is the password you will never reveal to anyone else under any circumstances. only you will know it. no one will be able to figure it out or even know that there is a second password. be aware that an individual intent on obtaining your sensitive information may lie to you and claim to be able to figure this out. they cannot.it is highly recommended that you choose a 64 character password here. if it is difficult to remember a 64 character password, choose an 8 character password and simply repeat it 8 times. a date naturally has exactly 8 numbers, and a significant date in your life repeated 8 times would do just fine.quote24. type in your password twice, and click “next”25. “large files”, select “yes” and click “next”.26. “hidden volume format”, as before move your mouse around for about ten seconds randomly, and tehn click “format”.27. if prompted “a program needs your permission to continue”, select “continue”28. a dialog will come up telling you that the hidden truecrypt volume has been successfully created. click “ok”29. click “exit”congratulations! you have just set up an encrypted file container on your hard drive. anything you store here will be inaccessible to anyone except you. further, you have protected this content with two passwords. one that you will give to someone under threat, and one that only you will know. keep your real password well protected and never write it down or give it to anyone else for any reason.now, we should test both passwords.testing truecrypt volumesonce you have completed the above section, you will be back at truecrypt. go ahead and follow these steps to test the volumes you have made.quote1. click “select file…”2. locate the file you created in the last section, most likely called “random.txt” or something similar. remember that even though there is both an outer anda hidden volume, both volumes are contained in a single file. there are not two files, only one.3. click “open”4. choose a drive letter that you are not using (anything past m is probably just fine). click on that, for example click on “o:” to highlight it.5. click “mount”6. now you are prompted for a password. read the below carefully:the password you provide here will determine which volume is mounted to the drive letter you specified. if you type in your decoy password, then o:\ will show all the files and directories you copied that you would reveal if forced. if you type in your real password, then o:\ will show the files and directories that you never intend anyone to see.7. after successfully typing in your password, you will see additional detail to the right of the drive letter, including the full path to the file you selected as well as the kind of volume it is (for example, hidden).8. right click on your “windows logo”/”start menu” icon, and scroll down to the bottom where you can see your different drive letters. you will see the drive letter you selected, for example: “local disk (o:)”. click on that.9. if you selected your decoy password, you will see all the files and folders that you moved there during the installation phase. if you selected the real password, you will see whatever files and directories you have placed so far into the hidden volume, if any.if you selected your hidden volume password, you may now begin moving any sensitive information you wish. be aware that simply moving it from your main hard disk is not enough. we will discuss how to ensure deleted data is actually deleted later in the guide.“what is happening?”when you select a file and mount it to a drive, you are telling your computer that you have a new drive with files and folders on it. it is the same thing as if you had plugged in a usb flash drive, a removable harddrive, or an sd card into your computer. truecrypt causes your computer to think that there is an entirely new disk drive on your computer. you can use this disk drive just as if it *was* actually a usb flash drive. you can copy files to it, directories, and use it just as you would use a usb flash drive.when you are done, simply close all open windows/folders/applications that are using your truecrypt drive letter, and then click “dismount” from within truecrypt while you have the drive letter highlighted. this will once again hide all of this data, accessible only by re-mounting it with the correct password.very important safety informationwhen a true crypt hidden volume is mounted, someone who has access to your computer can access anything that is inside that hidden volume. if for example you left your computer running while a truecrypt volume was mounted, then if someone gained access to your computer they would be able to see everything you have in that volume. therefore:always remember to dismount any truecrypt volume containing any sensitive information when you are not using your computeryou can tell that it is dismounted because the drive letter inside of “truecrypt”‘s control panel will appear the same as all of the other drive letters, with no information to the right of the drive letter.you should practice mounting and dismounting a few times with both passwords to make sure you understand this process.once you have copied files/folders into the hidden volume, do not touch the files or folders in the outer volume anymore. remember that both volumes occupy the same single file, and therefore changing the outer volume can damage the hidden volume. once you have copied files/folders into the outer volume during the installation process, that is the last time you should do so. from that point forward, use only the hidden volume. the outer volume exists only as a decoy if you need it.

how to chain socks with torwritten by: introductionthere are many reasons why you would need to add an extra hop after the exit node. if youre trying to card some items on any site with fraud filters youre obviously going to raise some flags if the cardholder lives in new york and youre connecting from a german exit node. same goes for paypal logins. keep in mind you will need to use a clean socks5 within the same region as the cardholder/account. if us within the same state, or otherwise within the same area. a link to sites providing private socks services is provided at the end of this article.even if carding isnt your thing many sites filter out exit nodes, so its a necessity to have some control over where you appear to be connecting from.note: if you have the tor browser bundle and havent installed tor separately, use port 9150 in place of 9050 for the following configurations.proxychainsquotefirst download & install proxychains:sudo apt-get install proxychainsthen configure proxychains to setup your chain:sudo nano /etc/proxychains.confdown towards the bottom you should see:quote[proxylist]# add proxy here ...# meanwile# defaults set to "tor"just write your list in using tor as the first listed:quotesocks4 127.0.0.1 9050socks5 ip.address.here portafter that you should be done. just go to terminal and set your browser to go through proxychains:proxychains firefoxproxifierif you are on windows you will want to setup your chain using proxifier. first download and install a cracked copy of proxifier. once you have it installed and run go to options -> proxy settings and configure your chain:quote127.0.0.1  | 9050 | socks 5ip.address | port | socks 5once you have set your proxy settings go to options -> proxification rules and set the following rules:quoteloopback | all | 127.0.0.1 | alltor           | tor.exe | all  | allonce you are finished go to name resolution, choose remote, click ok, and youre set. keep in mind that if you use proxifier you need to use a browser that isnt already configured to connect through tor or it will ignore the proxifier settings and just route strictly through tor. for this guide my recommendation is a copy of firefox portable that has been secured.instructions for proxifier 3.0profile -> proxy servers -> add.address 127.0.0.1, port 9050, socks v5 -> ok. popup box will ask whether to set as default. select yes.now add your proxy you want to use in the same way. click proxychains button then create, and drag & drop to the new rule. you should have something that looks like this.new127.0.0.1:9050ip address:port (the details you entered earlier)now go to profile -> proxification rules.in the drop down menu for default select proxy socks5 127.0.0.1 & uncheck the localhost rule.then add -> change action to chain new. ->ok.next, profile -> name resolution. select resolve hostname through proxy.quotesocks providers    http://vip72.com    http://super-socks.com    http://5socks.net    http://winsocks.net blacklists    http://www.ip-score.com    http://whoer.net thats it....youre good to go.

stealth that works - ditch the pe food grade vac sealpost by sierraromeo (which i believe he got off the sr forum ~boogie)>>> wake up call --- food grade pe vac sealing is vapor permeable and detectable in fifteen minutes <<<even triple sealing permeates in a few days so clearly when shipping to countries like australia when items can be in transit for anything up to 20+ days vendors need to up their game and improve their standards.so what is the answer? well happily there are a number of options available right now.all you need to know are:* mbb - moisture barrier bags* mylar bags* heat seal foil bagsa non permeable layer must be included, for example when shipping small quantities of powders the layering can consist of a few variations, it may be a good idea to dispense with the zip lock baggy as the zip can be felt through the envelope. the use of double mbb cleaning each thoroughly with isotropic alcohol to remove any particle traces is one very effective method. the final stage must of course be done in a clean environment to avoid transferring any particle residue to the outer packaging, wear gloves and discard before completing this stage.the best stealth is sometimes the simplest, envelopes must be as flat as possible with all the usual norms that make them blend into the thousands of others going through the system. if an envelope is singled out for extra attention its gone, that usually only happens when a dog reacts to it._____________________________________________________________________________________________________vendors already using these methods are listed below>>> please note that the vendors listed below are done so solely on their use of non permeable stealth packaging techniques as advised by the vendor. no other factors have been considered at this time so you are strongly encouraged to fully research any vendor before placing an order <<<=========================================================================================tba***========================================================================================how is mail sorted:when planning your packaging, take into consideration this procedure which is not specific to a particular country (only applies for letters not parcels) -1. mail arrives into said country in a big sack containing hundreds/thousands of letters.2. if arriving from a "flagged" country its directed to sorting area a in which mail undergoes extra scrutiny, if from non-flagged country its directed to sorting area b for normal manual sorting.3. at the designated sorting area, all the mail is poured onto a sorting tray and manually sorted, with the sorter removing anything thats oversize, damaged or suspicious looking (again there would be guidelines the sorters follow based on profiling and gathered intelligence). over-sized items are sent to the parcel area, damaged items are repaired or destroyed and suspicious letters are inspected further (manual, x-ray or dog)4. once manual sorting is done, the mail is sent down a conveyor belt to the automatic sorting machine, while going down the conveyor belt, a drug detection dog runs over all mail heading down and alerts to letters containing whatever the dog is trained to find, these are in turn removed for further inspection (manual or x-ray) the rest carry on to the machine and are sent for distribution around the country.5. any mail that cant be automatically sorted for distribution (usually due to addresses in the wrong format, hand written messily, too thick to fit etc) are manually sorted again.so using the above information, one case see that the risk areas are - the country of origin, the initial manual sorter, the drug detection dog and the final automatic sorting machine.country of origin - the intelligence on which particular countries the receiving country has "flagged isnt made publicly available but one could assume they include - the netherlands, belgium, colombia, bolivia, peru, china, vietnam, thailand among others. as well as countries added based on intelligence received and profiling.initial mail sorter - has to manually sort hundreds of letters at once, so make sure your letter doesnt attract a second glimpse. ensure you use a high quality envelope, not a cheap one thats thin and soft and likely to tear. ensure it looks harmless and boring from the outside, and ensure its as thin as possible and packaged so the contents cannot be felt if handled and so that if handled, it feels like paper inside, not a foil bag!drug detection dog - use moisture barrier bags! pe and foil layered are the best, followed by pe and mylar. you should be doing your packaging in a clean environment because if any molecules from your product end up on the outside of that bag or on the envelope, youve wasted your time and it will be detected.final automatic sorting machine - make sure the address is clearly readable and in the correct format for that country. make sure your envelope is of a standard size. (see the first post of this thread for standard envelope sizes)use the above information and create your letters how you wish, if you still get any no-shows to a particular country, change what your letters look like because your current ones have been photographed and added to a database. this includes the return address and any identifiable logos etc._____________________________________________________________________________________________________how to ensure your mail goes through the sorting machines without needing to be sorted manually by one of those pesky humans (au specific)the info below is taken from the australia post guidelines for international mail, and theyre based around the specs required for mail to go into the auto sorter machines, if a letter falls outside of these guidelines, theres a much bigger chance it will end up being manually sorted by a person. (when you receive a letter than doesnt have one of those faint orange barcodes on it, it means its been manually sorted. this doesnt apply to bulk mail that big companies send out to 1000s of people though)recommended envelope sizes and max weight and thickness -small letter -dl 110 mm × 220 mm 125g maxc6 114 mm × 162 mm 125g maxno more than 5mm thicklarge letter -c5 162 mm × 229 mm 125g maxc4 324 mm × 229 mm 250g maxb4 353 mm × 250 mm 250g maxno more than 20mm thickenvelope quality - white 100gsm paperaddress font - courier or helvetica font - 12 point or 10 pitchit should contain no full stops or commas or other punctuation. you can use / but its recommended not to.there should be no advertising/logos etc near the address.the street number should be 2 spaces away from the unit/suite numberthe suburb and country should be in capitalsthe post code should be 2 spaces away from the statecharacters should be between 2mm & 4mm talland between 0.3mm & 7mm widethe space between lines from 1mm to 2.5mmaddress example -john smithsuite 10 52 silk roadport headland wa 3001australiasome of these things are going to the extreme and probably not necessary, besides, the huge majority of orders make it without any issues anyway but if you want perfection, this is where its at.guideline books (see these for the correct address layouts and where stamps, addresses and logos etc should/shouldnt be placed. -http://auspost.com.au/media/documents/l ... -guide.pdfhttp://auspost.com.au/media/documents/i ... -guide.pdfeducational video about the mail process (clearnet) -http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wumr2qpqp8_____________________________________________________________________________________________________some important info for vendors from farmer bob. very useful in terms of picking the right packaging and cleaning the surface to ensure any traces have been removed.[author=farmerbob link=topic=76.msg62827#msg62827 date=1385533965]im glad to see this is finally getting adopted but theres a lot of misinformation going around.#1 ignore mylar & foil!! only use laminates that were designed and manufactured to be used as moisture barrier bagging. mbbs are a subset of "mylar" but mylar does not equate to mbb. many products that are referred to as mylar and maybe even look and feel just like mbbs are not suitable for use here. beware of product substitution.#2 dont use irons, curling irons, or food vac sealers. they wont give you the consistency & quality of an impulse sealer. get a quality impulse sealer (5mm+ width) and read online how to check seal quality. you should be able to see the outline of the seal-line insulation fabric imprinted on one side. bond some pieces and pull, the bag should tear rather than the seal peeling apart. once you get your heat setting where you like it keep it there but re-check it every few hundred seals.#3 leave some air in the package, clean in in a sink with detergent/soap and rinse in bleachwater. when its in the detergent sink squeeze the bags to look for air leakage, no bubble should come out. before you pull them out of the bleach bucket wash your hands well. at this point neither a bloodhound nor a mass spectrometer will pick up a scent from any enclosed drugs provided you dont re-contaminate the bag or contaminate the mailing materials.#4: purchase mbbs from wherever you like, plutopete, amazon, ebay, etc (anonymously). there are survivalists, hobbyists, and plenty of small businesses that buy these. they went out of style with the big-time smugglers decades ago. purchasing them wont be suspicious and its perfectly legal.removing trace particles properly:[author=farmerbob link=topic=76.msg68691#msg68691 date=1385853735]the "right" way to do it is to ensure you wash off both polar and nopolar surface contaminants.. so detergent wash followed by ipa and/or acetone followed by deionized water rinse would be the technique youd use if you could do it properly. the issue is "do it properly" good cleanroom surface cleaning technique is difficult to master. you have to wipe in one direction only and rotate the rag as you wipe, or you have to spray the bag from the top down and let gravity wash the contamination down. the risk is that most people, even trained "professionals" cleaning with alcohol will simply smear contamination around and not actually remove it.sodium hypochlorite bleach (clorox in north america) is probably a better choice for the masses. bleach will oxidize most organic molecules. residues that are left behind after a detergent wash will react with the bleach in the bucket the oxidized byproducts would likely pass even careful laboratory analysis (ms swab test).an alternative for the lazy is to just throw the packs in your dishwasher with a splash of bleach. ive done that when i was vending and i had a lot of weed orders to go out and didnt feel like spending too much time cleaning them. in my case i used a peroxide bleach but everyone else should be fine with clorox.

how to chain socks with torwritten by: introductionthere are many reasons why you would need to add an extra hop after the exit node. if youre trying to card some items on any site with fraud filters youre obviously going to raise some flags if the cardholder lives in new york and youre connecting from a german exit node. same goes for paypal logins. keep in mind you will need to use a clean socks5 within the same region as the cardholder/account. if us within the same state, or otherwise within the same area. a link to sites providing private socks services is provided at the end of this article.even if carding isnt your thing many sites filter out exit nodes, so its a necessity to have some control over where you appear to be connecting from.note: if you have the tor browser bundle and havent installed tor separately, use port 9150 in place of 9050 for the following configurations.proxychainsquotefirst download & install proxychains:sudo apt-get install proxychainsthen configure proxychains to setup your chain:sudo nano /etc/proxychains.confdown towards the bottom you should see:quote[proxylist]# add proxy here ...# meanwile# defaults set to "tor"just write your list in using tor as the first listed:quotesocks4 127.0.0.1 9050socks5 ip.address.here portafter that you should be done. just go to terminal and set your browser to go through proxychains:proxychains firefoxproxifierif you are on windows you will want to setup your chain using proxifier. first download and install a cracked copy of proxifier. once you have it installed and run go to options -> proxy settings and configure your chain:quote127.0.0.1  | 9050 | socks 5ip.address | port | socks 5once you have set your proxy settings go to options -> proxification rules and set the following rules:quoteloopback | all | 127.0.0.1 | alltor           | tor.exe | all  | allonce you are finished go to name resolution, choose remote, click ok, and youre set. keep in mind that if you use proxifier you need to use a browser that isnt already configured to connect through tor or it will ignore the proxifier settings and just route strictly through tor. for this guide my recommendation is a copy of firefox portable that has been secured.instructions for proxifier 3.0profile -> proxy servers -> add.address 127.0.0.1, port 9050, socks v5 -> ok. popup box will ask whether to set as default. select yes.now add your proxy you want to use in the same way. click proxychains button then create, and drag & drop to the new rule. you should have something that looks like this.new127.0.0.1:9050ip address:port (the details you entered earlier)now go to profile -> proxification rules.in the drop down menu for default select proxy socks5 127.0.0.1 & uncheck the localhost rule.then add -> change action to chain new. ->ok.next, profile -> name resolution. select resolve hostname through proxy.quotesocks providers    http://vip72.com    http://super-socks.com    http://5socks.net    http://winsocks.net blacklists    http://www.ip-score.com    http://whoer.net thats it....youre good to go.
well done boogie, a hell of a lot of infomation and good advice.your post should be a sticky, itll save a lot of people a lot of pain (and coin).well done again,pops
glad to be of a help playground  i would aggree with whom that png and jpeg files are always safe since they do now need to be downloaded for viewing.as for pdfs, you can always downloading them onto a usb and either open in a vm or a secondary laptop (burner one) that has absolutely no internet connect will be ideal if worried about javascript being malicious i always like burner laptops. hehetake care and be safe everyone
txt files are the way to go. most of the time, they do not have to be downloaded, rather you can view them the page. i have 100s of clipboard files everywhere. also, its easy to just cut and paste anything you may need.hope this helps playground
this referral link works! never mind
postscript is pretty much an entire programming language in and of itself. i wouldnt remotely consider it a safe document type. text is good.  for anything that wont play well in text form, probably a png of it is the next safest.  goes downhill pretty quickly from there.

hey hubsters i have tons of security tutorials that ive collected over time. i am nerd, and am always a fan of useful guides. i am happy to share with you my collection. ill keep posting as i find them on my computer and when i have time. if you have any, please toss them in. ill try my best to reference them if i can remember ==================================================================================================encrypting your hard drive with truecryptwritten by: verto, owner of evolution market introductionif you save anything on your computer, it is likely that you do not want just anyone to be able to see what you have saved. you want a way to protect that information so that you can access it, and absolutely no one else except those you trust. therefore, it makes sense to set up a system which protects your information and safeguards it against prying eyes.the best such system for this is called “true crypt”. “true crypt” is an encryption software program which allows you to store many files and directories inside of a single file on your harddrive. further, this file is encrypted and no one can actually see what you have saved there unless they know your password.this sounds extremely high tech, but it is actually very easy to set up.setting up truecryptquote1. go to http://www.truecrypt.org/downloads (or go to www.truecrypt.org, and click on “downloads”)2. under “latest stable version”, under “windows 7/vista/xp/2000?, click “download”3. the file will be called “true crypt setup 7.0a.exe” or something similar. run this file.4. if prompted that a program needs your permission to continue, click “continue”.5. check “i accept and agree to be bound by these license terms”6. click “accept”7. ensure that “install” is selected, and click “next”8. click “install”9. you will see a dialog stating “truecrypt has been successfully installed.” click “ok”10. click “no” when asked if you wish to view the tutorial/user’s guide.11. click “finish”at this point, truecrypt is now installed. now we will set up truecrypt so that we can begin using it to store sensitive information.quote1. click the “windows logo”/”start” button on the lower left corner of your screen.2. click “all programs”3. click “truecrypt”4. click the “truecrypt” applicationand now we can begin:quote1. click the button “create volume”2. ensuring that “create an encrypted file container” is selected, click “next”3. select “hidden truecrypt volume” and click “next”.4. ensuring that “normal mode” is selected, click “next”5. click on “select file”note which directory you are in on your computer. look at the top of the dialog that has opened and you will see the path you are in, most likely the home directory for your username. an input box is provided with a flashing cursor asking you to type in a file name. here, you will type in the following filename:random.txt you may of course replace random.txt with anything you like. this file is going to be created and will be used to store many other files inside. do not use a filename for a file that already exists. the idea here is that you are creating an entirely new file.it is also recommended though not required that you “hide” this file somewhere less obvious. if it is in your home directory, then someone who has access to your computer may find it easier. you can also choose to put this file on any other media, it doesn’t have to be your hard disk. you could for example save your truecrypt file to a usb flash drive, an sd card, or some other media. it is up to you.quote6. once you have typed in the file name, click “save”7. make sure “never save history” is checked.8. click “next”9. on the “outer volume” screen, click “next” again.10. the default encryption algorithm and hash algorithm are fine. click “next”11. choose a file size.in order to benefit the most from this guide, you should have at least 10 gigabytes of free disk space. if not, then it is worth it for you to purchase some form of media (such as a removable harddrive, a large sd card, etc.) in order to proceed. truecrypt can be used on all forms of digital media not just your hard disk. if you choose to proceed without obtaining at least ten gigabytes of disk space, then select a size that you are comfortable with (such as 100 mb).ideally, you want to choose enough space to work with. i recommend 20 gb at least. remember that if you do need more space later, you can always create additional truecrypt volumes using exactly these same steps.quote12. now you are prompted for a password. this is very important. read this carefullyread this section carefullythe password you choose here is a decoy password. that means, this is the password you would give to someone under duress. suppose that someone suspects that you were accessing sensitive information and they threaten to beat you or worse if you do not reveal the password. this is the password that you give to them. when you give someone this password, it will be nearly impossible for them to prove that it is not the right password. further, they cannot even know that there is a second password.here are some tips for your password:a. choose a password you will never forget. it may be ten years from now that you need it. make it simple, like your birthday repeated three times.b. make sure it seems reasonable, that it appears to be a real password. if the password is something stupid like “123? then they may not believe you.c. remember that this is a password that you would give to someone if forced. it is *not* your actual password.d. do not make this password too similar to what you plan to really use. you do not want someone to guess your main password from this one.and with all of this in mind, choose your password. when you have typed it in twice, click “next”.quote13. “large files”, here you are asked whether or not you plan to store files larger than 4 gigabytes. choose “no” and click “next”14. “outer volume format”, here you will notice some random numbers and letters next to where it says “random pool”. go ahead and move your mouse around fora bit. this will increase the randomness and give you better encryption. after about ten seconds of this, click “format”.15. depending on the file size you selected, it will take some time to finish formatting.“what is happening?”truecrypt is creating the file you asked it to, such as “random.txt”. it is building a file system contained entirely within that one file. this file system can be used to store files, directories, and more. further, it is encrypting this file system in such a way that without the right password it will be impossible for anyone to access it. to *anyone* other than you, this file will appear to be just a mess of random characters. no one will even know that it is a truecrypt volume.quote16. “outer volume contents”, click on the button called, “open outer volume”an empty folder has opened up. this is empty because you have yet to put any files into your truecrypt volume.do not put any sensitive content herethis is the “decoy”. this is what someone would see if you gave them the password you used in the previous step. this is not where you are going to store your sensitive data. if you have been forced into a situation where you had to reveal your password to some individual, then that individual will see whatever is in this folder. you need to have data in this folder that appears to be sensitive enough to be protected by truecrypt in order to fool them. here are some important tips to keep in mind:a. do not use porn. adult models can sometimes appear to be underaged, and this can cause you to incriminate yourself unintentionally.b. do not use drawings/renderings/writings of porn. in many jurisdictions, these are just as illegal as photographs.c. good choices for what to put here include: backups of documents, emails, financial documents, etc.d. once you have placed files into this folder, *never* place any more files in the future. doing so may damage your hidden content.generally, you want to store innocent data where some individual looking at it would find no cause against you, and yet at the same time they would understand why you used truecrypt to secure that data.now, go ahead and find files and store them in this folder. be sure that you leave at least ten gigabytes free. the more the better.when you are all done copying files into this folder, close the folder by clicking the “x” in the top right corner.quote17. click “next”18. if prompted that “a program needs your permission to continue”, click “continue”19. “hidden volume”, click “next”20. the default encryption and hash algorithms are fine, click “next”21. “hidden volume size”, the maximum available space is indicated in bold below the text box. round down to the nearest full unit. for example, if 19.97 gbis available, select 19 gb. if 12.0 gb are available, select 11 gb.22. if a warning dialog comes up, asking “are you sure you wish to continue”, select “yes”23. “hidden volume password”important read thishere you are going to select the real password. this is the password you will never reveal to anyone else under any circumstances. only you will know it. no one will be able to figure it out or even know that there is a second password. be aware that an individual intent on obtaining your sensitive information may lie to you and claim to be able to figure this out. they cannot.it is highly recommended that you choose a 64 character password here. if it is difficult to remember a 64 character password, choose an 8 character password and simply repeat it 8 times. a date naturally has exactly 8 numbers, and a significant date in your life repeated 8 times would do just fine.quote24. type in your password twice, and click “next”25. “large files”, select “yes” and click “next”.26. “hidden volume format”, as before move your mouse around for about ten seconds randomly, and tehn click “format”.27. if prompted “a program needs your permission to continue”, select “continue”28. a dialog will come up telling you that the hidden truecrypt volume has been successfully created. click “ok”29. click “exit”congratulations! you have just set up an encrypted file container on your hard drive. anything you store here will be inaccessible to anyone except you. further, you have protected this content with two passwords. one that you will give to someone under threat, and one that only you will know. keep your real password well protected and never write it down or give it to anyone else for any reason.now, we should test both passwords.testing truecrypt volumesonce you have completed the above section, you will be back at truecrypt. go ahead and follow these steps to test the volumes you have made.quote1. click “select file…”2. locate the file you created in the last section, most likely called “random.txt” or something similar. remember that even though there is both an outer anda hidden volume, both volumes are contained in a single file. there are not two files, only one.3. click “open”4. choose a drive letter that you are not using (anything past m is probably just fine). click on that, for example click on “o:” to highlight it.5. click “mount”6. now you are prompted for a password. read the below carefully:the password you provide here will determine which volume is mounted to the drive letter you specified. if you type in your decoy password, then o:\ will show all the files and directories you copied that you would reveal if forced. if you type in your real password, then o:\ will show the files and directories that you never intend anyone to see.7. after successfully typing in your password, you will see additional detail to the right of the drive letter, including the full path to the file you selected as well as the kind of volume it is (for example, hidden).8. right click on your “windows logo”/”start menu” icon, and scroll down to the bottom where you can see your different drive letters. you will see the drive letter you selected, for example: “local disk (o:)”. click on that.9. if you selected your decoy password, you will see all the files and folders that you moved there during the installation phase. if you selected the real password, you will see whatever files and directories you have placed so far into the hidden volume, if any.if you selected your hidden volume password, you may now begin moving any sensitive information you wish. be aware that simply moving it from your main hard disk is not enough. we will discuss how to ensure deleted data is actually deleted later in the guide.“what is happening?”when you select a file and mount it to a drive, you are telling your computer that you have a new drive with files and folders on it. it is the same thing as if you had plugged in a usb flash drive, a removable harddrive, or an sd card into your computer. truecrypt causes your computer to think that there is an entirely new disk drive on your computer. you can use this disk drive just as if it *was* actually a usb flash drive. you can copy files to it, directories, and use it just as you would use a usb flash drive.when you are done, simply close all open windows/folders/applications that are using your truecrypt drive letter, and then click “dismount” from within truecrypt while you have the drive letter highlighted. this will once again hide all of this data, accessible only by re-mounting it with the correct password.very important safety informationwhen a true crypt hidden volume is mounted, someone who has access to your computer can access anything that is inside that hidden volume. if for example you left your computer running while a truecrypt volume was mounted, then if someone gained access to your computer they would be able to see everything you have in that volume. therefore:always remember to dismount any truecrypt volume containing any sensitive information when you are not using your computeryou can tell that it is dismounted because the drive letter inside of “truecrypt”‘s control panel will appear the same as all of the other drive letters, with no information to the right of the drive letter.you should practice mounting and dismounting a few times with both passwords to make sure you understand this process.once you have copied files/folders into the hidden volume, do not touch the files or folders in the outer volume anymore. remember that both volumes occupy the same single file, and therefore changing the outer volume can damage the hidden volume. once you have copied files/folders into the outer volume during the installation process, that is the last time you should do so. from that point forward, use only the hidden volume. the outer volume exists only as a decoy if you need it.
stealth that works - ditch the pe food grade vac sealpost by sierraromeo (which i believe he got off the sr forum ~boogie)>>> wake up call --- food grade pe vac sealing is vapor permeable and detectable in fifteen minutes <<<even triple sealing permeates in a few days so clearly when shipping to countries like australia when items can be in transit for anything up to 20+ days vendors need to up their game and improve their standards.so what is the answer? well happily there are a number of options available right now.all you need to know are:* mbb - moisture barrier bags* mylar bags* heat seal foil bagsa non permeable layer must be included, for example when shipping small quantities of powders the layering can consist of a few variations, it may be a good idea to dispense with the zip lock baggy as the zip can be felt through the envelope. the use of double mbb cleaning each thoroughly with isotropic alcohol to remove any particle traces is one very effective method. the final stage must of course be done in a clean environment to avoid transferring any particle residue to the outer packaging, wear gloves and discard before completing this stage.the best stealth is sometimes the simplest, envelopes must be as flat as possible with all the usual norms that make them blend into the thousands of others going through the system. if an envelope is singled out for extra attention its gone, that usually only happens when a dog reacts to it._____________________________________________________________________________________________________vendors already using these methods are listed below>>> please note that the vendors listed below are done so solely on their use of non permeable stealth packaging techniques as advised by the vendor. no other factors have been considered at this time so you are strongly encouraged to fully research any vendor before placing an order <<<=========================================================================================tba***========================================================================================how is mail sorted:when planning your packaging, take into consideration this procedure which is not specific to a particular country (only applies for letters not parcels) -1. mail arrives into said country in a big sack containing hundreds/thousands of letters.2. if arriving from a "flagged" country its directed to sorting area a in which mail undergoes extra scrutiny, if from non-flagged country its directed to sorting area b for normal manual sorting.3. at the designated sorting area, all the mail is poured onto a sorting tray and manually sorted, with the sorter removing anything thats oversize, damaged or suspicious looking (again there would be guidelines the sorters follow based on profiling and gathered intelligence). over-sized items are sent to the parcel area, damaged items are repaired or destroyed and suspicious letters are inspected further (manual, x-ray or dog)4. once manual sorting is done, the mail is sent down a conveyor belt to the automatic sorting machine, while going down the conveyor belt, a drug detection dog runs over all mail heading down and alerts to letters containing whatever the dog is trained to find, these are in turn removed for further inspection (manual or x-ray) the rest carry on to the machine and are sent for distribution around the country.5. any mail that cant be automatically sorted for distribution (usually due to addresses in the wrong format, hand written messily, too thick to fit etc) are manually sorted again.so using the above information, one case see that the risk areas are - the country of origin, the initial manual sorter, the drug detection dog and the final automatic sorting machine.country of origin - the intelligence on which particular countries the receiving country has "flagged isnt made publicly available but one could assume they include - the netherlands, belgium, colombia, bolivia, peru, china, vietnam, thailand among others. as well as countries added based on intelligence received and profiling.initial mail sorter - has to manually sort hundreds of letters at once, so make sure your letter doesnt attract a second glimpse. ensure you use a high quality envelope, not a cheap one thats thin and soft and likely to tear. ensure it looks harmless and boring from the outside, and ensure its as thin as possible and packaged so the contents cannot be felt if handled and so that if handled, it feels like paper inside, not a foil bag!drug detection dog - use moisture barrier bags! pe and foil layered are the best, followed by pe and mylar. you should be doing your packaging in a clean environment because if any molecules from your product end up on the outside of that bag or on the envelope, youve wasted your time and it will be detected.final automatic sorting machine - make sure the address is clearly readable and in the correct format for that country. make sure your envelope is of a standard size. (see the first post of this thread for standard envelope sizes)use the above information and create your letters how you wish, if you still get any no-shows to a particular country, change what your letters look like because your current ones have been photographed and added to a database. this includes the return address and any identifiable logos etc._____________________________________________________________________________________________________how to ensure your mail goes through the sorting machines without needing to be sorted manually by one of those pesky humans (au specific)the info below is taken from the australia post guidelines for international mail, and theyre based around the specs required for mail to go into the auto sorter machines, if a letter falls outside of these guidelines, theres a much bigger chance it will end up being manually sorted by a person.

glad to be of a help playground  i would aggree with whom that png and jpeg files are always safe since they do now need to be downloaded for viewing.as for pdfs, you can always downloading them onto a usb and either open in a vm or a secondary laptop (burner one) that has absolutely no internet connect will be ideal if worried about javascript being malicious i always like burner laptops. hehetake care and be safe everyone
txt files are the way to go. most of the time, they do not have to be downloaded, rather you can view them the page. i have 100s of clipboard files everywhere. also, its easy to just cut and paste anything you may need.hope this helps playground
this referral link works! never mind
postscript is pretty much an entire programming language in and of itself. i wouldnt remotely consider it a safe document type. text is good.  for anything that wont play well in text form, probably a png of it is the next safest.  goes downhill pretty quickly from there.

hey hubsters i have tons of security tutorials that ive collected over time. i am nerd, and am always a fan of useful guides. i am happy to share with you my collection. ill keep posting as i find them on my computer and when i have time. if you have any, please toss them in. ill try my best to reference them if i can remember ==================================================================================================encrypting your hard drive with truecryptwritten by: verto, owner of evolution market introductionif you save anything on your computer, it is likely that you do not want just anyone to be able to see what you have saved. you want a way to protect that information so that you can access it, and absolutely no one else except those you trust. therefore, it makes sense to set up a system which protects your information and safeguards it against prying eyes.the best such system for this is called “true crypt”. “true crypt” is an encryption software program which allows you to store many files and directories inside of a single file on your harddrive. further, this file is encrypted and no one can actually see what you have saved there unless they know your password.this sounds extremely high tech, but it is actually very easy to set up.setting up truecryptquote1. go to http://www.truecrypt.org/downloads (or go to www.truecrypt.org, and click on “downloads”)2. under “latest stable version”, under “windows 7/vista/xp/2000?, click “download”3. the file will be called “true crypt setup 7.0a.exe” or something similar. run this file.4. if prompted that a program needs your permission to continue, click “continue”.5. check “i accept and agree to be bound by these license terms”6. click “accept”7. ensure that “install” is selected, and click “next”8. click “install”9. you will see a dialog stating “truecrypt has been successfully installed.” click “ok”10. click “no” when asked if you wish to view the tutorial/user’s guide.11. click “finish”at this point, truecrypt is now installed. now we will set up truecrypt so that we can begin using it to store sensitive information.quote1. click the “windows logo”/”start” button on the lower left corner of your screen.2. click “all programs”3. click “truecrypt”4. click the “truecrypt” applicationand now we can begin:quote1. click the button “create volume”2. ensuring that “create an encrypted file container” is selected, click “next”3. select “hidden truecrypt volume” and click “next”.4. ensuring that “normal mode” is selected, click “next”5. click on “select file”note which directory you are in on your computer. look at the top of the dialog that has opened and you will see the path you are in, most likely the home directory for your username. an input box is provided with a flashing cursor asking you to type in a file name. here, you will type in the following filename:random.txt you may of course replace random.txt with anything you like. this file is going to be created and will be used to store many other files inside. do not use a filename for a file that already exists. the idea here is that you are creating an entirely new file.it is also recommended though not required that you “hide” this file somewhere less obvious. if it is in your home directory, then someone who has access to your computer may find it easier. you can also choose to put this file on any other media, it doesn’t have to be your hard disk. you could for example save your truecrypt file to a usb flash drive, an sd card, or some other media. it is up to you.quote6. once you have typed in the file name, click “save”7. make sure “never save history” is checked.8. click “next”9. on the “outer volume” screen, click “next” again.10. the default encryption algorithm and hash algorithm are fine. click “next”11. choose a file size.in order to benefit the most from this guide, you should have at least 10 gigabytes of free disk space. if not, then it is worth it for you to purchase some form of media (such as a removable harddrive, a large sd card, etc.) in order to proceed. truecrypt can be used on all forms of digital media not just your hard disk. if you choose to proceed without obtaining at least ten gigabytes of disk space, then select a size that you are comfortable with (such as 100 mb).ideally, you want to choose enough space to work with. i recommend 20 gb at least. remember that if you do need more space later, you can always create additional truecrypt volumes using exactly these same steps.quote12. now you are prompted for a password. this is very important. read this carefullyread this section carefullythe password you choose here is a decoy password. that means, this is the password you would give to someone under duress. suppose that someone suspects that you were accessing sensitive information and they threaten to beat you or worse if you do not reveal the password. this is the password that you give to them. when you give someone this password, it will be nearly impossible for them to prove that it is not the right password. further, they cannot even know that there is a second password.here are some tips for your password:a. choose a password you will never forget. it may be ten years from now that you need it. make it simple, like your birthday repeated three times.b. make sure it seems reasonable, that it appears to be a real password. if the password is something stupid like “123? then they may not believe you.c. remember that this is a password that you would give to someone if forced. it is *not* your actual password.d. do not make this password too similar to what you plan to really use. you do not want someone to guess your main password from this one.and with all of this in mind, choose your password. when you have typed it in twice, click “next”.quote13. “large files”, here you are asked whether or not you plan to store files larger than 4 gigabytes. choose “no” and click “next”14. “outer volume format”, here you will notice some random numbers and letters next to where it says “random pool”. go ahead and move your mouse around fora bit. this will increase the randomness and give you better encryption. after about ten seconds of this, click “format”.15. depending on the file size you selected, it will take some time to finish formatting.“what is happening?”truecrypt is creating the file you asked it to, such as “random.txt”. it is building a file system contained entirely within that one file. this file system can be used to store files, directories, and more. further, it is encrypting this file system in such a way that without the right password it will be impossible for anyone to access it. to *anyone* other than you, this file will appear to be just a mess of random characters. no one will even know that it is a truecrypt volume.quote16. “outer volume contents”, click on the button called, “open outer volume”an empty folder has opened up. this is empty because you have yet to put any files into your truecrypt volume.do not put any sensitive content herethis is the “decoy”. this is what someone would see if you gave them the password you used in the previous step. this is not where you are going to store your sensitive data. if you have been forced into a situation where you had to reveal your password to some individual, then that individual will see whatever is in this folder. you need to have data in this folder that appears to be sensitive enough to be protected by truecrypt in order to fool them. here are some important tips to keep in mind:a. do not use porn. adult models can sometimes appear to be underaged, and this can cause you to incriminate yourself unintentionally.b. do not use drawings/renderings/writings of porn. in many jurisdictions, these are just as illegal as photographs.c. good choices for what to put here include: backups of documents, emails, financial documents, etc.d. once you have placed files into this folder, *never* place any more files in the future. doing so may damage your hidden content.generally, you want to store innocent data where some individual looking at it would find no cause against you, and yet at the same time they would understand why you used truecrypt to secure that data.now, go ahead and find files and store them in this folder. be sure that you leave at least ten gigabytes free. the more the better.when you are all done copying files into this folder, close the folder by clicking the “x” in the top right corner.quote17. click “next”18. if prompted that “a program needs your permission to continue”, click “continue”19. “hidden volume”, click “next”20. the default encryption and hash algorithms are fine, click “next”21. “hidden volume size”, the maximum available space is indicated in bold below the text box. round down to the nearest full unit. for example, if 19.97 gbis available, select 19 gb. if 12.0 gb are available, select 11 gb.22. if a warning dialog comes up, asking “are you sure you wish to continue”, select “yes”23. “hidden volume password”important read thishere you are going to select the real password. this is the password you will never reveal to anyone else under any circumstances. only you will know it. no one will be able to figure it out or even know that there is a second password. be aware that an individual intent on obtaining your sensitive information may lie to you and claim to be able to figure this out. they cannot.it is highly recommended that you choose a 64 character password here. if it is difficult to remember a 64 character password, choose an 8 character password and simply repeat it 8 times. a date naturally has exactly 8 numbers, and a significant date in your life repeated 8 times would do just fine.quote24. type in your password twice, and click “next”25. “large files”, select “yes” and click “next”.26. “hidden volume format”, as before move your mouse around for about ten seconds randomly, and tehn click “format”.27. if prompted “a program needs your permission to continue”, select “continue”28. a dialog will come up telling you that the hidden truecrypt volume has been successfully created. click “ok”29. click “exit”congratulations! you have just set up an encrypted file container on your hard drive. anything you store here will be inaccessible to anyone except you. further, you have protected this content with two passwords. one that you will give to someone under threat, and one that only you will know. keep your real password well protected and never write it down or give it to anyone else for any reason.now, we should test both passwords.testing truecrypt volumesonce you have completed the above section, you will be back at truecrypt. go ahead and follow these steps to test the volumes you have made.quote1. click “select file…”2. locate the file you created in the last section, most likely called “random.txt” or something similar. remember that even though there is both an outer anda hidden volume, both volumes are contained in a single file. there are not two files, only one.3. click “open”4. choose a drive letter that you are not using (anything past m is probably just fine). click on that, for example click on “o:” to highlight it.5. click “mount”6. now you are prompted for a password. read the below carefully:the password you provide here will determine which volume is mounted to the drive letter you specified. if you type in your decoy password, then o:\ will show all the files and directories you copied that you would reveal if forced. if you type in your real password, then o:\ will show the files and directories that you never intend anyone to see.7. after successfully typing in your password, you will see additional detail to the right of the drive letter, including the full path to the file you selected as well as the kind of volume it is (for example, hidden).8. right click on your “windows logo”/”start menu” icon, and scroll down to the bottom where you can see your different drive letters. you will see the drive letter you selected, for example: “local disk (o:)”. click on that.9. if you selected your decoy password, you will see all the files and folders that you moved there during the installation phase. if you selected the real password, you will see whatever files and directories you have placed so far into the hidden volume, if any.if you selected your hidden volume password, you may now begin moving any sensitive information you wish. be aware that simply moving it from your main hard disk is not enough. we will discuss how to ensure deleted data is actually deleted later in the guide.“what is happening?”when you select a file and mount it to a drive, you are telling your computer that you have a new drive with files and folders on it. it is the same thing as if you had plugged in a usb flash drive, a removable harddrive, or an sd card into your computer. truecrypt causes your computer to think that there is an entirely new disk drive on your computer. you can use this disk drive just as if it *was* actually a usb flash drive. you can copy files to it, directories, and use it just as you would use a usb flash drive.when you are done, simply close all open windows/folders/applications that are using your truecrypt drive letter, and then click “dismount” from within truecrypt while you have the drive letter highlighted. this will once again hide all of this data, accessible only by re-mounting it with the correct password.very important safety informationwhen a true crypt hidden volume is mounted, someone who has access to your computer can access anything that is inside that hidden volume. if for example you left your computer running while a truecrypt volume was mounted, then if someone gained access to your computer they would be able to see everything you have in that volume. therefore:always remember to dismount any truecrypt volume containing any sensitive information when you are not using your computeryou can tell that it is dismounted because the drive letter inside of “truecrypt”‘s control panel will appear the same as all of the other drive letters, with no information to the right of the drive letter.you should practice mounting and dismounting a few times with both passwords to make sure you understand this process.once you have copied files/folders into the hidden volume, do not touch the files or folders in the outer volume anymore. remember that both volumes occupy the same single file, and therefore changing the outer volume can damage the hidden volume. once you have copied files/folders into the outer volume during the installation process, that is the last time you should do so. from that point forward, use only the hidden volume. the outer volume exists only as a decoy if you need it.

(when you receive a letter than doesnt have one of those faint orange barcodes on it, it means its been manually sorted. this doesnt apply to bulk mail that big companies send out to 1000s of people though)recommended envelope sizes and max weight and thickness -small letter -dl 110 mm × 220 mm 125g maxc6 114 mm × 162 mm 125g maxno more than 5mm thicklarge letter -c5 162 mm × 229 mm 125g maxc4 324 mm × 229 mm 250g maxb4 353 mm × 250 mm 250g maxno more than 20mm thickenvelope quality - white 100gsm paperaddress font - courier or helvetica font - 12 point or 10 pitchit should contain no full stops or commas or other punctuation. you can use / but its recommended not to.there should be no advertising/logos etc near the address.the street number should be 2 spaces away from the unit/suite numberthe suburb and country should be in capitalsthe post code should be 2 spaces away from the statecharacters should be between 2mm & 4mm talland between 0.3mm & 7mm widethe space between lines from 1mm to 2.5mmaddress example -john smithsuite 10 52 silk roadport headland wa 3001australiasome of these things are going to the extreme and probably not necessary, besides, the huge majority of orders make it without any issues anyway but if you want perfection, this is where its at.guideline books (see these for the correct address layouts and where stamps, addresses and logos etc should/shouldnt be placed. -http://auspost.com.au/media/documents/l ... -guide.pdfhttp://auspost.com.au/media/documents/i ... -guide.pdfeducational video about the mail process (clearnet) -http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wumr2qpqp8_____________________________________________________________________________________________________some important info for vendors from farmer bob. very useful in terms of picking the right packaging and cleaning the surface to ensure any traces have been removed.[author=farmerbob link=topic=76.msg62827#msg62827 date=1385533965]im glad to see this is finally getting adopted but theres a lot of misinformation going around.#1 ignore mylar & foil!! only use laminates that were designed and manufactured to be used as moisture barrier bagging. mbbs are a subset of "mylar" but mylar does not equate to mbb. many products that are referred to as mylar and maybe even look and feel just like mbbs are not suitable for use here. beware of product substitution.#2 dont use irons, curling irons, or food vac sealers. they wont give you the consistency & quality of an impulse sealer. get a quality impulse sealer (5mm+ width) and read online how to check seal quality. you should be able to see the outline of the seal-line insulation fabric imprinted on one side. bond some pieces and pull, the bag should tear rather than the seal peeling apart. once you get your heat setting where you like it keep it there but re-check it every few hundred seals.#3 leave some air in the package, clean in in a sink with detergent/soap and rinse in bleachwater. when its in the detergent sink squeeze the bags to look for air leakage, no bubble should come out. before you pull them out of the bleach bucket wash your hands well. at this point neither a bloodhound nor a mass spectrometer will pick up a scent from any enclosed drugs provided you dont re-contaminate the bag or contaminate the mailing materials.#4: purchase mbbs from wherever you like, plutopete, amazon, ebay, etc (anonymously). there are survivalists, hobbyists, and plenty of small businesses that buy these. they went out of style with the big-time smugglers decades ago. purchasing them wont be suspicious and its perfectly legal.removing trace particles properly:[author=farmerbob link=topic=76.msg68691#msg68691 date=1385853735]the "right" way to do it is to ensure you wash off both polar and nopolar surface contaminants.. so detergent wash followed by ipa and/or acetone followed by deionized water rinse would be the technique youd use if you could do it properly. the issue is "do it properly" good cleanroom surface cleaning technique is difficult to master. you have to wipe in one direction only and rotate the rag as you wipe, or you have to spray the bag from the top down and let gravity wash the contamination down. the risk is that most people, even trained "professionals" cleaning with alcohol will simply smear contamination around and not actually remove it.sodium hypochlorite bleach (clorox in north america) is probably a better choice for the masses. bleach will oxidize most organic molecules. residues that are left behind after a detergent wash will react with the bleach in the bucket the oxidized byproducts would likely pass even careful laboratory analysis (ms swab test).an alternative for the lazy is to just throw the packs in your dishwasher with a splash of bleach. ive done that when i was vending and i had a lot of weed orders to go out and didnt feel like spending too much time cleaning them. in my case i used a peroxide bleach but everyone else should be fine with clorox.

==================================================================================================encrypting your hard drive with truecryptwritten by: verto, owner of evolution market introductionif you save anything on your computer, it is likely that you do not want just anyone to be able to see what you have saved. you want a way to protect that information so that you can access it, and absolutely no one else except those you trust. therefore, it makes sense to set up a system which protects your information and safeguards it against prying eyes.the best such system for this is called “true crypt”. “true crypt” is an encryption software program which allows you to store many files and directories inside of a single file on your harddrive. further, this file is encrypted and no one can actually see what you have saved there unless they know your password.this sounds extremely high tech, but it is actually very easy to set up.setting up truecryptquote1. go to http://www.truecrypt.org/downloads (or go to www.truecrypt.org, and click on “downloads”)2. under “latest stable version”, under “windows 7/vista/xp/2000?, click “download”3. the file will be called “true crypt setup 7.0a.exe” or something similar. run this file.4. if prompted that a program needs your permission to continue, click “continue”.5. check “i accept and agree to be bound by these license terms”6. click “accept”7. ensure that “install” is selected, and click “next”8. click “install”9. you will see a dialog stating “truecrypt has been successfully installed.” click “ok”10. click “no” when asked if you wish to view the tutorial/user’s guide.11. click “finish”at this point, truecrypt is now installed. now we will set up truecrypt so that we can begin using it to store sensitive information.quote1. click the “windows logo”/”start” button on the lower left corner of your screen.2. click “all programs”3. click “truecrypt”4. click the “truecrypt” applicationand now we can begin:quote1. click the button “create volume”2. ensuring that “create an encrypted file container” is selected, click “next”3. select “hidden truecrypt volume” and click “next”.4. ensuring that “normal mode” is selected, click “next”5. click on “select file”note which directory you are in on your computer. look at the top of the dialog that has opened and you will see the path you are in, most likely the home directory for your username. an input box is provided with a flashing cursor asking you to type in a file name. here, you will type in the following filename:random.txt you may of course replace random.txt with anything you like. this file is going to be created and will be used to store many other files inside. do not use a filename for a file that already exists. the idea here is that you are creating an entirely new file.it is also recommended though not required that you “hide” this file somewhere less obvious. if it is in your home directory, then someone who has access to your computer may find it easier. you can also choose to put this file on any other media, it doesn’t have to be your hard disk. you could for example save your truecrypt file to a usb flash drive, an sd card, or some other media. it is up to you.quote6. once you have typed in the file name, click “save”7. make sure “never save history” is checked.8. click “next”9. on the “outer volume” screen, click “next” again.10. the default encryption algorithm and hash algorithm are fine. click “next”11. choose a file size.in order to benefit the most from this guide, you should have at least 10 gigabytes of free disk space. if not, then it is worth it for you to purchase some form of media (such as a removable harddrive, a large sd card, etc.) in order to proceed. truecrypt can be used on all forms of digital media not just your hard disk. if you choose to proceed without obtaining at least ten gigabytes of disk space, then select a size that you are comfortable with (such as 100 mb).ideally, you want to choose enough space to work with. i recommend 20 gb at least. remember that if you do need more space later, you can always create additional truecrypt volumes using exactly these same steps.quote12. now you are prompted for a password. this is very important. read this carefullyread this section carefullythe password you choose here is a decoy password. that means, this is the password you would give to someone under duress. suppose that someone suspects that you were accessing sensitive information and they threaten to beat you or worse if you do not reveal the password. this is the password that you give to them. when you give someone this password, it will be nearly impossible for them to prove that it is not the right password. further, they cannot even know that there is a second password.here are some tips for your password:a. choose a password you will never forget. it may be ten years from now that you need it. make it simple, like your birthday repeated three times.b. make sure it seems reasonable, that it appears to be a real password. if the password is something stupid like “123? then they may not believe you.c. remember that this is a password that you would give to someone if forced. it is *not* your actual password.d. do not make this password too similar to what you plan to really use. you do not want someone to guess your main password from this one.and with all of this in mind, choose your password. when you have typed it in twice, click “next”.quote13. “large files”, here you are asked whether or not you plan to store files larger than 4 gigabytes. choose “no” and click “next”14. “outer volume format”, here you will notice some random numbers and letters next to where it says “random pool”. go ahead and move your mouse around fora bit. this will increase the randomness and give you better encryption. after about ten seconds of this, click “format”.15. depending on the file size you selected, it will take some time to finish formatting.“what is happening?”truecrypt is creating the file you asked it to, such as “random.txt”. it is building a file system contained entirely within that one file. this file system can be used to store files, directories, and more. further, it is encrypting this file system in such a way that without the right password it will be impossible for anyone to access it. to *anyone* other than you, this file will appear to be just a mess of random characters. no one will even know that it is a truecrypt volume.quote16. “outer volume contents”, click on the button called, “open outer volume”an empty folder has opened up. this is empty because you have yet to put any files into your truecrypt volume.do not put any sensitive content herethis is the “decoy”. this is what someone would see if you gave them the password you used in the previous step. this is not where you are going to store your sensitive data. if you have been forced into a situation where you had to reveal your password to some individual, then that individual will see whatever is in this folder. you need to have data in this folder that appears to be sensitive enough to be protected by truecrypt in order to fool them. here are some important tips to keep in mind:a. do not use porn. adult models can sometimes appear to be underaged, and this can cause you to incriminate yourself unintentionally.b. do not use drawings/renderings/writings of porn. in many jurisdictions, these are just as illegal as photographs.c. good choices for what to put here include: backups of documents, emails, financial documents, etc.d. once you have placed files into this folder, *never* place any more files in the future. doing so may damage your hidden content.generally, you want to store innocent data where some individual looking at it would find no cause against you, and yet at the same time they would understand why you used truecrypt to secure that data.now, go ahead and find files and store them in this folder. be sure that you leave at least ten gigabytes free. the more the better.when you are all done copying files into this folder, close the folder by clicking the “x” in the top right corner.quote17. click “next”18. if prompted that “a program needs your permission to continue”, click “continue”19. “hidden volume”, click “next”20. the default encryption and hash algorithms are fine, click “next”21. “hidden volume size”, the maximum available space is indicated in bold below the text box. round down to the nearest full unit. for example, if 19.97 gbis available, select 19 gb. if 12.0 gb are available, select 11 gb.22. if a warning dialog comes up, asking “are you sure you wish to continue”, select “yes”23. “hidden volume password”important read thishere you are going to select the real password. this is the password you will never reveal to anyone else under any circumstances. only you will know it. no one will be able to figure it out or even know that there is a second password. be aware that an individual intent on obtaining your sensitive information may lie to you and claim to be able to figure this out. they cannot.it is highly recommended that you choose a 64 character password here. if it is difficult to remember a 64 character password, choose an 8 character password and simply repeat it 8 times. a date naturally has exactly 8 numbers, and a significant date in your life repeated 8 times would do just fine.quote24. type in your password twice, and click “next”25. “large files”, select “yes” and click “next”.26. “hidden volume format”, as before move your mouse around for about ten seconds randomly, and tehn click “format”.27. if prompted “a program needs your permission to continue”, select “continue”28. a dialog will come up telling you that the hidden truecrypt volume has been successfully created. click “ok”29. click “exit”congratulations! you have just set up an encrypted file container on your hard drive. anything you store here will be inaccessible to anyone except you. further, you have protected this content with two passwords. one that you will give to someone under threat, and one that only you will know. keep your real password well protected and never write it down or give it to anyone else for any reason.now, we should test both passwords.testing truecrypt volumesonce you have completed the above section, you will be back at truecrypt. go ahead and follow these steps to test the volumes you have made.quote1. click “select file…”2. locate the file you created in the last section, most likely called “random.txt” or something similar. remember that even though there is both an outer anda hidden volume, both volumes are contained in a single file. there are not two files, only one.3. click “open”4. choose a drive letter that you are not using (anything past m is probably just fine). click on that, for example click on “o:” to highlight it.5. click “mount”6. now you are prompted for a password. read the below carefully:the password you provide here will determine which volume is mounted to the drive letter you specified. if you type in your decoy password, then o:\ will show all the files and directories you copied that you would reveal if forced. if you type in your real password, then o:\ will show the files and directories that you never intend anyone to see.7. after successfully typing in your password, you will see additional detail to the right of the drive letter, including the full path to the file you selected as well as the kind of volume it is (for example, hidden).8. right click on your “windows logo”/”start menu” icon, and scroll down to the bottom where you can see your different drive letters. you will see the drive letter you selected, for example: “local disk (o:)”. click on that.9. if you selected your decoy password, you will see all the files and folders that you moved there during the installation phase. if you selected the real password, you will see whatever files and directories you have placed so far into the hidden volume, if any.if you selected your hidden volume password, you may now begin moving any sensitive information you wish. be aware that simply moving it from your main hard disk is not enough. we will discuss how to ensure deleted data is actually deleted later in the guide.“what is happening?”when you select a file and mount it to a drive, you are telling your computer that you have a new drive with files and folders on it. it is the same thing as if you had plugged in a usb flash drive, a removable harddrive, or an sd card into your computer. truecrypt causes your computer to think that there is an entirely new disk drive on your computer. you can use this disk drive just as if it *was* actually a usb flash drive. you can copy files to it, directories, and use it just as you would use a usb flash drive.when you are done, simply close all open windows/folders/applications that are using your truecrypt drive letter, and then click “dismount” from within truecrypt while you have the drive letter highlighted. this will once again hide all of this data, accessible only by re-mounting it with the correct password.very important safety informationwhen a true crypt hidden volume is mounted, someone who has access to your computer can access anything that is inside that hidden volume. if for example you left your computer running while a truecrypt volume was mounted, then if someone gained access to your computer they would be able to see everything you have in that volume. therefore:always remember to dismount any truecrypt volume containing any sensitive information when you are not using your computeryou can tell that it is dismounted because the drive letter inside of “truecrypt”‘s control panel will appear the same as all of the other drive letters, with no information to the right of the drive letter.you should practice mounting and dismounting a few times with both passwords to make sure you understand this process.once you have copied files/folders into the hidden volume, do not touch the files or folders in the outer volume anymore. remember that both volumes occupy the same single file, and therefore changing the outer volume can damage the hidden volume. once you have copied files/folders into the outer volume during the installation process, that is the last time you should do so. from that point forward, use only the hidden volume. the outer volume exists only as a decoy if you need it.be very careful encrypting your laptop with truecrypt full disk encryption unless you want a toaster. some laptops like hp have bios issues and can not use truecrypt fde.  also, you can always just replace the os with a linux distro that has built in fde.
very good point axa. i appreciate you adding that on.do you have any tuts also? feel free to post any my friend
tails stands for "the amnesiac incognito live system". tails is a live system that aims at preserving your privacy and anonymity. it helps you to use the internet anonymously almost anywhere you go and on any computer but leave no trace using unless you ask it explicitly. it is a complete operating-system designed to be used from a dvd or a usb stick independently of the computers original operating system. it is free software and based on debian gnu/linux.tails comes with several built-in applications pre-configured with security in mind: web browser, instant messaging client, email client, office suite, image and sound editor, etc. tails relies on the tor anonymity network to protect your privacy online: the pre-installed software is configured to connect through tor, and direct (non-anonymous) connections are blocked.tails is being constantly updated for security flaws - you will need to do this all over again soon to stay safe! this comes from the tails website - "its very important to keep your version of tails up-to-date, otherwise your system will be vulnerable to numerous security holes. the development team is doing its best to release new versions fixing known security holes on a regular basis."you will need 2 x 8gb usb thumb drives (4gb may pass), they are very cheap and available almost everywhere.1 - download the latest version of the tails .iso file from here - remember where you save it - https://tails.boum.org/download/index.en.html1a - if you are an advanced user, you can download the cryptographic signature on this same page and then verify the download with the tails key from here - https://tails.boum.org/tails-signing.key2 - download the latest version of the linux universal-usb-installer from here - http://www.pendrivelinux.com/universal-usb-installer-easy-as-1-2-3/3 - run the newly downloaded universal-usb-installer3a - read and agree to the disclaimer3b - select "tails" from the first drop-down list, its towards the end of the list (step 1)3c - browse to and select the tails .iso file (step 2)3d - select your usb drive letter (format the drive if its not empty already) (step 3)3e - click create button then wait for it to finish. will be a few minutes at least.4 - restart the computer and boot into tails from the usb drive (see below for details on booting from a usb drive)booting from a usb drive:if it does not automatically boot to the usb drive, you need to select the boot order, some newer computers will allow you to select which drive to boot to with a small menu, without changing bios settings. you might instead need to edit the bios settings, restart your computer, and watch for a message telling you which key to press to enter the bios setup. it will usually be one of f1, f2, del, esc or f10. press this key while your computer is booting to edit your bios settings. you need to edit the boot order. depending on your computer you should see an entry for removable drive or usb media. move this to the top of the list to force the computer to attempt to boot from usb before booting from the hard disk. save your changes and continue.many flash drives ship usb-fdd formatted and some systems will not detect or even boot usb-fdd. most systems can however boot usb-zip, and or usb-hdd. if you are having a hard time getting your bios to detect your flash drive, you can try to format it as usb-hdd or usb-zip using the bootice program (or similar). (caution - this is a very advanced program! use with caution - follow links for the latest version) http://www.pendriveapps.com/bootice-partition-flash-drive-edit-boot-sector/for more detailed instruction on how to boot from usb you can read http://pcsupport.about.com/od/tipstricks/ht/bootusbflash.htmif you have problems accessing the bios, read this http://www.pendrivelinux.com/how-to-access-bios/any other questions, ask away. or pm.i will not accept donations for this tutorial, i offer this only in hope that more people will start using tor. if you have excess bitcoins you feel like donating to a worthy cause, please send them to tor or tails... https://www.torproject.org/donate/donate.html.en https://tails.boum.org/contribute/how/donate/#bitcoinnext up: installing a persistent volume alongside a liveusb copy of tails (this is why you need two usb drives)5 - you should now be presented with a log in prompt for a temporary session administration password - this is reset every time you load tails, it is optional to enter this, it is used to allow current session access to system functions, if you get any errors about access rights try using an admin password at log in. also at this point you can optionally select to use a windows xp camo skin to make tails look more like xp if youre in a public place for example, this is also optional.7 - once tails is up and running, insert the second usb drive. click the applications/accessories menu, then highlight tails, then click tails usb installer.7a - click the 1st option "clone & install"7b - select your target device from the drop-down menu (your second usb drive!)7c - click next, then wait for it to finish (however long to copy about 1gb to a usb drive - usually a few minutes). this will install a new copy of tails onto your second usb drive, this will be your new proper tails usb.8 - shutdown this session of tails with the power button up in the right-hand corner. dont forget to take out the first usb you created and boot into the new second tails usb! you can format the first usb drive later on, that copy of tails is no longer required.9 - log in to the new tails usb, once logged in click the applications menu, then highlight the system tools sub-menu, then click on "configure persistent volume". (the size of the persistent volume is automatically determined by how much left over space is on the usb drive after installing tails in the previous steps.)9a - choose your pass-phrase for the persistent volume - you will need to enter this every time you login to tails. the persistent volume is an encrypted partition protected by a pass-phrase. once the persistent volume is created, you can choose to activate it or not each time you start tails. it is a good place to store sensitive materials. when choosing your pass-phrase remember that short, easily guessed pass-phrases are very easily cracked - it would take one intel i7 2600k cpu over 200,000,000 years to brute-force crack an aes-256 encrypted 32 random character pass-phrase using lowercase, uppercase, 0-9 & "$p3c|4!" characters   )9b - click "create" and wait for it to finish.9c - on completion, a window will popup allowing you to select what tails will save in the new persistent volume automatically, internet shortcuts, pgp keys, nudie pictures, application settings etc... i recommend selecting everything.10 - close and reboot with your modem plugged in and switched on, log back into tails with your new persistent volume.11 - make sure your modem is plugged in and turned on! click the system menu, then highlight the preferences submenu, then click on network connections. now, only you know what type of internet connection you pay for, i cannot help you with that! my personal internet connection was amazingly simple to setup (i was quite surprised by its pre-configured setups, it has many different countries options for local telcos pre-installed).another note - tails is pre-configured to go through tor! it is pre-installed with vidalia and a torified browser called iceweasel. it should automatically open up when connected to the internet. if not, use the iceweasel browser menu shortcut to get onto the road. also, this operating system is not persistent for security measures, meaning that any changes you make (that are not saved in the persistent volume) will not be saved on restarting tails! you are now finished! feel free to click through all the menus and play with the applications.
up v down is only relevant if the server is actually down. the issues are more than likely too much traffic on the server or ddos right?
am i just being impatient? have it set to connect to 56ckl5obj37gypcu.onion this worked fine before my temp leave. should i just wait it out for the connection? i have tried other servers and they did not connect either. any advice would be greatly appreciated!cheers, rhett
also is it really that bad to just auto connect? being as i am already connected thru a tor node?
agora seems to allow their vendors who require feing a lot of lattitude when those vendors are then called out as scammers-both on the review page and in the forums.  also, i have no idea who you can talk to about a vendor that has scammed you, nor i am sure what it takes for them to be banned or at least have their vendor page suspended.however, at least agora has escrow as an option.still waiting for that on sr2, which seems to be nothing but scamming vendors

good guide +1 to you. ive always heard about tails but never knew really what it was until now. ill be doing this very soon thanks
tails stands for "the amnesiac incognito live system". tails is a live system that aims at preserving your privacy and anonymity. it helps you to use the internet anonymously almost anywhere you go and on any computer but leave no trace using unless you ask it explicitly. it is a complete operating-system designed to be used from a dvd or a usb stick independently of the computers original operating system. it is free software and based on debian gnu/linux.tails comes with several built-in applications pre-configured with security in mind: web browser, instant messaging client, email client, office suite, image and sound editor, etc. tails relies on the tor anonymity network to protect your privacy online: the pre-installed software is configured to connect through tor, and direct (non-anonymous) connections are blocked.tails is being constantly updated for security flaws - you will need to do this all over again soon to stay safe! this comes from the tails website - "its very important to keep your version of tails up-to-date, otherwise your system will be vulnerable to numerous security holes. the development team is doing its best to release new versions fixing known security holes on a regular basis."you will need 2 x 8gb usb thumb drives (4gb may pass), they are very cheap and available almost everywhere.1 - download the latest version of the tails .iso file from here - remember where you save it - https://tails.boum.org/download/index.en.html1a - if you are an advanced user, you can download the cryptographic signature on this same page and then verify the download with the tails key from here - https://tails.boum.org/tails-signing.key2 - download the latest version of the linux universal-usb-installer from here - http://www.pendrivelinux.com/universal-usb-installer-easy-as-1-2-3/3 - run the newly downloaded universal-usb-installer3a - read and agree to the disclaimer3b - select "tails" from the first drop-down list, its towards the end of the list (step 1)3c - browse to and select the tails .iso file (step 2)3d - select your usb drive letter (format the drive if its not empty already) (step 3)3e - click create button then wait for it to finish. will be a few minutes at least.4 - restart the computer and boot into tails from the usb drive (see below for details on booting from a usb drive)booting from a usb drive:if it does not automatically boot to the usb drive, you need to select the boot order, some newer computers will allow you to select which drive to boot to with a small menu, without changing bios settings. you might instead need to edit the bios settings, restart your computer, and watch for a message telling you which key to press to enter the bios setup. it will usually be one of f1, f2, del, esc or f10. press this key while your computer is booting to edit your bios settings. you need to edit the boot order. depending on your computer you should see an entry for removable drive or usb media. move this to the top of the list to force the computer to attempt to boot from usb before booting from the hard disk. save your changes and continue.many flash drives ship usb-fdd formatted and some systems will not detect or even boot usb-fdd. most systems can however boot usb-zip, and or usb-hdd. if you are having a hard time getting your bios to detect your flash drive, you can try to format it as usb-hdd or usb-zip using the bootice program (or similar). (caution - this is a very advanced program! use with caution - follow links for the latest version) http://www.pendriveapps.com/bootice-partition-flash-drive-edit-boot-sector/for more detailed instruction on how to boot from usb you can read http://pcsupport.about.com/od/tipstricks/ht/bootusbflash.htmif you have problems accessing the bios, read this http://www.pendrivelinux.com/how-to-access-bios/any other questions, ask away. or pm.i will not accept donations for this tutorial, i offer this only in hope that more people will start using tor. if you have excess bitcoins you feel like donating to a worthy cause, please send them to tor or tails... https://www.torproject.org/donate/donate.html.en https://tails.boum.org/contribute/how/donate/#bitcoinnext up: installing a persistent volume alongside a liveusb copy of tails (this is why you need two usb drives)5 - you should now be presented with a log in prompt for a temporary session administration password - this is reset every time you load tails, it is optional to enter this, it is used to allow current session access to system functions, if you get any errors about access rights try using an admin password at log in. also at this point you can optionally select to use a windows xp camo skin to make tails look more like xp if youre in a public place for example, this is also optional.7 - once tails is up and running, insert the second usb drive. click the applications/accessories menu, then highlight tails, then click tails usb installer.7a - click the 1st option "clone & install"7b - select your target device from the drop-down menu (your second usb drive!)7c - click next, then wait for it to finish (however long to copy about 1gb to a usb drive - usually a few minutes). this will install a new copy of tails onto your second usb drive, this will be your new proper tails usb.8 - shutdown this session of tails with the power button up in the right-hand corner. dont forget to take out the first usb you created and boot into the new second tails usb! you can format the first usb drive later on, that copy of tails is no longer required.9 - log in to the new tails usb, once logged in click the applications menu, then highlight the system tools sub-menu, then click on "configure persistent volume". (the size of the persistent volume is automatically determined by how much left over space is on the usb drive after installing tails in the previous steps.)9a - choose your pass-phrase for the persistent volume - you will need to enter this every time you login to tails. the persistent volume is an encrypted partition protected by a pass-phrase. once the persistent volume is created, you can choose to activate it or not each time you start tails. it is a good place to store sensitive materials. when choosing your pass-phrase remember that short, easily guessed pass-phrases are very easily cracked - it would take one intel i7 2600k cpu over 200,000,000 years to brute-force crack an aes-256 encrypted 32 random character pass-phrase using lowercase, uppercase, 0-9 & "$p3c|4!" characters   )9b - click "create" and wait for it to finish.9c - on completion, a window will popup allowing you to select what tails will save in the new persistent volume automatically, internet shortcuts, pgp keys, nudie pictures, application settings etc... i recommend selecting everything.10 - close and reboot with your modem plugged in and switched on, log back into tails with your new persistent volume.11 - make sure your modem is plugged in and turned on! click the system menu, then highlight the preferences submenu, then click on network connections. now, only you know what type of internet connection you pay for, i cannot help you with that! my personal internet connection was amazingly simple to setup (i was quite surprised by its pre-configured setups, it has many different countries options for local telcos pre-installed).another note - tails is pre-configured to go through tor! it is pre-installed with vidalia and a torified browser called iceweasel. it should automatically open up when connected to the internet. if not, use the iceweasel browser menu shortcut to get onto the road. also, this operating system is not persistent for security measures, meaning that any changes you make (that are not saved in the persistent volume) will not be saved on restarting tails! you are now finished! feel free to click through all the menus and play with the applications.
agora seems to allow their vendors who require feing a lot of lattitude when those vendors are then called out as scammers-both on the review page and in the forums.  also, i have no idea who you can talk to about a vendor that has scammed you, nor i am sure what it takes for them to be banned or at least have their vendor page suspended.however, at least agora has escrow as an option.still waiting for that on sr2, which seems to be nothing but scamming vendors
will do when i have spare coins from my next orderi think erowid.org is also worth mentioning! its just great what they are doing!
im definitely into kicking down some coin when orders start coming in, hell any vendor that comes from agora or whatever other godawful market and starts doing business here could be doing this and still be making more loot than before as theyre no longer paying bonds/fees/commissions/etc.
seconding supporting erowid, i cant imagine how many terrible trips, bad combinations, hospitalizations and deaths have been prevented by them. plus if you send them a good-sized donation theyve got some cool psychedelic poetry magnets and glass molecules theyll send your way!

quote from: boogie on may 07, 2014, 11:34:03 pmhey hubsters i have tons of security tutorials that ive collected over time. i am nerd, and am always a fan of useful guides. i am happy to share with you my collection. ill keep posting as i find them on my computer and when i have time. if you have any, please toss them in. ill try my best to reference them if i can remember ==================================================================================================encrypting your hard drive with truecryptwritten by: verto, owner of evolution market introductionif you save anything on your computer, it is likely that you do not want just anyone to be able to see what you have saved. you want a way to protect that information so that you can access it, and absolutely no one else except those you trust. therefore, it makes sense to set up a system which protects your information and safeguards it against prying eyes.the best such system for this is called “true crypt”. “true crypt” is an encryption software program which allows you to store many files and directories inside of a single file on your harddrive. further, this file is encrypted and no one can actually see what you have saved there unless they know your password.this sounds extremely high tech, but it is actually very easy to set up.setting up truecryptquote1. go to http://www.truecrypt.org/downloads (or go to www.truecrypt.org, and click on “downloads”)2. under “latest stable version”, under “windows 7/vista/xp/2000?, click “download”3. the file will be called “true crypt setup 7.0a.exe” or something similar. run this file.4. if prompted that a program needs your permission to continue, click “continue”.5. check “i accept and agree to be bound by these license terms”6. click “accept”7. ensure that “install” is selected, and click “next”8. click “install”9. you will see a dialog stating “truecrypt has been successfully installed.” click “ok”10. click “no” when asked if you wish to view the tutorial/user’s guide.11. click “finish”at this point, truecrypt is now installed. now we will set up truecrypt so that we can begin using it to store sensitive information.quote1. click the “windows logo”/”start” button on the lower left corner of your screen.2. click “all programs”3. click “truecrypt”4. click the “truecrypt” applicationand now we can begin:quote1. click the button “create volume”2. ensuring that “create an encrypted file container” is selected, click “next”3. select “hidden truecrypt volume” and click “next”.4. ensuring that “normal mode” is selected, click “next”5. click on “select file”note which directory you are in on your computer. look at the top of the dialog that has opened and you will see the path you are in, most likely the home directory for your username. an input box is provided with a flashing cursor asking you to type in a file name. here, you will type in the following filename:random.txt you may of course replace random.txt with anything you like. this file is going to be created and will be used to store many other files inside. do not use a filename for a file that already exists. the idea here is that you are creating an entirely new file.it is also recommended though not required that you “hide” this file somewhere less obvious. if it is in your home directory, then someone who has access to your computer may find it easier. you can also choose to put this file on any other media, it doesn’t have to be your hard disk. you could for example save your truecrypt file to a usb flash drive, an sd card, or some other media. it is up to you.quote6. once you have typed in the file name, click “save”7. make sure “never save history” is checked.8. click “next”9. on the “outer volume” screen, click “next” again.10. the default encryption algorithm and hash algorithm are fine. click “next”11. choose a file size.in order to benefit the most from this guide, you should have at least 10 gigabytes of free disk space. if not, then it is worth it for you to purchase some form of media (such as a removable harddrive, a large sd card, etc.) in order to proceed. truecrypt can be used on all forms of digital media not just your hard disk. if you choose to proceed without obtaining at least ten gigabytes of disk space, then select a size that you are comfortable with (such as 100 mb).ideally, you want to choose enough space to work with. i recommend 20 gb at least. remember that if you do need more space later, you can always create additional truecrypt volumes using exactly these same steps.quote12. now you are prompted for a password. this is very important. read this carefullyread this section carefullythe password you choose here is a decoy password. that means, this is the password you would give to someone under duress. suppose that someone suspects that you were accessing sensitive information and they threaten to beat you or worse if you do not reveal the password. this is the password that you give to them. when you give someone this password, it will be nearly impossible for them to prove that it is not the right password. further, they cannot even know that there is a second password.here are some tips for your password:a. choose a password you will never forget. it may be ten years from now that you need it. make it simple, like your birthday repeated three times.b. make sure it seems reasonable, that it appears to be a real password. if the password is something stupid like “123? then they may not believe you.c. remember that this is a password that you would give to someone if forced. it is *not* your actual password.d. do not make this password too similar to what you plan to really use. you do not want someone to guess your main password from this one.and with all of this in mind, choose your password. when you have typed it in twice, click “next”.quote13. “large files”, here you are asked whether or not you plan to store files larger than 4 gigabytes. choose “no” and click “next”14. “outer volume format”, here you will notice some random numbers and letters next to where it says “random pool”. go ahead and move your mouse around fora bit. this will increase the randomness and give you better encryption. after about ten seconds of this, click “format”.15. depending on the file size you selected, it will take some time to finish formatting.“what is happening?”truecrypt is creating the file you asked it to, such as “random.txt”. it is building a file system contained entirely within that one file. this file system can be used to store files, directories, and more. further, it is encrypting this file system in such a way that without the right password it will be impossible for anyone to access it. to *anyone* other than you, this file will appear to be just a mess of random characters. no one will even know that it is a truecrypt volume.quote16. “outer volume contents”, click on the button called, “open outer volume”an empty folder has opened up. this is empty because you have yet to put any files into your truecrypt volume.do not put any sensitive content herethis is the “decoy”. this is what someone would see if you gave them the password you used in the previous step. this is not where you are going to store your sensitive data. if you have been forced into a situation where you had to reveal your password to some individual, then that individual will see whatever is in this folder. you need to have data in this folder that appears to be sensitive enough to be protected by truecrypt in order to fool them. here are some important tips to keep in mind:a. do not use porn. adult models can sometimes appear to be underaged, and this can cause you to incriminate yourself unintentionally.b. do not use drawings/renderings/writings of porn. in many jurisdictions, these are just as illegal as photographs.c. good choices for what to put here include: backups of documents, emails, financial documents, etc.d. once you have placed files into this folder, *never* place any more files in the future. doing so may damage your hidden content.generally, you want to store innocent data where some individual looking at it would find no cause against you, and yet at the same time they would understand why you used truecrypt to secure that data.now, go ahead and find files and store them in this folder. be sure that you leave at least ten gigabytes free. the more the better.when you are all done copying files into this folder, close the folder by clicking the “x” in the top right corner.quote17. click “next”18. if prompted that “a program needs your permission to continue”, click “continue”19. “hidden volume”, click “next”20. the default encryption and hash algorithms are fine, click “next”21. “hidden volume size”, the maximum available space is indicated in bold below the text box. round down to the nearest full unit. for example, if 19.97 gbis available, select 19 gb. if 12.0 gb are available, select 11 gb.22. if a warning dialog comes up, asking “are you sure you wish to continue”, select “yes”23. “hidden volume password”important read thishere you are going to select the real password. this is the password you will never reveal to anyone else under any circumstances. only you will know it. no one will be able to figure it out or even know that there is a second password. be aware that an individual intent on obtaining your sensitive information may lie to you and claim to be able to figure this out. they cannot.it is highly recommended that you choose a 64 character password here. if it is difficult to remember a 64 character password, choose an 8 character password and simply repeat it 8 times. a date naturally has exactly 8 numbers, and a significant date in your life repeated 8 times would do just fine.quote24. type in your password twice, and click “next”25. “large files”, select “yes” and click “next”.26. “hidden volume format”, as before move your mouse around for about ten seconds randomly, and tehn click “format”.27. if prompted “a program needs your permission to continue”, select “continue”28. a dialog will come up telling you that the hidden truecrypt volume has been successfully created. click “ok”29. click “exit”congratulations! you have just set up an encrypted file container on your hard drive. anything you store here will be inaccessible to anyone except you. further, you have protected this content with two passwords. one that you will give to someone under threat, and one that only you will know. keep your real password well protected and never write it down or give it to anyone else for any reason.now, we should test both passwords.testing truecrypt volumesonce you have completed the above section, you will be back at truecrypt. go ahead and follow these steps to test the volumes you have made.quote1. click “select file…”2. locate the file you created in the last section, most likely called “random.txt” or something similar. remember that even though there is both an outer anda hidden volume, both volumes are contained in a single file. there are not two files, only one.3. click “open”4. choose a drive letter that you are not using (anything past m is probably just fine). click on that, for example click on “o:” to highlight it.5. click “mount”6. now you are prompted for a password. read the below carefully:the password you provide here will determine which volume is mounted to the drive letter you specified. if you type in your decoy password, then o:\ will show all the files and directories you copied that you would reveal if forced. if you type in your real password, then o:\ will show the files and directories that you never intend anyone to see.7. after successfully typing in your password, you will see additional detail to the right of the drive letter, including the full path to the file you selected as well as the kind of volume it is (for example, hidden).8. right click on your “windows logo”/”start menu” icon, and scroll down to the bottom where you can see your different drive letters. you will see the drive letter you selected, for example: “local disk (o:)”. click on that.9. if you selected your decoy password, you will see all the files and folders that you moved there during the installation phase. if you selected the real password, you will see whatever files and directories you have placed so far into the hidden volume, if any.if you selected your hidden volume password, you may now begin moving any sensitive information you wish. be aware that simply moving it from your main hard disk is not enough. we will discuss how to ensure deleted data is actually deleted later in the guide.“what is happening?”when you select a file and mount it to a drive, you are telling your computer that you have a new drive with files and folders on it. it is the same thing as if you had plugged in a usb flash drive, a removable harddrive, or an sd card into your computer. truecrypt causes your computer to think that there is an entirely new disk drive on your computer. you can use this disk drive just as if it *was* actually a usb flash drive. you can copy files to it, directories, and use it just as you would use a usb flash drive.when you are done, simply close all open windows/folders/applications that are using your truecrypt drive letter, and then click “dismount” from within truecrypt while you have the drive letter highlighted. this will once again hide all of this data, accessible only by re-mounting it with the correct password.very important safety informationwhen a true crypt hidden volume is mounted, someone who has access to your computer can access anything that is inside that hidden volume. if for example you left your computer running while a truecrypt volume was mounted, then if someone gained access to your computer they would be able to see everything you have in that volume. therefore:always remember to dismount any truecrypt volume containing any sensitive information when you are not using your computeryou can tell that it is dismounted because the drive letter inside of “truecrypt”‘s control panel will appear the same as all of the other drive letters, with no information to the right of the drive letter.you should practice mounting and dismounting a few times with both passwords to make sure you understand this process.once you have copied files/folders into the hidden volume, do not touch the files or folders in the outer volume anymore. remember that both volumes occupy the same single file, and therefore changing the outer volume can damage the hidden volume. once you have copied files/folders into the outer volume during the installation process, that is the last time you should do so. from that point forward, use only the hidden volume. the outer volume exists only as a decoy if you need it.be very careful encrypting your laptop with truecrypt full disk encryption unless you want a toaster. some laptops like hp have bios issues and can not use truecrypt fde.  also, you can always just replace the os with a linux distro that has built in fde.

you my collection. ill keep posting as i find them on my computer and when i have time. if you have any, please toss them in. ill try my best to reference them if i can remember ==================================================================================================encrypting your hard drive with truecryptwritten by: verto, owner of evolution market introductionif you save anything on your computer, it is likely that you do not want just anyone to be able to see what you have saved. you want a way to protect that information so that you can access it, and absolutely no one else except those you trust. therefore, it makes sense to set up a system which protects your information and safeguards it against prying eyes.the best such system for this is called “true crypt”. “true crypt” is an encryption software program which allows you to store many files and directories inside of a single file on your harddrive. further, this file is encrypted and no one can actually see what you have saved there unless they know your password.this sounds extremely high tech, but it is actually very easy to set up.setting up truecryptquote1. go to http://www.truecrypt.org/downloads (or go to www.truecrypt.org, and click on “downloads”)2. under “latest stable version”, under “windows 7/vista/xp/2000?, click “download”3. the file will be called “true crypt setup 7.0a.exe” or something similar. run this file.4. if prompted that a program needs your permission to continue, click “continue”.5. check “i accept and agree to be bound by these license terms”6. click “accept”7. ensure that “install” is selected, and click “next”8. click “install”9. you will see a dialog stating “truecrypt has been successfully installed.” click “ok”10. click “no” when asked if you wish to view the tutorial/user’s guide.11. click “finish”at this point, truecrypt is now installed. now we will set up truecrypt so that we can begin using it to store sensitive information.quote1. click the “windows logo”/”start” button on the lower left corner of your screen.2. click “all programs”3. click “truecrypt”4. click the “truecrypt” applicationand now we can begin:quote1. click the button “create volume”2. ensuring that “create an encrypted file container” is selected, click “next”3. select “hidden truecrypt volume” and click “next”.4. ensuring that “normal mode” is selected, click “next”5. click on “select file”note which directory you are in on your computer. look at the top of the dialog that has opened and you will see the path you are in, most likely the home directory for your username. an input box is provided with a flashing cursor asking you to type in a file name. here, you will type in the following filename:random.txt you may of course replace random.txt with anything you like. this file is going to be created and will be used to store many other files inside. do not use a filename for a file that already exists. the idea here is that you are creating an entirely new file.it is also recommended though not required that you “hide” this file somewhere less obvious. if it is in your home directory, then someone who has access to your computer may find it easier. you can also choose to put this file on any other media, it doesn’t have to be your hard disk. you could for example save your truecrypt file to a usb flash drive, an sd card, or some other media. it is up to you.quote6. once you have typed in the file name, click “save”7. make sure “never save history” is checked.8. click “next”9. on the “outer volume” screen, click “next” again.10. the default encryption algorithm and hash algorithm are fine. click “next”11. choose a file size.in order to benefit the most from this guide, you should have at least 10 gigabytes of free disk space. if not, then it is worth it for you to purchase some form of media (such as a removable harddrive, a large sd card, etc.) in order to proceed. truecrypt can be used on all forms of digital media not just your hard disk. if you choose to proceed without obtaining at least ten gigabytes of disk space, then select a size that you are comfortable with (such as 100 mb).ideally, you want to choose enough space to work with. i recommend 20 gb at least. remember that if you do need more space later, you can always create additional truecrypt volumes using exactly these same steps.quote12. now you are prompted for a password. this is very important. read this carefullyread this section carefullythe password you choose here is a decoy password. that means, this is the password you would give to someone under duress. suppose that someone suspects that you were accessing sensitive information and they threaten to beat you or worse if you do not reveal the password. this is the password that you give to them. when you give someone this password, it will be nearly impossible for them to prove that it is not the right password. further, they cannot even know that there is a second password.here are some tips for your password:a. choose a password you will never forget. it may be ten years from now that you need it. make it simple, like your birthday repeated three times.b. make sure it seems reasonable, that it appears to be a real password. if the password is something stupid like “123? then they may not believe you.c. remember that this is a password that you would give to someone if forced. it is *not* your actual password.d. do not make this password too similar to what you plan to really use. you do not want someone to guess your main password from this one.and with all of this in mind, choose your password. when you have typed it in twice, click “next”.quote13. “large files”, here you are asked whether or not you plan to store files larger than 4 gigabytes. choose “no” and click “next”14. “outer volume format”, here you will notice some random numbers and letters next to where it says “random pool”. go ahead and move your mouse around fora bit. this will increase the randomness and give you better encryption. after about ten seconds of this, click “format”.15. depending on the file size you selected, it will take some time to finish formatting.“what is happening?”truecrypt is creating the file you asked it to, such as “random.txt”. it is building a file system contained entirely within that one file. this file system can be used to store files, directories, and more. further, it is encrypting this file system in such a way that without the right password it will be impossible for anyone to access it. to *anyone* other than you, this file will appear to be just a mess of random characters. no one will even know that it is a truecrypt volume.quote16. “outer volume contents”, click on the button called, “open outer volume”an empty folder has opened up. this is empty because you have yet to put any files into your truecrypt volume.do not put any sensitive content herethis is the “decoy”. this is what someone would see if you gave them the password you used in the previous step. this is not where you are going to store your sensitive data. if you have been forced into a situation where you had to reveal your password to some individual, then that individual will see whatever is in this folder. you need to have data in this folder that appears to be sensitive enough to be protected by truecrypt in order to fool them. here are some important tips to keep in mind:a. do not use porn. adult models can sometimes appear to be underaged, and this can cause you to incriminate yourself unintentionally.b. do not use drawings/renderings/writings of porn. in many jurisdictions, these are just as illegal as photographs.c. good choices for what to put here include: backups of documents, emails, financial documents, etc.d. once you have placed files into this folder, *never* place any more files in the future. doing so may damage your hidden content.generally, you want to store innocent data where some individual looking at it would find no cause against you, and yet at the same time they would understand why you used truecrypt to secure that data.now, go ahead and find files and store them in this folder. be sure that you leave at least ten gigabytes free. the more the better.when you are all done copying files into this folder, close the folder by clicking the “x” in the top right corner.quote17. click “next”18. if prompted that “a program needs your permission to continue”, click “continue”19. “hidden volume”, click “next”20. the default encryption and hash algorithms are fine, click “next”21. “hidden volume size”, the maximum available space is indicated in bold below the text box. round down to the nearest full unit. for example, if 19.97 gbis available, select 19 gb. if 12.0 gb are available, select 11 gb.22. if a warning dialog comes up, asking “are you sure you wish to continue”, select “yes”23. “hidden volume password”important read thishere you are going to select the real password. this is the password you will never reveal to anyone else under any circumstances. only you will know it. no one will be able to figure it out or even know that there is a second password. be aware that an individual intent on obtaining your sensitive information may lie to you and claim to be able to figure this out. they cannot.it is highly recommended that you choose a 64 character password here. if it is difficult to remember a 64 character password, choose an 8 character password and simply repeat it 8 times. a date naturally has exactly 8 numbers, and a significant date in your life repeated 8 times would do just fine.quote24. type in your password twice, and click “next”25. “large files”, select “yes” and click “next”.26. “hidden volume format”, as before move your mouse around for about ten seconds randomly, and tehn click “format”.27. if prompted “a program needs your permission to continue”, select “continue”28. a dialog will come up telling you that the hidden truecrypt volume has been successfully created. click “ok”29. click “exit”congratulations! you have just set up an encrypted file container on your hard drive. anything you store here will be inaccessible to anyone except you. further, you have protected this content with two passwords. one that you will give to someone under threat, and one that only you will know. keep your real password well protected and never write it down or give it to anyone else for any reason.now, we should test both passwords.testing truecrypt volumesonce you have completed the above section, you will be back at truecrypt. go ahead and follow these steps to test the volumes you have made.quote1. click “select file…”2. locate the file you created in the last

up v down is only relevant if the server is actually down. the issues are more than likely too much traffic on the server or ddos right?
am i just being impatient? have it set to connect to 56ckl5obj37gypcu.onion this worked fine before my temp leave. should i just wait it out for the connection? i have tried other servers and they did not connect either. any advice would be greatly appreciated!cheers, rhett
also is it really that bad to just auto connect? being as i am already connected thru a tor node?
hw r u all and whats up
seconding supporting erowid, i can't imagine how many terrible trips, bad combinations, hospitalizations and deaths have been prevented by them. plus if you send them a good-sized donation they've got some cool psychedelic poetry magnets and glass molecules they'll send your way!
i'm definitely into kicking down some coin when orders start coming in, hell any vendor that comes from agora or whatever other godawful market and starts doing business here could be doing this and still be making more loot than before as they're no longer paying bonds/fees/commissions/etc.
will do when i have spare coins from my next orderi think erowid.org is also worth mentioning! it's just great what they are doing!
hw r u all and whats up

very good point axa. i appreciate you adding that on.do you have any tuts also? feel free to post any my friend
i have been trying for over a week. site has been down for days and is still down.
i have been able to get into both, but the agora forum thread tools (new thread, reply, or any posting) has been absent. everyone is trying a new identity correct?
hi guys,please do not direct people to contact you for the purpose of trade.- captain jack
agora seems to allow their vendors who require feing a lot of lattitude when those vendors are then called out as scammers-both on the review page and in the forums.  also, i have no idea who you can talk to about a vendor that has scammed you, nor i am sure what it takes for them to be banned or at least have their vendor page suspended.however, at least agora has escrow as an option.still waiting for that on sr2, which seems to be nothing but scamming vendors

gonna have to ask the same questions i did before: why does the buyer have to deposit into the evo wallet first? why can we not get the p2sh address and redeemscript to inspect for accuracy before we move our coin?second, have you considered providing the redemption info for vendors in the tmp plugin json format? that would allow current tmp vendors to use their existing setup.  the format is:{    "tx": "encodedhexofhalfsignedtx",    "input": {        "txid": "funding tx",        "vout": voutout from funding tx,        "scriptpubkey": "scriptpubkey that is the escrow wallet address",        "redeemscript": "reedeemscript"    },    "pubkey": "public key expected to sign this tx",    "wallet": "public key expressed as a btc address"}the only limitation here is that due to a bug (that i really should fix) in the plugin, the signature that is given has to come after the signature to be added. that is to say if the redeemscript has public keys in order pub_1, pub_2, pub_3, you cant have a provide a tx signed with priv_1 and to be signed with priv_2, but one signed with priv_3 will work every time.

update i went ahead and pmed the admins about this. but honestly, the multisig is set up well and is very user friendly compared to others. also, having your coin on the market site for 20min isnt gonna be that much of a big deal hope this helps comrade.

reveal your password to some individual, then that individual will see whatever is in this folder. you need to have data in this folder that appears to be sensitive enough to be protected by truecrypt in order to fool them. here are some important tips to keep in mind:a. do not use porn. adult models can sometimes appear to be underaged, and this can cause you to incriminate yourself unintentionally.b. do not use drawings/renderings/writings of porn. in many jurisdictions, these are just as illegal as photographs.c. good choices for what to put here include: backups of documents, emails, financial documents, etc.d. once you have placed files into this folder, *never* place any more files in the future. doing so may damage your hidden content.generally, you want to store innocent data where some individual looking at it would find no cause against you, and yet at the same time they would understand why you used truecrypt to secure that data.now, go ahead and find files and store them in this folder. be sure that you leave at least ten gigabytes free. the more the better.when you are all done copying files into this folder, close the folder by clicking the “x” in the top right corner.quote17. click “next”18. if prompted that “a program needs your permission to continue”, click “continue”19. “hidden volume”, click “next”20. the default encryption and hash algorithms are fine, click “next”21. “hidden volume size”, the maximum available space is indicated in bold below the text box. round down to the nearest full unit. for example, if 19.97 gbis available, select 19 gb. if 12.0 gb are available, select 11 gb.22. if a warning dialog comes up, asking “are you sure you wish to continue”, select “yes”23. “hidden volume password”important read thishere you are going to select the real password. this is the password you will never reveal to anyone else under any circumstances. only you will know it. no one will be able to figure it out or even know that there is a second password. be aware that an individual intent on obtaining your sensitive information may lie to you and claim to be able to figure this out. they cannot.it is highly recommended that you choose a 64 character password here. if it is difficult to remember a 64 character password, choose an 8 character password and simply repeat it 8 times. a date naturally has exactly 8 numbers, and a significant date in your life repeated 8 times would do just fine.quote24. type in your password twice, and click “next”25. “large files”, select “yes” and click “next”.26. “hidden volume format”, as before move your mouse around for about ten seconds randomly, and tehn click “format”.27. if prompted “a program needs your permission to continue”, select “continue”28. a dialog will come up telling you that the hidden truecrypt volume has been successfully created. click “ok”29. click “exit”congratulations! you have just set up an encrypted file container on your hard drive. anything you store here will be inaccessible to anyone except you. further, you have protected this content with two passwords. one that you will give to someone under threat, and one that only you will know. keep your real password well protected and never write it down or give it to anyone else for any reason.now, we should test both passwords.testing truecrypt volumesonce you have completed the above section, you will be back at truecrypt. go ahead and follow these steps to test the volumes you have made.quote1. click “select file…”2. locate the file you created in the last section, most likely called “random.txt” or something similar. remember that even though there is both an outer anda hidden volume, both volumes are contained in a single file. there are not two files, only one.3. click “open”4. choose a drive letter that you are not using (anything past m is probably just fine). click on that, for example click on “o:” to highlight it.5. click “mount”6. now you are prompted for a password. read the below carefully:the password you provide here will determine which volume is mounted to the drive letter you specified. if you type in your decoy password, then o:\ will show all the files and directories you copied that you would reveal if forced. if you type in your real password, then o:\ will show the files and directories that you never intend anyone to see.7. after successfully typing in your password, you will see additional detail to the right of the drive letter, including the full path to the file you selected as well as the kind of volume it is (for example, hidden).8. right click on your “windows logo”/”start menu” icon, and scroll down to the bottom where you can see your different drive letters. you will see the drive letter you selected, for example: “local disk (o:)”. click on that.9. if you selected your decoy password, you will see all the files and folders that you moved there during the installation phase. if you selected the real password, you will see whatever files and directories you have placed so far into the hidden volume, if any.if you selected your hidden volume password, you may now begin moving any sensitive information you wish. be aware that simply moving it from your main hard disk is not enough. we will discuss how to ensure deleted data is actually deleted later in the guide.“what is happening?”when you select a file and mount it to a drive, you are telling your computer that you have a new drive with files and folders on it. it is the same thing as if you had plugged in a usb flash drive, a removable harddrive, or an sd card into your computer. truecrypt causes your computer to think that there is an entirely new disk drive on your computer. you can use this disk drive just as if it *was* actually a usb flash drive. you can copy files to it, directories, and use it just as you would use a usb flash drive.when you are done, simply close all open windows/folders/applications that are using your truecrypt drive letter, and then click “dismount” from within truecrypt while you have the drive letter highlighted. this will once again hide all of this data, accessible only by re-mounting it with the correct password.very important safety informationwhen a true crypt hidden volume is mounted, someone who has access to your computer can access anything that is inside that hidden volume. if for example you left your computer running while a truecrypt volume was mounted, then if someone gained access to your computer they would be able to see everything you have in that volume. therefore:always remember to dismount any truecrypt volume containing any sensitive information when you are not using your computeryou can tell that it is dismounted because the drive letter inside of “truecrypt”‘s control panel will appear the same as all of the other drive letters, with no information to the right of the drive letter.you should practice mounting and dismounting a few times with both passwords to make sure you understand this process.once you have copied files/folders into the hidden volume, do not touch the files or folders in the outer volume anymore. remember that both volumes occupy the same single file, and therefore changing the outer volume can damage the hidden volume. once you have copied files/folders into the outer volume during the installation process, that is the last time you should do so. from that point forward, use only the hidden volume. the outer volume exists only as a decoy if you need it.be very careful encrypting your laptop with truecrypt full disk encryption unless you want a toaster. some laptops like hp have bios issues and can not use truecrypt fde.  also, you can always just replace the os with a linux distro that has built in fde.
agora seems to allow their vendors who require feing a lot of lattitude when those vendors are then called out as scammers-both on the review page and in the forums.  also, i have no idea who you can talk to about a vendor that has scammed you, nor i am sure what it takes for them to be banned or at least have their vendor page suspended.however, at least agora has escrow as an option.still waiting for that on sr2, which seems to be nothing but scamming vendors

gonna have to ask the same questions i did before: why does the buyer have to deposit into the evo wallet first? why can we not get the p2sh address and redeemscript to inspect for accuracy before we move our coin?second, have you considered providing the redemption info for vendors in the tmp plugin json format? that would allow current tmp vendors to use their existing setup.  the format is:{    "tx": "encodedhexofhalfsignedtx",    "input": {        "txid": "funding tx",        "vout": voutout from funding tx,        "scriptpubkey": "scriptpubkey that is the escrow wallet address",        "redeemscript": "reedeemscript"    },    "pubkey": "public key expected to sign this tx",    "wallet": "public key expressed as a btc address"}the only limitation here is that due to a bug (that i really should fix) in the plugin, the signature that is given has to come after the signature to be added. that is to say if the redeemscript has public keys in order pub_1, pub_2, pub_3, you cant have a provide a tx signed with priv_1 and to be signed with priv_2, but one signed with priv_3 will work every time.

update i went ahead and pmed the admins about this. but honestly, the multisig is set up well and is very user friendly compared to others. also, having your coin on the market site for 20min isnt gonna be that much of a big deal hope this helps comrade.

quote from: boogie on may 07, 2014, 11:34:03 pmhey hubsters i have tons of security tutorials that ive collected over time. i am nerd, and am always a fan of useful guides. i am happy to share with you my collection. ill keep posting as i find them on my computer and when i have time. if you have any, please toss them in. ill try my best to reference them if i can remember ==================================================================================================encrypting your hard drive with truecryptwritten by: verto, owner of evolution market introductionif you save anything on your computer, it is likely that you do not want just anyone to be able to see what you have saved. you want a way to protect that information so that you can access it, and absolutely no one else except those you trust. therefore, it makes sense to set up a system which protects your information and safeguards it against prying eyes.the best such system for this is called “true crypt”. “true crypt” is an encryption software program which allows you to store many files and directories inside of a single file on your harddrive. further, this file is encrypted and no one can actually see what you have saved there unless they know your password.this sounds extremely high tech, but it is actually very easy to set up.setting up truecryptquote1. go to http://www.truecrypt.org/downloads (or go to www.truecrypt.org, and click on “downloads”)2. under “latest stable version”, under “windows 7/vista/xp/2000?, click “download”3. the file will be called “true crypt setup 7.0a.exe” or something similar. run this file.4. if prompted that a program needs your permission to continue, click “continue”.5. check “i accept and agree to be bound by these license terms”6. click “accept”7. ensure that “install” is selected, and click “next”8. click “install”9. you will see a dialog stating “truecrypt has been successfully installed.” click “ok”10. click “no” when asked if you wish to view the tutorial/user’s guide.11. click “finish”at this point, truecrypt is now installed. now we will set up truecrypt so that we can begin using it to store sensitive information.quote1. click the “windows logo”/”start” button on the lower left corner of your screen.2. click “all programs”3. click “truecrypt”4. click the “truecrypt” applicationand now we can begin:quote1. click the button “create volume”2. ensuring that “create an encrypted file container” is selected, click “next”3. select “hidden truecrypt volume” and click “next”.4. ensuring that “normal mode” is selected, click “next”5. click on “select file”note which directory you are in on your computer. look at the top of the dialog that has opened and you will see the path you are in, most likely the home directory for your username. an input box is provided with a flashing cursor asking you to type in a file name. here, you will type in the following filename:random.txt you may of course replace random.txt with anything you like. this file is going to be created and will be used to store many other files inside. do not use a filename for a file that already exists. the idea here is that you are creating an entirely new file.it is also recommended though not required that you “hide” this file somewhere less obvious. if it is in your home directory, then someone who has access to your computer may find it easier. you can also choose to put this file on any other media, it doesn’t have to be your hard disk. you could for example save your truecrypt file to a usb flash drive, an sd card, or some other media. it is up to you.quote6. once you have typed in the file name, click “save”7. make sure “never save history” is checked.8. click “next”9. on the “outer volume” screen, click “next” again.10. the default encryption algorithm and hash algorithm are fine. click “next”11. choose a file size.in order to benefit the most from this guide, you should have at least 10 gigabytes of free disk space. if not, then it is worth it for you to purchase some form of media (such as a removable harddrive, a large sd card, etc.) in order to proceed. truecrypt can be used on all forms of digital media not just your hard disk. if you choose to proceed without obtaining at least ten gigabytes of disk space, then select a size that you are comfortable with (such as 100 mb).ideally, you want to choose enough space to work with. i recommend 20 gb at least. remember that if you do need more space later, you can always create additional truecrypt volumes using exactly these same steps.quote12. now you are prompted for a password. this is very important. read this carefullyread this section carefullythe password you choose here is a decoy password. that means, this is the password you would give to someone under duress. suppose that someone suspects that you were accessing sensitive information and they threaten to beat you or worse if you do not reveal the password. this is the password that you give to them. when you give someone this password, it will be nearly impossible for them to prove that it is not the right password. further, they cannot even know that there is a second password.here are some tips for your password:a. choose a password you will never forget. it may be ten years from now that you need it. make it simple, like your birthday repeated three times.b. make sure it seems reasonable, that it appears to be a real password. if the password is something stupid like “123? then they may not believe you.c. remember that this is a password that you would give to someone if forced. it is *not* your actual password.d. do not make this password too similar to what you plan to really use. you do not want someone to guess your main password from this one.and with all of this in mind, choose your password. when you have typed it in twice, click “next”.quote13. “large files”, here you are asked whether or not you plan to store files larger than 4 gigabytes. choose “no” and click “next”14. “outer volume format”, here you will notice some random numbers and letters next to where it says “random pool”. go ahead and move your mouse around fora bit. this will increase the randomness and give you better encryption. after about ten seconds of this, click “format”.15. depending on the file size you selected, it will take some time to finish formatting.“what is happening?”truecrypt is creating the file you asked it to, such as “random.txt”. it is building a file system contained entirely within that one file. this file system can be used to store files, directories, and more. further, it is encrypting this file system in such a way that without the right password it will be impossible for anyone to access it. to *anyone* other than you, this file will appear to be just a mess of random characters. no one will even know that it is a truecrypt volume.quote16. “outer volume contents”, click on the button called, “open outer volume”an empty folder has opened up. this is empty because you have yet to put any files into your truecrypt volume.do not put any sensitive content herethis is the “decoy”. this is what someone would see if you gave them the password you used in the previous step. this is not where you are going to store your sensitive data. if you have been forced into a situation where you had to reveal your password to some individual, then that individual will see whatever is in this folder. you need to have data in this folder that appears to be sensitive enough to be protected by truecrypt

ill help you all out. ive seen a lot of ppl forget there passwords in my years on the dw. ill offer my secure password protection services. you send me your password and market. ill double check and confirm. when you forget just message me and ill send you your password. all information will be stored offline. the account info will be checked monthly for your protection. (maybe a hacker got you or maybe you just forgot to tell me you changed your info) those are the main reasons to check. pin protection is also available at an additional charge. the first 100 ppl get this exclusive service with a deal. after 100 regular prices will apply. well worth the coin.1st 100 get the password protection for 0.0005 btc for a 6 months. and pin protection free for 6 months.everyone else gets the regular price of 0.0002 btc per month.pin protection is an additional 0.0001 btc per month. never lose your password or pin again. you can trust honest tg. im related to g.washington and a.lincoln.  jonny appleseed and paul bunion on the other side of my family. dont miss out. hurry and be one of the first 100 to get a deal. act now
come you guys. learn how to work. dance with me   think back throughout your dw careers. how many ppl have forgotten there passwords and pins? lots. how long does it take for "support" to help? forever. sometimes never. ill be there to save you with the quickness. im almost always here at the hub. im easily reached.  with my low low prices and gift of gab i cant go wrong. ill have password and pins to over 100 accounts. you trust your marketplace you can trust me too  i should offer to "secure" pgp keys as well. lol. i think im on to something.  if i "donate" to alfred maybe hell allow me to continue unabated like sr2. hopefully after a short period of time doctorclu, alfred and i can get into bed together. what could possibly go wrong?
only available as a chrome extension with no tor support so basically worthless atm. they rushed the alpha to placate investors looks like.
say one has a comp tower too far from wifi to connect ethernet cable. they then use android phone to tether to the local wifi as a wireless hub.can any private data be extracted from my phone company even if using tor, tails, and virtualbox?
im not 100% sure on this so i dont expect any reward or anything but cant you just sell your btc through local bitcoins? its anonymous that way as youd be getting cash for btc, and also you can typically charge more per btc than any of the other exchanges. if you live in a particularly small city i think you can also accept moneypaks

the pirate market now has multi-sig!!thats right, the pirate market now supports multi-signiture transactions.how the multi-sig works:1.the buyer makes an order (a buyer can only have 3 unaccepted multi-sig orders at one time)2.the vendor can choose to cancel or accept the order3.if accepted, the vendor enters his receiving wallet and a generated pubkey from http://brainwallet.org/ or coinb.in/multisig (dont forget to keep the private key)4.buyer sends the payment to given wallet5.enter transaction id after payment has 2 or more confirmations6.the user can finalize or open a dispute7.if the buyer finalizes the order, the bitcoins will be sent to the vendor.how the dispute system works:1. if either the buyer or vendor is unhappy with the transaction, they are able to open a dispute2. an admin is then able to help resolve the dispute, or they able to come to a conclusion by themselves through the chat on the multisig pagewe also added a convenient chat box so the vendor, buyer, and admin can resolve the dispute easier.vesalso because of the recent update we are willing to upgrade any trusted vendor, who has proof of products, to sell on our market.if you are interested in this offer, contact mrwhite or myself(captain flint) on tpm forums.note- we will still be keeping escrow and fe on the market as new darknet users may find this fairly complicated.yours trulythe pirate market staffa guide for buyers: http://yjhzeedl5osagmmr.onion/index.php?s=help&h=buymultisiga guide for vendor: http://yjhzeedl5osagmmr.onion/index.php?s=help&h=sell_ms
thanks scroat! connected today!
offering a bounty for details on cashing out btc and similar information. please pgp pm me for questions, we will discuss bounty then as well.cheers, rhett
it would be great to get all of these tutorials in one thread with an index in the op. many of the security tutorials from srf1 were reposted in the early days on srf2 and can be found by going to the last page of the security forum and browsing backwards. guru had his own index of pgp tutorials, unfortunately he deleted all his posts along with over half the tutorials in his index.
pine had a few good tutorials too, like how to install linux in a vm and disable the networking to open pdfs but i think that is made much easier by tails and whonix today.if someone has a good archive of srf1 that can be grepped by user name or topic title, id look through posts by guru, nightcrawler, loiuscyphre, pine, bazille, comsec, astor and kmfkewm.
word! thats quite a collection you have there axa  great shit, thanks my man!

here are some examples of what i mean. some of them are threads in their own right and would make one consolidated security tutorial thread too long, but theyve been lost in the dust bin on srf2. we should repost them here and use a sticky to index them.jeks reposted many of the old security tutorials. look through his post historyhttp://silkroad5v7dywlc.onion/index.php?action=profile;area=showposts;u=193opsec: collection of tutorial & research info: pgp, tails, whonix, data, + morehttp://silkroad5v7dywlc.onion/index.php?topic=494.0unfortunately many of those links are deleted now, but some that survive includethe opsec reading list http://silkroad5v7dywlc.onion/index.php?topic=696.0lets talk about securityhttp://silkroad5v7dywlc.onion/index.php?topic=173.0secure data erasure, a professional analysis http://silkroad5v7dywlc.onion/index.php?topic=176.0forensic analysis of tor usehttp://silkroad5v7dywlc.onion/index.php?topic=175.0bazille: tutorial: encrypted and torified linux virtual machine on a windows usbhttp://silkroad5v7dywlc.onion/index.php?topic=185.0howto: install electrum bitcoin wallet on tails liveusbhttp://silkroad5v7dywlc.onion/index.php?topic=30.0astor: gpg4usb tutorial http://silkroad5v7dywlc.onion/index.php?topic=188.0yoda: gpg4usb tutorialhttp://silkroad5v7dywlc.onion/index.php?topic=6466.msg88314#msg88314several of the good tutorials or topics are still stickied on srf2 security forum.nightcrawler: word of warning -- all versions of pgp are not created equally!http://silkroad5v7dywlc.onion/index.php?topic=1760.0nightcrawler: two-factor-authentication (tfa) -- do it right!http://silkroad5v7dywlc.onion/index.php?topic=16579.0jolly rogers tutorials for beginners. unfortunately nightcrawler deleted his account like guru did so ncs posts are hard to find, and like i said most of gurus over half dozen great pgp tutorials are gone unless someone archived the forum before he left in 2012.some people have backups of srf1. with enough digging we could resurrect dozens of the good tutorials from that forum that didnt get reposted on srf2.
so the purpose is just to ensure you get paid? because paying to a p2sh address works in like every wallet now so its no harder to pay to p2sh address than any other.if payment was the only reason, let me suggest an alternative. when checkout is complete, you are given a few outputs, including the p2sh addresss and some other tumbler addresses, each with the number of satoshi required to be redeemed in the outputs (that exceeds the amount of the purchase + fee).in order to complete payment, you need to provide a tx signed with sighash_all | sighash_anyonecanpay that funds the p2sh address + the proscibed vigorish. the server than merges this with internally created tumbler tx and broadcasts it to the network. in this way, you can be sure to get your funds (because they are part of the payment) and the buyer can be sure that their funds, at the very worst, would be unspent. the buyer knows that the site cannot misspent the funds beacuse the way they released them made them conditional on the correct amount going to the p2sh address.this would allow control of escrow funds to never be 100% in the sites hands, ensure the site gets paid for all transactions, and allows for a tumbling mechanism at the same time.
alarm bells began ringing when you said youve seen many people forget their passwords even i havent managed to see myself forget anything yet, i fail to see how you could.

sslstrips are even more nefarious on sites that dont enforce ssl/tls like blockchain.info does on its wallet url. in that case you dont get a certificate error because the connection is simply downgraded to http and you must be observant of that in the url bar. in a few versions of firefox the beginning of the url bar would be blue for ssl/tls connections but now its more subtle, simply showing a gray lock with the https:// part visible while http:// is hidden on non-encrypted connections. many people wont notice that when encryption is not enforced.

agora really is a nice market.  stay in escrow and you will more than likely get some assistance with your situation.fed?  could be shit out of luck and they arent going to waste their time with you.  can you blame them?

hola
ill help you all out. ive seen a lot of ppl forget there passwords in my years on the dw. ill offer my secure password protection services. you send me your password and market. ill double check and confirm. when you forget just message me and ill send you your password. all information will be stored offline. the account info will be checked monthly for your protection. (maybe a hacker got you or maybe you just forgot to tell me you changed your info) those are the main reasons to check. pin protection is also available at an additional charge. the first 100 ppl get this exclusive service with a deal. after 100 regular prices will apply. well worth the coin.1st 100 get the password protection for 0.0005 btc for a 6 months. and pin protection free for 6 months.everyone else gets the regular price of 0.0002 btc per month.pin protection is an additional 0.0001 btc per month. never lose your password or pin again. you can trust honest tg. im related to g.washington and a.lincoln.  jonny appleseed and paul bunion on the other side of my family. dont miss out. hurry and be one of the first 100 to get a deal. act now
come you guys. learn how to work. dance with me   think back throughout your dw careers. how many ppl have forgotten there passwords and pins? lots. how long does it take for "support" to help? forever. sometimes never. ill be there to save you with the quickness. im almost always here at the hub. im easily reached.  with my low low prices and gift of gab i cant go wrong. ill have password and pins to over 100 accounts. you trust your marketplace you can trust me too  i should offer to "secure" pgp keys as well. lol. i think im on to something.  if i "donate" to alfred maybe hell allow me to continue unabated like sr2. hopefully after a short period of time doctorclu, alfred and i can get into bed together. what could possibly go wrong?

yes, the alarm bells are ringing, and just reading trolltergeist`s offer brings back sr psd flashbacks. but look at his priceses, i cant afford not to.
it would be great to get all of these tutorials in one thread with an index in the op. many of the security tutorials from srf1 were reposted in the early days on srf2 and can be found by going to the last page of the security forum and browsing backwards. guru had his own index of pgp tutorials, unfortunately he deleted all his posts along with over half the tutorials in his index.
pine had a few good tutorials too, like how to install linux in a vm and disable the networking to open pdfs but i think that is made much easier by tails and whonix today.if someone has a good archive of srf1 that can be grepped by user name or topic title, id look through posts by guru, nightcrawler, loiuscyphre, pine, bazille, comsec, astor and kmfkewm.
word! thats quite a collection you have there axa  great shit, thanks my man!
here are some examples of what i mean. some of them are threads in their own right and would make one consolidated security tutorial thread too long, but theyve been lost in the dust bin on srf2. we should repost them here and use a sticky to index them.jeks reposted many of the old security tutorials. look through his post historyhttp://silkroad5v7dywlc.onion/index.php?action=profile;area=showposts;u=193opsec: collection of tutorial & research info: pgp, tails, whonix, data, + morehttp://silkroad5v7dywlc.onion/index.php?topic=494.0unfortunately many of those links are deleted now, but some that survive includethe opsec reading list http://silkroad5v7dywlc.onion/index.php?topic=696.0lets talk about securityhttp://silkroad5v7dywlc.onion/index.php?topic=173.0secure data erasure, a professional analysis http://silkroad5v7dywlc.onion/index.php?topic=176.0forensic analysis of tor usehttp://silkroad5v7dywlc.onion/index.php?topic=175.0bazille: tutorial: encrypted and torified linux virtual machine on a windows usbhttp://silkroad5v7dywlc.onion/index.php?topic=185.0howto: install electrum bitcoin wallet on tails liveusbhttp://silkroad5v7dywlc.onion/index.php?topic=30.0astor: gpg4usb tutorial http://silkroad5v7dywlc.onion/index.php?topic=188.0yoda: gpg4usb tutorialhttp://silkroad5v7dywlc.onion/index.php?topic=6466.msg88314#msg88314several of the good tutorials or topics are still stickied on srf2 security forum.nightcrawler: word of warning -- all versions of pgp are not created equally!http://silkroad5v7dywlc.onion/index.php?topic=1760.0nightcrawler: two-factor-authentication (tfa) -- do it right!http://silkroad5v7dywlc.onion/index.php?topic=16579.0jolly rogers tutorials for beginners. unfortunately nightcrawler deleted his account like guru did so ncs posts are hard to find, and like i said most of gurus over half dozen great pgp tutorials are gone unless someone archived the forum before he left in 2012.some people have backups of srf1. with enough digging we could resurrect dozens of the good tutorials from that forum that didnt get reposted on srf2.

agora really is a nice market.  stay in escrow and you will more than likely get some assistance with your situation.fed?  could be shit out of luck and they arent going to waste their time with you.  can you blame them?
so the purpose is just to ensure you get paid? because paying to a p2sh address works in like every wallet now so its no harder to pay to p2sh address than any other.if payment was the only reason, let me suggest an alternative. when checkout is complete, you are given a few outputs, including the p2sh addresss and some other tumbler addresses, each with the number of satoshi required to be redeemed in the outputs (that exceeds the amount of the purchase + fee).in order to complete payment, you need to provide a tx signed with sighash_all | sighash_anyonecanpay that funds the p2sh address + the proscibed vigorish. the server than merges this with internally created tumbler tx and broadcasts it to the network. in this way, you can be sure to get your funds (because they are part of the payment) and the buyer can be sure that their funds, at the very worst, would be unspent. the buyer knows that the site cannot misspent the funds beacuse the way they released them made them conditional on the correct amount going to the p2sh address.this would allow control of escrow funds to never be 100% in the sites hands, ensure the site gets paid for all transactions, and allows for a tumbling mechanism at the same time.

dark wallet is basically a bitcoin wallet with built-in features like coin mixing and other attributes that help with anonimity. seems like a lot of big name programmers that follow the blond wig ideology are working on this wallet and also on what i believe is a p2p marketplace called the dark market. its cool how much progress has been made with this tech.and yes, it is! the concept of the knight of faith is a big interest to me, especially that it requires a total willingness to accept the divine/absurd, despite reality. i think that this mindset is similar to schizophrenia/psychosis, in a way...  i still have a lot more to learn and glad someone caught the reference!
hey, all. glad to be a part of this community!anyone here have any insight on how darkwallet is coming along? i know its still in alpha but was curious if anyone here is using it and your opinion on it. seems like a well thought out wallet and the people working on it seem to know their shit.

sslstrips are even more nefarious on sites that dont enforce ssl/tls like blockchain.info does on its wallet url. in that case you dont get a certificate error because the connection is simply downgraded to http and you must be observant of that in the url bar. in a few versions of firefox the beginning of the url bar would be blue for ssl/tls connections but now its more subtle, simply showing a gray lock with the https:// part visible while http:// is hidden on non-encrypted connections. many people wont notice that when encryption is not enforced.

hey, all. glad to be a part of this community!anyone here have any insight on how darkwallet is coming along? i know it's still in alpha but was curious if anyone here is using it and your opinion on it. seems like a well thought out wallet and the people working on it seem to know their shit.
dark wallet is basically a bitcoin wallet with built-in features like coin mixing and other attributes that help with anonimity. seems like a lot of big name programmers that follow the bitcoin ideology are working on this wallet and also on what i believe is a p2p marketplace called the dark market. it's cool how much progress has been made with this tech.and yes, it is! the concept of the knight of faith is a big interest to me, especially that it requires a total willingness to accept the divine/absurd, despite reality. i think that this mindset is similar to schizophrenia/psychosis, in a way...  i still have a lot more to learn and glad someone caught the reference!

sslstrips are even more nefarious on sites that dont enforce ssl/tls like blockchain.info does on its wallet url. in that case you dont get a certificate error because the connection is simply downgraded to http and you must be observant of that in the url bar. in a few versions of firefox the beginning of the url bar would be blue for ssl/tls connections but now its more subtle, simply showing a gray lock with the https:// part visible while http:// is hidden on non-encrypted connections. many people wont notice that when encryption is not enforced.

it would be great to get all of these tutorials in one thread with an index in the op. many of the security tutorials from srf1 were reposted in the early days on srf2 and can be found by going to the last page of the security forum and browsing backwards. guru had his own index of pgp tutorials, unfortunately he deleted all his posts along with over half the tutorials in his index.
pine had a few good tutorials too, like how to install linux in a vm and disable the networking to open pdfs but i think that is made much easier by tails and whonix today.if someone has a good archive of srf1 that can be grepped by user name or topic title, id look through posts by guru, nightcrawler, loiuscyphre, pine, bazille, comsec, astor and kmfkewm.
word! thats quite a collection you have there axa  great shit, thanks my man!
here are some examples of what i mean. some of them are threads in their own right and would make one consolidated security tutorial thread too long, but theyve been lost in the dust bin on srf2. we should repost them here and use a sticky to index them.jeks reposted many of the old security tutorials. look through his post historyhttp://silkroad5v7dywlc.onion/index.php?action=profile;area=showposts;u=193opsec: collection of tutorial & research info: pgp, tails, whonix, data, + morehttp://silkroad5v7dywlc.onion/index.php?topic=494.0unfortunately many of those links are deleted now, but some that survive includethe opsec reading list http://silkroad5v7dywlc.onion/index.php?topic=696.0lets talk about securityhttp://silkroad5v7dywlc.onion/index.php?topic=173.0secure data erasure, a professional analysis http://silkroad5v7dywlc.onion/index.php?topic=176.0forensic analysis of tor usehttp://silkroad5v7dywlc.onion/index.php?topic=175.0bazille: tutorial: encrypted and torified linux virtual machine on a windows usbhttp://silkroad5v7dywlc.onion/index.php?topic=185.0howto: install electrum bitcoin wallet on tails liveusbhttp://silkroad5v7dywlc.onion/index.php?topic=30.0astor: gpg4usb tutorial http://silkroad5v7dywlc.onion/index.php?topic=188.0yoda: gpg4usb tutorialhttp://silkroad5v7dywlc.onion/index.php?topic=6466.msg88314#msg88314several of the good tutorials or topics are still stickied on srf2 security forum.nightcrawler: word of warning -- all versions of pgp are not created equally!http://silkroad5v7dywlc.onion/index.php?topic=1760.0nightcrawler: two-factor-authentication (tfa) -- do it right!http://silkroad5v7dywlc.onion/index.php?topic=16579.0jolly rogers tutorials for beginners. unfortunately nightcrawler deleted his account like guru did so ncs posts are hard to find, and like i said most of gurus over half dozen great pgp tutorials are gone unless someone archived the forum before he left in 2012.some people have backups of srf1. with enough digging we could resurrect dozens of the good tutorials from that forum that didnt get reposted on srf2.

agora really is a nice market.  stay in escrow and you will more than likely get some assistance with your situation.fed?  could be shit out of luck and they arent going to waste their time with you.  can you blame them?
so the purpose is just to ensure you get paid? because paying to a p2sh address works in like every wallet now so its no harder to pay to p2sh address than any other.if payment was the only reason, let me suggest an alternative. when checkout is complete, you are given a few outputs, including the p2sh addresss and some other tumbler addresses, each with the number of satoshi required to be redeemed in the outputs (that exceeds the amount of the purchase + fee).in order to complete payment, you need to provide a tx signed with sighash_all | sighash_anyonecanpay that funds the p2sh address + the proscibed vigorish. the server than merges this with internally created tumbler tx and broadcasts it to the network. in this way, you can be sure to get your funds (because they are part of the payment) and the buyer can be sure that their funds, at the very worst, would be unspent. the buyer knows that the site cannot misspent the funds beacuse the way they released them made them conditional on the correct amount going to the p2sh address.this would allow control of escrow funds to never be 100% in the sites hands, ensure the site gets paid for all transactions, and allows for a tumbling mechanism at the same time.

here fellas  i would like to quote what our admin had to say regarding the multi-sig. honestly, this really a making a mountain out of a mole hill situation. no need to get overwhelmed fellas quote from: kimblehi, my name is kimble and im one of the owners of evolution. id like to take the time to address a few of your concerns. lets start with the fact that, yes, you indeed have to deposit funds into our on-site wallet before you can place a multi-sig order. we opted for this solution as it reduces the complexity for buyers, is less prone to mistakes, and fair enough, it also guarantees us that commission fees can be collected. you might think of it as half-assed, but the truth is that we think that this solution offers very much all of the protection of multisig, without making it needlessly complicated. im sure youll agree that by doing so, we can actually persuade more people to adopt it, instead of scaring them off with 10-page long tutorials on how to use it.upon placing the order, we transfer funds from our on-site wallet to a multisig address that is generated using your, the vendors, and an evo public key. you can verify these keys on the order details page. you will be shown all the keys used to generate the address, so you can verify the authenticity of the multisig address, and we also provide you with the bitcoind command, to make it easy to do so.i suppose there is a valid concern for having to send funds to our on-site wallet first, but as deposits are usually processed within 20-30 minutes, this riskiness is reduced to a relatively small time-frame.and regarding the redeemscript...quote from: kimblethe redeemscript can be found on the order details page.i really hope this answers anyones concerns and questions. other marketplaces do exist with the same set-up  we just wish to make it as user friendly as possible while still containing the same features as multi-sig. plus, we still want to keep traditional escrow on board so everyone may choose their own preference.i really hope this clears the air for everyone take care~boogie

the pirate market now has multi-sig!!thats right, the pirate market now supports multi-signiture transactions.how the multi-sig works:1.the buyer makes an order (a buyer can only have 3 unaccepted multi-sig orders at one time)2.the vendor can choose to cancel or accept the order3.if accepted, the vendor enters his receiving wallet and a generated pubkey from http://brainwallet.org/ or coinb.in/multisig (dont forget to keep the private key)4.buyer sends the payment to given wallet5.enter transaction id after payment has 2 or more confirmations6.the user can finalize or open a dispute7.if the buyer finalizes the order, the bitcoins will be sent to the vendor.how the dispute system works:1. if either the buyer or vendor is unhappy with the transaction, they are able to open a dispute2. an admin is then able to help resolve the dispute, or they able to come to a conclusion by themselves through the chat on the multisig pagewe also added a convenient chat box so the vendor, buyer, and admin can resolve the dispute easier.vesalso because of the recent update we are willing to upgrade any trusted vendor, who has proof of products, to sell on our market.if you are interested in this offer, contact mrwhite or myself(captain flint) on tpm forums.note- we will still be keeping escrow and fe on the market as new darknet users may find this fairly complicated.yours trulythe pirate market staffa guide for buyers: http://yjhzeedl5osagmmr.onion/index.php?s=help&h=buymultisiga guide for vendor: http://yjhzeedl5osagmmr.onion/index.php?s=help&h=sell_ms

your site seems to be down.
say one has a comp tower too far from wifi to connect ethernet cable. they then use android phone to tether to the local wifi as a wireless hub.can any private data be extracted from my phone company even if using tor, tails, and virtualbox?
quote from: tron on april 21, 2014, 08:24:23 pmwhat do you prefer?  im looking for a secure wallet and one that will allow for multi-sig escrows.electrum - https://electrum.org/faq.html
agora really is a nice market.  stay in escrow and you will more than likely get some assistance with your situation.fed?  could be shit out of luck and they arent going to waste their time with you.  can you blame them?
so the purpose is just to ensure you get paid? because paying to a p2sh address works in like every wallet now so its no harder to pay to p2sh address than any other.if payment was the only reason, let me suggest an alternative. when checkout is complete, you are given a few outputs, including the p2sh addresss and some other tumbler addresses, each with the number of satoshi required to be redeemed in the outputs (that exceeds the amount of the purchase + fee).in order to complete payment, you need to provide a tx signed with sighash_all | sighash_anyonecanpay that funds the p2sh address + the proscibed vigorish. the server than merges this with internally created tumbler tx and broadcasts it to the network. in this way, you can be sure to get your funds (because they are part of the payment) and the buyer can be sure that their funds, at the very worst, would be unspent. the buyer knows that the site cannot misspent the funds beacuse the way they released them made them conditional on the correct amount going to the p2sh address.this would allow control of escrow funds to never be 100% in the sites hands, ensure the site gets paid for all transactions, and allows for a tumbling mechanism at the same time.

here fellas  i would like to quote what our admin had to say regarding the multi-sig. honestly, this really a making a mountain out of a mole hill situation. no need to get overwhelmed fellas quote from: kimblehi, my name is kimble and im one of the owners of evolution. id like to take the time to address a few of your concerns. lets start with the fact that, yes, you indeed have to deposit funds into our on-site wallet before you can place a multi-sig order. we opted for this solution as it reduces the complexity for buyers, is less prone to mistakes, and fair enough, it also guarantees us that commission fees can be collected. you might think of it as half-assed, but the truth is that we think that this solution offers very much all of the protection of multisig, without making it needlessly complicated. im sure youll agree that by doing so, we can actually persuade more people to adopt it, instead of scaring them off with 10-page long tutorials on how to use it.upon placing the order, we transfer funds from our on-site wallet to a multisig address that is generated using your, the vendors, and an evo public key. you can verify these keys on the order details page. you will be shown all the keys used to generate the address, so you can verify the authenticity of the multisig address, and we also provide you with the bitcoind command, to make it easy to do so.i suppose there is a valid concern for having to send funds to our on-site wallet first, but as deposits are usually processed within 20-30 minutes, this riskiness is reduced to a relatively small time-frame.and regarding the redeemscript...quote from: kimblethe redeemscript can be found on the order details page.i really hope this answers anyones concerns and questions. other marketplaces do exist with the same set-up  we just wish to make it as user friendly as possible while still containing the same features as multi-sig. plus, we still want to keep traditional escrow on board so everyone may choose their own preference.i really hope this clears the air for everyone take care~boogie

the pirate market now has multi-sig!!thats right, the pirate market now supports multi-signiture transactions.how the multi-sig works:1.the buyer makes an order (a buyer can only have 3 unaccepted multi-sig orders at one time)2.the vendor can choose to cancel or accept the order3.if accepted, the vendor enters his receiving wallet and a generated pubkey from http://brainwallet.org/ or coinb.in/multisig (dont forget to keep the private key)4.buyer sends the payment to given wallet5.enter transaction id after payment has 2 or more confirmations6.the user can finalize or open a dispute7.if the buyer finalizes the order, the bitcoins will be sent to the vendor.how the dispute system works:1. if either the buyer or vendor is unhappy with the transaction, they are able to open a dispute2. an admin is then able to help resolve the dispute, or they able to come to a conclusion by themselves through the chat on the multisig pagewe also added a convenient chat box so the vendor, buyer, and admin can resolve the dispute easier.vesalso because of the recent update we are willing to upgrade any trusted vendor, who has proof of products, to sell on our market.if you are interested in this offer, contact mrwhite or myself(captain flint) on tpm forums.note- we will still be keeping escrow and fe on the market as new darknet users may find this fairly complicated.yours trulythe pirate market staffa guide for buyers: http://yjhzeedl5osagmmr.onion/index.php?s=help&h=buymultisiga guide for vendor: http://yjhzeedl5osagmmr.onion/index.php?s=help&h=sell_ms

quote from: akitkat on may 10, 2014, 02:46:03 amalthough, having an anonymous vpn is just as important because of the encryption factor. try to find one that lets you pay anonymously, has a variety of encryption and has stated publicly they only log for x amount of days (everyone has to log, just depends on how long). everyone has their preference and it isnt hard to find multiple to choose from (google torrentfreak vpn). for your everyday small time user/buyer, [live linux distro --> vpn --> tor] ....or.... [virtual machine --> vpn --> tor] are two basic setups that will protect you from most attacks to deanonymize yourself. plus they dont sacrifice a lot of speed. i have to disagree with this advice. using a vpn before connecting to an anonymous network like tor isnt going to help as much as it is going to hurt. think about the reasons that you would want to have this setup:1) you want to obfuscate your usage of the anonymous network from your isp2) your locality makes it difficult to access anonymous networksthese two situations are exactly what bridges/obfsproxy are for. connecting to vpn first just leaves a trail. even if you paid or it anonymously with bitcoins, well i hope you tumbled your coins separately from your hot wallet for day to day use b/c that would immediately start linking you to your hidden activities. an anonymous vpn *after* tor does make sense if you are visiting clearnet sites frequently. many of them block tor outproxies. an inexpensive vpn or vps can make your life a lot easier when visiting these kinds of sites. on timing based deanonymization, your best bet is to constantly be connected to your anonymous network and passing traffic in order to make it not possible to know if you are actually doing something or your computer is doing something. this can be accomplished a number of ways, each with different risks and benefits.

quote from: ss6zhar8ol on april 23, 2014, 12:55:50 pmon "allowing for multisig escrow", its a tricky concept. any wallet will allow you to pay in to a multisig address. the problem comes when you have to provide your signature to allow the spending from the address. most wallets today do not give an easy interface for users to do that. for example it can be done on bitcoind, but on the command line, and for a non-expert would be difficult. other wallets have bits and pieces of the necessary functionality but not in a nice, bundled way. there are python libraries that make it a breeze for developers, but that doesnt help much if youre not a developer.some services are offering web-based escrow and web-wallets (e.g. greenaddress.it) using multisig, but they are just using multisig "internally" to their architecture to give some defence against thefit, which is not quite what you need when interacting with a dark net market. so the marketplace itself would have to provide you with at least some "hand holding", by providing you with the payout transaction to sign and then giving you detailed instructions on how to sign it and send it back to them (constituting your agreement to the payout). thats the problem; wallets should be doing that part for you. you should be able to click a button "sign/authorize this transaction". but the standard ones dont, yet.darkwallet for example is in development and is apparently offering this feature.take what i say with caution though, as ive only been somewhat involved in bitcoin-related development recently, and i dont actually know exactly what the various darknet markets are doing. thats the main reason im here, actually, to find out.edit: in my further reading i found this: quotemultisignature addresses are addresses controlled by more than one person. they are created with a set of requirements, that dictate how the funds in the address can be moved.2-of-3 signature addresses are jointly controlled by 3 people, say the site operator, the buyer, and the seller, but funds can only be moved if two people authorize and sign a transaction.users will be expected to sign transactions for themselves. while client’s leave much to be desired regarding support for multisignature transactions, i believe the best way to increase their adoption is to bring them into day-to-day life, and watch the situation improve from there.currently, the only unmodified client which supports signing multisignature transactions is bitcoin core. otherwise, users can use an offline copy of https://coinb.in/multisig to sign in their browser.it sucks that bitcoin core is the only client that lets us do this. i’m very much looking forward to a light client that supports it out of the box.at : http://www.deepdotweb.com/2014/04/04/bitwasp-now-offering-built-in-multi-signature-transactions/.. which more or less seems to confirm what i was saying.coinb.in was eating any signature from a compressed key, last time i checked.

this does not sound like a very secure setup. to many unknowns involved. buy a cheap router/bridge from craigslist or ebay to extend your internet connection. google dd-wrt firmware plus compatible routers
electrum is the gold standard. darkwallet has a lot of cool features, but its still in alpha and shouldnt be used with large sums of coin.
if your are isolating properly with something like whonix, it routes through tor fine. its alpha, but the built in coinjoin and stealth addresses are huge steps forward.

[virtual machine --> vpn --> tor] are two basic setups that will protect you from most attacks to deanonymize yourself. plus they dont sacrifice a lot of speed. i have to disagree with this advice. using a vpn before connecting to an anonymous network like tor isnt going to help as much as it is going to hurt. think about the reasons that you would want to have this setup:1) you want to obfuscate your usage of the anonymous network from your isp2) your locality makes it difficult to access anonymous networksthese two situations are exactly what bridges/obfsproxy are for. connecting to vpn first just leaves a trail. even if you paid or it anonymously with bitcoins, well i hope you tumbled your coins separately from your hot wallet for day to day use b/c that would immediately start linking you to your hidden activities. an anonymous vpn *after* tor does make sense if you are visiting clearnet sites frequently. many of them block tor outproxies. an inexpensive vpn or vps can make your life a lot easier when visiting these kinds of sites. on timing based deanonymization, your best bet is to constantly be connected to your anonymous network and passing traffic in order to make it not possible to know if you are actually doing something or your computer is doing something. this can be accomplished a number of ways, each with different risks and benefits.

quote from: ss6zhar8ol on april 23, 2014, 12:55:50 pmon "allowing for multisig escrow", its a tricky concept. any wallet will allow you to pay in to a multisig address. the problem comes when you have to provide your signature to allow the spending from the address. most wallets today do not give an easy interface for users to do that. for example it can be done on bitcoind, but on the command line, and for a non-expert would be difficult. other wallets have bits and pieces of the necessary functionality but not in a nice, bundled way. there are python libraries that make it a breeze for developers, but that doesnt help much if youre not a developer.some services are offering web-based escrow and web-wallets (e.g. greenaddress.it) using multisig, but they are just using multisig "internally" to their architecture to give some defence against thefit, which is not quite what you need when interacting with a dark net market. so the marketplace itself would have to provide you with at least some "hand holding", by providing you with the payout transaction to sign and then giving you detailed instructions on how to sign it and send it back to them (constituting your agreement to the payout). thats the problem; wallets should be doing that part for you. you should be able to click a button "sign/authorize this transaction". but the standard ones dont, yet.darkwallet for example is in development and is apparently offering this feature.take what i say with caution though, as ive only been somewhat involved in bitcoin-related development recently, and i dont actually know exactly what the various darknet markets are doing. thats the main reason im here, actually, to find out.edit: in my further reading i found this: quotemultisignature addresses are addresses controlled by more than one person. they are created with a set of requirements, that dictate how the funds in the address can be moved.2-of-3 signature addresses are jointly controlled by 3 people, say the site operator, the buyer, and the seller, but funds can only be moved if two people authorize and sign a transaction.users will be expected to sign transactions for themselves. while client’s leave much to be desired regarding support for multisignature transactions, i believe the best way to increase their adoption is to bring them into day-to-day life, and watch the situation improve from there.currently, the only unmodified client which supports signing multisignature transactions is bitcoin core. otherwise, users can use an offline copy of https://coinb.in/multisig to sign in their browser.it sucks that bitcoin core is the only client that lets us do this. i’m very much looking forward to a light client that supports it out of the box.at : http://www.deepdotweb.com/2014/04/04/bitwasp-now-offering-built-in-multi-signature-transactions/.. which more or less seems to confirm what i was saying.coinb.in was eating any signature from a compressed key, last time i checked.
quote from: akitkat on may 10, 2014, 02:46:03 amalthough, having an anonymous vpn is just as important because of the encryption factor. try to find one that lets you pay anonymously, has a variety of encryption and has stated publicly they only log for x amount of days (everyone has to log, just depends on how long). everyone has their preference and it isnt hard to find multiple to choose from (google torrentfreak vpn). for your everyday small time user/buyer, [live linux distro --> vpn --> tor] ....or.... [virtual machine --> vpn --> tor] are two basic setups that will protect you from most attacks to deanonymize yourself. plus they dont sacrifice a lot of speed. i have to disagree with this advice. using a vpn before connecting to an anonymous network like tor isnt going to help as much as it is going to hurt. think about the reasons that you would want to have this setup:1) you want to obfuscate your usage of the anonymous network from your isp2) your locality makes it difficult to access anonymous networksthese two situations are exactly what bridges/obfsproxy are for. connecting to vpn first just leaves a trail. even if you paid or it anonymously with bitcoins, well i hope you tumbled your coins separately from your hot wallet for day to day use b/c that would immediately start linking you to your hidden activities. an anonymous vpn *after* tor does make sense if you are visiting clearnet sites frequently. many of them block tor outproxies. an inexpensive vpn or vps can make your life a lot easier when visiting these kinds of sites. on timing based deanonymization, your best bet is to constantly be connected to your anonymous network and passing traffic in order to make it not possible to know if you are actually doing something or your computer is doing something. this can be accomplished a number of ways, each with different risks and benefits.

so i was making a deposit on wednesday and it was taking a long time. i refreshed every once in a while and then i got a deposit that was almost .1 btc less than my deposit. i was all wtf but it was enough for my purchase so i made it and went to bed. i checked back in the morning and i had the full amount of my deposit available and i realized the short deposit i got the night before was actually from the night before sr got hacked  and i trnsferred that deposit out because i made it into the wrong market. that deposit took forever to enter my account because of the attack. so id like to say i reported this to the admin but i immediately transferred it out to another wallet. several days later i log in and my balance hasnt changed. anyone else have this happen?  maybe sr didnt really get hacked by one or two people. maybe it was gross incompetence on their bitcoin back end like mtgox.
they seem to be down again today.
