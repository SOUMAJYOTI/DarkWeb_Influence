once buyers submit their public key place order the vendor noticed the new order. 
the vendor can chose for payment upfront for multi sig escrow. 
once vendors have decided the payment method buyers will notified how proceed further. 
now the orders page would have multisig payment address assigned for that specific order which buyers need send the funds and soon one confirmation has been received the order will marked paid and the vendor notified. 
the vendor will then their bitcoind debug console input the following commands. 
instructions for buyers and vendors available your orders page guide you through. 
hex string for the order details all you need copy paste. 
this will show the multisig address which the funds are being held sent the buyer. 
once the vendor has dispatched the items they will then punch this will provide hex string your output verifying them having signed the transaction. 
this hex output needs copied and posted the blank box. 
this point time the buyer will notified that the vendor has dispatched the goods. 
once the goods have been received the buyer will then need sign their signature confirming havering received the goods and then releasing the escrow which would pay the vendor directly their wallet. 
same instructions for the buyers with one additional step releasing funds escrow. 
your bitcoind debug console hex string for the order details this second signature will now complete the order. 
hex string raw transaction. 
this send immediately the blockchain network and the first confirmation the vendor paid their wallet. 
create your public and private key onlineyou will need use clearnet site.

this will then provide you with wallet address pubkey privkey. 
save your newly generated private and public key for placing receiving your order and releasing receiving your funds. 
login the and upload your bitcoin public key youre vendor click account tab. 
and then add bitcoin pub keys. 
buyer use freshly generated one while placing order. 
once both parties buyer and vendor have confirmed details order they will presented with unique order wallet address redeem script public keys the buyer vendor and the for that specific order.

this hex output will then need copied broadcasted the blockchain network release the escrow funds the vendor. 
click broadcast tab and input the final hex output and click submit release escrow funds the vendor.

onion users torchem. 
this gateway working the time this post. 
onion these are the others. 
using middle box requires two network interfaces the middle box and has only one. 
anyway believe tutorial using for this purpose needed. 
maybe the use middle box isolates the various intel chipset rootkits though would still very sceptical about any intel chipset these days. 
website reference forum hidden service that was called pedoforum. 
was run the same guy who ran cam lot apparently the site that just made the news for having been busted year ago that collected videos teenagers jacking off webcams they called cam lot website. 
from the wording that sounds like they didnt target casual browsers the forum but only people who registered accounts. 
any case should have expected them things like this. 
the best defense having two computers dedicated for anonymous activity one being tor router some secure like openbsd and the other being hardened system for browsing. 
physical isolation the diamond standard for protecting from this sort attack and obviously they are going keep doing this type attack more and more time for people rapidly start using physical isolation. 
throw still though hide hardware serial numbers. 
another technique protect from attacks like this use virtual machine based isolation itself. 
you can also protect from attacks like this with software and hardware firewalls and with process level firewalls like mandatory access controls. 
pretty much this concerns you the things look into are how protect from this sort attack with. 
firewalls complicated often requires extensive knowledge exactly how needs configured both the firewall and the system itself. 
mandatory access controls similar firewalls also requires extensive knowledge. 
physical isolation requires much less knowledge and much less wrong well. 
its very powerful technique. 
virtual isolation requires the least amount knowledge trivial configure provides significant protection but not much physical isolation you also need know how harden your browser. 
like disable javascript tor browser for sure. 
you dont need them disable images too long you understand that this could increase linkability risk though this wont matter much you only few websites only websites you illegal things. 
not using windows one the biggest favors you can for yourself well use some distribution linux instead maybe even some bsd distro. 
think how you can add amnesia well even you are compromised the attackers foothold lost after some period time. 
tails has amnesia built into for example and has protection from this sort attack via the firewall method the firewall having been configured professionals. 
whonix goes with the virtual isolation technique for protecting from this sort attack but doesnt have amnesia attacker can still gain permanent foothold they just cant easily get your real address though they can spy your entire besides that you will deanonymize yourself you send address plaintext for example. 
you could get amnesia using stable operating system without many updates for and loading from read only medium into memory something maybe from hard drive with write blocker. 
and only load writable format when updating the software intentionally never when the process doing sensitive things. 
you could also use snapshots the same thing for virtual isolation. 
the biggest thing also keep mind for our threat model the risk attacker deanonymizing you with your plaintext address even they cant get your address. 
protect from this your address needs encrypted before passes through exposed security domains. 
the best way this with air gaps virtual air gaps least. 
security this level really hard get into and even harder maintain. 
but you follow the already known best practices you can make extremely unlikely that fbi level attacker can pwn you with this technique. 
nsa tao different story though. 
never mind about the rise email just read axas thread secure email and got lelantos account. 
from grams april amnever mind about the rise email just read axas thread secure email and got lelantos account. 
you will like lelantos. 
thanks for your good work with grams and welcome the forum. 
hey everyone the owner operator and programmer grams. 
got lot people emailing from here thought would make account. 
doing lot new features and markets for the beta release hopefully tomorrow. 
you have any questions feel free email. 
try respond fast but have been working hour days the past week trying make the site the best can. 
about safe mail. 
know sucks trying get rise invite. 
already have but need another. 
any you could hook that would great. 
can send you some btc for your trouble. 
anyways glad you all liek the site and cant wait for you see what have planned. 
hello boys and girls you know the money the wallet agora can pick them and the money referall still apply did enroll approximately people every week and gain sometimes even. 
someone can answer thanks brothers and sisters sorry english bad. 
your best bets are lbc bitstamp buying one the markets via prepaid visa. 
how come there love for evo feel like missing part the picture. 
only problem with have little traffic over there. 
hey have shit agora. 
have attempted access agora using the new urls they have posted all over the dark web. 
but never loads the login page. 
dose any one know how long untill its and running when can back work tried warn every one trade your email with your business associates because any day agora could crash like the others. 
and today one can access agora they say this bug could have fucked agora. 
its really unfortuante case the law impermanance. 
they really fuck the univeral community subsatnce users when they toasted silk. 
that was the most awsome creation ever got experience. 
the world will never freely organised was when silk ran its course. 
feel blessed have been apart. 
worked hard earn coin invest silk was their number fan supporter and believer. 
invested every thing had and could earn into silk. 
was scammed over btc. 
but for while there vendor was earning aud week. 
faith paid off was supermn lucky. 
others lost big dillars. 
but trial and error gambeled every penny had. 
miss you silk you were ultimate window the universal sub culture users and abusers. 
iwill never forget you. 
contact with them too edge about whether not trust them. 
hmm they seem legit there one way know they are being legityou could ask them put you into contact with one their customers and see matches with the same one spoke and from there listed the wiki tor scam but dosent say why only that discount cards dont exist when confronted him about this said was probably due the green machine fungi and even told fungi plays some part what put the hidden wiki least the old one anyway and that very good scamming people. 
this house cards seems legit but then dosent the same time think maybe its best stick evolution and the established market places with escrow just safe although ask him put you into contact with another one his customers and get back here when has done that and can collaborate from here. 
cant access outlaw with the main link. 
their site seems down. 
know they have multiple links access their site anyone have them. 
that onionshop worth looking into. 
yeah heard deepify wasnt working right today. 
not one ive checked. 
ill have give them look from deepdotweb april pmblackbank also changed their url. 
odd that thinks they arent vulnerable.

becoming all the more apparent doesnt hold the keys cant change the url even did want. 
seems like everyone around area never has any coins. 
its hard find them why dam coins going hunt you down and find you wherever you are hiding. 
anyone have any leads where get coins anonymously besides local bitcoins.

firewalls complicated often requires extensive knowledge exactly how needs configured both the firewall and the system itself. 
mandatory access controls similar firewalls also requires extensive knowledge. 
physical isolation requires much less knowledge and much less wrong well. 
its very powerful technique. 
virtual isolation requires the least amount knowledge trivial configure provides significant protection but not much physical isolation you also need know how harden your browser. 
like disable javascript tor browser for sure. 
you dont need them disable images too long you understand that this could increase linkability risk though this wont matter much you only few websites only websites you illegal things. 
not using windows one the biggest favors you can for yourself well use some distribution linux instead maybe even some bsd distro. 
think how you can add amnesia well even you are compromised the attackers foothold lost after some period time. 
tails has amnesia built into for example and has protection from this sort attack via the firewall method the firewall having been configured professionals. 
whonix goes with the virtual isolation technique for protecting from this sort attack but doesnt have amnesia attacker can still gain permanent foothold they just cant easily get your real address though they can spy your entire besides that you will deanonymize yourself you send address plaintext for example. 
you could get amnesia using stable operating system without many updates for and loading from read only medium into memory something maybe from hard drive with write blocker. 
and only load writable format when updating the software intentionally never when the process doing sensitive things. 
you could also use snapshots the same thing for virtual isolation. 
the biggest thing also keep mind for our threat model the risk attacker deanonymizing you with your plaintext address even they cant get your address. 
protect from this your address needs encrypted before passes through exposed security domains. 
the best way this with air gaps virtual air gaps least. 
security this level really hard get into and even harder maintain. 
but you follow the already known best practices you can make extremely unlikely that fbi level attacker can pwn you with this technique. 
nsa tao different story though. 
using middle box requires two network interfaces the middle box and has only one. 
anyway believe tutorial using for this purpose needed. 
maybe the use middle box isolates the various intel chipset rootkits though would still very sceptical about any intel chipset these days. 
hey everyone the owner operator and programmer grams. 
got lot people emailing from here thought would make account. 
doing lot new features and markets for the beta release hopefully tomorrow. 
you have any questions feel free email. 
try respond fast but have been working hour days the past week trying make the site the best can. 
about safe mail. 
know sucks trying get rise invite. 
already have but need another. 
any you could hook that would great. 
can send you some btc for your trouble. 
anyways glad you all liek the site and cant wait for you see what have planned. 
seems like everyone around area never has any coins. 
its hard find them why dam coins going hunt you down and find you wherever you are hiding. 
anyone have any leads where get coins anonymously besides local bitcoins. 
ive used that place lol. 
how come there love for evo feel like missing part the picture. 
only problem with have little traffic over there. 
this was our take middle boxes last year and other than read only file system dont have much add. 
wifi used for one the interfaces either. 
would like see build script than could applied vanilla fresh rasbian build. 
wouldnt that much work for somebody. 
quotewe have taken slightly different approach with this the past one that provides little additional security the cost little usability. 
provide here for information may useful for some. 
the fundamental difference that rather than transparently route all traffic from the secure box and into tor only route explicitly defined traffic. 
the middle boxa simple tor client dual homed host ideally physical host. 
will have two network interfaces public interface which connects the internet ideally through natting router firewall and private interface. 
this system must hardened because will able establish arbitrary connections the internet. 
will run tor client mode and will expose the socks proxy the private network only. 
ideally should hard coded connect trusted guard nodes preferably ones that you either run know safe. 
the least the guard nodes should local you network terms. 
this system should configured drop all inbound connections the public interface regardless any upstream firewalls. 
the system should also configured drop all traffic and out the private interface except inbound traffic the local socks proxy port tcp similar. 
for good measure the middle box should also drop all outbound udp traffic the internet. 
the private networkthis network exists purely between the middle box and the secure box. 
ideally this should simple cross over cable which connects the two systems. 
wireless acceptable but the key thing that the private network cannot route anywhere other then between the middle and secure boxes and will carrying plain text sensitive traffic and thus must protected from eavesdropping. 
the private network must have default gateway and dns. 
the secure boxthe key tenet this system that does not know where have any way finding out where. 
this system has single network interface the private network. 
again there must default gateway dns nothing. 
just simple static address and more. 
the local firewall iptables should configured this system drop all inbound traffic and block all outbound traffic except outbound the socks port the middle box. 
the browser this system should configured use the socks proxy the middle box. 
there requirement use any other application other than the browser then must explicitly configured use socks failing that executed using torsocks which again will use the socks proxy the middle box. 
ideally the hostname this system should computer server and only one user should configured called user ensure the mac address the system modified from the hardware default boot time ideally randomized each boot. 
terms anything that non persistent nearly always better such tails. 
the systems should have microphone camera gps and ideally wireless wlan bluetooth gsm etc. 
nothing that allows interact with the real world any way except via that socks proxy. 
when looking the hardening the secure box imagine you are bad guy somewhere who has gained unrestricted access the system and ask yourself can you break out any way that will cause you generate network traffic that will not through the socks port and into tor you can then something wrong rethink. 
can you extract anything from the system that provides irl identity information for instance address details that you might use copy paste into order forms you can find anything value then something wrong rethink. 
this model can virtualized easily enough but the cost some security. 
virtualized then make sure file sharing from guest host disabled shared clipboards etc. 
the virtualization software should configured provide much isolation between the guest and host systems possible. 
our preferred setup for this simple and uses rasberry the middle box and old laptop connected via cross over ethernet cable. 
the connects wirelessly the local broadband router. 
internet router middle box secured laptop. 
contact with them too edge about whether not trust them. 
hmm they seem legit there one way know they are being legityou could ask them put you into contact with one their customers and see matches with the same one spoke and from there listed the wiki tor scam but dosent say why only that discount cards dont exist when confronted him about this said was probably due the green machine fungi and even told fungi plays some part what put the hidden wiki least the old one anyway and that very good scamming people. 
this house cards seems legit but then dosent the same time think maybe its best stick evolution and the established market places with escrow just safe although ask him put you into contact with another one his customers and get back here when has done that and can collaborate from here.

becoming all the more apparent doesnt hold the keys cant change the url even did want. 
website reference forum hidden service that was called pedoforum. 
was run the same guy who ran cam lot apparently the site that just made the news for having been busted year ago that collected videos teenagers jacking off webcams they called cam lot website. 
from the wording that sounds like they didnt target casual browsers the forum but only people who registered accounts. 
any case should have expected them things like this. 
the best defense having two computers dedicated for anonymous activity one being tor router some secure like openbsd and the other being hardened system for browsing. 
physical isolation the diamond standard for protecting from this sort attack and obviously they are going keep doing this type attack more and more time for people rapidly start using physical isolation. 
throw still though hide hardware serial numbers. 
another technique protect from attacks like this use virtual machine based isolation itself. 
you can also protect from attacks like this with software and hardware firewalls and with process level firewalls like mandatory access controls. 
pretty much this concerns you the things look into are how protect from this sort attack with. 
firewalls complicated often requires extensive knowledge exactly how needs configured both the firewall and the system itself. 
mandatory access controls similar firewalls also requires extensive knowledge. 
physical isolation requires much less knowledge and much less wrong well. 
its very powerful technique. 
virtual isolation requires the least amount knowledge trivial configure provides significant protection but not much physical isolation you also need know how harden your browser. 
like disable javascript tor browser for sure. 
you dont need them disable images too long you understand that this could increase linkability risk though this wont matter much you only few websites only websites you illegal things. 
not using windows one the biggest favors you can for yourself well use some distribution linux instead maybe even some bsd distro. 
think how you can add amnesia well even you are compromised the attackers foothold lost after some period time. 
tails has amnesia built into for example and has protection from this sort attack via the firewall method the firewall having been configured professionals. 
whonix goes with the virtual isolation technique for protecting from this sort attack but doesnt have amnesia attacker can still gain permanent foothold they just cant easily get your real address though they can spy your entire besides that you will deanonymize yourself you send address plaintext for example. 
you could get amnesia using stable operating system without many updates for and loading from read only medium into memory something maybe from hard drive with write blocker. 
and only load writable format when updating the software intentionally never when the process doing sensitive things. 
you could also use snapshots the same thing for virtual isolation. 
the biggest thing also keep mind for our threat model the risk attacker deanonymizing you with your plaintext address even they cant get your address. 
protect from this your address needs encrypted before passes through exposed security domains. 
the best way this with air gaps virtual air gaps least. 
security this level really hard get into and even harder maintain. 
but you follow the already known best practices you can make extremely unlikely that fbi level attacker can pwn you with this technique. 
nsa tao different story though. 
tor changing their urls. 
not because they claim they are not susceptible exploit. 
heard few markets forums changing them but cant remember which ones. 
this gateway working the time this post. 
onion these are the others. 
onion something similar looking for reviews. 
whats your experience with him. 
onion users torchem. 
cant access outlaw with the main link. 
their site seems down. 
know they have multiple links access their site anyone have them. 
hey have shit agora. 
have attempted access agora using the new urls they have posted all over the dark web. 
but never loads the login page. 
dose any one know how long untill its and running when can back work tried warn every one trade your email with your business associates because any day agora could crash like the others. 
and today one can access agora they say this bug could have fucked agora. 
its really unfortuante case the law impermanance. 
they really fuck the univeral community subsatnce users when they toasted silk. 
that was the most awsome creation ever got experience. 
the world will never freely organised was when silk ran its course. 
feel blessed have been apart. 
worked hard earn coin invest silk was their number fan supporter and believer. 
invested every thing had and could earn into silk. 
was scammed over btc. 
but for while there vendor was earning aud week. 
faith paid off was supermn lucky. 
others lost big dillars. 
but trial and error gambeled every penny had. 
miss you silk you were ultimate window the universal sub culture users and abusers. 
iwill never forget you. 
that onionshop worth looking into. 
yeah heard deepify wasnt working right today. 
seems like everyone around area never has any coins. 
its hard find them why dam coins going hunt you down and find you wherever you are hiding. 
anyone have any leads where get coins anonymously besides local bitcoins. 
ive used that place lol. 
using middle box requires two network interfaces the middle box and has only one. 
anyway believe tutorial using for this purpose needed. 
maybe the use middle box isolates the various intel chipset rootkits though would still very sceptical about any intel chipset these days. 
the pirate market has now added vacation mode for vendors when vendor hasnt signed into the market for days vacation mode enabled which hides their items from the product list and basically puts their account into hibernation. 
when the vendor signs back into their account can disable vacation mode and their account returns normal. 
this eliminates any extra time spent fishing out inactive vendors the pirate market. 
tmg doesnt use ssl seems theyre unaffected. 
not sure which any darknet sites use ssl but imagine itd huge hassle. 
you could self sign but that would alarm many people when their browsers start yelling them about and imagine itd hard get one signed for onion domain from the various cas out there. 
how better than torchat. 
please not direct people email any other direct message system for the purpose trade. 
also not advertise goods link your marketplace before you are verified vendor. 
agora has just come back online under its new url. 
onionthe forums are also online under new url. 
onion these are the correct urls confirmed agoras pgp signed message code select begin pgp signed message hash sha agora announcement earlier this week the details serious bug the openssl library were made public. 
this bug which affected large number web servers and devices was popularly referred heartbleed. 
the bug allows anybody connecting vulnerable service reveal the contents memory the server and thus reveal secret keys user information passwords etc. 
there more information about the bug and the versions openssl that are affected the website setup for the bug. 
com agora hidden service served the tor network and while agora itself does not use the vulnerable library the tor software that makes the network was affected this bug some instances since integrates the openssl library. 
the tor project wrote blog post about how this bug affects various aspects the tor service. 
org blog openssl bug cve for users the tor browser bundle you should upgrade the latest release version immediately the bundled version tor vulnerable the attack. 
get the latest tor browser bundle version from. 
orgfor agora hidden service have investigated the possibilities exploitation and our current best knowledge the most attacker could hope gain hypothetical situation successful exploitation the ability impersonate the hidden service. 
the tor blog post this subject states like the last big openssl bug this shouldnt allow attacker identify the location the hidden service but attacker who knows the hidden service identity key can impersonate the hidden service. 
this time even attack like that looking unlikely and havent seen any signs being successfully executed. 
however since the underlying bug very serious and has been the wild for unclear amount time will taking the necessary precautions and shall hereby recycle all our previously used hidden service keys. 
effectively this means that need change the address the market. 
additionally have decided take the market down for some time can fully investigate the effects and change all servers used order fully protect ourselves from any hypothetical damage information leaks. 
estimate that this process will complete the end the week. 
understand that this big inconvenience for many you but please understand that this for the sake your anonymity well.

thanks for the update. 
from cousinmolly april pmnice did you have the post ready and hit refresh for days lol nope. 
just have copy the pgp signed message and when the market came back online passed along the info. 
have sales loss. 
just set evolution well. 
does anyone know whats happening. 
the new link doesnt work. 
this aint your average trolly trash talk thread. 
for would like very much hear from agora admin the subject. 
its prolly all over reddit but not word down here. 
maybe even quick mention their forums. 
but know that just causes issues too. 
look what happened when clu opened his mouth. 
hope they come back soon. 
they should least give update. 
message from hydroblowback today not sure. 
theres been bug the system for unknown amount time. 
site should weeks time that sucks big time. 
you are the ball arent you now they said weeks end and ended about minutes ago. 
guess they never lied because sure they will have back the weeks end. 
know that the old url posted message saying that they were moving servers and that they said would back the end the week. 
dont know which week they meant when they said that. 
they are indeed doing what the message said. 
know that they have not posted single message since the site was taken down and that thus far new information has been provided. 
also know that someone logged into the agora forum account several hours after the site was taken off line without posting any additional information but since then there has been sight agora admins staff. 
hopefully the site not again soon they will provide some sort update. 
until then really know nothing. 
hope think believe but not know. 
wanna know something interesting. 
have not once been accused posting.

com agora hidden service served the tor network and while agora itself does not use the vulnerable library the tor software that makes the network was affected this bug some instances since integrates the openssl library. 
the tor project wrote blog post about how this bug affects various aspects the tor service.

the tor blog post this subject states like the last big openssl bug this shouldnt allow attacker identify the location the hidden service but attacker who knows the hidden service identity key can impersonate the hidden service. 
this time even attack like that looking unlikely and havent seen any signs being successfully executed. 
however since the underlying bug very serious and has been the wild for unclear amount time will taking the necessary precautions and shall hereby recycle all our previously used hidden service keys.

the oldstable versions debian squeeze and suse linux enterprise server are not vulnerable. 
pirate market sorry our team disagree with your information.

our opinion does not help the old debian immune there exploitable network traffic that can captured and decoded the opponent. 
here the official tor announcement about heartbleed bug and the impact tor network.

from cousinmolly april pmnice did you have the post ready and hit refresh for days lol nope. 
just have copy the pgp signed message and when the market came back online passed along the info. 
nice did you have the post ready and hit refresh for days cause that was super fast post check mins before and nothing.

know why because never started fucking with market should not have been fucking with. 
have sales loss. 
just set evolution well. 
know that the old url posted message saying that they were moving servers and that they said would back the end the week. 
dont know which week they meant when they said that. 
they are indeed doing what the message said. 
know that they have not posted single message since the site was taken down and that thus far new information has been provided. 
also know that someone logged into the agora forum account several hours after the site was taken off line without posting any additional information but since then there has been sight agora admins staff. 
hopefully the site not again soon they will provide some sort update. 
until then really know nothing. 
hope think believe but not know. 
you are the ball arent you now they said weeks end and ended about minutes ago. 
guess they never lied because sure they will have back the weeks end. 
message from hydroblowback today not sure. 
theres been bug the system for unknown amount time. 
site should weeks time that sucks big time. 
hope they come back soon. 
they should least give update. 
this aint your average trolly trash talk thread. 
for would like very much hear from agora admin the subject. 
its prolly all over reddit but not word down here. 
maybe even quick mention their forums. 
but know that just causes issues too. 
look what happened when clu opened his mouth. 
does anyone know whats happening. 
the new link doesnt work. 
please not direct people email any other direct message system for the purpose trade. 
also not advertise goods link your marketplace before you are verified vendor. 
agora working fine stop bitching dumbasses like fatherted. 
fatherted and other stupid spreading fud sucka dick motherfockers. 
from rounded april pmis anybody suggesting any reason doubt them other than should always doubt everything there every reason doubt the fuckers every reason scammed money. 
keep trustin these markets without multi sig party offsite escrow. 
the idiots have been weeks the last and not word from staff thats the first thing ever. 
thats now how you business and any off still doing business there idiot. 
the pirate market has now added vacation mode for vendors when vendor hasnt signed into the market for days vacation mode enabled which hides their items from the product list and basically puts their account into hibernation. 
when the vendor signs back into their account can disable vacation mode and their account returns normal. 
this eliminates any extra time spent fishing out inactive vendors the pirate market.

each square the chessboard identified unique coordinate pair letter and number. 
the vertical column squares called files from whites left the queenside his right the kingside are labeled through. 
the horizontal rows squares called ranks are numbered starting from whites side the board. 
thus each square has unique identification file letter followed rank number.

down your syndrome cant even fucking read the last few comments the first thread this section before opening new one. 
its again right now but word play wouldnt have worked said straight away. 
would love get involved this but unfortunately dont quite have the basics down yet. 
friend and started trying figure out while ago but just confused the balls out. 
think need find person can play face face get head round first. 
give wee bit time and will back take that lsd you. 
alright you want play some. 
org wiki game will using the fairly standard chess like notation one side skipped and the other. 
about kyu beginner but good enough that can try make game interesting. 
you are just starting out this probably not the best format play games played this way tend stretch for very long. 
the very beginning best get many games done fast reasonable. 
you are best off probably learning the basics else where. 
will try accommodate any skill level however feel free challenge regardless skill. 
easy handicap feel free suggest handicap your favor. 
lets start with game. 
black has considerable advantage challenger can first. 
and there real interest would like offer prize some lsd for future games. 
seriously get life. 
allowing for multisig escrow its tricky concept. 
any wallet will allow you pay multisig address. 
the problem comes when you have provide your signature allow the spending from the address. 
most wallets today not give easy interface for users that. 
for example can done bitcoind but the command line and for non expert would difficult. 
other wallets have bits and pieces the necessary functionality but not nice bundled way. 
there are python libraries that make breeze for developers but that doesnt help much youre not developer. 
some services are offering web based escrow and web wallets. 
using multisig but they are just using multisig internally their architecture give some defence against thefit which not quite what you need when interacting with dark net market. 
the marketplace itself would have provide you with least some hand holding providing you with the payout transaction sign and then giving you detailed instructions how sign and send back them constituting your agreement the payout. 
thats the problem wallets should doing that part for you. 
you should able click button sign authorize this transaction. 
but the standard ones dont yet. 
darkwallet for example development and apparently offering this feature. 
take what say with caution though ive only been somewhat involved bitcoin related development recently and dont actually know exactly what the various darknet markets are doing. 
thats the main reason here actually find out. 
edit further reading found this addresses are addresses controlled more than one person. 
they are created with set requirements that dictate how the funds the address can moved. 
signature addresses are jointly controlled people say the site operator the buyer and the seller but funds can only moved two people authorize and sign transaction. 
users will expected sign transactions for themselves. 
while client leave much desired regarding support for multisignature transactions believe the best way increase their adoption bring them into day day life and watch the situation improve from there. 
currently the only unmodified client which supports signing multisignature transactions bitcoin core. 
otherwise users can use offline copy. 
multisig sign their browser. 
sucks that bitcoin core the only client that lets this. 
very much looking forward light client that supports out the box. 
com bitwasp now offering built multi signature transactions. 
which more less seems confirm what was saying. 
must admit that the multi sig explanation little daunting when first read but after going back and reading all again liking more and more. 
thanks for focusing the main issues that most other markets only claim fix.

something isnt right. 
special characters passwords really why not are passwords with special characters more secure harder password processing code the password contains punctuation characters dollar signs etc naively imagine that restricted character set for passwordsmakes said passwords much easier crack. 
but hey what know you have specifically and knowingly implemented policythat forbids special characters passwords. 
why that know you consciously did this. 
and that its not oversight. 
because the front page issues specific error message that reads.

was buyer since july and two years customer not very active though didnt witness any theft any hacking althought that times shouldnt have good security. 
suppossed its successor then why did got its coins lost why all that force shit not really into bitcoins security blindly trust dont know what transaction maleability but bitcoin had flaw that allowed these kind robbing wouldnt massively tried accomplished dont want evil minded but smell rat the new dpr. 
from guru april amodd that thinks they arent vulnerable. 
are they correct are they just arrogant from evilgrin april amtor changing their urls. 
not because they claim they are not susceptible exploit. 
heard few markets forums changing them but cant remember which ones. 
think you are invulnerable arrogance has had its problems the past and would not surprise they continue have problems. 
appreciate the heads the new forums come right the market the other hand taking some time respond. 
guess they are still working some the bugs out.

sounds like you are connected competitor something sorry you are legit. 
not accepting special chars does not mean not encrypted hashed. 
usual for several reasons even some services from big corporations not accept special chars. 
checked and their password case sensitive being realist you cannot break strong case sensitive password letters and numbers over http connections and they worry force you use least chars mixed there are many people agora and silk using pure letters passwords. 
also you would need break the pin code too completely impossible you use decent password pigeon site looks safe very fast and easy use.

org wiki game will using the fairly standard chess like notation one side skipped and the other. 
about kyu beginner but good enough that can try make game interesting. 
you are just starting out this probably not the best format play games played this way tend stretch for very long. 
the very beginning best get many games done fast reasonable. 
you are best off probably learning the basics else where. 
will try accommodate any skill level however feel free challenge regardless skill. 
easy handicap feel free suggest handicap your favor. 
lets start with game. 
black has considerable advantage challenger can first. 
and there real interest would like offer prize some lsd for future games. 
appreciate the heads the new forums come right the market the other hand taking some time respond.

onion you seem have some dodgy password rules going there. 
something isnt right. 
special characters passwords really why not are passwords with special characters more secure harder password processing code the password contains punctuation characters dollar signs etc naively imagine that restricted character set for passwordsmakes said passwords much easier crack. 
but hey what know you have specifically and knowingly implemented policythat forbids special characters passwords. 
why that know you consciously did this. 
and that its not oversight. 
because the front page issues specific error message that reads. 
white spaces special characters. 
pigeon makes sense because was ease cracking could only not encrypt passwors. 
maybe its some botched job avoid injection. 
anyways feel free register using referal link lol. 
onion pehymxacn yits avoid sql injection does that ever work with password fields. 
down your syndrome cant even fucking read the last few comments the first thread this section before opening new one. 
its again right now but word play wouldnt have worked said straight away. 
must admit that the multi sig explanation little daunting when first read but after going back and reading all again liking more and more. 
thanks for focusing the main issues that most other markets only claim fix. 
seriously get life.

allowing for multisig escrow its tricky concept. 
any wallet will allow you pay multisig address. 
the problem comes when you have provide your signature allow the spending from the address. 
most wallets today not give easy interface for users that. 
for example can done bitcoind but the command line and for non expert would difficult. 
other wallets have bits and pieces the necessary functionality but not nice bundled way. 
there are python libraries that make breeze for developers but that doesnt help much youre not developer. 
some services are offering web based escrow and web wallets. 
using multisig but they are just using multisig internally their architecture give some defence against thefit which not quite what you need when interacting with dark net market. 
the marketplace itself would have provide you with least some hand holding providing you with the payout transaction sign and then giving you detailed instructions how sign and send back them constituting your agreement the payout. 
thats the problem wallets should doing that part for you. 
you should able click button sign authorize this transaction. 
but the standard ones dont yet. 
darkwallet for example development and apparently offering this feature. 
take what say with caution though ive only been somewhat involved bitcoin related development recently and dont actually know exactly what the various darknet markets are doing. 
thats the main reason here actually find out. 
edit further reading found this addresses are addresses controlled more than one person. 
they are created with set requirements that dictate how the funds the address can moved. 
signature addresses are jointly controlled people say the site operator the buyer and the seller but funds can only moved two people authorize and sign transaction. 
users will expected sign transactions for themselves. 
while client leave much desired regarding support for multisignature transactions believe the best way increase their adoption bring them into day day life and watch the situation improve from there. 
currently the only unmodified client which supports signing multisignature transactions bitcoin core. 
otherwise users can use offline copy. 
multisig sign their browser. 
sucks that bitcoin core the only client that lets this. 
very much looking forward light client that supports out the box. 
com bitwasp now offering built multi signature transactions. 
which more less seems confirm what was saying.

signature addresses are jointly controlled people say the site operator the buyer and the seller but funds can only moved two people authorize and sign transaction. 
users will expected sign transactions for themselves. 
while client leave much desired regarding support for multisignature transactions believe the best way increase their adoption bring them into day day life and watch the situation improve from there. 
currently the only unmodified client which supports signing multisignature transactions bitcoin core. 
otherwise users can use offline copy. 
multisig sign their browser. 
sucks that bitcoin core the only client that lets this. 
very much looking forward light client that supports out the box. 
com bitwasp now offering built multi signature transactions. 
which more less seems confirm what was saying.

onion you seem have some dodgy password rules going there. 
something isnt right. 
special characters passwords really why not are passwords with special characters more secure harder password processing code the password contains punctuation characters dollar signs etc naively imagine that restricted character set for passwordsmakes said passwords much easier crack. 
but hey what know you have specifically and knowingly implemented policythat forbids special characters passwords. 
why that know you consciously did this. 
and that its not oversight. 
because the front page issues specific error message that reads. 
white spaces special characters. 
pigeon makes sense because was ease cracking could only not encrypt passwors. 
maybe its some botched job avoid injection. 
anyways feel free register using referal link lol. 
onion pehymxacn yits avoid sql injection does that ever work with password fields man you are trying give pigeon bad name everywhere. 
sounds like you are connected competitor something sorry you are legit. 
not accepting special chars does not mean not encrypted hashed. 
usual for several reasons even some services from big corporations not accept special chars. 
checked and their password case sensitive being realist you cannot break strong case sensitive password letters and numbers over http connections and they worry force you use least chars mixed there are many people agora and silk using pure letters passwords. 
also you would need break the pin code too completely impossible you use decent password pigeon site looks safe very fast and easy use.

swoh see not inbox this the problem with these referral link. 
who will sign site due some referral from someone you dont know join market based user reports security reports and our general feel for this. 
the referrals are useless mind. 
its working for. 
its slowly picking. 
its secondary market. 
right now imo agora only because volume bsm market. 
with the inevitable death pandora sure that both agora and bsm will see increase traffic. 
quick facts users are not required any payment deposit allowed sell but temporary. 
once change our sell policies only already registered users will keep the right sell without any requirements. 
verification label your user profile can asked writing our support. 
full feedback system including feedback buyers. 
run two separated servers. 
the web server dedicated for serving web pages and holding the minimal necessary data while the hidden server dedicated hold bitcoin sensitive data and make all necessary updates web server. 
web server does not know how access hidden thats just not possible. 
our system house development. 
not use any kind third party code. 
users passwords are hashed. 
simple machines message board runs isolated third server. 
use traditional escrow cause very simple everyone specially for customers. 
believe multi signature does not provide any significant benefit definetly does not avoid intelligent scaming someone who full control the server. 
believe multi sig time consuming stressing and does not generate impulse sales that represents big portion all transactions any business. 
our servers are ready deal with massive amounts requests not need turn off the servers off escalate. 
already started big and fast. 
you can expect full uptime. 
want keep the site simple and straight forward but will consider any feature resquests. 
ask our board you think something really necessary. 
longevity can always pay for our costs matter the site profitable not. 
and run the site mostly for political reasons. 
expect see our site online for ages even not big success. 
referral program fairly rewarded specific cases. 
fully accountable you can verify how many users you referred and all your received payments.

there really reason for you need ssl encryption hidden service the only exception could think you had one tor client that acted behalf network and you didnt want anybody the local network see your packets. 
the other hand the only things that should going out plain text anyway are the headers username and password. 
everything else should encrypted using pgp mime the like. 
ive used bit blender couple times and was very impressed with ease use and speed. 
hello pigeon yeah. 
just dismiss competitor thats easier than makingany changes right get the password rules changed. 
there absolutely justification darknet site for imposing password character limitations. 
looks like scam and they act like scammers its probably scam. 
youre legit market youll happy keep clients happy right.

extend the max password length characters. 
accept any utf characters. 
what are you guys going now have nice day.

hello siblings what would like some encryption facility that can load onto usb key that will give access encrypted files encrypted vault files that will work equally well plug into windows machine linux machine. 
presume this will program guess will need have twoversions one that executes from usb key windows and one thatexecutes from usb key ubuntu. 
both versions linux and windows need looking the same set encrypted files vault files. 
that have access these files whether using linux machine windows machine. 
anyone knows such program please let know. 
three additional related questions.

large number saved professional games are included for study well libraries openings and corner sequences. 
can also used play against other programs. 
literature the filesharing networks often contains the following the first part the file torrent name igo baduk weiqithere huge. 
torrent collection available the public trackers called book collection which should contain all youre likely need and more. 
add tts post. 
one can also purchase through local bitcoins with cash via online methods. 
look for listings that offer cash deposit certain bank branches. 
these require you the bank branch choice and fill out out state deposit slip you fill this form out and give the cash the teller and they deposit into the account the btc seller. 
your btcs are then released you. 
you dont even have member the bank bank america has always been very fast and hassle free. 
also with this method you usually arent charged ridiculous price for your cryptocurrency. 
just remember tumble your coins intermediate wallet before using them purchase from vendor. 
info accessed through tor allows for the quick creation wallet that can used tumble the coins. 
there are many different things that you could use possibly satisfy this requirement. 
perhaps the easiest would simply zip file that has been password protected. 
course ive never done audit nor seen one the codebase ensure that the crypto that system doesnt have any implentation bugs. 
there are many other functionally similar methods doing the same thing. 
this would the encrypted tarball approach. 
the second approach would mount the file actual disk. 
this has the advantage being easy work with looks and feels just like native volume. 
there are few contenders that have both nix and windows compatabality this domain. 
the two ones that come mind are truecrypt and luks dmcrypt there are others well.
