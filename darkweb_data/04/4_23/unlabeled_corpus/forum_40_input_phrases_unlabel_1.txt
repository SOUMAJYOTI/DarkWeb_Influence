from gumby february pmfh wasnt hosted home. 
the server was france. 
the hosting provider believed ovh. 
none the servers were hosted home either but they were all discovered. 
the problem with hosting home that its undeniable you are the owner whereas you rent server anonymously then even your hidden service found they wont necessarily able find you. 
the point stupid host from home. 
another point should mention not use plastic bags plastic wrap etc stop odor. 
that and vac sealing not stop odor for more than few minutes. 
even triple sealing does very little and can smelled human let alone dog after hours. 
use mylar the minimum aluminum foil bags are even better. 
seal them with aluminum tape found home improvement centers world wide. 
also suggest using layers gloves. 
one cloth then external par nitrile gloves not latexthat will certainly work but need for pair gloves. 
one pair cotton will the job prints will get through that. 
latex nitrile will get hot hell you wear them for long same with other rubber substitutes. 
bandcamp those are good points. 
mirage you just repeated what said about plastic mylar foil. 
you can find gloves that fit closely there nothing wrong with wearing them just dont see the need. 
wearing gloves like having robot fingers that are super clumsy. 
nothing they can trace will through cotton glove you are only wearing long enough the packing. 
what are other ways stop odor from coming through. 
put the goods glass jar. 
put them tin some sort and tape carefully. 
pack them pvc. 
pack them abs other odor proof plastic. 
any other tips.

from flaxceed february amfortunately now can just use agora pandora and forget about the nightmare that was. 
yes there werent other options available guess guess would undertand the wrenching hair and dressing whole cloth wailing away the loss their market place but there are vendors the other markets and running and doing fines. 
ive been using agora for the past month and problems yet. 
ever becomes problem off use pandora any other ones around. 
when gets its shit together then folks want they can back the. 
until that happens for the most part will continue check and see movement being made fix things then will decide bring business back. 
doesnt have like. 
high school girls getting the vapors over the whole damn thing. 
move another market for now. 
have placed few orders agora and everything seems work just fine. 
problems have been seeing havent had effect. 
right now this marketplace. 
yea partial escrow excellent option give vedors the piece mind that they wont lose their ass escrow hack happens. 
bsm has gretly impressed over the last few months. 
and juelz you are running that ship blackstallion thanks you. 
from fromage february pmalright thx want order something from tmp any other market that has multsig have ask both the vendor and the marketplace for their public key every time yes technically you could. 
but really would not make much sense. 
using the old system escrow you are putting trust that the server going pay out the money the seller refund you there dispute. 
this case you are just placing trust that the server creating multisignature address that releasable either you the seller. 
you intend paying for your item then what concerns you have requesting the public keys the seller and server seems pointless since the seller who would end getting the funds. 
and this why you choose trustworthy markets and vendors. 
from fromage february pmwell its all about trust the end there any point multisig addresses yes stop the market from getting robbed because each transaction needs unlocked separately with unique keys. 
suppose you could get the public keys from the seller and server but this effectively would give the buyer and seller the ability close the deal without the server and therefore you could cut out their market fees. 
this bad idea for the server this. 
let just say that there more risk doing multisig than regular escrow and fact less risk because party hacker cannot steal everyones money. 
trusting the market choice you need make your own and you want deal directly with the vendor then outside the market. 
the market going give its customers the ability close deals while cutting out their market fees would not worth for the market.

the main concern have mostly about the security because for what know relies party create multisig address right now what guarantee have that this party uses the public key provided. 
and what guarantee have that this address indeed multisig and not something else there any way verifying this and how. 
alright thx want order something from tmp any other market that has multsig have ask both the vendor and the marketplace for their public key every time. 
well its all about trust the end there any point multisig addresses. 
thx that explains lot. 
ive been pestering people for week now.

lolthere this site found bitcoinbuilder. 
com where you can buy gox btc with real your wallet btc the hopes they resume withdraws. 
quite frankly dont know why bothered. 
two days ago posted this response your questionsquote from floydy february pmkeep eye. 
com this virtual market for goxbux and goxcoin and tells what the market thinks. 
did you skip what wrote did you actually read when you were fucked drugs cant remember thanks for your contribution the community. 
guess missed that. 
sorry dude must have been reading fast. 
legit didnt see please feel free neg karma. 
tonight gox owner resigned from his position the bitcoin foundations board directors. 
whale put bitcoins bitstamp mil usd worth about btc and like them got bought then the price fell some. 
theory gox insiders who are able withdraw coins from gox are buying gox and then selling other exchanges and depressing the prices. 
not new theory course. 
since btc has rules not even sure illegal. 
true hope gox profiteering rebuild its funds gox can reopen solvent. 
hope not just going rogue and ripping everyone off and hurting coin values well. 
wonder the whale bitstamp tonight gox insiders buying coins from themselves move the coins new wallets and break the evidence trail where the coins came from not sure that would work really but. 
ask the next man provide the other public keys then generate the address will begin with and see matches the payment address gave you.

from flaxceed february amfortunately now can just use agora pandora and forget about the nightmare that was. 
yes there werent other options available guess guess would undertand the wrenching hair and dressing whole cloth wailing away the loss their market place but there are vendors the other markets and running and doing fines. 
ive been using agora for the past month and problems yet. 
ever becomes problem off use pandora any other ones around. 
when gets its shit together then folks want they can back the. 
until that happens for the most part will continue check and see movement being made fix things then will decide bring business back. 
doesnt have like. 
high school girls getting the vapors over the whole damn thing. 
move another market for now. 
have placed few orders agora and everything seems work just fine. 
problems have been seeing havent had effect. 
right now this marketplace. 
yea partial escrow excellent option give vedors the piece mind that they wont lose their ass escrow hack happens. 
bsm has gretly impressed over the last few months. 
and juelz you are running that ship blackstallion thanks you. 
from fromage february pmalright thx want order something from tmp any other market that has multsig have ask both the vendor and the marketplace for their public key every time yes technically you could. 
but really would not make much sense. 
using the old system escrow you are putting trust that the server going pay out the money the seller refund you there dispute. 
this case you are just placing trust that the server creating multisignature address that releasable either you the seller. 
you intend paying for your item then what concerns you have requesting the public keys the seller and server seems pointless since the seller who would end getting the funds. 
and this why you choose trustworthy markets and vendors. 
from fromage february pmwell its all about trust the end there any point multisig addresses yes stop the market from getting robbed because each transaction needs unlocked separately with unique keys. 
suppose you could get the public keys from the seller and server but this effectively would give the buyer and seller the ability close the deal without the server and therefore you could cut out their market fees. 
this bad idea for the server this. 
let just say that there more risk doing multisig than regular escrow and fact less risk because party hacker cannot steal everyones money. 
trusting the market choice you need make your own and you want deal directly with the vendor then outside the market. 
the market going give its customers the ability close deals while cutting out their market fees would not worth for the market. 
from thekushlife february pmwhat does take for new marketplace get its own sub forum this currently being discussed. 
before deeper would like everybody really read the following clearnet article regarding javascript and tor. 
com software tor project stop using windows disable javascript the vulnerability was patched mozilla later versions firefox but some people may still using the older versions the tor browser bundle. 
the bundles browser based firefox specially configured visit tor sites which have urls that look like. 
several tor browser bundle versions were fixed over four day period starting june. 
although the browser bundle will automatically check for new version possible that some users didnt upgrade which could have put them risk. 
although unconfirmed computer security experts have theorized the malware may have been used law enforcement collect information people who browsed certain tor websites supported company called freedom hosting. 
that hosting company believed connected year old man eric eoin marques. 
being held irish authorities pending extradition request from the. 
charges distributing and promoting child pornography according the irish publication the independent. 
really switching away from windows probably good security move for many reasons according security advisory posted monday the tor project. 
people using linux and were not affected but that doesnt mean they couldnt targeted the future. 
this wasnt the first firefox vulnerability nor will the last the tor project warned. 
know that windows isnt safe. 
and anyone using older version the tor browser bundle isnt safe. 
moral dump windows and upgrade your software javascript not huge chunk security. 
the fact that site uses javascript should not absolute non negotiable issue. 
the tor network and javascript are just tools along with pgp tails pidgin ssl multi signature transactions crypto currency and many many more that each user has his her disposal stay safewhile its true our.

our site still functional even with javascript disabled. 
you will not have access certain areas the site but your experience still should enjoyable.

ship pieces and ironically the receiver the only piece thats actually illegal ship. 
any handling the gun with pairs gloves. 
thoroughly wipe each piece down with gun oil then lint free cloth before putting bubble mailer possible trace prints. 
use different types labels different fonts with business label shipping templates. 
yeah kind anal about. 
the more professional you make your packages look the less likely they are arouse suspicion. 
live larger metropolitan city what have list all the apartment complexes mile radius. 
keep track how often use each one. 
use fake name and simply dont put apartment number the return address. 
take each package different post office each time. 
keeping track which ones. 
before walking into the post office wipe the mailer down then bring holding between index and thumb. 
swing back and forth people don wonder why carrying like that. 
handing the clerk slide fingers opposite each hard which gets rid any print that might have been there. 
yeah again anal. 
lol with the receiver wrap sticky lead tape make look like anything except receiver gun case gets rayed. 
normally throw other stuff the packages too that are made metal. 
never had one not make. 
from pothead february pmuntil decon repays users shouldnt considered scam marketplace they get pass because they help fund this forum didnt realize first you have different market. 
wont get pass from the community and are the ones that count. 
the problem with making prove scam that these admins hide their activities from impossible for prove anything. 
with this requirement proof nothing scam. 
imagine market takes all our money and the admin says his dog ate the bitcoin. 
that impossible just like theft transacion maleability but still can not prove that scam happened. 
can only prove that the bitcoins were not eaten maleable. 
think makes valid point. 
have unique problem someone stole password and tried pass themselves off and have had help resolving this issue created both pdxblack accounts the same time and worked very hard build name that solid agora with almost sales first month. 
the accounts had different keys but they are both mine. 
just dont want any the shit this guy pulled affect name also have tha name couple other markets. 
bandcamp those are good points. 
mirage you just repeated what said about plastic mylar foil. 
you can find gloves that fit closely there nothing wrong with wearing them just dont see the need. 
wearing gloves like having robot fingers that are super clumsy. 
nothing they can trace will through cotton glove you are only wearing long enough the packing. 
what are other ways stop odor from coming through. 
put the goods glass jar. 
put them tin some sort and tape carefully. 
pack them pvc. 
pack them abs other odor proof plastic. 
any other tips. 
another point should mention not use plastic bags plastic wrap etc stop odor. 
that and vac sealing not stop odor for more than few minutes. 
even triple sealing does very little and can smelled human let alone dog after hours. 
use mylar the minimum aluminum foil bags are even better. 
seal them with aluminum tape found home improvement centers world wide. 
also suggest using layers gloves. 
one cloth then external par nitrile gloves not latexthat will certainly work but need for pair gloves. 
one pair cotton will the job prints will get through that. 
latex nitrile will get hot hell you wear them for long same with other rubber substitutes.

from jolly roger february pmquote from fromage february pmwell its all about trust the end there any point multisig addresses yes stop the market from getting robbed because each transaction needs unlocked separately with unique keys. 
suppose you could get the public keys from the seller and server but this effectively would give the buyer and seller the ability close the deal without the server and therefore you could cut out their market fees. 
this bad idea for the server this. 
let just say that there more risk doing multisig than regular escrow and fact less risk because party hacker cannot steal everyones money. 
trusting the market choice you need make your own and you want deal directly with the vendor then outside the market. 
the market going give its customers the ability close deals while cutting out their market fees would not worth for the market. 
have disagree with this guyif the server doesnt give you the opportunity verify the address then its not worth. 
they could give you multi sig that with addresses both controlled the market. 
this opens you obvious scams. 
dont fall for what proposing. 
verify the address and protect yourself from scams. 
also makes sense for the market hide this the buyer seller wanted avoid fees they could set their own escrow. 
also the situation jolly roger describes above the buyer could sign transaction sending all funds vendor and then vendor verifies and also signs the transaction. 
funds released market bypassed. 
the market not protected. 
the market would rely getting income through signing transaction which sends most funds vendor and commision market. 
this would then signed the buyer when happy. 
the buyer starts bypassing the market fee transaction then banned. 
but hide all away from the user and not give them the ability able verify addresses avoid this market set. 
its not healthy. 
would warn anyone away from the setup jolly roger promoting. 
will lead more scams the future and will not allow you verify multi sig setup correctly. 
from ronin february pmi have disagree with this guy the server doesnt give you the opportunity verify the address then its not worth. 
they could give you multi sig that with addresses both controlled the market. 
this opens you obvious scams. 
dont fall for what proposing. 
verify the address and protect yourself from scams. 
first all your accusations about are very offensive. 
accusing that trying get you all fall for something. 
and not think you completely understand the entire process multisignature addresses make the claims you are making. 
how this any more risky than the escrow system that markets had before the markets were controlling the funds and getting robbed and cleaned out several occasions. 
people were placing trust markets before and now suddenly you are worried about getting scammed where were you speaking out with the old escrow system from ronin february also makes sense for the market hide this the buyer seller wanted avoid fees they could set their own escrow. 
also the situation jolly roger describes above the buyer could sign transaction sending all funds vendor and then vendor verifies and also signs the transaction. 
funds released market bypassed. 
the market not protected. 
yes they buyer and seller could set their own escrow outside the market but this would stupid because having makes possible for the market become the arbitrator. 
only one the people involved has scammer and then the funds are locked forever. 
with the buyer tries scam then the market can provide the second key unlock the funds send the seller. 
this why better than. 
also the case the market cannot bypassed without the redeemscript generated the time that the multisignature address created. 
the market holds the redeemscript multisignature address then the buyer and seller cannot complete the transaction the side without the market and therefore cut out the markets fees. 
another security issue with releasing all public keys involved that lets the participants know whether not the seller buyer server are reusing private key and therefore making them more susceptible attacks. 
from ronin february the market would rely getting income through signing transaction which sends most funds vendor and commision market. 
this would then signed the buyer when happy. 
the buyer starts bypassing the market fee transaction then banned. 
but hide all away from the user and not give them the ability able verify addresses avoid this market set. 
its not healthy. 
harder verify you might think see the buyer and seller are closing the deal the side. 
unless the market constantly searching through the blockchain for funds spent from that multisignature address would extremely difficult verify that buyer and seller are bypassing the market cut out their fees. 
from ronin february pmi would warn anyone away from the setup jolly roger promoting. 
will lead more scams the future and will not allow you verify multi sig setup correctly. 
what you are basically saying here that the market should trust the buyers but the buyers should not trust the market. 
the market has every incentive keep the ability unlock funds itself out its own hands that not target for hackers. 
the market has the ability unlock the funds without any buyer seller input would make the market very dangerous and this not desirable and defeats the purpose for the markets. 
but giving out the keys and the redeemscript the buyer and seller gives them the ability close the deal outside the market and bypass fees. 
again you are not able trust your market then yes contact the seller and say you want with your seller outside the market and you can easily set one. 
but with fees average bypassing the fees will become more common than you think and harder detect than you think. 
especially when you are dealing with thousands transactions. 
ronin understand what you are saying and you make valid point that would likely desirable for buyer have this setup. 
but not desireable for market have this setup since the market relies market fees and giving your customers the ability cut you out the deal bad for business. 
there are plenty free and multisignature services out there now that you can use. 
you are not comfortable using the markets system then use another one that gives you the public keys. 
but you expect the markets start giving you the ability bypass their commissions then you will likely never happy. 
not think makes sense for markets this. 
the cost running market high and allowing your buyers not pay their taxes speak dumb move for the market. 
you not trust your market outside the market. 
you make the choice.

are well too trivial mention. 
movement not commerce platform. 
mtgox real business and the owners identities are known this isnt like the deepweb. 
can they really say everyones coins are safe then close their doors and never give them back not mention people put real money into the site. 
can they really get away with that know there laws around running bitcoin exchange.

feb believe the thief uses this wallet. 
was worried that this info could compromise dpr trial bitcoin earned him. 
ive even tried make myself known the wallet owner firing the numbers for using but ross cant moving that money around hes custody. 
when defcon claimed unable find the escrow funds december felt sorry for him found many. 
system wallets could for him marked them from the wallet dec then messaged support let them know where dpr kept the money. 
info address ahynaomxdpd bnnvxusy thursday feb escrow went missing again about time along with those other vendors. 
silk road support had been specifically asked not steal from any the british tor vendors association members. 
was contacted the btva and asked find our missing funds. 
was very easy and easier because already had wallets such.

and some money with him. 
the thief hadnt from the brotherhood british meth chemists none this need have happened. 
incidentally this isnt real listing dont try buy feel free make small payment any those wallets. 
will let the thief thieves know that you know. 
have great week everybody its only bbmc team xsposer can you explain how you identified particular bitcoin wallet from the transactions just curious because though the only way tell addresses belonged single wallet was tracing movements coins aggregated from set addresses. 
from jolly roger february pmquote from fromage february pmwell its all about trust the end there any point multisig addresses yes stop the market from getting robbed because each transaction needs unlocked separately with unique keys. 
suppose you could get the public keys from the seller and server but this effectively would give the buyer and seller the ability close the deal without the server and therefore you could cut out their market fees. 
this bad idea for the server this. 
let just say that there more risk doing multisig than regular escrow and fact less risk because party hacker cannot steal everyones money. 
trusting the market choice you need make your own and you want deal directly with the vendor then outside the market. 
the market going give its customers the ability close deals while cutting out their market fees would not worth for the market. 
have disagree with this guyif the server doesnt give you the opportunity verify the address then its not worth. 
they could give you multi sig that with addresses both controlled the market. 
this opens you obvious scams. 
dont fall for what proposing. 
verify the address and protect yourself from scams. 
also makes sense for the market hide this the buyer seller wanted avoid fees they could set their own escrow. 
also the situation jolly roger describes above the buyer could sign transaction sending all funds vendor and then vendor verifies and also signs the transaction. 
funds released market bypassed. 
the market not protected. 
the market would rely getting income through signing transaction which sends most funds vendor and commision market. 
this would then signed the buyer when happy. 
the buyer starts bypassing the market fee transaction then banned. 
but hide all away from the user and not give them the ability able verify addresses avoid this market set. 
its not healthy. 
would warn anyone away from the setup jolly roger promoting. 
will lead more scams the future and will not allow you verify multi sig setup correctly. 
from ronin february pmi have disagree with this guy the server doesnt give you the opportunity verify the address then its not worth. 
they could give you multi sig that with addresses both controlled the market. 
this opens you obvious scams. 
dont fall for what proposing. 
verify the address and protect yourself from scams. 
first all your accusations about are very offensive. 
accusing that trying get you all fall for something. 
and not think you completely understand the entire process multisignature addresses make the claims you are making. 
how this any more risky than the escrow system that markets had before the markets were controlling the funds and getting robbed and cleaned out several occasions. 
people were placing trust markets before and now suddenly you are worried about getting scammed where were you speaking out with the old escrow system from ronin february also makes sense for the market hide this the buyer seller wanted avoid fees they could set their own escrow. 
also the situation jolly roger describes above the buyer could sign transaction sending all funds vendor and then vendor verifies and also signs the transaction. 
funds released market bypassed. 
the market not protected. 
yes they buyer and seller could set their own escrow outside the market but this would stupid because having makes possible for the market become the arbitrator. 
only one the people involved has scammer and then the funds are locked forever. 
with the buyer tries scam then the market can provide the second key unlock the funds send the seller. 
this why better than. 
also the case the market cannot bypassed without the redeemscript generated the time that the multisignature address created. 
the market holds the redeemscript multisignature address then the buyer and seller cannot complete the transaction the side without the market and therefore cut out the markets fees. 
another security issue with releasing all public keys involved that lets the participants know whether not the seller buyer server are reusing private key and therefore making them more susceptible attacks. 
from ronin february the market would rely getting income through signing transaction which sends most funds vendor and commision market. 
this would then signed the buyer when happy. 
the buyer starts bypassing the market fee transaction then banned. 
but hide all away from the user and not give them the ability able verify addresses avoid this market set. 
its not healthy. 
harder verify you might think see the buyer and seller are closing the deal the side. 
unless the market constantly searching through the blockchain for funds spent from that multisignature address would extremely difficult verify that buyer and seller are bypassing the market cut out their fees. 
from ronin february pmi would warn anyone away from the setup jolly roger promoting. 
will lead more scams the future and will not allow you verify multi sig setup correctly. 
what you are basically saying here that the market should trust the buyers but the buyers should not trust the market. 
the market has every incentive keep the ability unlock funds itself out its own hands that not target for hackers. 
the market has the ability unlock the funds without any buyer seller input would make the market very dangerous and this not desirable and defeats the purpose for the markets. 
but giving out the keys and the redeemscript the buyer and seller gives them the ability close the deal outside the market and bypass fees. 
again you are not able trust your market then yes contact the seller and say you want with your seller outside the market and you can easily set one. 
but with fees average bypassing the fees will become more common than you think and harder detect than you think. 
especially when you are dealing with thousands transactions. 
ronin understand what you are saying and you make valid point that would likely desirable for buyer have this setup. 
but not desireable for market have this setup since the market relies market fees and giving your customers the ability cut you out the deal bad for business. 
there are plenty free and multisignature services out there now that you can use. 
you are not comfortable using the markets system then use another one that gives you the public keys. 
but you expect the markets start giving you the ability bypass their commissions then you will likely never happy. 
not think makes sense for markets this. 
the cost running market high and allowing your buyers not pay their taxes speak dumb move for the market. 
you not trust your market outside the market. 
you make the choice.

from whom february. 
there are three huge problems with vps hosting for hidden services. 
when someone exploits the vps provider console management interface they have root your vps instance this one happens fairly often. 
someone exploits bug solusvm another vps provider management console and gets control over every vps box their environment. 
better solution rented dedicated server running xen another hypervisor and using the hypervisor isolate the server actually providing the http other service from the tor instance that advertises the. 
onion address servervm private virtual network torvm internet that scenario when someone pwns the servervm they cant deanonymize sending arbitrary traffic out. 
theyre stuck behind the torvm and can only send traffic via tor. 
deanonymize the servervm effectively they need exploit the hypervisor first. 
that architecture the torvm should only allowed send out the tor traffic. 
the hypervisor probably shouldnt even really public network except bridge traffic the torvm and damned sure shouldnt accept arbitrary traffic from the internet itself. 
please elaborate the hypervisor use case possible references detailed example documentation most appreciated. 
safe assume the torvm comprised barebones installation with iptables dropping everything but tor traffic. 
thought mastered pgp but not sure. 
basically put their key gpa sign keys set owner trust send keys. 
clipboard write address encrypt. 
then put key and and the encrypted message into the address box. 
but occasionally get messages from vendors saying you gave the key mistake even though put the key and then the encrypted message underneath. 
not supposed this. 
youself favor mate get gpg usb much easier and better than gpa kleopatra. 
you are sending someone message encrypted with their public key the usual and proper way give the recipient your own public key paste your public key your message the end before you encrypt like axa begin pgp public key block version gnupg.

router that routes all communication through the vpn channel and separates this machines segment from all other internal communication. 
would this some kind safe solution because still needs connect the vpn from your home connection. 
the address the vpn hosting the hidden service ever discovered would not hard trace you. 
this exact thing happened dpr but did not host from home. 
even connected from computer cafe.

not entirely sure about the structure the pgp key but can tell you that put both those keys into text document and try import both them only one key will inputted into keyring not two. 
meaning that those two keys are related the same private key. 
again not sure why the last bytes changed but you are worried about take old message sent you that worked with your old key and try and decrypt. 
works there nothing wrong with your key. 
think nightcrawler the expert this though. 
from whom february. 
there are three huge problems with vps hosting for hidden services. 
when someone exploits the vps provider console management interface they have root your vps instance this one happens fairly often. 
someone exploits bug solusvm another vps provider management console and gets control over every vps box their environment. 
better solution rented dedicated server running xen another hypervisor and using the hypervisor isolate the server actually providing the http other service from the tor instance that advertises the. 
onion address servervm private virtual network torvm internet that scenario when someone pwns the servervm they cant deanonymize sending arbitrary traffic out. 
theyre stuck behind the torvm and can only send traffic via tor. 
deanonymize the servervm effectively they need exploit the hypervisor first. 
that architecture the torvm should only allowed send out the tor traffic. 
the hypervisor probably shouldnt even really public network except bridge traffic the torvm and damned sure shouldnt accept arbitrary traffic from the internet itself. 
please elaborate the hypervisor use case possible references detailed example documentation most appreciated. 
safe assume the torvm comprised barebones installation with iptables dropping everything but tor traffic. 
thanks for the attention given doubt you take off head will try contact nightcrawler.

from xsposer february amhere the original post looks like defcon started this scam december slowly moving btc his wallet several times day. 
read below for the details. 
onion items here the stolen silk walletop. 
appears had arrangement with group vendors not steal from them but anyone else was free game copy pasted bbmc full member the british tor vendors association btva ever get the feeling youve been swindled. 
info address grfntylwoyqnk mffaz qpkdwp ysoytheyve been moving our bitcoins out the sites fac wallet since the end january. 
btcmore interesting all the ive been finding associated with silk road from this wallet. 
info address nxd wzeysjucbtm nps skheach payment marks massive cashpile there are them. 
the wallet has been busy again today. 
feb believe the thief uses this wallet. 
was worried that this info could compromise dpr trial bitcoin earned him. 
ive even tried make myself known the wallet owner firing the numbers for using but ross cant moving that money around hes custody. 
when defcon claimed unable find the escrow funds december felt sorry for him found many. 
system wallets could for him marked them from the wallet dec then messaged support let them know where dpr kept the money. 
info address ahynaomxdpd bnnvxusy thursday feb escrow went missing again about time along with those other vendors. 
silk road support had been specifically asked not steal from any the british tor vendors association members. 
was contacted the btva and asked find our missing funds. 
was very easy and easier because already had wallets such. 
info address facb qnikfpuoo wvfnyai hcov tmarked dec and decthe irony that thief was using small bitcoin payments mark his own swag piles wasnt lost. 
the ing wallet now has itjust and add few those hundreds fat wallets all filled then marked with wallet. 
info address nxd wzeysjucbtm nps skhin close succession. 
havent added all but looks around half billion dollars move and marked february. 
most that must unspent historical silk road and earnings. 
whoever owns the android phone with bitcoin wallet nxd the thief believe. 
and some money with him. 
the thief hadnt from the brotherhood british meth chemists none this need have happened. 
incidentally this isnt real listing dont try buy feel free make small payment any those wallets. 
will let the thief thieves know that you know. 
have great week everybody its only bbmc team xsposer can you explain how you identified particular bitcoin wallet from the transactions just curious because though the only way tell addresses belonged single wallet was tracing movements coins aggregated from set addresses. 
from jolly roger february pmquote from fromage february pmwell its all about trust the end there any point multisig addresses yes stop the market from getting robbed because each transaction needs unlocked separately with unique keys. 
suppose you could get the public keys from the seller and server but this effectively would give the buyer and seller the ability close the deal without the server and therefore you could cut out their market fees. 
this bad idea for the server this. 
let just say that there more risk doing multisig than regular escrow and fact less risk because party hacker cannot steal everyones money. 
trusting the market choice you need make your own and you want deal directly with the vendor then outside the market. 
the market going give its customers the ability close deals while cutting out their market fees would not worth for the market. 
have disagree with this guyif the server doesnt give you the opportunity verify the address then its not worth. 
they could give you multi sig that with addresses both controlled the market. 
this opens you obvious scams. 
dont fall for what proposing. 
verify the address and protect yourself from scams. 
also makes sense for the market hide this the buyer seller wanted avoid fees they could set their own escrow. 
also the situation jolly roger describes above the buyer could sign transaction sending all funds vendor and then vendor verifies and also signs the transaction. 
funds released market bypassed. 
the market not protected. 
the market would rely getting income through signing transaction which sends most funds vendor and commision market. 
this would then signed the buyer when happy. 
the buyer starts bypassing the market fee transaction then banned. 
but hide all away from the user and not give them the ability able verify addresses avoid this market set. 
its not healthy. 
would warn anyone away from the setup jolly roger promoting. 
will lead more scams the future and will not allow you verify multi sig setup correctly. 
from ronin february pmi have disagree with this guy the server doesnt give you the opportunity verify the address then its not worth. 
they could give you multi sig that with addresses both controlled the market. 
this opens you obvious scams. 
dont fall for what proposing. 
verify the address and protect yourself from scams. 
first all your accusations about are very offensive. 
accusing that trying get you all fall for something. 
and not think you completely understand the entire process multisignature addresses make the claims you are making. 
how this any more risky than the escrow system that markets had before the markets were controlling the funds and getting robbed and cleaned out several occasions. 
people were placing trust markets before and now suddenly you are worried about getting scammed where were you speaking out with the old escrow system from ronin february also makes sense for the market hide this the buyer seller wanted avoid fees they could set their own escrow. 
also the situation jolly roger describes above the buyer could sign transaction sending all funds vendor and then vendor verifies and also signs the transaction. 
funds released market bypassed. 
the market not protected. 
yes they buyer and seller could set their own escrow outside the market but this would stupid because having makes possible for the market become the arbitrator. 
only one the people involved has scammer and then the funds are locked forever. 
with the buyer tries scam then the market can provide the second key unlock the funds send the seller. 
this why better than. 
also the case the market cannot bypassed without the redeemscript generated the time that the multisignature address created. 
the market holds the redeemscript multisignature address then the buyer and seller cannot complete the transaction the side without the market and therefore cut out the markets fees. 
another security issue with releasing all public keys involved that lets the participants know whether not the seller buyer server are reusing private key and therefore making them more susceptible attacks. 
from ronin february the market would rely getting income through signing transaction which sends most funds vendor and commision market. 
this would then signed the buyer when happy. 
the buyer starts bypassing the market fee transaction then banned. 
but hide all away from the user and not give them the ability able verify addresses avoid this market set. 
its not healthy. 
harder verify you might think see the buyer and seller are closing the deal the side. 
unless the market constantly searching through the blockchain for funds spent from that multisignature address would extremely difficult verify that buyer and seller are bypassing the market cut out their fees. 
from ronin february pmi would warn anyone away from the setup jolly roger promoting. 
will lead more scams the future and will not allow you verify multi sig setup correctly. 
what you are basically saying here that the market should trust the buyers but the buyers should not trust the market. 
the market has every incentive keep the ability unlock funds itself out its own hands that not target for hackers. 
the market has the ability unlock the funds without any buyer seller input would make the market very dangerous and this not desirable and defeats the purpose for the markets. 
but giving out the keys and the redeemscript the buyer and seller gives them the ability close the deal outside the market and bypass fees. 
again you are not able trust your market then yes contact the seller and say you want with your seller outside the market and you can easily set one. 
but with fees average bypassing the fees will become more common than you think and harder detect than you think. 
especially when you are dealing with thousands transactions. 
ronin understand what you are saying and you make valid point that would likely desirable for buyer have this setup. 
but not desireable for market have this setup since the market relies market fees and giving your customers the ability cut you out the deal bad for business. 
there are plenty free and multisignature services out there now that you can use. 
you are not comfortable using the markets system then use another one that gives you the public keys. 
but you expect the markets start giving you the ability bypass their commissions then you will likely never happy. 
not think makes sense for markets this. 
the cost running market high and allowing your buyers not pay their taxes speak dumb move for the market. 
you not trust your market outside the market. 
you make the choice.

its seriously screwing the market across the board and its making bitcoins look shady fuck general and since the guy like one the founding fathers some bull shit organzation can just pull everyone along for the ride like has done but think its finally over.

from xsposer february amhere the original post looks like defcon started this scam december slowly moving btc his wallet several times day. 
read below for the details. 
onion items here the stolen silk walletop. 
appears had arrangement with group vendors not steal from them but anyone else was free game copy pasted bbmc full member the british tor vendors association btva ever get the feeling youve been swindled. 
info address grfntylwoyqnk mffaz qpkdwp ysoytheyve been moving our bitcoins out the sites fac wallet since the end january. 
btcmore interesting all the ive been finding associated with silk road from this wallet. 
info address nxd wzeysjucbtm nps skheach payment marks massive cashpile there are them. 
the wallet has been busy again today. 
feb believe the thief uses this wallet. 
was worried that this info could compromise dpr trial bitcoin earned him. 
ive even tried make myself known the wallet owner firing the numbers for using but ross cant moving that money around hes custody. 
when defcon claimed unable find the escrow funds december felt sorry for him found many. 
system wallets could for him marked them from the wallet dec then messaged support let them know where dpr kept the money. 
info address ahynaomxdpd bnnvxusy thursday feb escrow went missing again about time along with those other vendors. 
silk road support had been specifically asked not steal from any the british tor vendors association members. 
was contacted the btva and asked find our missing funds. 
was very easy and easier because already had wallets such. 
info address facb qnikfpuoo wvfnyai hcov tmarked dec and decthe irony that thief was using small bitcoin payments mark his own swag piles wasnt lost. 
the ing wallet now has itjust and add few those hundreds fat wallets all filled then marked with wallet. 
info address nxd wzeysjucbtm nps skhin close succession. 
havent added all but looks around half billion dollars move and marked february. 
most that must unspent historical silk road and earnings. 
whoever owns the android phone with bitcoin wallet nxd the thief believe. 
and some money with him. 
the thief hadnt from the brotherhood british meth chemists none this need have happened. 
incidentally this isnt real listing dont try buy feel free make small payment any those wallets. 
will let the thief thieves know that you know. 
have great week everybody its only bbmc team xsposer can you explain how you identified particular bitcoin wallet from the transactions just curious because though the only way tell addresses belonged single wallet was tracing movements coins aggregated from set addresses. 
from jolly roger february pmquote from fromage february pmwell its all about trust the end there any point multisig addresses yes stop the market from getting robbed because each transaction needs unlocked separately with unique keys. 
suppose you could get the public keys from the seller and server but this effectively would give the buyer and seller the ability close the deal without the server and therefore you could cut out their market fees. 
this bad idea for the server this. 
let just say that there more risk doing multisig than regular escrow and fact less risk because party hacker cannot steal everyones money. 
trusting the market choice you need make your own and you want deal directly with the vendor then outside the market. 
the market going give its customers the ability close deals while cutting out their market fees would not worth for the market. 
have disagree with this guyif the server doesnt give you the opportunity verify the address then its not worth. 
they could give you multi sig that with addresses both controlled the market. 
this opens you obvious scams. 
dont fall for what proposing. 
verify the address and protect yourself from scams. 
also makes sense for the market hide this the buyer seller wanted avoid fees they could set their own escrow. 
also the situation jolly roger describes above the buyer could sign transaction sending all funds vendor and then vendor verifies and also signs the transaction. 
funds released market bypassed. 
the market not protected. 
the market would rely getting income through signing transaction which sends most funds vendor and commision market. 
this would then signed the buyer when happy. 
the buyer starts bypassing the market fee transaction then banned. 
but hide all away from the user and not give them the ability able verify addresses avoid this market set. 
its not healthy. 
would warn anyone away from the setup jolly roger promoting. 
will lead more scams the future and will not allow you verify multi sig setup correctly. 
from ronin february pmi have disagree with this guy the server doesnt give you the opportunity verify the address then its not worth. 
they could give you multi sig that with addresses both controlled the market. 
this opens you obvious scams. 
dont fall for what proposing. 
verify the address and protect yourself from scams. 
first all your accusations about are very offensive. 
accusing that trying get you all fall for something. 
and not think you completely understand the entire process multisignature addresses make the claims you are making. 
how this any more risky than the escrow system that markets had before the markets were controlling the funds and getting robbed and cleaned out several occasions. 
people were placing trust markets before and now suddenly you are worried about getting scammed where were you speaking out with the old escrow system from ronin february also makes sense for the market hide this the buyer seller wanted avoid fees they could set their own escrow. 
also the situation jolly roger describes above the buyer could sign transaction sending all funds vendor and then vendor verifies and also signs the transaction. 
funds released market bypassed. 
the market not protected. 
yes they buyer and seller could set their own escrow outside the market but this would stupid because having makes possible for the market become the arbitrator. 
only one the people involved has scammer and then the funds are locked forever. 
with the buyer tries scam then the market can provide the second key unlock the funds send the seller. 
this why better than. 
also the case the market cannot bypassed without the redeemscript generated the time that the multisignature address created. 
the market holds the redeemscript multisignature address then the buyer and seller cannot complete the transaction the side without the market and therefore cut out the markets fees. 
another security issue with releasing all public keys involved that lets the participants know whether not the seller buyer server are reusing private key and therefore making them more susceptible attacks. 
from ronin february the market would rely getting income through signing transaction which sends most funds vendor and commision market. 
this would then signed the buyer when happy. 
the buyer starts bypassing the market fee transaction then banned. 
but hide all away from the user and not give them the ability able verify addresses avoid this market set. 
its not healthy. 
harder verify you might think see the buyer and seller are closing the deal the side. 
unless the market constantly searching through the blockchain for funds spent from that multisignature address would extremely difficult verify that buyer and seller are bypassing the market cut out their fees. 
from ronin february pmi would warn anyone away from the setup jolly roger promoting. 
will lead more scams the future and will not allow you verify multi sig setup correctly. 
what you are basically saying here that the market should trust the buyers but the buyers should not trust the market. 
the market has every incentive keep the ability unlock funds itself out its own hands that not target for hackers. 
the market has the ability unlock the funds without any buyer seller input would make the market very dangerous and this not desirable and defeats the purpose for the markets. 
but giving out the keys and the redeemscript the buyer and seller gives them the ability close the deal outside the market and bypass fees. 
again you are not able trust your market then yes contact the seller and say you want with your seller outside the market and you can easily set one. 
but with fees average bypassing the fees will become more common than you think and harder detect than you think. 
especially when you are dealing with thousands transactions. 
ronin understand what you are saying and you make valid point that would likely desirable for buyer have this setup. 
but not desireable for market have this setup since the market relies market fees and giving your customers the ability cut you out the deal bad for business. 
there are plenty free and multisignature services out there now that you can use. 
you are not comfortable using the markets system then use another one that gives you the public keys. 
but you expect the markets start giving you the ability bypass their commissions then you will likely never happy. 
not think makes sense for markets this. 
the cost running market high and allowing your buyers not pay their taxes speak dumb move for the market. 
you not trust your market outside the market. 
you make the choice.

from mirage february pmjust never forget what more important external usb dvd drive your freedom and even perhaps day your space time. 
peacemirageoki you have point. 
guess ill invest one. 
but one question. 
cant use usb key instead dvd should right. 
from mirage february pmquote from raztafarii february pmwell ive pretty much given this point. 
its really advanced stuff and tech knowledge and skills sort dont that far. 
mirage ive only been able download the required files. 
iso file and another one and the tailssigning. 
key one used verify the.

dont know what this stage and this like the first freaking step. 
also apparently you need refit whatever which dont have. 
also buying anything this point isnt rly ideal dunno. 
just might look into. 
maybe ill try upgrade more recent osx have snow leopard. 
but ill help when wake unless someone else does first. 
wasnt trying macbook was trying imac with optical drive but was trying boot tails from usb not. 
the proccess fairly complicated. 
there are few methods but the only one got work was installing via command line. 
there are directions the site that explain how this and you can simply copy paste the commands and replace the with the. 
iso compy pasting the command line when asks for its directory. 
for simply would not install this way and was because was missing command that was not the instructions. 
something retarded like dev the end certain command. 
after about hours trying figured this out and got successfully install. 
next you need bootloader because mac has efi loader instead. 
for this they say you need refind which older version refit. 
could not get install because already had refit there with hopes remove. 
when turned computer the usb drive shows but only boots blank screen and goes where. 
after few more hours tinkinering gave.

never give and you shouldnt even worrying about terminal for now. 
for starters just try burn the. 
iso dvd using disk utility mentioned above. 
then you can worry about verifing and signatures and what not later. 
first things first. 
and you might not even have use reefit just hold down the option key when booting see your list connected drives give try works for only use. 
for legal stuff for number reasons. 
the least which its the last version you dont have download and can have original dvd installation disk. 
well you read the small print the licensing agreement apple didnt join the nsas prizm program until after steve jobs died. 
just went down like that. 
and there are many other good reasons run. 
and nothing after. 
and even better reasons run linux tails ect. 
dont give just yet are all here help try what mentioned above and just lemmie know peacemirageoki thanks for the encouragement wont give yet would get the burning onto the dvd but drive all jacked put itll never coma back out unless manage pull out. 
will usb work really want avoid buying anything extra this point runnin low cash like external drive something. 
from cooked february pmnow lets look some more practical thingsprivnote isnt stored your computerwhat the fuck normal non criminal person doing with pgp their computer being private why you think there are huge network keyservers sks keyservers. 
net its powerful tool verify identity and secure. 
pgp has been around since. 
there nothing fundementally suspicious about using pgp. 
org projects torbrowser design. 
net code issues basically tails want look exactly the same tbb web server. 
noscript enabled default tbb tails will change theirs reflect the new design. 
course you could actually build your own tails with javascript turned off. 
there are instructions how roll your own tails the website. 
here the commit tree you can how was sup before you got. 
tails leaves javascript enabled default because they want match the tbb fingerprint closely possible. 
get the tbb fix and tails will change without hesitation. 
you have make sure that noscript allowing both blockchain. 
info and sharedcoin. 
comalso have noticed you have address that has mupltiple inputs sharedcoin doesnt like them all and tends fail. 
its easier sweep them all into one address and send. 
any you guys want start bitcoin exchange with can all split half billion dollars. 
buy all the bitcoins existance advertise everywhere that bitcoins are the best thing since sliced bread sell the bitcoinsi say pump you say dumppump. 
anyone used bizniz from any info discussion would appreciated thanks.

until gox comes back online nothing can done. 
legal tax paying business surely there aduty care and reimbursement here. 
mean whether btc are seen legit not they were providing service and they have failed that right. 
from blackstar february amyea man sorry. 
hopefully there some legal recouse that can implemented lean them pay coins back. 
not sure they all got stolen what. 
wouldnt suprise the feds didnt have ahand. 
seems like more and more coins are going missing into wallets that are sitting still. 
know how bad the feds want btc gone. 
who knows though. 
genuinely sorry for all involved gox. 
read somewhere where btc had been stolen from mtgox and they never told anyone. 
dont think its any excuse for its dark net site security the biggest issue. 
course for mtgox but fucking hell you dont expect darknet market vulnerable thats the whole point doing illegal activity online security.

and some money with him. 
the thief hadnt from the brotherhood british meth chemists none this need have happened update edit feb was inside job but not the current staff. 
the same goes for gox. 
believe programmer who coded the gox wallets the wallets and also set thegaming sites which have been spamming the bitcoin network with micropayments. 
hacked our investigators facebook order message him feb which was investigating before being contracted using the name phibbo bit. 
this the message some background mtgox runs custom wallet software. 
this reasonable and common practice for service its size and nature. 
getting wallet implementing right isn easy there very little room for error much like the rest the bitcoin system. 
some have criticized their use custom software here but reasonable and common practice for service its size and nature. 
the reference client wallet basically suitable for small scale single party use. 
would not recommend something like mtgox use the reference node wallet least not without healthy layer abstraction top relieving duties harder than key management and chain monitoring otherwise improving greatly. 
for that matter mtgox wallet software has caused them fewer concerning problems than some other companies. 
some have completely implemented the bitcoin protocol incorrectly and exposed the outside world and suffered numerous local blockchain rejecting glitches. 
though its certainly taken gox fair amount time sort things out. 
first heard people reporting stuck transactions back september. 
looked into and determined that mtgox was spending immature coins. 
freshly generated bitcoins from mining can not spend until they are least blocks deep the blockchain. 
this prevents the funds from vanishing forever the chain reorgs. 
pinged magicaltux and after couple tries got hold him. 
think they also wasted some time dead ends trying resolve this before the actual nature the problem was brought their attention. 
raising their transaction fees with mistaken belief that their fees weren high enough. 
mtgox wasn tracking the coins were freshly generated what their height was their software. 
including this data would apparently non trivial change and for high risk finance software even trivial change takes lot work. 
suggested workaround basically just try spend the oldest coins and far know they implemented and was effective. 
they continued have problems with stuck transactions after and further analysis revealed that they were producing transactions with excessively padded signatures. 
minor tangent required here there design flaw the bitcoin protocol where its possible for third party take valid transaction yours and mutate way which leaves valid and functionally identical but with different transaction. 
this greatly complicates writing correct wallet software and can used abusively invalidate long chains unconfirmed transactions that depend the non mutant transaction since transactions refer each other txid. 
this issue arises from several sources one them being openssl willingness accept and make sense signatures with invalid encodings. 
normal ecdsa signature encodes two large integers the encoding isn constant length there are leading zeros you are supposed drop them. 
easy write software that assumes the signature will constant length and then leave extra leading zeros them. 
order eventually remove this malleability flaw been gradually tightening the rules that govern what transactions nodes the network will consider valid when they relay them mine them. 
after months work chasing down software authors get them fix their bugs transactions with these invalid encodings were longer relayed. 
this caused some problems for few things. 
itself had been fixed long before but they couldn update the iphone app without fear triggering another review apple. 
eventually this was just worked around the server side mutating the transactions produced the iphone wallets. 
and moot now guess. 
mtgox also had problems with occasionally producing invalid signatures. 
this would normally simple fix. 
here example where fixed this type issue some python wallet code never used but saw lot people were copying. 
com but said before high value systems like mtgox even simple fixes aren simple and took them quite some time deploy fix. 
however believe that actually fixed now. 
current understanding and inference that the remaining issues are because while mtgox was producing transactions the bad form that the network won relay anymore some people decided help out fixing these transactions like. 
did for iphone users making the signatures normal and broadcasting them. 
course the new transactions while functionally identical have different txids. 
the difference here that the mtgox wallet software appears have not handled this case gracefully all and apparently simply wouldn notice transactions that didn make spending its own coins. 
result the mtgox wallet believed some coins were available for spending which really had already been spent and began double spending those inputs. 
this may have interacted particularly poorly with the earlier workaround mentioned trying always use the oldest available coins they did implement that workaround. 
worse some this may have resulted users getting paid multiple times and could have been intentionally triggered with that end mind someone helpfully fixed some transactions and then noticed they got paid twice. 
think this unlikely have caused large losses before people run off worrying about that both because the reuse the oldest inputs and because the hot wallet cold wallet split. 
this point they likely have accounting mess clean figuring out who did and didn get paid now with none the txids matching. 
cleaning that will somewhat tricky. 
say there were three payments mtgox coins apple the block chain and three users that attempted pay apple and mtgox records thinks that only one went through. 
software will have written that matches transactions with their mutants order figure out what went where. 
not personally concerned least not any the details here. 
mtgox slow speed resolving these sorts issues and poor communications are not terribly inspiring. 
they seem horribly short staffed but competent and trustworthy people this space may hard find the regulatory morass that business sure make many steer clear. 
the claims that the delays indicate insolvency strike just hysteria the technical background doesn support this conclusion and there may bit opportunism play from people who want manipulate the market too. 
don get wrong have not seen their books gox may well have financial problems though with their income its hard for see how but any problems like that exist they not being indicated here. 
course none this suggests anyone should happy with the service mtgox has been providing but our anger should least well informed. 
february that wasn the time from copy saved another recipient still think defcon full shit with his will prevail our community shit. 
but don think the boy dunnit. 
redbookthe bbmc team there you have. 
take from what you will. 
but still wont going anywhere near. 
update having closely studied what posted above have come the conclusion that gasp oracle form the forum was probably correct his theory dox last week. 
not that support but his dox pritel internet name mods not delete was pretty accurate. 
the dox included everything that the above post says about the mtgox theft and other btc hacks. 
turns out this guy pritel was bragging about how helped code these sites and had found the btc protocol. 
says that hit bitstamp and gox with ddos flooded them with mutated transactions and made fortune. 
all sounded well oracle the time but now this bbmc update has come light actually believe this guy pritel person deep interest. 
have full uncensored copy pritel dox and will post redacted version below you can all see the relation and importance. 
but names address will included mods dont freak out. 
this now looks pretty conclusive. 
but only time will tell. 
also not stir shit but explanation above still doesnt put defcon the clear. 
defcon hired pritel after reccomendation from non other than stexo. 
possible that they could all sharing the profits behind the scenes. 
hence the repeated call for narco who probably doesnt exist and likely dropshpper from spain france. 
redacted dox pritel will posted soon.

dont use tails just the tor browser bundle. 
here expereince with shared send blockchain. 
info since was modified use sharedcoin. 
com several weeks ago. 
can very slow. 
the little popup that happens when you start transaction can take long time complete. 
sometimes will not complete. 
when the transaction initiated will take longer confirm than standard transaction. 
sometimes couple hours. 
sometimes full day. 
rather than shared send vendor now have separate wallet blockchain. 
info that shared send. 
keep some btc there that when want use can transfer directly from there vendor. 
that way not concerned with the reliability time for shared send. 
has anyone been having problems with their tails freezing while they try shared coin send there way can avoid this the future.

thanks for coming. 
know youre bit. 
shaken and stressed. 
are you doing okay more less its and tomorrow morning first time have lawyer appointment things couldnt better well not tomorrow but today now yeah youre the future over there japan lol. 
guys are even more the future yeah two places ive wanted visit but cringe the flight time alone. 
just wanted talk you here pressure you dont have answer anything you dont want. 
weve chatted before briefly. 
you know lil something. 
yep and with all what happened yesterday even though knew all that didnt let contacts fox business publish because didnt want see bitcoin gox going flames could salvaged. 
obviously holding that info back and not publishing tumblr leaking docs first allowed someone else stake claim first. 
but you win some you lose some. 
and honestly not fan people posting things that are rumors bullshit not verified just because damages the shit out someone company. 
and really cannot taken back afterwards. 
that crisis strategy draft even legit more less the name suggests its draft and its bunch proposals deal with the issue hand not things that are actually planned and done this said this document was not produced mtgox saw some strategies there that had shared with you but also saw some things there that would have never suggested anyone ever through with would make you look horrible. 
think lot people ignored the draft part. 
was just really surprising see that being leaked. 
you think was leaked someone purposely hurt you personally gox general you think was leaked someone purposely hurt you personally gox general have some doubts heh bet. 
are you stepping down ceo and away from gox too you cant legally disclose then just say cant disclose that yety yet. 
the reason asking because after yesterdays events you removing yourself from the foundation and deleting the twitter account posts and all. 
right away speculation within the bitcoin arena went into hyper chaotic mode and the word the street was that you were closing shop and running away with all their monies and bitcoin. 
how does that make you feel hear see people you bailed out yourself and stood for over the years turn you like that not good mark know youre not one for expressing yourself but heres your chance because you really have stepped before and done things one else ever had. 
probably will again. 
and seems like all has been quickly forgotten and instead youre being labeled the madoff bitcoin. 
were having this chat and youre still japan your apt office and not cave somewhere right look mark you took mtgox and ran with built stuck with and took level one ever thought possible. 
when other exchanges were crippled you stepped and bailed them out absorbed them save the bitcoin market general. 
exchange brought you massive surge customers and press that made you look like the hero the day and then some. 
but what most people forget too was that you werent set handle this from the start. 
were having this chat and youre still japan your apt office and not cave somewhere right home with cat being pain sleeping the keyboard yeah doesnt sound like someone the run with bags money. 
whats the plan now for you and mtgox cant comment that yet alright. 
mostly because doing could compromise our current efforts imgur the simple image sharer cat pushing keyboard pushing the keyboard back the desk you guys are still actively trying save though havent given you could have given and walked away bunch times previously but you always stuck out. 
even though others have closed and walked away why have you continued fight and work and not give giving not part how usually things you want tell your side this bit more like what youve sacrificed given personally have imagine its taken quite toll you. 
well first would guess health what you mean took more than since handling mtgox compensating for stress eating guessing stress from lack sleep too like now. 
heh and drinking liters coca cola how american almost american actually since some people see coca cola being non american lol anyway should try get some sleep already waking hours err one more thing. 
and starting tired pushing keyboard stays the desk you still believe the viability unregulated digital currency like bitcoin tho difficult tbqh the pressure got from banks and governments makes things very hard you think were regulated would make easier work things out partially how well first avoid being blocked banks and governments around the world regulated means that long you follow the regulations youre fine the biggest question people really have asked though are you personally vested mtgox with your own btc and whether not you like everyone else have taken personal hit and are the same boat they are terms taking loss hit from the recent events and whether not you like everyone else have taken personal hit and are the same boat they are terms taking loss hit from the recent events any btc own personally were mtgox how much did you lose yourself well technically speaking its not lost just yet just temporarily unavailable magicaltux magicaltu mtgox staff magicaltux realname mark karpeles channels channelname server calvino. 
net milan account magicaltux end whois well how much unavail for you not even sure guys reddit and wickedfire are running around posting screenshots horror stories about how much bitcoin they have lost from this. 
didnt check wallet before pushing the site offline anyway maybe should sleep now anything else youd like say everyone before all the pissed off people start going nuts even more. 
not really maybe just link something like that why fall gag well well see how this one goes anyway well like chat more but know youre pushing sleep. 
and long you are saying youre not disappearing from this. 
still think you should say something more all these people least reveal how much youve taken hit for personally. 
would show them that you are still their side. 
the way that whole removal from the foundation did you decide leave that before after the chats with them help save gox versus let fail. 
made the cryptocurrency sub its own sub opposed child board now feel free move this over there you want.

what you guys think. 
had this argument the bmr forums and was derailed death but think its common senseprivnote safer then pgp and here whyok you place order market for drugs and give your address with privnoteseller ships your order then gets raidedgives his private key passwords etc ordered judge and you used pgp your address would viewablenow lets look some more practical thingsprivnote isnt stored your computerwhat the fuck normal non criminal person doing with pgp their computer privnotes are made day. 
even one has your whatever shit its impossible say was used for anything illegal and its also impossible tie back agora etc because the message deletedpgp however can tied back and all messages can read you are ordered give who dont like privnote only dont like because the. 
chance that messages arent actually deleted and are recoverable the fbito date there has been nothing suggest this and arrests have been made because recovered privnote messages the publics knowledgeand obviously privnote has nothing with safely encrypted sensitive files records etcbut think privnote should always used when making purchase here for contraband.

sure buyer vendor would prioritize verifying that the funds transactions over verifying support.

its important help each other the community. 
growing safe and secure community mutually beneficial for everyone regardless immediate financial gain.

and there have. 
solution that doesnt centralise all power with the market. 
from jolly roger february pmquote from ronin february pmi have disagree with this guy the server doesnt give you the opportunity verify the address then its not worth. 
they could give you multi sig that with addresses both controlled the market. 
this opens you obvious scams. 
dont fall for what proposing. 
verify the address and protect yourself from scams. 
first all your accusations about are very offensive. 
accusing that trying get you all fall for something. 
and not think you completely understand the entire process multisignature addresses make the claims you are making. 
how this any more risky than the escrow system that markets had before the markets were controlling the funds and getting robbed and cleaned out several occasions. 
people were placing trust markets before and now suddenly you are worried about getting scammed where were you speaking out with the old escrow system sorry that you feel offended but dont think have said anything below the belt. 
you are proposing multi sig escrow solution which doesnt protect the buyer from rogue markets incompetent developers. 
kind poinltess opionion. 
regarding risk compared previous its the same market could rogue loose all its coins due incompetent devs. 
whats your point you are proposing solution that still exposes users the same problems. 
and its not sudden worry. 
have raised the issue mutli sig way before the debacle. 
take the time through postings this forum and others and you will see have been long term proponent multi sig. 
way beforfe became fashinable. 
from jolly roger february pmquote from ronin february also makes sense for the market hide this the buyer seller wanted avoid fees they could set their own escrow. 
also the situation jolly roger describes above the buyer could sign transaction sending all funds vendor and then vendor verifies and also signs the transaction. 
funds released market bypassed. 
the market not protected. 
yes they buyer and seller could set their own escrow outside the market but this would stupid because having makes possible for the market become the arbitrator. 
only one the people involved has scammer and then the funds are locked forever. 
with the buyer tries scam then the market can provide the second key unlock the funds send the seller. 
this why better than. 
also the case the market cannot bypassed without the redeemscript generated the time that the multisignature address created. 
the market holds the redeemscript multisignature address then the buyer and seller cannot complete the transaction the side without the market and therefore cut out the markets fees. 
another security issue with releasing all public keys involved that lets the participants know whether not the seller buyer server are reusing private key and therefore making them more susceptible attacks. 
doesnt benefit the scammer financially pull scam. 
which removes most the motive. 
agree better but not the market doesnt allow the buyer vendor confirm the address you are proposing. 
wouldnt touch market that insists hiding the details the address from you. 
its too open abuse incompetence. 
agreed the redeem script. 
but the market cant really withold the script someone can generate themselves from the original inputs. 
dont think its security issue the buyer vendor can see the market reusing the same keys. 
this would excellent way people being able ascertain the market coded incompetent. 
from jolly roger february pmquote from ronin february the market would rely getting income through signing transaction which sends most funds vendor and commision market. 
this would then signed the buyer when happy. 
the buyer starts bypassing the market fee transaction then banned. 
but hide all away from the user and not give them the ability able verify addresses avoid this market set. 
its not healthy. 
harder verify you might think see the buyer and seller are closing the deal the side. 
unless the market constantly searching through the blockchain for funds spent from that multisignature address would extremely difficult verify that buyer and seller are bypassing the market cut out their fees. 
dont see the issue here. 
what difficult about this exactly anyone running the bitcond client always getting every transaction. 
the databse holding transactions could checked for transactions once week that are older than one month. 
any such transaction which has the funds removed from the address would flagged having done deal outside the market. 
could probably write bash script this fairly quickly. 
missing something here what the difficulty from jolly roger february pmquote from ronin february pmi would warn anyone away from the setup jolly roger promoting. 
will lead more scams the future and will not allow you verify multi sig setup correctly. 
what you are basically saying here that the market should trust the buyers but the buyers should not trust the market. 
the market has every incentive keep the ability unlock funds itself out its own hands that not target for hackers. 
the market has the ability unlock the funds without any buyer seller input would make the market very dangerous and this not desirable and defeats the purpose for the markets. 
but giving out the keys and the redeemscript the buyer and seller gives them the ability close the deal outside the market and bypass fees. 
again you are not able trust your market then yes contact the seller and say you want with your seller outside the market and you can easily set one. 
but with fees average bypassing the fees will become more common than you think and harder detect than you think. 
especially when you are dealing with thousands transactions. 
ronin understand what you are saying and you make valid point that would likely desirable for buyer have this setup. 
but not desireable for market have this setup since the market relies market fees and giving your customers the ability cut you out the deal bad for business. 
there are plenty free and multisignature services out there now that you can use. 
you are not comfortable using the markets system then use another one that gives you the public keys. 
but you expect the markets start giving you the ability bypass their commissions then you will likely never happy. 
not think makes sense for markets this. 
the cost running market high and allowing your buyers not pay their taxes speak dumb move for the market. 
you not trust your market outside the market. 
you make the choice. 
think has already been shown that markets suffer from fraudulent owners incompetent developers. 
not saying markets shouldnt charge fee. 
but also not proposing solution that offers benefits unless you abolutely trust the markets honesty and development abiity which recent events have shown arent good bet. 
think this benefits everyone involved. 
while hear what you are saying about maintaining the dominance markets and that users should trust them with multi sig respectfully disagree think its appalling setup and will only lead more scams and hacks. 
sovles nothing and doesnt move towards trustless system.

edit wow brain wasnt working. 
the even more important difference that the second key has expiration date. 
the first key good forever. 
always have expiration date your key and always have revocation certificate backed somewhere case your key compromised. 
bitcoin also messed computer and dont like the idea the client having store the entire blockchain computer. 
info because pretty damn simple and has never given problems. 
however know will have sacrafice conveinience for security and happy. 
unfortunetly not all people will feel that way quite possibly the majority. 
ready try wallet that supports mst and will have soon can explain how works all the. 
web wallets can secure they are fully client side but you take the risk that the javascript not malicious unless you verify everytime. 
prefer bitcoind over electrum for reasons electrum crap for signing multisigs. 
give and you will see what mean. 
other than transfering coins multi sig address isnt multi sig compliant. 
bitcoind has the whole blockchain. 
electrum requests the data for addresses sends server. 
the server can then link your addresses and potentially deanonoymise you. 
bitcoind you have the whole blockchain one can link nothing you. 
having said that electrum obviously more convenient and space saving. 
have been working plugin for trying fix multi sig signing electrum but havent had much time devote this would have liked recently. 
but will continue and hopefully have out before electrum fix albert one thing would say though allow people able verify the multi sig address legit giving them the public keys needed recreate. 
markets and vendors buyer will already have his own key. 
pointless have multi sig the user cant generate the address themselves and verify legit. 
this brings some credibility theft.

how about this solution tor over vpn like axa mentioned here. 
msg msg sorry dont want pain the ass just trying find the best solution available person. 
have feeling that they disabled registration help deal with all the users whose bitcoins were already missing due the negative balance bug the users whose bitcoins not show pending and other users who will not getting repaid. 
here another tip. 
you have foil bags and want ship something that will smell you can use pvc pipe. 
get anything from larger than that and gets very heavy. 
look for thinwall. 
get end caps and the glue. 
put your goods the pipe section you cut off glue the end caps and wait bit for them dry. 
you now have odor proof container send out and wont set off any metal detectors either. 
otr can used with nearly any transport. 
otr likely the most secure way youll have messaging for while. 
not sure where they are pulling their btc rate from. 
its also entirely possible that due the rapid fall and expected quick rebound that the devs locked temporarily keep customers from drastically over spending. 
ofc this would have been bad move the rebound had not happened would have put burden back onto vendors but overall cant blame them for doing. 
honestly was probably good move favor the customers the time but since looks like btc going back the rise now that the whole fear gox collapsing over they should put back auto tracking. 
yeah bitcoin money torrent download. 
not centralized which means instead running one server which shut down would the end running upon computers and servers order for shut down you would need shut down every computer running aka the whole internet. 
this precisely how the next generation darkent markets need designed. 
howdy blackbanks system takes the commission before starting the escrow transaction. 
the transaction only has single output instead two. 
this way blackbank more than happy allow vendors buyers finalize outside blackbank. 
the only trust issue would blackbank offers support there are problems. 
however that lot less risky than traditional centralized escrow systems and easier for the buyer vendor. 
sure buyer vendor would prioritize verifying that the funds transactions over verifying support. 
however still promise continue support with any issues ive been offering advice and support outside blackbank entirely even members other markets. 
its important help each other the community. 
growing safe and secure community mutually beneficial for everyone regardless immediate financial gain. 
from ofl pwmolzg february amuse more privacy friendly exchange like btc with fresh deposit tumbling fog coinjoin shared send but also move into other coins and then tumbling fog coinjoin shared send those other coins and then move back into bitcoin. 
when something like zerocoin comes out for real usage and has market obviously moving and out that would the ultimate method. 
very cool feel like many more ideas here the better. 
recent scam revelation. 
well ive been playing around with the idea having secure multi sigs implementation tba for while now and been toying around with number different bitcoin clients that currently support transaction some form another. 
and ive had folks with their ideas asto why should have such system place well why they believe not. 
set for debate amongst our users. 
and having heard both sides the argument the overwhelming choice was for favor multi sig integration. 
despite the niggles and constraints presented end user. 
with various bicoin clients out there was wondering what the spread was like and hence the poll. 
maybe you could also drop line two asto why you use prefer the said client over another thatd totally awesome. 
though pretty close having had worked out fine balance for how about without being too complicated some users suggested seemed like know what people out here use their favorite bitcoin client.

just what was looking for. 
got very little hands experience with bitcoinqt but gather its just python based gui for the bash based bitcoind program but with limited features. 
but interesting know that its messed your computers sure wasnt something else and yes youre right requires bitcoind updated the lastest blockchain and synced all function which about gigs now from axa february pmbitcoin and armory exactly that.

unfortunately armory doesnt support multi sigs just yet but definitely agree its the most secure offline wallet program out there and therefore use for the markets cold storage. 
comes two flavors online and offline and unlike the online version which requires good ram the offline version can run and most folks use old rusty which doesnt require internet. 
ideal for offline storage.

correct wrong looked into trying out the coinbase api for multisigs and they only support transactions upto couple hundred dollars day without dox anything above and for larger transactions requires verified account.

heard the news that there are issues with the btc mkt. 
didnt catch the full story. 
hopefully misunderstood the little that heard. 
was under the impression that the only way that thebtc could destroyed when the entire internet goes down. 
hopefully someone can shed come light the topic. 
this looks good. 
like the wot rating system. 
sure you know this but ill mention anyway. 
info very javascript heavy you need enabled for that site. 
dont use tails just the tor browser bundle. 
here expereince with shared send blockchain. 
info since was modified use sharedcoin. 
com several weeks ago. 
can very slow. 
the little popup that happens when you start transaction can take long time complete. 
sometimes will not complete. 
when the transaction initiated will take longer confirm than standard transaction. 
sometimes couple hours. 
sometimes full day. 
rather than shared send vendor now have separate wallet blockchain. 
info that shared send. 
keep some btc there that when want use can transfer directly from there vendor. 
that way not concerned with the reliability time for shared send.

wasnt trying macbook was trying imac with optical drive but was trying boot tails from usb not. 
the proccess fairly complicated. 
there are few methods but the only one got work was installing via command line. 
there are directions the site that explain how this and you can simply copy paste the commands and replace the with the. 
iso compy pasting the command line when asks for its directory. 
for simply would not install this way and was because was missing command that was not the instructions. 
something retarded like dev the end certain command. 
after about hours trying figured this out and got successfully install. 
next you need bootloader because mac has efi loader instead. 
for this they say you need refind which older version refit. 
could not get install because already had refit there with hopes remove. 
when turned computer the usb drive shows but only boots blank screen and goes where. 
after few more hours tinkinering gave. 
from mirage february pmquote from raztafarii february pmwell ive pretty much given this point. 
its really advanced stuff and tech knowledge and skills sort dont that far.

iso file and another one and the tailssigning. 
key one used verify the. 
the tails signing. 
key when download zipped file which cant unzip error corrupt file file format not supported when try import terminal doesnt work. 
dont know what this stage and this like the first freaking step. 
also apparently you need refit whatever which dont have. 
also buying anything this point isnt rly ideal dunno. 
just might look into. 
maybe ill try upgrade more recent osx have snow leopard. 
never give and you shouldnt even worrying about terminal for now. 
for starters just try burn the. 
iso dvd using disk utility mentioned above. 
then you can worry about verifing and signatures and what not later. 
first things first.

net its powerful tool verify identity and secure. 
pgp has been around since. 
there nothing fundementally suspicious about using pgp. 
tails leaves javascript enabled default because they want match the tbb fingerprint closely possible. 
get the tbb fix and tails will change without hesitation. 
org projects torbrowser design. 
net code issues basically tails want look exactly the same tbb web server. 
noscript enabled default tbb tails will change theirs reflect the new design. 
course you could actually build your own tails with javascript turned off. 
there are instructions how roll your own tails the website.

from mdparity february amhowdy blackbanks system takes the commission before starting the escrow transaction. 
the transaction only has single output instead two. 
this way blackbank more than happy allow vendors buyers finalize outside blackbank. 
the only trust issue would blackbank offers support there are problems. 
however that lot less risky than traditional centralized escrow systems and easier for the buyer vendor. 
sure buyer vendor would prioritize verifying that the funds transactions over verifying support. 
however still promise continue support with any issues ive been offering advice and support outside blackbank entirely even members other markets. 
its important help each other the community. 
growing safe and secure community mutually beneficial for everyone regardless immediate financial gain. 
cheers idea like feel like both can win this situation.

cheers idea like feel like both can win this situation. 
get the buyer send the commission first the market then you can release all public keys allow the buyer and seller feel safer about the transaction. 
and there have. 
solution that doesnt centralise all power with the market. 
from jolly roger february pmquote from ronin february pmi have disagree with this guy the server doesnt give you the opportunity verify the address then its not worth. 
they could give you multi sig that with addresses both controlled the market. 
this opens you obvious scams. 
dont fall for what proposing. 
verify the address and protect yourself from scams. 
first all your accusations about are very offensive. 
accusing that trying get you all fall for something. 
and not think you completely understand the entire process multisignature addresses make the claims you are making. 
how this any more risky than the escrow system that markets had before the markets were controlling the funds and getting robbed and cleaned out several occasions. 
people were placing trust markets before and now suddenly you are worried about getting scammed where were you speaking out with the old escrow system sorry that you feel offended but dont think have said anything below the belt. 
you are proposing multi sig escrow solution which doesnt protect the buyer from rogue markets incompetent developers. 
kind poinltess opionion. 
regarding risk compared previous its the same market could rogue loose all its coins due incompetent devs. 
whats your point you are proposing solution that still exposes users the same problems. 
and its not sudden worry. 
have raised the issue mutli sig way before the debacle. 
take the time through postings this forum and others and you will see have been long term proponent multi sig. 
way beforfe became fashinable. 
from jolly roger february pmquote from ronin february also makes sense for the market hide this the buyer seller wanted avoid fees they could set their own escrow. 
also the situation jolly roger describes above the buyer could sign transaction sending all funds vendor and then vendor verifies and also signs the transaction. 
funds released market bypassed. 
the market not protected. 
yes they buyer and seller could set their own escrow outside the market but this would stupid because having makes possible for the market become the arbitrator. 
only one the people involved has scammer and then the funds are locked forever. 
with the buyer tries scam then the market can provide the second key unlock the funds send the seller. 
this why better than. 
also the case the market cannot bypassed without the redeemscript generated the time that the multisignature address created. 
the market holds the redeemscript multisignature address then the buyer and seller cannot complete the transaction the side without the market and therefore cut out the markets fees. 
another security issue with releasing all public keys involved that lets the participants know whether not the seller buyer server are reusing private key and therefore making them more susceptible attacks. 
doesnt benefit the scammer financially pull scam. 
which removes most the motive. 
agree better but not the market doesnt allow the buyer vendor confirm the address you are proposing. 
wouldnt touch market that insists hiding the details the address from you. 
its too open abuse incompetence. 
agreed the redeem script. 
but the market cant really withold the script someone can generate themselves from the original inputs. 
dont think its security issue the buyer vendor can see the market reusing the same keys. 
this would excellent way people being able ascertain the market coded incompetent. 
from jolly roger february pmquote from ronin february the market would rely getting income through signing transaction which sends most funds vendor and commision market. 
this would then signed the buyer when happy. 
the buyer starts bypassing the market fee transaction then banned. 
but hide all away from the user and not give them the ability able verify addresses avoid this market set. 
its not healthy. 
harder verify you might think see the buyer and seller are closing the deal the side. 
unless the market constantly searching through the blockchain for funds spent from that multisignature address would extremely difficult verify that buyer and seller are bypassing the market cut out their fees. 
dont see the issue here. 
what difficult about this exactly anyone running the bitcond client always getting every transaction. 
the databse holding transactions could checked for transactions once week that are older than one month. 
any such transaction which has the funds removed from the address would flagged having done deal outside the market. 
could probably write bash script this fairly quickly. 
missing something here what the difficulty from jolly roger february pmquote from ronin february pmi would warn anyone away from the setup jolly roger promoting. 
will lead more scams the future and will not allow you verify multi sig setup correctly. 
what you are basically saying here that the market should trust the buyers but the buyers should not trust the market. 
the market has every incentive keep the ability unlock funds itself out its own hands that not target for hackers. 
the market has the ability unlock the funds without any buyer seller input would make the market very dangerous and this not desirable and defeats the purpose for the markets. 
but giving out the keys and the redeemscript the buyer and seller gives them the ability close the deal outside the market and bypass fees. 
again you are not able trust your market then yes contact the seller and say you want with your seller outside the market and you can easily set one. 
but with fees average bypassing the fees will become more common than you think and harder detect than you think. 
especially when you are dealing with thousands transactions. 
ronin understand what you are saying and you make valid point that would likely desirable for buyer have this setup. 
but not desireable for market have this setup since the market relies market fees and giving your customers the ability cut you out the deal bad for business. 
there are plenty free and multisignature services out there now that you can use. 
you are not comfortable using the markets system then use another one that gives you the public keys. 
but you expect the markets start giving you the ability bypass their commissions then you will likely never happy. 
not think makes sense for markets this. 
the cost running market high and allowing your buyers not pay their taxes speak dumb move for the market. 
you not trust your market outside the market. 
you make the choice. 
think has already been shown that markets suffer from fraudulent owners incompetent developers. 
not saying markets shouldnt charge fee. 
but also not proposing solution that offers benefits unless you abolutely trust the markets honesty and development abiity which recent events have shown arent good bet. 
think this benefits everyone involved. 
while hear what you are saying about maintaining the dominance markets and that users should trust them with multi sig respectfully disagree think its appalling setup and will only lead more scams and hacks. 
sovles nothing and doesnt move towards trustless system. 
from blackstar february amyea man sorry. 
hopefully there some legal recouse that can implemented lean them pay coins back. 
not sure they all got stolen what. 
wouldnt suprise the feds didnt have ahand. 
seems like more and more coins are going missing into wallets that are sitting still. 
know how bad the feds want btc gone. 
who knows though. 
genuinely sorry for all involved gox. 
read somewhere where btc had been stolen from mtgox and they never told anyone. 
legal tax paying business surely there aduty care and reimbursement here. 
mean whether btc are seen legit not they were providing service and they have failed that right. 
dont think its any excuse for its dark net site security the biggest issue. 
course for mtgox but fucking hell you dont expect darknet market vulnerable thats the whole point doing illegal activity online security. 
until gox comes back online nothing can done. 
have feeling that they disabled registration help deal with all the users whose bitcoins were already missing due the negative balance bug the users whose bitcoins not show pending and other users who will not getting repaid. 
from lila february pmif you read carefully says that they can view your real address. 
justa heads upof course they can any vpn can. 
however airvpn the only paid vpn aware that has procedure that does hide your true from their server providing true vpn over tor see. 
org tor for details. 
from lila february amthis where they say they can see your though the tor sectionfrom the airvpn link noted before using airvpn with torworking configuration tested tor browser bundle openvpn. 
after you have downloaded and launched tor browser bundle connect airvpn with socks proxy option activated. 
you can this either with airvpn client with the proper option menu member access without our client. 
select socks proxy type the combo box the bottom the page. 
parameters socks proxy. 
port you use the configuration generator dont forget download the archive air. 
zip copy all the files inside and paste them into the openvpn configuration directory. 
advantages additional privacy layer our vpn server will not see your real address but the the tor exit node option connect web sites under tor protection even those sites which refuse tor connections usage tor even the programs which dont support access tor from all the applications transparently need configure each application one one avoidance any traffic discrimination from tor exit nodes packets are still encrypted when they pass through tor exit node major security layer the event you pass through compromised malicious tor exit node packets are still encrypted when they pass through the tor exit node disadvantages poor performance nfi airvpn respected provider. 
sure you know this but ill mention anyway. 
info very javascript heavy you need enabled for that site. 
dont use tails just the tor browser bundle. 
here expereince with shared send blockchain. 
info since was modified use sharedcoin. 
com several weeks ago. 
can very slow. 
the little popup that happens when you start transaction can take long time complete. 
sometimes will not complete. 
when the transaction initiated will take longer confirm than standard transaction. 
sometimes couple hours. 
sometimes full day. 
rather than shared send vendor now have separate wallet blockchain. 
info that shared send. 
keep some btc there that when want use can transfer directly from there vendor. 
that way not concerned with the reliability time for shared send. 
has anyone been having problems with their tails freezing while they try shared coin send there way can avoid this the future.

something retarded like dev the end certain command.

unfortunetly not all people will feel that way quite possibly the majority. 
ready try wallet that supports mst and will have soon can explain how works all the. 
web wallets can secure they are fully client side but you take the risk that the javascript not malicious unless you verify everytime. 
prefer bitcoind over electrum for reasons electrum crap for signing multisigs. 
give and you will see what mean. 
other than transfering coins multi sig address isnt multi sig compliant. 
bitcoind has the whole blockchain. 
electrum requests the data for addresses sends server. 
the server can then link your addresses and potentially deanonoymise you. 
bitcoind you have the whole blockchain one can link nothing you. 
having said that electrum obviously more convenient and space saving. 
have been working plugin for trying fix multi sig signing electrum but havent had much time devote this would have liked recently. 
but will continue and hopefully have out before electrum fix albert one thing would say though allow people able verify the multi sig address legit giving them the public keys needed recreate. 
markets and vendors buyer will already have his own key. 
pointless have multi sig the user cant generate the address themselves and verify legit.

the event this true wouldnt this solution safe one after all the feds goes the vpn provider but its dead end there. 
yes but this case vpn discovered hosting somebody interest then they can forced court order keep logs. 
this happened hide ass and another vpn which escapes right now.

recent scam revelation. 
update having closely studied what posted above have come the conclusion that gasp oracle form the forum was probably correct his theory dox last week. 
not that support but his dox pritel internet name mods not delete was pretty accurate. 
the dox included everything that the above post says about the mtgox theft and other btc hacks. 
turns out this guy pritel was bragging about how helped code these sites and had found the btc protocol. 
says that hit bitstamp and gox with ddos flooded them with mutated transactions and made fortune. 
all sounded well oracle the time but now this bbmc update has come light actually believe this guy pritel person deep interest. 
have full uncensored copy pritel dox and will post redacted version below you can all see the relation and importance. 
but names address will included mods dont freak out. 
this now looks pretty conclusive. 
but only time will tell. 
also not stir shit but explanation above still doesnt put defcon the clear. 
defcon hired pritel after reccomendation from non other than stexo. 
possible that they could all sharing the profits behind the scenes. 
hence the repeated call for narco who probably doesnt exist and likely dropshpper from spain france. 
redacted dox pritel will posted soon.

the same goes for gox. 
believe programmer who coded the gox wallets the wallets and also set thegaming sites which have been spamming the bitcoin network with micropayments. 
hacked our investigators facebook order message him feb which was investigating before being contracted using the name phibbo bit. 
this the message some background mtgox runs custom wallet software. 
this reasonable and common practice for service its size and nature. 
getting wallet implementing right isn easy there very little room for error much like the rest the bitcoin system. 
some have criticized their use custom software here but reasonable and common practice for service its size and nature. 
the reference client wallet basically suitable for small scale single party use. 
would not recommend something like mtgox use the reference node wallet least not without healthy layer abstraction top relieving duties harder than key management and chain monitoring otherwise improving greatly. 
for that matter mtgox wallet software has caused them fewer concerning problems than some other companies. 
some have completely implemented the bitcoin protocol incorrectly and exposed the outside world and suffered numerous local blockchain rejecting glitches. 
though its certainly taken gox fair amount time sort things out. 
first heard people reporting stuck transactions back september. 
looked into and determined that mtgox was spending immature coins. 
freshly generated bitcoins from mining can not spend until they are least blocks deep the blockchain. 
this prevents the funds from vanishing forever the chain reorgs. 
pinged magicaltux and after couple tries got hold him. 
think they also wasted some time dead ends trying resolve this before the actual nature the problem was brought their attention. 
raising their transaction fees with mistaken belief that their fees weren high enough. 
mtgox wasn tracking the coins were freshly generated what their height was their software. 
including this data would apparently non trivial change and for high risk finance software even trivial change takes lot work. 
suggested workaround basically just try spend the oldest coins and far know they implemented and was effective. 
they continued have problems with stuck transactions after and further analysis revealed that they were producing transactions with excessively padded signatures. 
minor tangent required here there design flaw the bitcoin protocol where its possible for third party take valid transaction yours and mutate way which leaves valid and functionally identical but with different transaction. 
this greatly complicates writing correct wallet software and can used abusively invalidate long chains unconfirmed transactions that depend the non mutant transaction since transactions refer each other txid. 
this issue arises from several sources one them being openssl willingness accept and make sense signatures with invalid encodings. 
normal ecdsa signature encodes two large integers the encoding isn constant length there are leading zeros you are supposed drop them. 
easy write software that assumes the signature will constant length and then leave extra leading zeros them. 
order eventually remove this malleability flaw been gradually tightening the rules that govern what transactions nodes the network will consider valid when they relay them mine them. 
after months work chasing down software authors get them fix their bugs transactions with these invalid encodings were longer relayed. 
this caused some problems for few things. 
itself had been fixed long before but they couldn update the iphone app without fear triggering another review apple. 
eventually this was just worked around the server side mutating the transactions produced the iphone wallets. 
and moot now guess. 
mtgox also had problems with occasionally producing invalid signatures. 
this would normally simple fix. 
here example where fixed this type issue some python wallet code never used but saw lot people were copying. 
com but said before high value systems like mtgox even simple fixes aren simple and took them quite some time deploy fix. 
however believe that actually fixed now. 
current understanding and inference that the remaining issues are because while mtgox was producing transactions the bad form that the network won relay anymore some people decided help out fixing these transactions like. 
did for iphone users making the signatures normal and broadcasting them. 
course the new transactions while functionally identical have different txids. 
the difference here that the mtgox wallet software appears have not handled this case gracefully all and apparently simply wouldn notice transactions that didn make spending its own coins. 
result the mtgox wallet believed some coins were available for spending which really had already been spent and began double spending those inputs. 
this may have interacted particularly poorly with the earlier workaround mentioned trying always use the oldest available coins they did implement that workaround. 
worse some this may have resulted users getting paid multiple times and could have been intentionally triggered with that end mind someone helpfully fixed some transactions and then noticed they got paid twice. 
think this unlikely have caused large losses before people run off worrying about that both because the reuse the oldest inputs and because the hot wallet cold wallet split. 
this point they likely have accounting mess clean figuring out who did and didn get paid now with none the txids matching. 
cleaning that will somewhat tricky. 
say there were three payments mtgox coins apple the block chain and three users that attempted pay apple and mtgox records thinks that only one went through. 
software will have written that matches transactions with their mutants order figure out what went where. 
not personally concerned least not any the details here. 
mtgox slow speed resolving these sorts issues and poor communications are not terribly inspiring. 
they seem horribly short staffed but competent and trustworthy people this space may hard find the regulatory morass that business sure make many steer clear. 
the claims that the delays indicate insolvency strike just hysteria the technical background doesn support this conclusion and there may bit opportunism play from people who want manipulate the market too. 
don get wrong have not seen their books gox may well have financial problems though with their income its hard for see how but any problems like that exist they not being indicated here. 
course none this suggests anyone should happy with the service mtgox has been providing but our anger should least well informed.

from jolly roger february pmquote from ronin february pmi have disagree with this guy the server doesnt give you the opportunity verify the address then its not worth. 
they could give you multi sig that with addresses both controlled the market. 
this opens you obvious scams. 
dont fall for what proposing. 
verify the address and protect yourself from scams. 
first all your accusations about are very offensive. 
accusing that trying get you all fall for something. 
and not think you completely understand the entire process multisignature addresses make the claims you are making. 
how this any more risky than the escrow system that markets had before the markets were controlling the funds and getting robbed and cleaned out several occasions. 
people were placing trust markets before and now suddenly you are worried about getting scammed where were you speaking out with the old escrow system sorry that you feel offended but dont think have said anything below the belt. 
you are proposing multi sig escrow solution which doesnt protect the buyer from rogue markets incompetent developers. 
kind poinltess opionion. 
regarding risk compared previous its the same market could rogue loose all its coins due incompetent devs. 
whats your point you are proposing solution that still exposes users the same problems. 
and its not sudden worry. 
have raised the issue mutli sig way before the debacle. 
take the time through postings this forum and others and you will see have been long term proponent multi sig. 
way beforfe became fashinable. 
from jolly roger february pmquote from ronin february also makes sense for the market hide this the buyer seller wanted avoid fees they could set their own escrow. 
also the situation jolly roger describes above the buyer could sign transaction sending all funds vendor and then vendor verifies and also signs the transaction. 
funds released market bypassed. 
the market not protected. 
yes they buyer and seller could set their own escrow outside the market but this would stupid because having makes possible for the market become the arbitrator. 
only one the people involved has scammer and then the funds are locked forever. 
with the buyer tries scam then the market can provide the second key unlock the funds send the seller. 
this why better than. 
also the case the market cannot bypassed without the redeemscript generated the time that the multisignature address created. 
the market holds the redeemscript multisignature address then the buyer and seller cannot complete the transaction the side without the market and therefore cut out the markets fees. 
another security issue with releasing all public keys involved that lets the participants know whether not the seller buyer server are reusing private key and therefore making them more susceptible attacks. 
doesnt benefit the scammer financially pull scam. 
which removes most the motive. 
agree better but not the market doesnt allow the buyer vendor confirm the address you are proposing. 
wouldnt touch market that insists hiding the details the address from you. 
its too open abuse incompetence. 
agreed the redeem script. 
but the market cant really withold the script someone can generate themselves from the original inputs. 
dont think its security issue the buyer vendor can see the market reusing the same keys. 
this would excellent way people being able ascertain the market coded incompetent. 
from jolly roger february pmquote from ronin february the market would rely getting income through signing transaction which sends most funds vendor and commision market. 
this would then signed the buyer when happy. 
the buyer starts bypassing the market fee transaction then banned. 
but hide all away from the user and not give them the ability able verify addresses avoid this market set. 
its not healthy. 
harder verify you might think see the buyer and seller are closing the deal the side. 
unless the market constantly searching through the blockchain for funds spent from that multisignature address would extremely difficult verify that buyer and seller are bypassing the market cut out their fees. 
dont see the issue here. 
what difficult about this exactly anyone running the bitcond client always getting every transaction. 
the databse holding transactions could checked for transactions once week that are older than one month. 
any such transaction which has the funds removed from the address would flagged having done deal outside the market. 
could probably write bash script this fairly quickly. 
missing something here what the difficulty from jolly roger february pmquote from ronin february pmi would warn anyone away from the setup jolly roger promoting. 
will lead more scams the future and will not allow you verify multi sig setup correctly. 
what you are basically saying here that the market should trust the buyers but the buyers should not trust the market. 
the market has every incentive keep the ability unlock funds itself out its own hands that not target for hackers. 
the market has the ability unlock the funds without any buyer seller input would make the market very dangerous and this not desirable and defeats the purpose for the markets. 
but giving out the keys and the redeemscript the buyer and seller gives them the ability close the deal outside the market and bypass fees. 
again you are not able trust your market then yes contact the seller and say you want with your seller outside the market and you can easily set one. 
but with fees average bypassing the fees will become more common than you think and harder detect than you think. 
especially when you are dealing with thousands transactions. 
ronin understand what you are saying and you make valid point that would likely desirable for buyer have this setup. 
but not desireable for market have this setup since the market relies market fees and giving your customers the ability cut you out the deal bad for business. 
there are plenty free and multisignature services out there now that you can use. 
you are not comfortable using the markets system then use another one that gives you the public keys. 
but you expect the markets start giving you the ability bypass their commissions then you will likely never happy. 
not think makes sense for markets this. 
the cost running market high and allowing your buyers not pay their taxes speak dumb move for the market. 
you not trust your market outside the market. 
you make the choice. 
think has already been shown that markets suffer from fraudulent owners incompetent developers. 
not saying markets shouldnt charge fee. 
but also not proposing solution that offers benefits unless you abolutely trust the markets honesty and development abiity which recent events have shown arent good bet. 
think this benefits everyone involved. 
while hear what you are saying about maintaining the dominance markets and that users should trust them with multi sig respectfully disagree think its appalling setup and will only lead more scams and hacks. 
sovles nothing and doesnt move towards trustless system.

the pump and dump was done wall street after fell. 
they pumped past. 
then did massive sell off. 
rumor has chase banking cartel used the fast profits they made bitcoin help fund the development their version bitcoin. 
the forums are still available online you should able find the whole sad saga easily enough. 
remember limetless vouched for vladimirs bitcoin hedge fund which was offering silly returns and was obvious ponzi scheme. 
ultimately vladimir disappeared with the funds after was late some payments and began receiving calls his workplace. 
and not long afterwards limetless had overdose and disappeared from the scene. 
does anybody else remember this have link mirror the forums wonder what ever became that cast screen names. 
had money account before the attack whatever happened. 
now says but have been reading where some people have been getting their money back. 
accont and have hit refresh etc etc. 
still says will ever get coin back. 
buy all the bitcoins existance advertise everywhere that bitcoins are the best thing since sliced bread sell the bitcoinsi say pump you say dumppump. 
not sure where they are pulling their btc rate from. 
its also entirely possible that due the rapid fall and expected quick rebound that the devs locked temporarily keep customers from drastically over spending. 
ofc this would have been bad move the rebound had not happened would have put burden back onto vendors but overall cant blame them for doing. 
honestly was probably good move favor the customers the time but since looks like btc going back the rise now that the whole fear gox collapsing over they should put back auto tracking. 
yea and unlike where the theif virtually anonymous fatfuck has worry about more than moving coins around. 
needs worry about moving himself around his are pretty much public record. 
almost feel bad for the guy. 
any intelligent person would register website and business like mtgox stolen identity.

from axa february pmsecurity bitcoin depends the blockchain being held full many people. 
bitcoin and armory exactly that. 
however given enough copies the blockchain one can assume the system secure from the data being lost and rely other nodes provide the information require when need. 
many users like having the whole blockchain available them but that problem for you use lightweight wallet like electrum. 
all the wallets available only armory and electrum only need backed once ever. 
careful with web wallets they have been hacked before. 
keeping your bitcoin locally using client your own computer always more secure. 
can see reason use web wallet unless you have small amount there. 
has armory the most secure moment. 
wasnt trying macbook was trying imac with optical drive but was trying boot tails from usb not. 
the proccess fairly complicated. 
there are few methods but the only one got work was installing via command line. 
there are directions the site that explain how this and you can simply copy paste the commands and replace the with the. 
iso compy pasting the command line when asks for its directory. 
for simply would not install this way and was because was missing command that was not the instructions. 
something retarded like dev the end certain command. 
after about hours trying figured this out and got successfully install. 
next you need bootloader because mac has efi loader instead. 
for this they say you need refind which older version refit. 
could not get install because already had refit there with hopes remove. 
when turned computer the usb drive shows but only boots blank screen and goes where. 
after few more hours tinkinering gave.

key one used verify the. 
the tails signing. 
key when download zipped file which cant unzip error corrupt file file format not supported when try import terminal doesnt work. 
dont know what this stage and this like the first freaking step. 
also apparently you need refit whatever which dont have. 
also buying anything this point isnt rly ideal dunno. 
just might look into. 
maybe ill try upgrade more recent osx have snow leopard. 
never give and you shouldnt even worrying about terminal for now. 
for starters just try burn the. 
iso dvd using disk utility mentioned above. 
then you can worry about verifing and signatures and what not later. 
first things first. 
and you might not even have use reefit just hold down the option key when booting see your list connected drives give try works for only use. 
for legal stuff for number reasons. 
the least which its the last version you dont have download and can have original dvd installation disk. 
well you read the small print the licensing agreement apple didnt join the nsas prizm program until after steve jobs died. 
just went down like that. 
and there are many other good reasons run. 
and nothing after. 
and even better reasons run linux tails ect. 
dont give just yet are all here help try what mentioned above and just lemmie know peacemirageoki thanks for the encouragement wont give yet would get the burning onto the dvd but drive all jacked put itll never coma back out unless manage pull out. 
will usb work really want avoid buying anything extra this point runnin low cash like external drive something.

way beforfe became fashinable. 
from jolly roger february pmquote from ronin february also makes sense for the market hide this the buyer seller wanted avoid fees they could set their own escrow. 
also the situation jolly roger describes above the buyer could sign transaction sending all funds vendor and then vendor verifies and also signs the transaction. 
funds released market bypassed. 
the market not protected. 
yes they buyer and seller could set their own escrow outside the market but this would stupid because having makes possible for the market become the arbitrator. 
only one the people involved has scammer and then the funds are locked forever. 
with the buyer tries scam then the market can provide the second key unlock the funds send the seller. 
this why better than. 
also the case the market cannot bypassed without the redeemscript generated the time that the multisignature address created. 
the market holds the redeemscript multisignature address then the buyer and seller cannot complete the transaction the side without the market and therefore cut out the markets fees. 
another security issue with releasing all public keys involved that lets the participants know whether not the seller buyer server are reusing private key and therefore making them more susceptible attacks. 
doesnt benefit the scammer financially pull scam. 
which removes most the motive. 
agree better but not the market doesnt allow the buyer vendor confirm the address you are proposing. 
wouldnt touch market that insists hiding the details the address from you. 
its too open abuse incompetence. 
agreed the redeem script. 
but the market cant really withold the script someone can generate themselves from the original inputs. 
dont think its security issue the buyer vendor can see the market reusing the same keys. 
this would excellent way people being able ascertain the market coded incompetent. 
from jolly roger february pmquote from ronin february the market would rely getting income through signing transaction which sends most funds vendor and commision market. 
this would then signed the buyer when happy. 
the buyer starts bypassing the market fee transaction then banned. 
but hide all away from the user and not give them the ability able verify addresses avoid this market set. 
its not healthy. 
harder verify you might think see the buyer and seller are closing the deal the side. 
unless the market constantly searching through the blockchain for funds spent from that multisignature address would extremely difficult verify that buyer and seller are bypassing the market cut out their fees. 
dont see the issue here. 
what difficult about this exactly anyone running the bitcond client always getting every transaction. 
the databse holding transactions could checked for transactions once week that are older than one month. 
any such transaction which has the funds removed from the address would flagged having done deal outside the market. 
could probably write bash script this fairly quickly. 
missing something here what the difficulty from jolly roger february pmquote from ronin february pmi would warn anyone away from the setup jolly roger promoting. 
will lead more scams the future and will not allow you verify multi sig setup correctly. 
what you are basically saying here that the market should trust the buyers but the buyers should not trust the market. 
the market has every incentive keep the ability unlock funds itself out its own hands that not target for hackers. 
the market has the ability unlock the funds without any buyer seller input would make the market very dangerous and this not desirable and defeats the purpose for the markets. 
but giving out the keys and the redeemscript the buyer and seller gives them the ability close the deal outside the market and bypass fees. 
again you are not able trust your market then yes contact the seller and say you want with your seller outside the market and you can easily set one. 
but with fees average bypassing the fees will become more common than you think and harder detect than you think. 
especially when you are dealing with thousands transactions. 
ronin understand what you are saying and you make valid point that would likely desirable for buyer have this setup. 
but not desireable for market have this setup since the market relies market fees and giving your customers the ability cut you out the deal bad for business. 
there are plenty free and multisignature services out there now that you can use. 
you are not comfortable using the markets system then use another one that gives you the public keys. 
but you expect the markets start giving you the ability bypass their commissions then you will likely never happy. 
not think makes sense for markets this. 
the cost running market high and allowing your buyers not pay their taxes speak dumb move for the market. 
you not trust your market outside the market. 
you make the choice. 
think has already been shown that markets suffer from fraudulent owners incompetent developers. 
not saying markets shouldnt charge fee. 
but also not proposing solution that offers benefits unless you abolutely trust the markets honesty and development abiity which recent events have shown arent good bet. 
think this benefits everyone involved. 
while hear what you are saying about maintaining the dominance markets and that users should trust them with multi sig respectfully disagree think its appalling setup and will only lead more scams and hacks. 
sovles nothing and doesnt move towards trustless system. 
from blackstar february amyea man sorry. 
hopefully there some legal recouse that can implemented lean them pay coins back. 
not sure they all got stolen what. 
wouldnt suprise the feds didnt have ahand. 
seems like more and more coins are going missing into wallets that are sitting still. 
know how bad the feds want btc gone. 
who knows though. 
genuinely sorry for all involved gox. 
read somewhere where btc had been stolen from mtgox and they never told anyone. 
legal tax paying business surely there aduty care and reimbursement here. 
mean whether btc are seen legit not they were providing service and they have failed that right. 
dont think its any excuse for its dark net site security the biggest issue. 
course for mtgox but fucking hell you dont expect darknet market vulnerable thats the whole point doing illegal activity online security. 
until gox comes back online nothing can done. 
have feeling that they disabled registration help deal with all the users whose bitcoins were already missing due the negative balance bug the users whose bitcoins not show pending and other users who will not getting repaid. 
from lila february pmif you read carefully says that they can view your real address. 
justa heads upof course they can any vpn can. 
however airvpn the only paid vpn aware that has procedure that does hide your true from their server providing true vpn over tor see. 
org tor for details. 
from lila february amthis where they say they can see your though the tor sectionfrom the airvpn link noted before using airvpn with torworking configuration tested tor browser bundle openvpn. 
after you have downloaded and launched tor browser bundle connect airvpn with socks proxy option activated. 
you can this either with airvpn client with the proper option menu member access without our client. 
select socks proxy type the combo box the bottom the page. 
parameters socks proxy. 
port you use the configuration generator dont forget download the archive air. 
zip copy all the files inside and paste them into the openvpn configuration directory. 
advantages additional privacy layer our vpn server will not see your real address but the the tor exit node option connect web sites under tor protection even those sites which refuse tor connections usage tor even the programs which dont support access tor from all the applications transparently need configure each application one one avoidance any traffic discrimination from tor exit nodes packets are still encrypted when they pass through tor exit node major security layer the event you pass through compromised malicious tor exit node packets are still encrypted when they pass through the tor exit node disadvantages poor performance nfi airvpn respected provider. 
sure you know this but ill mention anyway. 
info very javascript heavy you need enabled for that site. 
dont use tails just the tor browser bundle. 
here expereince with shared send blockchain. 
info since was modified use sharedcoin. 
com several weeks ago. 
can very slow. 
the little popup that happens when you start transaction can take long time complete. 
sometimes will not complete. 
when the transaction initiated will take longer confirm than standard transaction. 
sometimes couple hours. 
sometimes full day. 
rather than shared send vendor now have separate wallet blockchain. 
info that shared send. 
keep some btc there that when want use can transfer directly from there vendor. 
that way not concerned with the reliability time for shared send. 
has anyone been having problems with their tails freezing while they try shared coin send there way can avoid this the future. 
from blackstar february pmquote from owockeznan february pmyou have make sure that noscript allowing both blockchain. 
info and sharedcoin. 
comalso have noticed you have address that has mupltiple inputs sharedcoin doesnt like them all and tends fail. 
its easier sweep them all into one address and send. 
shit well that would explain perfectly didnt even know sharedcoin was different site rather feature. 
that kinda sucks know how sketch enabling scripts and barely let blockchain. 
com credible like blkchn hopefully the moment shared coin the only credible alternative bitcoin fog. 
heard the news that there are issues with the btc mkt. 
didnt catch the full story. 
hopefully misunderstood the little that heard. 
was under the impression that the only way that thebtc could destroyed when the entire internet goes down. 
hopefully someone can shed come light the topic. 
from mirage february pmjust never forget what more important external usb dvd drive your freedom and even perhaps day your space time. 
peacemirageoki you have point. 
guess ill invest one. 
but one question. 
cant use usb key instead dvd should right. 
from mirage february pmquote from raztafarii february pmwell ive pretty much given this point. 
its really advanced stuff and tech knowledge and skills sort dont that far. 
mirage ive only been able download the required files. 
iso file and another one and the tailssigning. 
key one used verify the. 
the tails signing. 
key when download zipped file which cant unzip error corrupt file file format not supported when try import terminal doesnt work. 
dont know what this stage and this like the first freaking step. 
also apparently you need refit whatever which dont have. 
also buying anything this point isnt rly ideal dunno. 
just might look into. 
maybe ill try upgrade more recent osx have snow leopard. 
but ill help when wake unless someone else does first. 
the different torescrow threads have now been merged. 
unforeseen future nestled somewhere victims warnings signs slayer. 
any you guys want start bitcoin exchange with can all split half billion dollars. 
yeah bitcoin money torrent download. 
not centralized which means instead running one server which shut down would the end running upon computers and servers order for shut down you would need shut down every computer running aka the whole internet. 
this precisely how the next generation darkent markets need designed. 
like man aint movement all just secret place buy and sell stuff. 
and like any other marketplace the planet they cant properly manage the folks property worse they cant keep their hands out the cookie jar then theyve failed being market and will wither away with all the other frauds. 
here another tip. 
you have foil bags and want ship something that will smell you can use pvc pipe. 
get anything from larger than that and gets very heavy. 
look for thinwall. 
get end caps and the glue. 
put your goods the pipe section you cut off glue the end caps and wait bit for them dry. 
you now have odor proof container send out and wont set off any metal detectors either. 
made the cryptocurrency sub its own sub opposed child board now feel free move this over there you want. 
from albert february amalso drop line two asto why you use prefer the said client over another thatd totally awesomei use few other things too but for this conversation preference seems around these kryptokit. 
from cooked february amas its huge ass nigga file and anused itself then fucked mac dont like spending computer only have fucked albert from evilgrin february ambitcoin also messed computer and dont like the idea the client having store the entire blockchain computer. 
info because pretty damn simple and has never given problems. 
great feedbacks people. 
just what was looking for. 
got very little hands experience with bitcoinqt but gather its just python based gui for the bash based bitcoind program but with limited features. 
but interesting know that its messed your computers sure wasnt something else and yes youre right requires bitcoind updated the lastest blockchain and synced all function which about gigs now from axa february pmbitcoin and armory exactly that. 
many users like having the whole blockchain available them but that problem for you use lightweight wallet like electrum. 
careful with web wallets they have been hacked before. 
keeping your bitcoin locally using client your own computer always more secure. 
unfortunately armory doesnt support multi sigs just yet but definitely agree its the most secure offline wallet program out there and therefore use for the markets cold storage. 
comes two flavors online and offline and unlike the online version which requires good ram the offline version can run and most folks use old rusty which doesnt require internet. 
ideal for offline storage. 
from missjones february pmagree. 
the most secure web wallets atm are blockchain. 
info and coinbase. 
coinbase keeps over bitcoin cold storage and moves users hot wallet needed. 
correct wrong looked into trying out the coinbase api for multisigs and they only support transactions upto couple hundred dollars day without dox anything above and for larger transactions requires verified account. 
should forward them ssn from ronin february pmweb wallets can secure they are fully client side but you take the risk that the javascript not malicious unless you verify everytime. 
electrum crap for signing multisigs. 
give and you will see what mean. 
other than transfering coins multi sig address isnt multi sig compliant. 
the server can then link your addresses and potentially deanonoymise you. 
bitcoind you have the whole blockchain one can link nothing you. 
albert one thing would say though allow people able verify the multi sig address legit giving them the public keys needed recreate. 
markets and vendors buyer will already have his own key. 
pointless have multi sig the user cant generate the address themselves and verify legit. 
some pretty awesome and important points. 
well yes the clients would generating their own key pairs pub and priv keys for precisely that. 
such verify transactions then broadcast them well for vendors later redeem them. 
the idea have this done pretty simple steps. 
from missjones february pmquote from axa february pmsecurity bitcoin depends the blockchain being held full many people. 
bitcoin and armory exactly that. 
however given enough copies the blockchain one can assume the system secure from the data being lost and rely other nodes provide the information require when need. 
many users like having the whole blockchain available them but that problem for you use lightweight wallet like electrum. 
all the wallets available only armory and electrum only need backed once ever. 
careful with web wallets they have been hacked before. 
keeping your bitcoin locally using client your own computer always more secure. 
can see reason use web wallet unless you have small amount there.

keeping your bitcoin locally using client your own computer always more secure. 
well ive been playing around with the idea having secure multi sigs implementation tba for while now and been toying around with number different bitcoin clients that currently support transaction some form another. 
and ive had folks with their ideas asto why should have such system place well why they believe not. 
set for debate amongst our users. 
and having heard both sides the argument the overwhelming choice was for favor multi sig integration. 
despite the niggles and constraints presented end user. 
with various bicoin clients out there was wondering what the spread was like and hence the poll. 
maybe you could also drop line two asto why you use prefer the said client over another thatd totally awesome. 
though pretty close having had worked out fine balance for how about without being too complicated some users suggested seemed like know what people out here use their favorite bitcoin client. 
the most convenient way buy bitcoin the usa through coinbase. 
once you link your bank account you can purchase bitcoin with your checking account and receive the bitcoin your coinbase account days. 
coinbase charges fee buy sell bitcoin and customers with verified can buy sell bitcoin per day instantly. 
anyone can use the coinbase wallet but present you need usa bank account buy sell bitcoin. 
com allows you buy bitcoin person from local traders using cash from sellers online and has escrow service built. 
com the mycelium mobile wallet for android has local trader feature built that lets you find local sellers offering bitcoin for person trades using cash. 
cash into coins. 
php new service only that allows you deposit cash your local bank and receive bitcoins about day. 
can bitcoin purchased using paypal yes there are sellers localbitcoins. 
com who accept paypal. 
com buy bitcoins online paypal nho. 
you can also use paypal your credit card purchase bitcoin through the bitcoin insanity. 
for more ways buy bitcoin browse the clearnet list bitcoin wiki. 
wiki buying you will have make your newly purchased bitcoin anonymous using mixing service like bitcoin fog. 
best practice keep separate bitcoin wallet for coins that have been mixed. 
once sent through bitcoin fog the coins can not traced back you. 
why dont just put peace your signiture. 
say all the time. 
sorry keep your head.

this where they say they can see your though the tor section. 
anyone used bizniz from any info discussion would appreciated thanks. 
this brings some credibility theft. 
gox gets robbed anyone else can too. 
from ofl pwmolzg february amuse more privacy friendly exchange like btc with fresh deposit tumbling fog coinjoin shared send but also move into other coins and then tumbling fog coinjoin shared send those other coins and then move back into bitcoin. 
when something like zerocoin comes out for real usage and has market obviously moving and out that would the ultimate method. 
very cool feel like many more ideas here the better. 
this looks good. 
like the wot rating system. 
mpressed the layout well their trust system. 
would feel confident placing order through torescrow. 
howdy blackbanks system takes the commission before starting the escrow transaction. 
the transaction only has single output instead two. 
this way blackbank more than happy allow vendors buyers finalize outside blackbank. 
the only trust issue would blackbank offers support there are problems. 
however that lot less risky than traditional centralized escrow systems and easier for the buyer vendor. 
sure buyer vendor would prioritize verifying that the funds transactions over verifying support. 
however still promise continue support with any issues ive been offering advice and support outside blackbank entirely even members other markets. 
its important help each other the community. 
growing safe and secure community mutually beneficial for everyone regardless immediate financial gain. 
from drguacamole february pmi know the safest pgp but have some friends that wont use. 
maintain decent private communication have testing trying privnote and telegram secret chat mode. 
regarding privnote don really know secure fact have the very feeling that service runned the cia itself that can broken. 
telegram secret mode seems quite strong and secure the way the. 
usd they offer price for the first hacker that could break seems quite convincent. 
what you guys think think anyone who conducts confidential business smartphone taking risks telegram not. 
the industry standard for temporary notes. 
but way replacement for pgp. 
posting here cryptocurrency section too hidden. 
magical tux fatboy fanboy. 
jonwickedfire redacted has joined channelname mode channelname magicaltux magicaltu mtgox staff magicaltux has joined channelname hey mark. 
thanks for coming. 
know youre bit. 
shaken and stressed. 
are you doing okay more less its and tomorrow morning first time have lawyer appointment things couldnt better well not tomorrow but today now yeah youre the future over there japan lol. 
guys are even more the future yeah two places ive wanted visit but cringe the flight time alone. 
just wanted talk you here pressure you dont have answer anything you dont want. 
weve chatted before briefly. 
you know lil something. 
yep and with all what happened yesterday even though knew all that didnt let contacts fox business publish because didnt want see bitcoin gox going flames could salvaged. 
obviously holding that info back and not publishing tumblr leaking docs first allowed someone else stake claim first. 
but you win some you lose some. 
and honestly not fan people posting things that are rumors bullshit not verified just because damages the shit out someone company. 
and really cannot taken back afterwards. 
that crisis strategy draft even legit more less the name suggests its draft and its bunch proposals deal with the issue hand not things that are actually planned and done this said this document was not produced mtgox saw some strategies there that had shared with you but also saw some things there that would have never suggested anyone ever through with would make you look horrible. 
think lot people ignored the draft part. 
was just really surprising see that being leaked. 
you think was leaked someone purposely hurt you personally gox general you think was leaked someone purposely hurt you personally gox general have some doubts heh bet. 
are you stepping down ceo and away from gox too you cant legally disclose then just say cant disclose that yety yet. 
the reason asking because after yesterdays events you removing yourself from the foundation and deleting the twitter account posts and all. 
right away speculation within the bitcoin arena went into hyper chaotic mode and the word the street was that you were closing shop and running away with all their monies and bitcoin. 
how does that make you feel hear see people you bailed out yourself and stood for over the years turn you like that not good mark know youre not one for expressing yourself but heres your chance because you really have stepped before and done things one else ever had. 
probably will again. 
and seems like all has been quickly forgotten and instead youre being labeled the madoff bitcoin. 
were having this chat and youre still japan your apt office and not cave somewhere right look mark you took mtgox and ran with built stuck with and took level one ever thought possible. 
when other exchanges were crippled you stepped and bailed them out absorbed them save the bitcoin market general. 
exchange brought you massive surge customers and press that made you look like the hero the day and then some. 
but what most people forget too was that you werent set handle this from the start. 
were having this chat and youre still japan your apt office and not cave somewhere right home with cat being pain sleeping the keyboard yeah doesnt sound like someone the run with bags money. 
whats the plan now for you and mtgox cant comment that yet alright. 
mostly because doing could compromise our current efforts imgur the simple image sharer cat pushing keyboard pushing the keyboard back the desk you guys are still actively trying save though havent given you could have given and walked away bunch times previously but you always stuck out. 
even though others have closed and walked away why have you continued fight and work and not give giving not part how usually things you want tell your side this bit more like what youve sacrificed given personally have imagine its taken quite toll you. 
well first would guess health what you mean took more than since handling mtgox compensating for stress eating guessing stress from lack sleep too like now. 
heh and drinking liters coca cola how american almost american actually since some people see coca cola being non american lol anyway should try get some sleep already waking hours err one more thing. 
and starting tired pushing keyboard stays the desk you still believe the viability unregulated digital currency like bitcoin tho difficult tbqh the pressure got from banks and governments makes things very hard you think were regulated would make easier work things out partially how well first avoid being blocked banks and governments around the world regulated means that long you follow the regulations youre fine the biggest question people really have asked though are you personally vested mtgox with your own btc and whether not you like everyone else have taken personal hit and are the same boat they are terms taking loss hit from the recent events and whether not you like everyone else have taken personal hit and are the same boat they are terms taking loss hit from the recent events any btc own personally were mtgox how much did you lose yourself well technically speaking its not lost just yet just temporarily unavailable magicaltux magicaltu mtgox staff magicaltux realname mark karpeles channels channelname server calvino. 
net milan account magicaltux end whois well how much unavail for you not even sure guys reddit and wickedfire are running around posting screenshots horror stories about how much bitcoin they have lost from this. 
didnt check wallet before pushing the site offline anyway maybe should sleep now anything else youd like say everyone before all the pissed off people start going nuts even more. 
not really maybe just link something like that why fall gag well well see how this one goes anyway well like chat more but know youre pushing sleep. 
and long you are saying youre not disappearing from this. 
still think you should say something more all these people least reveal how much youve taken hit for personally. 
would show them that you are still their side. 
the way that whole removal from the foundation did you decide leave that before after the chats with them help save gox versus let fail. 
yea was all over the news yesterday all can say. 
been waiting almost weeks withdraw wash coins and now the sites gone down. 
what are the people the know doing about this. 
from blackstar february amyea man sorry.

mean whether btc are seen legit not they were providing service and they have failed that right think too but with fdic insurance they wouldnt have the funds pay back people the coins were stolen. 
like bank not fdic insured may not able pay you back after bank robbery its gon its gone. 
thats the main issue see even was court ordered pay back the btc just simply does not have and guess that would just bankruptcy for him and gox and has live with death threats forever.

this happened hide ass and another vpn which escapes right now.

txt version created len sigclass digest algo begin digest hashed subpkt len sig created version created len sigclass digest algo begin digest hashed subpkt len sig created hashed subpkt len key expires after looks like they represent the date differently and have slight stylistic differences. 
edit wow brain wasnt working. 
the even more important difference that the second key has expiration date. 
the first key good forever. 
always have expiration date your key and always have revocation certificate backed somewhere case your key compromised. 
not sure where they are pulling their btc rate from. 
its also entirely possible that due the rapid fall and expected quick rebound that the devs locked temporarily keep customers from drastically over spending. 
ofc this would have been bad move the rebound had not happened would have put burden back onto vendors but overall cant blame them for doing. 
honestly was probably good move favor the customers the time but since looks like btc going back the rise now that the whole fear gox collapsing over they should put back auto tracking. 
yea and unlike where the theif virtually anonymous fatfuck has worry about more than moving coins around. 
needs worry about moving himself around his are pretty much public record. 
almost feel bad for the guy.

wasnt trying macbook was trying imac with optical drive but was trying boot tails from usb not. 
the proccess fairly complicated. 
there are few methods but the only one got work was installing via command line. 
there are directions the site that explain how this and you can simply copy paste the commands and replace the with the. 
iso compy pasting the command line when asks for its directory. 
for simply would not install this way and was because was missing command that was not the instructions. 
something retarded like dev the end certain command. 
after about hours trying figured this out and got successfully install. 
next you need bootloader because mac has efi loader instead. 
for this they say you need refind which older version refit. 
could not get install because already had refit there with hopes remove. 
when turned computer the usb drive shows but only boots blank screen and goes where. 
after few more hours tinkinering gave. 
from mirage february pmquote from raztafarii february pmwell ive pretty much given this point. 
its really advanced stuff and tech knowledge and skills sort dont that far. 
mirage ive only been able download the required files. 
iso file and another one and the tailssigning. 
key one used verify the. 
the tails signing. 
key when download zipped file which cant unzip error corrupt file file format not supported when try import terminal doesnt work. 
dont know what this stage and this like the first freaking step. 
also apparently you need refit whatever which dont have. 
also buying anything this point isnt rly ideal dunno. 
just might look into. 
maybe ill try upgrade more recent osx have snow leopard. 
never give and you shouldnt even worrying about terminal for now. 
for starters just try burn the. 
iso dvd using disk utility mentioned above. 
then you can worry about verifing and signatures and what not later. 
first things first. 
and you might not even have use reefit just hold down the option key when booting see your list connected drives give try works for only use. 
for legal stuff for number reasons. 
the least which its the last version you dont have download and can have original dvd installation disk. 
well you read the small print the licensing agreement apple didnt join the nsas prizm program until after steve jobs died. 
just went down like that. 
and there are many other good reasons run. 
and nothing after. 
and even better reasons run linux tails ect. 
dont give just yet are all here help try what mentioned above and just lemmie know peacemirageoki thanks for the encouragement wont give yet would get the burning onto the dvd but drive all jacked put itll never coma back out unless manage pull out. 
will usb work really want avoid buying anything extra this point runnin low cash like external drive something. 
shared send gone friend. 
and have been having issues with tails using shared coin simply wont let. 
says loading but nothing working happening the box stays greyish rather than the blue clickable button. 
thought was just. 
from axa february pmquote from blackstar february pmquote from owockeznan february pmyou have make sure that noscript allowing both blockchain. 
info and sharedcoin. 
comalso have noticed you have address that has mupltiple inputs sharedcoin doesnt like them all and tends fail. 
its easier sweep them all into one address and send. 
shit well that would explain perfectly didnt even know sharedcoin was different site rather feature. 
that kinda sucks know how sketch enabling scripts and barely let blockchain. 
com credible like blkchn hopefully the moment shared coin the only credible alternative bitcoin fog. 
know and not nealry good shared send was. 
but think the feds kinda gave kick the pants get that feature removed.

from cooked february pmnow lets look some more practical thingsprivnote isnt stored your computerwhat the fuck normal non criminal person doing with pgp their computer being private why you think there are huge network keyservers sks keyservers. 
net its powerful tool verify identity and secure. 
pgp has been around since. 
there nothing fundementally suspicious about using pgp. 
tails leaves javascript enabled default because they want match the tbb fingerprint closely possible. 
get the tbb fix and tails will change without hesitation. 
org projects torbrowser design. 
net code issues basically tails want look exactly the same tbb web server. 
noscript enabled default tbb tails will change theirs reflect the new design. 
course you could actually build your own tails with javascript turned off. 
there are instructions how roll your own tails the website.

sure buyer vendor would prioritize verifying that the funds transactions over verifying support.

get the buyer send the commission first the market then you can release all public keys allow the buyer and seller feel safer about the transaction. 
and there have. 
solution that doesnt centralise all power with the market. 
from jolly roger february pmquote from ronin february pmi have disagree with this guy the server doesnt give you the opportunity verify the address then its not worth. 
they could give you multi sig that with addresses both controlled the market. 
this opens you obvious scams. 
dont fall for what proposing. 
verify the address and protect yourself from scams. 
first all your accusations about are very offensive. 
accusing that trying get you all fall for something. 
and not think you completely understand the entire process multisignature addresses make the claims you are making. 
how this any more risky than the escrow system that markets had before the markets were controlling the funds and getting robbed and cleaned out several occasions. 
people were placing trust markets before and now suddenly you are worried about getting scammed where were you speaking out with the old escrow system sorry that you feel offended but dont think have said anything below the belt. 
you are proposing multi sig escrow solution which doesnt protect the buyer from rogue markets incompetent developers. 
kind poinltess opionion. 
regarding risk compared previous its the same market could rogue loose all its coins due incompetent devs. 
whats your point you are proposing solution that still exposes users the same problems. 
and its not sudden worry. 
have raised the issue mutli sig way before the debacle. 
take the time through postings this forum and others and you will see have been long term proponent multi sig. 
way beforfe became fashinable. 
from jolly roger february pmquote from ronin february also makes sense for the market hide this the buyer seller wanted avoid fees they could set their own escrow. 
also the situation jolly roger describes above the buyer could sign transaction sending all funds vendor and then vendor verifies and also signs the transaction. 
funds released market bypassed. 
the market not protected. 
yes they buyer and seller could set their own escrow outside the market but this would stupid because having makes possible for the market become the arbitrator. 
only one the people involved has scammer and then the funds are locked forever. 
with the buyer tries scam then the market can provide the second key unlock the funds send the seller. 
this why better than. 
also the case the market cannot bypassed without the redeemscript generated the time that the multisignature address created. 
the market holds the redeemscript multisignature address then the buyer and seller cannot complete the transaction the side without the market and therefore cut out the markets fees. 
another security issue with releasing all public keys involved that lets the participants know whether not the seller buyer server are reusing private key and therefore making them more susceptible attacks. 
doesnt benefit the scammer financially pull scam. 
which removes most the motive. 
agree better but not the market doesnt allow the buyer vendor confirm the address you are proposing. 
wouldnt touch market that insists hiding the details the address from you. 
its too open abuse incompetence. 
agreed the redeem script. 
but the market cant really withold the script someone can generate themselves from the original inputs. 
dont think its security issue the buyer vendor can see the market reusing the same keys. 
this would excellent way people being able ascertain the market coded incompetent. 
from jolly roger february pmquote from ronin february the market would rely getting income through signing transaction which sends most funds vendor and commision market. 
this would then signed the buyer when happy. 
the buyer starts bypassing the market fee transaction then banned. 
but hide all away from the user and not give them the ability able verify addresses avoid this market set. 
its not healthy. 
harder verify you might think see the buyer and seller are closing the deal the side. 
unless the market constantly searching through the blockchain for funds spent from that multisignature address would extremely difficult verify that buyer and seller are bypassing the market cut out their fees. 
dont see the issue here. 
what difficult about this exactly anyone running the bitcond client always getting every transaction. 
the databse holding transactions could checked for transactions once week that are older than one month. 
any such transaction which has the funds removed from the address would flagged having done deal outside the market. 
could probably write bash script this fairly quickly. 
missing something here what the difficulty from jolly roger february pmquote from ronin february pmi would warn anyone away from the setup jolly roger promoting. 
will lead more scams the future and will not allow you verify multi sig setup correctly. 
what you are basically saying here that the market should trust the buyers but the buyers should not trust the market. 
the market has every incentive keep the ability unlock funds itself out its own hands that not target for hackers. 
the market has the ability unlock the funds without any buyer seller input would make the market very dangerous and this not desirable and defeats the purpose for the markets. 
but giving out the keys and the redeemscript the buyer and seller gives them the ability close the deal outside the market and bypass fees. 
again you are not able trust your market then yes contact the seller and say you want with your seller outside the market and you can easily set one. 
but with fees average bypassing the fees will become more common than you think and harder detect than you think. 
especially when you are dealing with thousands transactions. 
ronin understand what you are saying and you make valid point that would likely desirable for buyer have this setup. 
but not desireable for market have this setup since the market relies market fees and giving your customers the ability cut you out the deal bad for business. 
there are plenty free and multisignature services out there now that you can use. 
you are not comfortable using the markets system then use another one that gives you the public keys. 
but you expect the markets start giving you the ability bypass their commissions then you will likely never happy. 
not think makes sense for markets this. 
the cost running market high and allowing your buyers not pay their taxes speak dumb move for the market. 
you not trust your market outside the market. 
you make the choice. 
think has already been shown that markets suffer from fraudulent owners incompetent developers. 
not saying markets shouldnt charge fee. 
but also not proposing solution that offers benefits unless you abolutely trust the markets honesty and development abiity which recent events have shown arent good bet. 
think this benefits everyone involved. 
while hear what you are saying about maintaining the dominance markets and that users should trust them with multi sig respectfully disagree think its appalling setup and will only lead more scams and hacks. 
sovles nothing and doesnt move towards trustless system. 
from blackstar february amyea man sorry. 
hopefully there some legal recouse that can implemented lean them pay coins back. 
not sure they all got stolen what. 
wouldnt suprise the feds didnt have ahand. 
seems like more and more coins are going missing into wallets that are sitting still. 
know how bad the feds want btc gone. 
who knows though. 
genuinely sorry for all involved gox. 
read somewhere where btc had been stolen from mtgox and they never told anyone. 
legal tax paying business surely there aduty care and reimbursement here. 
mean whether btc are seen legit not they were providing service and they have failed that right. 
dont think its any excuse for its dark net site security the biggest issue. 
course for mtgox but fucking hell you dont expect darknet market vulnerable thats the whole point doing illegal activity online security. 
until gox comes back online nothing can done. 
have feeling that they disabled registration help deal with all the users whose bitcoins were already missing due the negative balance bug the users whose bitcoins not show pending and other users who will not getting repaid. 
from lila february pmif you read carefully says that they can view your real address. 
justa heads upof course they can any vpn can. 
however airvpn the only paid vpn aware that has procedure that does hide your true from their server providing true vpn over tor see. 
org tor for details. 
from lila february amthis where they say they can see your though the tor sectionfrom the airvpn link noted before using airvpn with torworking configuration tested tor browser bundle openvpn. 
after you have downloaded and launched tor browser bundle connect airvpn with socks proxy option activated. 
you can this either with airvpn client with the proper option menu member access without our client. 
select socks proxy type the combo box the bottom the page. 
parameters socks proxy. 
port you use the configuration generator dont forget download the archive air. 
zip copy all the files inside and paste them into the openvpn configuration directory. 
advantages additional privacy layer our vpn server will not see your real address but the the tor exit node option connect web sites under tor protection even those sites which refuse tor connections usage tor even the programs which dont support access tor from all the applications transparently need configure each application one one avoidance any traffic discrimination from tor exit nodes packets are still encrypted when they pass through tor exit node major security layer the event you pass through compromised malicious tor exit node packets are still encrypted when they pass through the tor exit node disadvantages poor performance nfi airvpn respected provider. 
sure you know this but ill mention anyway. 
info very javascript heavy you need enabled for that site. 
dont use tails just the tor browser bundle. 
here expereince with shared send blockchain. 
info since was modified use sharedcoin. 
com several weeks ago. 
can very slow. 
the little popup that happens when you start transaction can take long time complete. 
sometimes will not complete. 
when the transaction initiated will take longer confirm than standard transaction. 
sometimes couple hours. 
sometimes full day. 
rather than shared send vendor now have separate wallet blockchain. 
info that shared send. 
keep some btc there that when want use can transfer directly from there vendor. 
that way not concerned with the reliability time for shared send. 
has anyone been having problems with their tails freezing while they try shared coin send there way can avoid this the future.

the different torescrow threads have now been merged. 
unforeseen future nestled somewhere victims warnings signs slayer. 
any you guys want start bitcoin exchange with can all split half billion dollars. 
yeah bitcoin money torrent download. 
not centralized which means instead running one server which shut down would the end running upon computers and servers order for shut down you would need shut down every computer running aka the whole internet. 
this precisely how the next generation darkent markets need designed. 
like man aint movement all just secret place buy and sell stuff. 
and like any other marketplace the planet they cant properly manage the folks property worse they cant keep their hands out the cookie jar then theyve failed being market and will wither away with all the other frauds. 
here another tip. 
you have foil bags and want ship something that will smell you can use pvc pipe. 
get anything from larger than that and gets very heavy. 
look for thinwall. 
get end caps and the glue. 
put your goods the pipe section you cut off glue the end caps and wait bit for them dry. 
you now have odor proof container send out and wont set off any metal detectors either. 
made the cryptocurrency sub its own sub opposed child board now feel free move this over there you want. 
from albert february amalso drop line two asto why you use prefer the said client over another thatd totally awesomei use few other things too but for this conversation preference seems around these kryptokit. 
from cooked february amas its huge ass nigga file and anused itself then fucked mac dont like spending computer only have fucked albert from evilgrin february ambitcoin also messed computer and dont like the idea the client having store the entire blockchain computer. 
info because pretty damn simple and has never given problems. 
great feedbacks people. 
just what was looking for. 
got very little hands experience with bitcoinqt but gather its just python based gui for the bash based bitcoind program but with limited features. 
but interesting know that its messed your computers sure wasnt something else and yes youre right requires bitcoind updated the lastest blockchain and synced all function which about gigs now from axa february pmbitcoin and armory exactly that. 
many users like having the whole blockchain available them but that problem for you use lightweight wallet like electrum. 
careful with web wallets they have been hacked before. 
keeping your bitcoin locally using client your own computer always more secure. 
unfortunately armory doesnt support multi sigs just yet but definitely agree its the most secure offline wallet program out there and therefore use for the markets cold storage. 
comes two flavors online and offline and unlike the online version which requires good ram the offline version can run and most folks use old rusty which doesnt require internet. 
ideal for offline storage. 
from missjones february pmagree. 
the most secure web wallets atm are blockchain. 
info and coinbase. 
coinbase keeps over bitcoin cold storage and moves users hot wallet needed. 
correct wrong looked into trying out the coinbase api for multisigs and they only support transactions upto couple hundred dollars day without dox anything above and for larger transactions requires verified account. 
should forward them ssn from ronin february pmweb wallets can secure they are fully client side but you take the risk that the javascript not malicious unless you verify everytime. 
electrum crap for signing multisigs. 
give and you will see what mean. 
other than transfering coins multi sig address isnt multi sig compliant. 
the server can then link your addresses and potentially deanonoymise you. 
bitcoind you have the whole blockchain one can link nothing you. 
albert one thing would say though allow people able verify the multi sig address legit giving them the public keys needed recreate. 
markets and vendors buyer will already have his own key. 
pointless have multi sig the user cant generate the address themselves and verify legit. 
some pretty awesome and important points. 
well yes the clients would generating their own key pairs pub and priv keys for precisely that. 
such verify transactions then broadcast them well for vendors later redeem them. 
the idea have this done pretty simple steps. 
from missjones february pmquote from axa february pmsecurity bitcoin depends the blockchain being held full many people. 
bitcoin and armory exactly that. 
however given enough copies the blockchain one can assume the system secure from the data being lost and rely other nodes provide the information require when need. 
many users like having the whole blockchain available them but that problem for you use lightweight wallet like electrum. 
all the wallets available only armory and electrum only need backed once ever. 
careful with web wallets they have been hacked before.

can see reason use web wallet unless you have small amount there.

well ive been playing around with the idea having secure multi sigs implementation tba for while now and been toying around with number different bitcoin clients that currently support transaction some form another. 
and ive had folks with their ideas asto why should have such system place well why they believe not. 
set for debate amongst our users. 
and having heard both sides the argument the overwhelming choice was for favor multi sig integration. 
despite the niggles and constraints presented end user. 
with various bicoin clients out there was wondering what the spread was like and hence the poll. 
maybe you could also drop line two asto why you use prefer the said client over another thatd totally awesome. 
though pretty close having had worked out fine balance for how about without being too complicated some users suggested seemed like know what people out here use their favorite bitcoin client. 
the most convenient way buy bitcoin the usa through coinbase. 
once you link your bank account you can purchase bitcoin with your checking account and receive the bitcoin your coinbase account days. 
coinbase charges fee buy sell bitcoin and customers with verified can buy sell bitcoin per day instantly. 
anyone can use the coinbase wallet but present you need usa bank account buy sell bitcoin. 
com allows you buy bitcoin person from local traders using cash from sellers online and has escrow service built. 
com the mycelium mobile wallet for android has local trader feature built that lets you find local sellers offering bitcoin for person trades using cash. 
cash into coins. 
php new service only that allows you deposit cash your local bank and receive bitcoins about day. 
can bitcoin purchased using paypal yes there are sellers localbitcoins.

you can also use paypal your credit card purchase bitcoin through the bitcoin insanity. 
for more ways buy bitcoin browse the clearnet list bitcoin wiki. 
wiki buying you will have make your newly purchased bitcoin anonymous using mixing service like bitcoin fog. 
best practice keep separate bitcoin wallet for coins that have been mixed. 
once sent through bitcoin fog the coins can not traced back you. 
why dont just put peace your signiture.

this where they say they can see your though the tor section. 
anyone used bizniz from any info discussion would appreciated thanks. 
this brings some credibility theft. 
gox gets robbed anyone else can too. 
from ofl pwmolzg february amuse more privacy friendly exchange like btc with fresh deposit tumbling fog coinjoin shared send but also move into other coins and then tumbling fog coinjoin shared send those other coins and then move back into bitcoin. 
when something like zerocoin comes out for real usage and has market obviously moving and out that would the ultimate method. 
very cool feel like many more ideas here the better. 
this looks good. 
like the wot rating system. 
mpressed the layout well their trust system. 
would feel confident placing order through torescrow. 
howdy blackbanks system takes the commission before starting the escrow transaction. 
the transaction only has single output instead two. 
this way blackbank more than happy allow vendors buyers finalize outside blackbank. 
the only trust issue would blackbank offers support there are problems. 
however that lot less risky than traditional centralized escrow systems and easier for the buyer vendor. 
sure buyer vendor would prioritize verifying that the funds transactions over verifying support.

maintain decent private communication have testing trying privnote and telegram secret chat mode.

telegram secret mode seems quite strong and secure the way the. 
usd they offer price for the first hacker that could break seems quite convincent. 
what you guys think think anyone who conducts confidential business smartphone taking risks telegram not. 
the industry standard for temporary notes. 
but way replacement for pgp. 
posting here cryptocurrency section too hidden. 
magical tux fatboy fanboy. 
jonwickedfire redacted has joined channelname mode channelname magicaltux magicaltu mtgox staff magicaltux has joined channelname hey mark. 
thanks for coming. 
know youre bit. 
shaken and stressed. 
are you doing okay more less its and tomorrow morning first time have lawyer appointment things couldnt better well not tomorrow but today now yeah youre the future over there japan lol. 
guys are even more the future yeah two places ive wanted visit but cringe the flight time alone. 
just wanted talk you here pressure you dont have answer anything you dont want. 
weve chatted before briefly. 
you know lil something. 
yep and with all what happened yesterday even though knew all that didnt let contacts fox business publish because didnt want see bitcoin gox going flames could salvaged. 
obviously holding that info back and not publishing tumblr leaking docs first allowed someone else stake claim first. 
but you win some you lose some. 
and honestly not fan people posting things that are rumors bullshit not verified just because damages the shit out someone company. 
and really cannot taken back afterwards. 
that crisis strategy draft even legit more less the name suggests its draft and its bunch proposals deal with the issue hand not things that are actually planned and done this said this document was not produced mtgox saw some strategies there that had shared with you but also saw some things there that would have never suggested anyone ever through with would make you look horrible. 
think lot people ignored the draft part. 
was just really surprising see that being leaked. 
you think was leaked someone purposely hurt you personally gox general you think was leaked someone purposely hurt you personally gox general have some doubts heh bet. 
are you stepping down ceo and away from gox too you cant legally disclose then just say cant disclose that yety yet. 
the reason asking because after yesterdays events you removing yourself from the foundation and deleting the twitter account posts and all. 
right away speculation within the bitcoin arena went into hyper chaotic mode and the word the street was that you were closing shop and running away with all their monies and bitcoin. 
how does that make you feel hear see people you bailed out yourself and stood for over the years turn you like that not good mark know youre not one for expressing yourself but heres your chance because you really have stepped before and done things one else ever had. 
probably will again. 
and seems like all has been quickly forgotten and instead youre being labeled the madoff bitcoin. 
were having this chat and youre still japan your apt office and not cave somewhere right look mark you took mtgox and ran with built stuck with and took level one ever thought possible. 
when other exchanges were crippled you stepped and bailed them out absorbed them save the bitcoin market general. 
exchange brought you massive surge customers and press that made you look like the hero the day and then some. 
but what most people forget too was that you werent set handle this from the start. 
were having this chat and youre still japan your apt office and not cave somewhere right home with cat being pain sleeping the keyboard yeah doesnt sound like someone the run with bags money. 
whats the plan now for you and mtgox cant comment that yet alright. 
mostly because doing could compromise our current efforts imgur the simple image sharer cat pushing keyboard pushing the keyboard back the desk you guys are still actively trying save though havent given you could have given and walked away bunch times previously but you always stuck out. 
even though others have closed and walked away why have you continued fight and work and not give giving not part how usually things you want tell your side this bit more like what youve sacrificed given personally have imagine its taken quite toll you. 
well first would guess health what you mean took more than since handling mtgox compensating for stress eating guessing stress from lack sleep too like now. 
heh and drinking liters coca cola how american almost american actually since some people see coca cola being non american lol anyway should try get some sleep already waking hours err one more thing. 
and starting tired pushing keyboard stays the desk you still believe the viability unregulated digital currency like bitcoin tho difficult tbqh the pressure got from banks and governments makes things very hard you think were regulated would make easier work things out partially how well first avoid being blocked banks and governments around the world regulated means that long you follow the regulations youre fine the biggest question people really have asked though are you personally vested mtgox with your own btc and whether not you like everyone else have taken personal hit and are the same boat they are terms taking loss hit from the recent events and whether not you like everyone else have taken personal hit and are the same boat they are terms taking loss hit from the recent events any btc own personally were mtgox how much did you lose yourself well technically speaking its not lost just yet just temporarily unavailable magicaltux magicaltu mtgox staff magicaltux realname mark karpeles channels channelname server calvino. 
net milan account magicaltux end whois well how much unavail for you not even sure guys reddit and wickedfire are running around posting screenshots horror stories about how much bitcoin they have lost from this. 
didnt check wallet before pushing the site offline anyway maybe should sleep now anything else youd like say everyone before all the pissed off people start going nuts even more. 
not really maybe just link something like that why fall gag well well see how this one goes anyway well like chat more but know youre pushing sleep. 
and long you are saying youre not disappearing from this. 
still think you should say something more all these people least reveal how much youve taken hit for personally. 
would show them that you are still their side. 
the way that whole removal from the foundation did you decide leave that before after the chats with them help save gox versus let fail. 
yea was all over the news yesterday all can say. 
been waiting almost weeks withdraw wash coins and now the sites gone down. 
what are the people the know doing about this. 
from blackstar february amyea man sorry. 
hopefully there some legal recouse that can implemented lean them pay coins back. 
not sure they all got stolen what. 
wouldnt suprise the feds didnt have ahand. 
seems like more and more coins are going missing into wallets that are sitting still. 
know how bad the feds want btc gone. 
who knows though. 
genuinely sorry for all involved gox. 
omg was thinking this minutes ago. 
what they are just hoarding all the coins one offline wallet till the can just ruin the rate bitcoin. 
yea man sorry. 
hopefully there some legal recouse that can implemented lean them pay coins back. 
not sure they all got stolen what.

had some coin there day trade with which pretty easy profit from volatile market like gox when you can see the order book and know when the spikes would happen. 
never bothered leave aml trail because was easy enough withdraw profits btc sell localbitcoins. 
now appears shit out luck for rest stuck there. 
from bandcamp february amquote from blackstar february amyea man sorry.

not sure they all got stolen what. 
wouldnt suprise the feds didnt have ahand. 
seems like more and more coins are going missing into wallets that are sitting still. 
know how bad the feds want btc gone. 
who knows though. 
genuinely sorry for all involved gox. 
read somewhere where btc had been stolen from mtgox and they never told anyone. 
heard that too that number astronomical for none the reddit skript kiddies see that trail coins the blockchain. 
but also heard was because transaction maleablity and apperantly that not possibility from what others with knowledge have posted about the topic after the hack. 
wish knew enough figure out but don even know how spell and too lazy look. 
from wrathmore february amas legal tax paying business surely there aduty care and reimbursement here. 
mean whether btc are seen legit not they were providing service and they have failed that right think too but with fdic insurance they wouldnt have the funds pay back people the coins were stolen. 
like bank not fdic insured may not able pay you back after bank robbery its gon its gone. 
thats the main issue see even was court ordered pay back the btc just simply does not have and guess that would just bankruptcy for him and gox and has live with death threats forever.

otr can used with nearly any transport. 
otr likely the most secure way youll have messaging for while. 
bitcoin also messed computer and dont like the idea the client having store the entire blockchain computer. 
info because pretty damn simple and has never given problems. 
however know will have sacrafice conveinience for security and happy. 
unfortunetly not all people will feel that way quite possibly the majority. 
ready try wallet that supports mst and will have soon can explain how works all the. 
web wallets can secure they are fully client side but you take the risk that the javascript not malicious unless you verify everytime. 
prefer bitcoind over electrum for reasons electrum crap for signing multisigs. 
give and you will see what mean. 
other than transfering coins multi sig address isnt multi sig compliant. 
bitcoind has the whole blockchain. 
electrum requests the data for addresses sends server. 
the server can then link your addresses and potentially deanonoymise you. 
bitcoind you have the whole blockchain one can link nothing you. 
having said that electrum obviously more convenient and space saving. 
have been working plugin for trying fix multi sig signing electrum but havent had much time devote this would have liked recently. 
but will continue and hopefully have out before electrum fix albert one thing would say though allow people able verify the multi sig address legit giving them the public keys needed recreate. 
markets and vendors buyer will already have his own key. 
pointless have multi sig the user cant generate the address themselves and verify legit. 
from jolly roger february pmquote from patrick february amtrue but there are lots vpn services which advertises itself providers who doesnt keep any logs all. 
the event this true wouldnt this solution safe one after all the feds goes the vpn provider but its dead end there. 
yes but this case vpn discovered hosting somebody interest then they can forced court order keep logs. 
this happened hide ass and another vpn which escapes right now. 
just remember that nobody will jail for you.

the even more important difference that the second key has expiration date.

founded shakil khan who heavily invested bitpay take bitpay related news with grain salt. 
they certainly keep touch with many important bitcoiners the american community and have good track record publishing rumors that are later revealed correct. 
this article source believes karpeles was involved arbitrage attempts something that has long been suspected further allegationsmt. 
gox has allegedly never conducted single audit its customer deposits and believed that karpeles may have been the only one within the company have knowledge how actually tap the exchange cold storage. 
remains unclear exactly how this type storage leak could have happened over multi year period without any knowledge the part the executives. 
result karpeles apparent wizard status within the organization also appears unlikely that the true technical cause the leak will fully understood until the embattled ceo speaks. 
whether that will happen during interview possible criminal case unclear. 
the latter seems likely however one source believes that karpeles knew about the pervasive damage the transaction malleability attacks for several weeks and was engaging arbitrage scheme that leveraged the depressed.

this was allegedly happening well before the exchange breaking point this past weekend.

peace outalthough haven't verified myself and you likely don't even recognize under this nym can assure you this the real deal just look the approved vendor list for all the assurance you need vendors like that don't just hop into new markets like this doing bit verification first.

after looking some interesting forum posts courtesy gwern and doing some discreet googling the grand wizard may not know exactly who was responsible for the scam. 
but reasonably certain that vlad bitcoin scammer and thief friendly with identical limetless either part the game knows exactly who. 
know beyond reasonable doubt that vlad identity open secret the bitcoin community. 
also know that least one anglo nigerian living london knows who limetless and some circumstantial evidence which makes suspect strongly that vlad and limetless are the same person. 
and talented amateur like the grand wizard can find this with minutes digging you can expect leo did the same research and came with the same conclusions.

from cxm february ami would expect this post have advice buying your coins anonymous fashion. 
that order for leo convict you they need all the pieces the following person purchased btc with method same person then transfered said purchased btc and transferred for illegal purposes person was taken into custody with evidence the illegal activities. 
steps and are the ones most thought about and are dealt with coin washing and pgp encryption address among other things ensuring safe delivery. 
think this post should emphasize point and the options for buying btc here are mostly ones that can trace the purchase directly back individual. 
credit card bank account. 
endorse finding ways purchase the btc using cash transfer the most anonymous fashion possible. 
for instance have seen listings localbitcoin. 
com for cash the mail transfers however one must have high level trust said vendor for this viable option. 
another localbitcoin trick the other online payment optioin where you purchase something like greendot card cash grocery store convenience store and then upload images said card and reciept showing was purchased cash. 
you choose this option vital that you know the metadata the images you will sending not send images taken cell phone sure there accurate time location data retrievable from the image. 
this can accomplished through function tails you could upload the images imgur and then use those images for the transfer. 
since most vendors who work this way request image the receipt well highly suggest using pen marker remove all location time identification from the receirpt. 
fold hide the label the store you purchased from write over the letters and numbers that could used identifiable information. 
finally when you purchase the cash coin intermediary. 
vanilla reload card suggest you wear heavy clothing such that images your face can taken while you purchase the card. 
hoddie and sun glasses and something cover your chin gloves dont hurt either. 
also suggest you purchase cards from more than one location this makes more difficult isolate where the purchases are taking place. 
remember always act you are already compromised leo. 
extra step precautions would suggest parking your car little ways aways from the purchase location that cameras could get picture you entering your car and getting your license plate number. 
the only better way buy coin buy cash from friend yours with decent stock pile then there are traces whatsoever. 
this way leo ever does hit you with scenario being caught with evidence illegal activity they will not able add extra charges that would possible they can trace the purchase all the way back the purchase the btc. 
washing your coins important early and alot but there another step before washing the coins that can just important washing the coins and that anonymous purchase the coins. 
please anyone give feedback this post identify ways improve the anonymity purchasing coins anonymously. 
also you have some spare coin donate alfred. 
this site awesome and want stick around just much erowid. 
orgmost folks already realize that using bitcoin mixing service essential and recommended for security even you purchase bitcoin locally with cash. 
becoming more difficult purchase bitcoin without providing identity information which will taint your coins and make possible track the use back you keep separate bitcoin wallet for clean coins. 
send all your newly purchased bitcoin through bitcoin fog with delivery your clean wallet and you are good. 
com unilateral statement regarding gox insider not often you get see ceo speak freely. 
the guy clearly passionate about bitcoin hopefully his exchange can overcome their latest banking woes. 
can help but angry and frustrated and depressed. 
all the hard work done bring bitcoin the mainstream and now this and the people. 
look was supposed write some lawyer approved statement about how kraken kicks ass and super secure and compliant and payward leading the charge data and all the great things doing right. 
from sunwu february amquote from red february amsunwu dont think just speculation. 
you have the leaders thier industry making statement public regarding thembeing insolvent read their corporate plan looks very legit. 
com doc mtgox situation crisis strategy drafti agree very much looks that way that crisis draft shows signs authenticity all though with regard mtgox being liable under law for the bitcoins. 
its very new subject sure might possible reclaim some which will undoubtedly take very long time more likely they will declare sorry derail but where might find you vending others see sunwu has not logged for bit anyone can answer this would think you very kind indeed. 
have some empathy but please not forget the fact you are reporter. 
not have exposed your common information poor protocol immature just opinion. 
place like localbitcoins. 
they put coins escrow until deal finished. 
just did deal with dude china and got coins minutes. 
you can see there feedback and everything. 
well have one these for agora links figured better get this going before the link spam ensues. 
against the rules the hub spam referral links the open forum please limit them your signatures and this thread. 
ill kick this off heres mine. 
php register fba. 
wish agora would spend the time explain their referral program the way you just did for yours. 
first let say excited announce one more market which customers may find. 
the doors are open come and get some. 
second let say thanks for the opportunity albert and sorry for ruffling your feathers the other day. 
something site wallet asked support and the told becasue its below the minimum. 
important silk road has removed escrow. 
customer support non existent. 
due recent events silk road has removed the security escrow from its market. 
orders are now set auto finalize leaving buyers the mercy vendors. 
make matters worse there currently customer support from site staff staff continue direct full attention the market itself. 
disputes can still opened but responses are far not forthcoming. 
what does this mean this means that buyers are completely the hands vendors. 
vendors are free claim packages have been dispatched and without staff intervention there can way settling the dispute. 
its advisable avoid the market the current state but you must use silk road please only deal with vendors you recognise that can researched thoroughly. 
delete this seems pointless but growing numbers users especially new users are ignorant the state silk road the moment and only become aware once theyve placed order. 
this stops one user being scammed then its worked.

heya welcome abroad tba and worries mate long its great feedback constructive criticism totally dont mind all only helps improve.

hope tba delivers everything you expect off great marketplace. 
from stingray february heres theory based that evidence. 
think was indeed hacked and some funds were stolen. 
think defcunt saw the coins vanishing and shutdown bitcoind. 
after this think realized his database was total mess and could not fix decided steal all the coins and blamed the hacker for everything. 
you havent noticed peoples balances are fucked and there are people who have pending balance. 
thats very good theory. 
were thinking the same thing but wanted post all our physical evidence first. 
but that good point because lot users including have had their entire wallet stolen after having nothing escrow. 
very possible that defon someone else behind the scene dpr stexo realised what was going with the hack knew that their coding was totally fucked since they cloned from. 
gox and just decided take the rest for themselves. 
there very strong possibility that that occured and our investigation will likely head that direction later. 
but for now want try and stay impartial hard that just providing the physical evidence have obtained far. 
people can decide for themselves. 
but that seems pretty good conclusion. 
there are two types people the darknet. 
fanboys and those that heavily dislike fanboys. 
this thread for the people the latter group who enjoy reading some the stupidity that shat onto the forums daily basis. 
post any good comments you find and think deserve requote here. 
this laugh nothing more leave your somebody think the children idiocy out. 
get the thread going will awarding. 
bitcoin the person who posts the best fanboy. 
just copy and paste the well the link the page can verify.

cyprus has long been attractive offshore financial hub. 
their economy based the finance sector and tourism but the gfc did come knockin unfortunately with the citizens left involuntarily foot the bill. 
bailout agreement reached with meant that the countrys second biggest bank froze accounts that the gov could take out the money from all uninsured accounts well other measures hostile the interests the people. 
this was the catalyst for bail bitcoin due people wanting protect their wealth from their own government. 
the bitcoin price shot drastically from highs before were all course. 
cyprus have long been well educated when comes finance surprise see many cypriots calling for cyprus become the worlds first bitcoin hub. 
they realize that there are huge advantages for the country that jumps first. 
the initial meteoric rise the price bitcoin that they would holding the time just one tantalizing prospect for country become hub for bitcoin would also huge win for bitcoin not just for the initial rise value there also the perceived legitimacy that comes with entire country getting behind. 
and once bitcoin has country and their banks heavily invested the exchange bitcoins for fiat will much easier there would host new exchanges popping out cyprus without the banking limits the current exchanges are plagued with. 
cyprus also has the first university accept bitcoin for fee payments and offer course cryptocurrency. 
recently the worlds first bitcoin bank was opened cyprus. 
this will help foster widespread adoption country where people are little more openminded when comes bitcoin. 
com bank like bitcoin portal neo opens first branch cyprus. 
com the central bank cyprus has been more favorable bitcoin lately. 
com bitcoin legal says central bank cyprus. 
from evilgrin february pmthis precisely how the next generation darkent markets need designed. 
our experience was the few initial orders there were fine then required support transaction and was day reply from support and our issue was not resolved. 
agreed percent refund the buyer and kept the bitcoins buyer was out. 
usd because this action. 
lost small portion too. 
will not vend dls market anymore they have flaws little support and deceitful practices. 
edit update received and emailing stating every was resolved was not funds were never released. 
from february amalso the perceived legitimacy that comes with entire country getting behind itsensational. 
just add this admin are preparing status update the situation over the next couple days which should add clarity the situation. 
keep eye the main board over the latter half the weekend. 
for the people who vote yes please add some details know the votes arent padded. 
you dont have include particulars. 
very much agree. 
ill you when get chance. 
strange when everybody wants know much possible about everything and everyone while are sharing tips and tutorials how stay anonymous tor hidden services. 
have affiliation with any market just clear. 
but its annoying see personal info posted left and right. 
would you like somebody that you. 
what goes around comes around. 
stay safe all. 
really not have definitive answer for you because nobody agrees this. 
the kind person who needle haystack type that likes blend with the crowd. 
mirage likes his her obfuscated bridges. 
axa likes his her vpn tor. 
you will never get everyone come together this never ending debate. 
find one that you feel best about. 
sorry for the lack answer. 
just joined here. 
tried posting this forum but ended with karma couple hours. 
hopefully people will more receptive constructive here. 
love but some customers suck dick suggest using expresscoin cashforcoin. 
they offer several methods for acquiring coins one which sending usps money order. 
buy money order does not require and costs less than like for every money order. 
this means you can purchase several thousand dollars worth money orders different post offices very short period and keep returning them. 
benefits using money orders are that banks not see large transactions. 
you can take your money from selling and turn right into bitcoins. 
intermediary bank involved. 
also your name not the money order. 
now these sites require you send picture with the money order. 
this does not seem like the largest deal though. 
most resourceful people should able come with valid from several different people not themself. 
mean jesus just pay some junkies piece for pictures their and hour you will have ids. 
just take picture print that shit and mail off with your money order. 
you also need email them copy pictures and money order. 
wipe exif data and you are bueno. 
they will keep this file they are money transfer service but will never get that far. 
why you ask because you arent dumbass and you mixed your coins course fallbacks are necessary though. 
suggest tumbling mixing whatever twice before depositing into any market wallet. 
this redundancy will cost only very small percentage and the time you are done possible get money into your marketplace wallet for only more than market value quantities. 
here how this all looks expresscoin wallet mixing wallet mixing marketplacebad scenario they track coins wallet. 
worse scenario they track coins wallet. 
they track back wallet entirely your fault. 
but say this happens. 
now sees comes from expresscoin and subpoenas them. 
finds record with that isnt you but they will follow that person. 
what does this mean well for means lot work. 
they now need prove ownership each wallet the person whose. 
apocalypse scenario they are able prove ownership each wallet the same person. 
dont know how this apocalypse scenario would happen but not the most savvy person either. 
this happens the person whose could get visit from police but most likely not. 
say this point the person drops your name. 
certainly seems short grounds for warrant think they would probably knock and talk police stop without warrant try get you say something that grounds for warrant. 
police show your door. 
hey muttley have you linked illegal purchases online. 
need talk you about this downtown. 
sorry officer wouldnt know anything about that. 
sounds like some crazy shit though. 
hope you officers have good day. 
bye bye now. 
and that where ends. 
the only downside your person with the compromised you can never again use your own address receive anything and will need use someone catch packages for you from then. 
impossible get the level police ever showing you mix coins properly. 
there are sufficient number failsafes though for use this method with regularity and large amounts. 
certain steps need taken though prevent expresscoin similar services from getting suspicious though not order from multiple ids and send them all the same time from the same location. 
stagger few days possible. 
make sure the ids are not all from the same location you live small town. 
orders for two thousand bucks piece within week from the middle kansas will raise eyebrows. 
vary amounts slightly. 
time think this isnt huge deal. 
any input suggestions. 
would expect this post have advice buying your coins anonymous fashion.
