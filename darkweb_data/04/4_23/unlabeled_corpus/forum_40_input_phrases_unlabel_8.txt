its harder exploit the browser without javascript but its nowhere near impossible. 
off the top head font rendering and image handling are two less areas where ive seen usable exploits for firefox etc. 
that was the one was looking for but couldnt find. 
and true there are much easier ways find out what you are encrypting than breaking the encryption. 
brute force useless dont even see why its used example. 
from thedude march amquote from rounded march pmi have character strong password and full disk encryption. 
you need least strong. 
dude while realize that your intent was humorous you nevertheless raise excellent question even only inference just how many characters you need secure the subject passwords and passphrases has been discussed considerable detail over the last two decades. 
let attempt boil things down were one the most fundamental concepts information theory that order versus randomness. 
order for message meaningful must contain some information meaning that has both structure well content. 
for example beautiful day today the sky blue the birds are singing. 
the above string sentence has structure has both order and meaning. 
usmgjtins ozp axmwz utcsb jlcm eowi pxov glwin contrast this string has structure has neither order nor meaning essentially random noise. 
the object cryptography take the first string characters english sentence and using some method usually based mathematical function transform into something resembling the second random string characters order keep the information out the hands unauthorized persons. 
over the centuries variety methods have been devised accomplish this one the more common use today the cipher. 
cipher method usually based mathematical principles functions for transforming data into apparent gibberish. 
some the most common ciphers use today pgp are aes the advanced encryption standard triple des often abbreviated des cast and idea. 
the strength ciphers and passphrases are frequently expressed bits thus have variants the aes cipher aes aes and aes where the keys used these ciphers are bits bits and bits respectively. 
other ciphers used pgp are also bit idea and cast. 
exception des bits. 
ciphers bits more are considered unbreakable brute force attack. 
here interesting note from pgps jon callas describing the difficulty cracking modern bit ciphers quotemodern cryptographic systems are essentially unbreakable particularly adversary restricted intercepts. 
have argued for designed and built systems with bits security precisely because they are essentially unbreakable. 
very easy underestimate the power exponentials. 
very big number. 
burt kaliski first came with this and had nickel for every time tell could buy latte three. 
imagine computer that the size grain sand that can test keys against some encrypted data. 
also imagine that can test key the amount time takes light cross. 
then consider cluster these computers many that you covered the earth with them they would cover the whole planet the height meter. 
the cluster computers would crack bit key average years. 
you want brute force key literally takes planet ful computers. 
and course there are always bit keys you worry about the possibility that government has spare planet that they want devote key cracking. 
passphrase with bits more entropy would appear ideal. 
now have deal with the question how determine how much entropy passphrase certain length thankfully the calculations this are pretty. 
one the most frequently misleading assertions about passwords that they must include special characters. 
this may may not necessary depending the length the password were discussing. 
general rule the strength password depends two factors the length the password and the search space the number characters comprising the set used the password passphrase the greater the search space the shorter your password has afford the same security. 
your password allows only lowercase the search space your password allows lower uppercase the search space. 
your password allows lower uppercase numerals the search space. 
there are special characters that are sometimes permitted passwords these are. 
your password allows lower uppercase numerals special characters the search space. 
situations where are restricted short passwords. 
characters the use special characters addition uppercase lowercase and numerals highly recommended due the short password lengths. 
let illustrate some examples the typical automated teller machine atm allows for digit pin number this gives search space from through. 
although this acceptable for atm would laughable computer password any password cracking software would break this within seconds. 
lets assume that now are using system with character password limitation. 
such systems still exist believe not. 
one such torbox. 
lets see how stacks upper lowercase only. 
about billion combinations. 
bits entropy upper lowercase only. 
about billion combinations bits entropy upper lowercase numerals. 
about billion combinations bits entropy upper lowercase numberals special. 
million billion combinations bits entropy you can see from the numbers that the addition special characters increases the complexity considerably but are still constrained the much too short password length. 
the major problem wiht the above example torbox that the allowable password length simply too short. 
more reasonable systems will allow passwords the character limit. 
little aside you may find interest learn that the fsb federal security bureau the russian states successor the soviet kgb recommended their agents that they use character password their computers. 
lets the math shall characters lowercase only. 
this works out bits entropy just slightly less than the bits afforded some the ciphers pgp. 
this times strong the des cipher bits. 
this should proof positive that you not have have mixed case numerics special characters the password long enough. 
lets now look two more recent examples tormail which had character password limit and mailtor which has character limit. 
tormail char limit upper lowercase numerals. 
which works out bits entropy. 
mailtor char limit upper lowercase numerals. 
which works out bits entropy. 
both these are well excess the bits that set goal. 
now lets consider the original posters characters chars lowercase only. 
which works out bits entropy. 
chars mixed case. 
which works out bits entropy. 
chars mixed case numerals. 
which works out bits entropy. 
chars mixed case numerals special. 
which works out bits entropy. 
any way you slice the original posters character password more than sufficiently strong thwart brute force attack. 
final note like excerpt some information from jon callas presentation cracking pgp which made the defcon conference. 
note the last reference about hypotheticals per second thats about. 
billion password guesses per second. 
also remember that these remarks were made think can assume that the government considerably better now some years later. 
sum order thwart dictionary attacks and brute forcing passwords have random with about bits entropy.

characters the use special characters addition uppercase lowercase and numerals highly recommended due the short password lengths. 
let illustrate some examples the typical automated teller machine atm allows for digit pin number this gives search space from through. 
although this acceptable for atm would laughable computer password any password cracking software would break this within seconds. 
lets assume that now are using system with character password limitation. 
such systems still exist believe not. 
one such torbox. 
lets see how stacks upper lowercase only. 
about billion combinations. 
bits entropy upper lowercase only. 
about billion combinations bits entropy upper lowercase numerals. 
about billion combinations bits entropy upper lowercase numberals special. 
million billion combinations bits entropy you can see from the numbers that the addition special characters increases the complexity considerably but are still constrained the much too short password length. 
the major problem wiht the above example torbox that the allowable password length simply too short. 
more reasonable systems will allow passwords the character limit. 
little aside you may find interest learn that the fsb federal security bureau the russian states successor the soviet kgb recommended their agents that they use character password their computers. 
lets the math shall characters lowercase only. 
this works out bits entropy just slightly less than the bits afforded some the ciphers pgp. 
this times strong the des cipher bits. 
this should proof positive that you not have have mixed case numerics special characters the password long enough. 
lets now look two more recent examples tormail which had character password limit and mailtor which has character limit. 
tormail char limit upper lowercase numerals. 
which works out bits entropy. 
mailtor char limit upper lowercase numerals. 
which works out bits entropy. 
both these are well excess the bits that set goal. 
now lets consider the original posters characters chars lowercase only. 
which works out bits entropy. 
chars mixed case. 
which works out bits entropy. 
chars mixed case numerals. 
which works out bits entropy. 
chars mixed case numerals special. 
which works out bits entropy. 
any way you slice the original posters character password more than sufficiently strong thwart brute force attack. 
final note like excerpt some information from jon callas presentation cracking pgp which made the defcon conference. 
note the last reference about hypotheticals per second thats about. 
billion password guesses per second. 
also remember that these remarks were made think can assume that the government considerably better now some years later. 
sum order thwart dictionary attacks and brute forcing passwords have random with about bits entropy. 
quotestart hacking the passphrase use some cracker call specialists this access data etc. 
major governments have their own clusters this use psychological modeling based upon browser caches searches plaintext can generate over hypotheticals per secondzaphod.

com you could also use diceware diceware words yield bits entropy. 
com actually thought you were going reference this comic. 
from rounded april amas for full disk encryption from macintosh using system. 
btw thinking that tryecrypt has been broken about safe. 
there evidence least that aware that truecrypt has been broken. 
while true that truecrypt undergoing security audit that does not mean insecure. 
truecrypt does have track record iirc there was brazilian banker named danzas who had several encrypted drive seized brazilian police. 
the brazilian authorities were unable make any headway the encrypted drives after months effort they enlisted the help the fbi. 
the fbi hammered them for another full year with success. 
while truecrypt wasnt mentioned name from the description the media reports about cascading ciphers was reasonably obvious that truecrypt was what they were talking about. 
from rounded april amthen hopefully further step have created bit encrypted disk image hard drive with another strong password including all keys.

about hours ago went move just about btc and initially the transaction popped onto blockchain with medium priority expected confirm within blocks. 
big deal this how usually goes. 
but hours later coins have arrived wallet started poking around. 
now when put the btc address into blockchain get this message warning this bitcoin address contains transactions which may double spends. 
you should extremely careful when trusting any transactions from this address. 
best guess that someone else using share coin screwed tried pull fast one but now this transaction seems hopelessly lost and make worse theres about worth other sends included this transaction other addresses.

good lord jesus dont use osx for darknetn macs but dream using osx for illegal purpose. 
apple has backdoors for the nsa all over macs prolly. 
also using osx also uses the flash memory. 
unlike hardrive flash storage cant securely erased.

html why get gpg warning using insecure memorythe answer you cant because windows you cant lock pages prevent them from being swapped out. 
the only thing you can encrypt the pagefile. 
the pagefile encrypted then doesnt matter the memory gets swapped out. 
from trolltergeist april amclu and must punished. 
spam time remember make new nym. 
its good idea. 
and ill keep pushing. 
wheres cooked when want him lol. 
forum registration open again. 
created two accounts. 
clu and clu. 
used the former spam with links and when both those accounts were banned created doctorclu. 
from that account only sent message who assuming you nugs your dpr. 
you have any proof whatsoever that was uploaded from the clu account when skimming your html saw that the image urls had random base code before the actual uploaded file name. 
the operator you should able tell the name the file uploaded your site avatar. 
far cry from good man but very against child pornography pedophilia. 
repost from dnm the only images uploaded were own avatar when spammed the site with links. 
not sure where the bullshit comes into play. 
dont nor will ever possess that disgusting material. 
that signed message was sent their dpr. 
will have track that back and see who originally posted. 
they are likely running this new site. 
also didnt ddos agora. 
ddosd tormarket yes but have not done anything agora. 
sent him message think means sent messages both and dpr not that dpr. 
you should provide quick overview saying its finance carding site and any other pertinent information for prospective buyersthis will drive traffic your site thats the vertical market youre looking capture. 
your coins are fine and support will fix this issue. 
its easy fix for them and zero amount coins will ever lost when comes. 
just make certain that you include all the proper info regarding the transaction question. 
richard few weeks ago there was some ddos agora very severe. 
all that got fixed. 
agora has been running well lately except for some forum spam. 
just went the first try everything copasetic agora mkt usual. 
the worst thing that can said undersupported the back end. 
but has proven very durable. 
only buyer but works great only few scammers not like. 
lots vendors great variety and the best vendors are extremely busy. 
its really the flagship darknet market nowadays. 
also has strong independent forum where your loyal customers can brag your stuff. 
nothin like word mouth keep the coins rolling for bullshit down bizness vendor.

owockeznancan you post step step instruction for noobs for installing electrum and connection via ssl would very useful peace. 
since most you are familiar with the current setup here are some the changes youd notice more bitcoin link the navigation panel. 
instead topping wallet address pay for funds which leaves the scope for hacks and theft hackers and maket operator multisignature transactions are now standard for front payment escrow. 
vendors can chose enter list public keys advance for accepting orders will prompted enter keys they have none available when accepting order. 
buyers must enter public keys per order basis. 
the new system once funds leave multisig address they pay directly the users key that was used create the address. 
users will then need sign multisignature transactions. 
explain detail below. 
recommend electrum bitcoin client its the only deterministic key derivation algorithm that sees mainstream use. 
forcing users enter list keys individually solely from mpk sucks. 
however this acceptable solution until clients adopt bip library which will the case for the next version electrum and eventually all the others well. 
since vendors buyers admins can missing during order multisignature addresses are used for escrow and front payments funds are recoverable. 
whats multisig multisignature addresses are bitcoin addresses controlled more than one person. 
they are created with set requirements that dictate how the funds the address can moved between parties. 
signature addresses are jointly controlled people the market the buyer and the seller but funds can only moved two people authorize and sign transaction. 
users will expected sign transactions for themselves. 
while current clients leave much desired regarding support for multisignature transactions believe the best way increasing the adoption into day day life and watch the situation improve from there. 
currently the only unmodified client which supports signing multisignature transactions bitcoin core. 
otherwise users can use offline copy. 
multisig sign their browser. 
kinda sucks that bitcoin core the only client that lets this now but were very much looking forward lighter client that supports out the box the days come. 
training users use can seem complicated but weve tried make the process smooth practicality can done and with the neccessary security measures place. 
and can only improve from here. 
completing order doesnt require many complicated steps once but rather gradual process where users are guided doing the transaction. 
users have any experience with electrum offline wallet the process very similar take unsigned transaction sign broadcast. 
heres more detailed explanation. 
order process step buyer choses their items normal. 
when theyre ready they enter public key and their address and confirm their order.

step disputed orderif dispute raised and the order was escrow the market administrator will able craft new raw transaction which pays the buyer vendor appropriate amount their discretion.

none these security issues are disclaimed his vendor profile never wouldve ordered.

whom has obviously spurned offer spiritual leadership and grandstanding behalf piratey darkness. 
therefore have gone own way. 
this week something different something interesting coming this way. 
cheap very cheap some might say. 
break from the norm.

since most you are familiar with the current setup here are some the changes youd notice more bitcoin link the navigation panel. 
instead topping wallet address pay for funds which leaves the scope for hacks and theft hackers and maket operator multisignature transactions are now standard for front payment escrow. 
vendors can chose enter list public keys advance for accepting orders will prompted enter keys they have none available when accepting order. 
buyers must enter public keys per order basis. 
the new system once funds leave multisig address they pay directly the users key that was used create the address. 
users will then need sign multisignature transactions. 
explain detail below. 
recommend electrum bitcoin client its the only deterministic key derivation algorithm that sees mainstream use. 
forcing users enter list keys individually solely from mpk sucks. 
however this acceptable solution until clients adopt bip library which will the case for the next version electrum and eventually all the others well. 
since vendors buyers admins can missing during order multisignature addresses are used for escrow and front payments funds are recoverable. 
whats multisig multisignature addresses are bitcoin addresses controlled more than one person. 
they are created with set requirements that dictate how the funds the address can moved between parties. 
signature addresses are jointly controlled people the market the buyer and the seller but funds can only moved two people authorize and sign transaction. 
users will expected sign transactions for themselves. 
while current clients leave much desired regarding support for multisignature transactions believe the best way increasing the adoption into day day life and watch the situation improve from there. 
currently the only unmodified client which supports signing multisignature transactions bitcoin core. 
otherwise users can use offline copy. 
multisig sign their browser. 
kinda sucks that bitcoin core the only client that lets this now but were very much looking forward lighter client that supports out the box the days come. 
training users use can seem complicated but weve tried make the process smooth practicality can done and with the neccessary security measures place. 
and can only improve from here. 
completing order doesnt require many complicated steps once but rather gradual process where users are guided doing the transaction. 
users have any experience with electrum offline wallet the process very similar take unsigned transaction sign broadcast. 
heres more detailed explanation. 
order process step buyer choses their items normal. 
when theyre ready they enter public key and their address and confirm their order. 
step vendor receives the new order then must decide proceed either vis escrow front payment based ratings etc. 
the vendor has pre entered public keys advance with their listings they can skip step below but not. 
they will prompted here. 
step awaiting payment once the order accepted the vendor and the terms are selected front escrow the multisig address will created and available all users. 
redeemscript then given allowing users verify that the address one they have control over which contains their public key. 
the buyer then needs pay the address continue. 
once the market has seen enough incoming transactions this address cover for the order will progress the order the next step which signing. 
first both users need import the address their wallet. 
copy paste command will shown help them with that. 
step front orders only await buyer signature. 
the order front then the buyer signs the unsigned transaction. 
they paste the partially signed transaction onto the order page and submit where will verified and the order progressed step. 
the order escrow then the process skips this step and the vendor signs dispatches first. 
step waiting for vendor deliver goods. 
the vendor signs indicate they have dispatched. 
the order front then the vendor will now sign and broadcast the transaction. 
once the market sees this transaction blockchain then the order moved step. 
the order escrow the vendor will add the first signature the transaction and paste the partially signed transaction onto the order page. 
step order has been dispatched. 
await buyer sign broadcast escrow click received front. 
its front the buyer simply clicks the received button and the order completed step. 
otherwise the buyer can raise dispute. 
its escrow when the goods arrive the buyer signs broadcasts the transaction paying the vendor the order marked completed step. 
otherwise the buyer the vendor can raise dispute. 
step disputed orderif dispute raised and the order was escrow the market administrator will able craft new raw transaction which pays the buyer vendor appropriate amount their discretion. 
ideally both users should satisfied with the outcome but the admin can sign and wait for the second signature and the transaction broadcast before the dispute automatically closed and the order marked complete. 
step completed orderat this point the buyer and seller will asked leave feedback for the other. 
buyer will leave feedback for the vendor and then the items. 
vendor will leave feedback for the buyer. 
the order was disputed this will mark each review the page disputed allowing users read what happened. 
leaving feedback vendors can rate buyers qualities like cooperation and communication from. 
buyers can rate vendors qualities like shipping and communication from. 
they also rate the items order item quality and matches description the listing. 
when buyers leave feedback for order with more than one item they can choose rate all the items with the same score and comments else fill ratings comments individually. 
all users can leave comments about the vendor buyer item. 
these can from list prepared statements mask peoples writing styles else bespoke comment can written. 
also feedback takes average hours show and are updated bulk keep them anonymous all feedback will have timestamp the following day they appear batch. 
now wed thoroughly testing out these features over the next week with select market users. 
and all those whod wanted participate have been invited seperate board the subject how get started.

org blog openssl bug cve new openssl vulnerability. 
out today which can used reveal memory connected client server. 
youre using older openssl version youre safe. 
note that this bug affects way more programs than just tor expect everybody who runs webserver scrambling today. 
you need strong anonymity privacy the internet you might want stay away from the internet entirely for the next few days while things settle. 
here are our first thoughts what tor components are affected clients tor browser shouldnt affected since uses libnss rather than openssl. 
but tor clients could possibly induced send sensitive information like what sites you visited this session your entry guards. 
youre using tbb well have new bundles out shortly youre using your operating systems tor package you should get new openssl package and then sure manually restart your tor. 
relays and bridges tor relays and bridges could maybe made leak their medium term onion keys rotated once week their long term relay identity keys. 
attacker who has your relay identity key can publish new relay descriptor indicating that youre new location not particularly useful attack. 
attacker who has your relay identity key has your onion key and can intercept traffic flows your address can impersonate your relay but remember that tors multi hop design means that attacking just one relay the clients path not very useful. 
any case best practice would update your openssl package discard all the files keys your datadirectory and restart your tor generate new keys. 
hidden services tor hidden services might leak their long term hidden service identity keys their guard relays. 
like the last big openssl bug this shouldnt allow attacker identify the location the hidden service but attacker who knows the hidden service identity key can impersonate the hidden service. 
best practice would move new hidden service address your convenience. 
directory authorities addition the keys listed the relays and bridges section above tor directory authorities might leak their medium term authority signing keys. 
once youve updated your openssl package you should generate new signing key. 
long term directory authority identity keys are offline should not affected whew. 
more tricky that clients have your relay identity key hard coded please dont rotate that yet. 
well see how this unfolds and try think good solution there. 
tails still tracking debian oldstable should not affected this bug. 
orbot looks vulnerable well try publish more details here soon. 
looks like most the webservers the. 
org rotation need upgrades too and maybe well need throw away our torproject ssl web cert and get new one hopefully well deal with all that soon.

you are doing yourself dis service crossing them off your list. 
just two cents. 
after small short downtime the market now back and working normal.

thanks for clearing that one.

thanks updated that post again electrum. 
ldd which torchat not dynamic going depend the operating system. 
windows whichever linux distro and version you use and whichever version openssl the maintainers used you installed from repository. 
best thing compile from source with fixed version openssl your system. 
putty the windows ssh client not vulnerable. 
winscp uses openssl and vulnerable. 
filezilla uses gcrypt and not vulnerable. 
since there have been couple git hidden services wonder how git handles encryption. 
ldd doesnt show any linked encryption libraries. 
the encryption must baked and its hard find documentation google searches git openssl and encryption. 
sgtatham putty faq. 
html faq openssh. 
net winscp news winscp released. 
like how the tor devs suggest change your onion address your convenience its convenient for any major hidden service but considering any relay any circuit that your hidden service built the last years could have stolen your private keys that the best thing. 
have zero information that any hidden service has been impersonated other than standard phishing sites but the nsa didnt know about the bug before they know about now. 
lets compile list software that people use over tor and that may vulnerable the heartbleed exploit. 
tor browser has components firefox and tor. 
firefox uses mozillas nss library for ssl not vulnerable. 
tor vulnerable you should upgrade the latest tor browser. 
attacker could potentially read your session data including sites you visit login cookies proving you are specific person logged into market forum etc. 
ssh uses openssl and vulnerable. 
openvpn uses openssl and vulnerable. 
curl uses openssl and vulnerable. 
wget uses openssl and vulnerable. 
ntp uses openssl and vulnerable. 
all these dynamically link libssl the library needs upgraded fixed version. 
the case sshd ntp and openvpn which usually run continuously they should restarted after updating libssl. 
pidgin libpurple uses nss and not vulnerable. 
adium uses libpurple which uses nss not vulnerable. 
otr all plugins that aware use gcrypt and are not vulnerable. 
mirc havent checked but since its windows only assuming its not vulnerable. 
xchat the linux version and possibly the windows version use openssl for client server encryption. 
the major issue here you connected hidden service irc server while simultaneously connecting over clearnet irc server with ssl. 
the clearnet server could deanonymize you specific user the hidden service irc. 
you should update openssl immediately. 
feel free add this list. 
pre built electrum binaries from electrum built using openssl. 
and not vulnerable. 
electrum ran from python source dynamically links openssl version system make sure the openssl package updatedtorchat uses openssl library but uncertain which build. 
could vulnerable bitmessage based compilation instructions bitmessage uses openssl and could vulnerable the system using exploitable buildaccording thomas voegtlin one the developers electrum all binaries directly from their official website are built using openssl. 
and not vulnerable the exploit. 
you run electrum from python source will use the version openssl that installed your system. 
msg msg the moment also trying ascertain which other applications that use vulnerable openssl libraries. 
does anyone know torchat built the vulnerable openssl libraries any application that provides anonymity and has heartbeat enabled under fire. 
any anonymity application that functions server all applications are server like and uses openssl could potentially exploited and details the memory could possibly contain information that reveals the real identity user. 
this not mentioned much popular media not the primary concern the general public but reality for every one the darknet community. 
best check all applications used for communication they are often run directly from the system. 
guess this prime example why using non persistent such tails important even then running tails with the real exposed the the moment possibly dangerous user using pre built binaries that not dynamically link the systems openssl. 
bitcoin uses openssl and vulnerable version. 
but not any versions before after. 
this particularly nefarious because attacker could steal your private keys and therefore your coins they are loaded into ram some point like you broadcast transaction. 
links against openssl. 
which fixes the bug you should upgrade immediately. 
electrum uses openssl and vulnerable any linux distro that uses the vulnerable versions. 
the prebuilt windows binaries are not vulnerable. 
electrum uses pythons ssl library. 
pythons ssl based openssl. 
org library ssl. 
html tails electrum users have nothing fear squeezes openssl based branch without the bug. 
not sure however what version ssl the window binary compiled against know that vunerable not. 
thats strange have had few matters taken care very quickly recently. 
fact asked could delete all messages without having manually and within the hour new feature was put delete all messages. 
they not only answer promptly but also implement features light speed. 
maybe llama you should try again reach them. 
honestly have not waited longer then hours for response for months now. 
and they don respond via message they respond with change. 
dont worry llama sorry you have been ignored but sure that support will get back you you try once more. 
trying support ticket seems have dissappeared now. 
whats the business like bsm. 
mods please delete this thread change the name. 
this does not help the market grow. 
this exactly what happened the forums when bsm first started that halted the growth tremendously.

hello today would like announce that started our own tumbler service about the tumbler service possible wallets which means can send your bitcoins different wallets random transfer times. 
its always random when youll receive the bitcoins.

from angel eyes april amwhats the for make sure all internet traffic that travels through your modem via tor large part yes. 
there direct path the internet for the workstation laptop even was completely owned would not able anonymize you through address leakage. 
this case not possible for your laptop create surreptitious connections anything the internet unless via tor. 
but also moves the tor process off your secure workstation onto independent and isolated system the tor software ever exposes significant flaw which can lead disclosure information this week being good example even remote code execution then the impact restricted the only which while serious far less serious than breach your workstation which contains passwords data private keys etc.

dont care how small team they are doesnt take much post times day update the people who are making you rich. 
this was very badly handled. 
they found something that critical that they had shut down thats fine but you dont that and then say nothing beyond webpage message. 
the only organization that know that did that was mtgox.

dont know about this shit only feel comfortable posting here because the url hasnt changed whyusheep warned this shit while back not sure this was what was anticipating but does certainly seems unforeseen mentioned for that matter. 
hell even the original link post states that attackers would have the ability impersonate the hidden service agora. 
fuck that shit warning nothing fuck logging they sure hell aint getting password via redirect hack not trying spread fudd just warning people careful watch your and and lets see what the fall out there any. 
bit surprised the optimism here. 
there hasnt been word from agora the forums. 
fear theyve followed all the other markets and run off enjoy nice retirement with our btc. 
but they have done nothing communicate with the vendors and buyers and thats just insane. 
dont care how small team they are doesnt take much post times day update the people who are making you rich. 
this was very badly handled. 
they found something that critical that they had shut down thats fine but you dont that and then say nothing beyond webpage message. 
the only organization that know that did that was mtgox. 
yes action does speak louder than words. 
and theyve done nothing but disappear far. 
like see some action their part.

dont see anybody panicking. 
but think its foolish assume that everything and act like you know fact. 
nobody knows anything about anyone this world. 
thats the beautiful thing that makes all possible. 
also the ugly thing that makes possible for anyone anything and never accountable for. 
until agora goes back doesnt. 
will not assume everything that webpage true. 
nor will assume theyve run off with the money. 
ive been alive for more than half century. 
learned long time ago that one can never too sure anyone especially when they are protected anonymity. 
its fine optimistic but dont certain. 
because unless you personally know these people and are sitting beside them. 
you cant certain anything.
