hello hub many you may interested hiding the use tor from your isp. 
some isps are already under federal orders maintain databases addresses connecting tor nodes and this point you should expect the collecting that data. 
there nice solution other than vpn services which can prove not helpful depending how you configure your pathway into tor you choose bad vpn service called pluggable transports that give you bridge connect tor. 
bridge address that connects you tor possibly unknown tor bridge. 
using these will hide that you are using known tor node. 
obfs bridge bridge that has data packets disguised normal data hides the surface that you are using tor. 
vulnerable dpi deep packet inspection capability the fbi nsa. 
roughly exist understand using them can pool you into smaller group. 
solution host your own vps the tor cloud serviceobfs resistent dpi ultimately the safest bridge completely masks your data packets. 
the only problem that they are few number thus pooling you into yet smaller group. 
the more people host the infinitely stronger tor becomes torproject and look some bridges obfs and obfs bridges the more you have the better. 
now boot tails bridge mode. 
wait til the menu for live live failsafe comes. 
hit tab and then hit spacebar and enter the word bridge which will launch tails bridge mode. 
from here set the system clock sync with utc time. 
the menu for adding bridges will open automatically with attached. 
some other number not delete this necessary for bridge mode run. 
add your bridges one time and hit the button connect tor bit more safely tails working implenting support for flashproxy the next huge tool tor anynomity. 
once that deployed for tails would heavily consider implementing that technology. 
there special pluggable transports tor browser bundle that configured run bridges automatically which supports flashproxy matter time. 
the tor cloud service great way host free private obfs bridge. 
you want strengthen tor think about hosting public bridge obfs bridge safe lovies.

send private message with your username the pirate market image link and link the advertisment. 
had some funds that took over day show fog the past three days. 
and agora isnt loading well for now. 
dont think these things are related frankly. 
think agora just having tor bandwidth issues its the new premier market. 
think fog has been having issues and they are aware. 
perhaps they are both under ddos attacks from the gubmint but thats pure speculation. 
wouldnt you think that really hacked agora thered little more about though other than people reporting the site down its been down for more than just day least thats what ive seen. 
but who knows after all that these dark net sites have been through nothing surprises anymore. 
wish there was way could really assured sites security. 
there are many marketplaces the dark web now some them could ran clowns. 
has anyone else noticed this know that bitcoinfog has been very slow releasing peoples deposits this last week fact many people myself included still have not received their withdrawals from days ago.

thank you everyone. 
hello hub many you may interested hiding the use tor from your isp. 
some isps are already under federal orders maintain databases addresses connecting tor nodes and this point you should expect the collecting that data. 
there nice solution other than vpn services which can prove not helpful depending how you configure your pathway into tor you choose bad vpn service called pluggable transports that give you bridge connect tor. 
bridge address that connects you tor possibly unknown tor bridge. 
using these will hide that you are using known tor node. 
obfs bridge bridge that has data packets disguised normal data hides the surface that you are using tor. 
vulnerable dpi deep packet inspection capability the fbi nsa. 
roughly exist understand using them can pool you into smaller group. 
solution host your own vps the tor cloud serviceobfs resistent dpi ultimately the safest bridge completely masks your data packets. 
the only problem that they are few number thus pooling you into yet smaller group. 
the more people host the infinitely stronger tor becomes torproject and look some bridges obfs and obfs bridges the more you have the better. 
now boot tails bridge mode. 
wait til the menu for live live failsafe comes. 
hit tab and then hit spacebar and enter the word bridge which will launch tails bridge mode. 
from here set the system clock sync with utc time. 
the menu for adding bridges will open automatically with attached. 
some other number not delete this necessary for bridge mode run. 
add your bridges one time and hit the button connect tor bit more safely tails working implenting support for flashproxy the next huge tool tor anynomity. 
once that deployed for tails would heavily consider implementing that technology. 
there special pluggable transports tor browser bundle that configured run bridges automatically which supports flashproxy matter time. 
the tor cloud service great way host free private obfs bridge. 
you want strengthen tor think about hosting public bridge obfs bridge safe lovies. 
business accounts not personal. 
you can use business accounts increments several times daily deposits from different locals with little problem. 
stretch out those deposit cities. 
deposits this city. 
more this city. 
skip county over. 
deposits this city ect. 
businesses make money lol. 
youd look successful. 
versace keep cash you can since doesnt sound like you need move much. 
just take bucket franklins ups store and have pack and ship. 
youre committed enmesh yourself with legitamate operation and run things through that. 
literally just google how launder money. 
one here going give you better advice.

org can anyone validate the agora database hack and user dump its not hack its list pot vendor names that anyone can see logging into agora and clicking the cannabis category. 
somewhat more impressive feat would have dump the buyer names but that would require lot more trial and error guesswork names than simply looking the names vendors. 
the agora forum there full list all users. 
many users both buyers and vendors use the same username for both market and forum anyone could copy the entire list users. 
hope this just the case and that nothing more sinister info was obtained. 
this list should removed completely. 
hope gets sorted out like this market lot good vendors. 
vendor imported hash and mdma and others and that list. 
dont know what think about.

from sorrymario march pmquote from nevil march pmhey sorry mario remember back the day utopia when you started that thread asking for the list current online users removed they got rid that asap hey maybe should use magical powers persuasion agora lol fortunately agora uses simple machines forums and you can set your account hide online status wont show the online users list just like here the hub. 
use simple machine forums also but there option available view full list users maybe the list can removed from agora. 
the top forum page have used number times. 
just click member icon top forum page and you get dropdown box that gives you option type and search for member name only other option view the full list members. 
problem fixed just had set system clock utc which tails uses. 
not bridge mode only allows you connect via bridges. 
but boot tails normally can connect without issue. 
says something about the system clock not sync the messages. 
from nevermind march pmhello officer how nice you drop. 
give warm regards leo ura fag you know him hes yur cptni like everyone else said clu retard for him calling reddit mods.

agora has pretty much top notch hope comes. 
was hoping this was about gox. 
has anyone else noticed this know that bitcoinfog has been very slow releasing peoples deposits this last week fact many people myself included still have not received their withdrawals from days ago. 
but now both agora and bitcoinfogs websites appear down. 
please let know anyone else has had any luck getting either site the last hour youve heard any news this issue. 
thank you everyone. 
from gumby march amsomeone performed security analysis bitmessage almost year ago. 
things may have improved but its worth read. 
org forum index. 
thanks for the link. 
just read the whitepaper over bitmessage. 
uses bitcoin like principles hide the sender receiver and everyone gets all the messages make impossible for anyone watching tell whats going. 
you can send messages specific address those who subscribe mailing list. 
uses the proof work concept like bitcoin help prevent spam. 
anyone here using what you think easier than pgp email. 
from sorrymario march pmlol the logo actually taken from graphic used the snowden nsa documents for the tor sucks slides. 
agora said the graphic was too good let waste. 
didnt know this pretty cool.

must have stayed hours surfing the listings over and over picking every delectable was gonna try when figured out how get sum duckketts. 
was sad see his downfall the money hurt but was the loss visionary that hurts more. 
has inspired many others but few will carry the torch high did for long backopy which also legend. 
these two sites have given much many. 
thanks gentleman for giving true freemarket access. 
yeah shes limping horse but not quite dead. 
lol would hilarious they did pay everyone back again and end stronger than ever but just optimist trying because have pending balanace like many others. 
havent been its forums quite long time but one thing noticed and really didnt like was their shady little practice moving important relevant topics sections one will ever see them. 
one the last posts had there was asking for mod answer why the scammer was still vending there. 
got moved customer support where one would see. 
mod could move thread. 
but not answer.

dont worry guys the smalldick virgin whyusheep has idea what hes talking about hes some pimply virgin that paid someone dos site vain effort get attention seeing his penis will never get any attention other than his hand. 
got faith agora team they are the most legit site them all far. 
how about big lotus flower the login screne. 
havs anyone ever not been calmed the sight lotus full bloom that beeing said like the current logo banditos for hire catch you can fuck. 
all does anyone have any other contact details for trava other than the usual placed order over week ago and got mail confirming got coin but mail confirming anything sent.

have used them the past the markets with probs but the direct site has worked for far wildey safe mail. 
bitcoins easy steps. 
how does work. 
advertise the pirate market somewhere. 
create image and upload anony. 
send private message with your username the pirate market image link and link the advertisment. 
had some funds that took over day show fog the past three days. 
and agora isnt loading well for now. 
dont think these things are related frankly. 
think agora just having tor bandwidth issues its the new premier market. 
think fog has been having issues and they are aware. 
perhaps they are both under ddos attacks from the gubmint but thats pure speculation. 
wouldnt you think that really hacked agora thered little more about though other than people reporting the site down its been down for more than just day least thats what ive seen. 
but who knows after all that these dark net sites have been through nothing surprises anymore. 
wish there was way could really assured sites security. 
there are many marketplaces the dark web now some them could ran clowns. 
has anyone else noticed this know that bitcoinfog has been very slow releasing peoples deposits this last week fact many people myself included still have not received their withdrawals from days ago.

hello hub many you may interested hiding the use tor from your isp. 
some isps are already under federal orders maintain databases addresses connecting tor nodes and this point you should expect the collecting that data. 
there nice solution other than vpn services which can prove not helpful depending how you configure your pathway into tor you choose bad vpn service called pluggable transports that give you bridge connect tor. 
bridge address that connects you tor possibly unknown tor bridge. 
using these will hide that you are using known tor node. 
obfs bridge bridge that has data packets disguised normal data hides the surface that you are using tor. 
vulnerable dpi deep packet inspection capability the fbi nsa. 
roughly exist understand using them can pool you into smaller group. 
solution host your own vps the tor cloud serviceobfs resistent dpi ultimately the safest bridge completely masks your data packets. 
the only problem that they are few number thus pooling you into yet smaller group. 
the more people host the infinitely stronger tor becomes torproject and look some bridges obfs and obfs bridges the more you have the better. 
now boot tails bridge mode. 
wait til the menu for live live failsafe comes. 
hit tab and then hit spacebar and enter the word bridge which will launch tails bridge mode. 
from here set the system clock sync with utc time. 
the menu for adding bridges will open automatically with attached. 
some other number not delete this necessary for bridge mode run. 
add your bridges one time and hit the button connect tor bit more safely tails working implenting support for flashproxy the next huge tool tor anynomity. 
once that deployed for tails would heavily consider implementing that technology. 
there special pluggable transports tor browser bundle that configured run bridges automatically which supports flashproxy matter time. 
the tor cloud service great way host free private obfs bridge. 
you want strengthen tor think about hosting public bridge obfs bridge safe lovies. 
business accounts not personal. 
you can use business accounts increments several times daily deposits from different locals with little problem. 
stretch out those deposit cities. 
deposits this city. 
more this city. 
skip county over. 
deposits this city ect. 
businesses make money lol. 
youd look successful. 
versace keep cash you can since doesnt sound like you need move much. 
just take bucket franklins ups store and have pack and ship. 
youre committed enmesh yourself with legitamate operation and run things through that. 
literally just google how launder money. 
one here going give you better advice. 
bmr favorite marketplace all time. 
even the glory days the original silkroad favored this market will support back anything does ever returns the community. 
just thinking about bmr seems warrant the phrase the good days though was operating only few months ago. 
think will always favorite marketplace altogether. 
very good security with backopy the site was just painfully slow. 
when the new one and running any inside info. 
just call eash maket jesus market allah maret vishnuu market buddah market mormon mrket stc. 
all lead agora eveyone happy. 
from paesmem march miss stexo didnt expect hear anyone say that again. 
from march pmi dont think its ddos attack. 
can intermittently log agora seems their not under attack. 
guess that its just traffic problems since they have ton new users. 
ddos attack would allow the odd legitamate user though and ddos definition traffic problem. 
htmlquotethank you investigating the issue right now. 
this bug has indeed existed was due the server not handling the dos attack properly and must have been random occurrence with possibility exploit purposefully. 
this time have made general asset check and can confirm that large sums money are missing. 
anything all was missing due this shall account the lost ourselves since that case the server should have been more ddos proof. 
this time dont see reason shutdown access the service but shall update this changes.

your loud aggressive obnoxious stance doesnt your argument any favours matter how valid may. 
sounds like there may real cause for concern with agora will away and further research you suggest.

think you have configure persistent volume your tails bootable card usb very easy. 
personally always boot from dvd and just import pgp keys and manually configure bridges just because appreciate the amnesic feautures tails.

turns out japanese american model train enthusiast whose name indeed satoshi nakamoto. 
reporter tracked down the year old physicist living under the name dorian. 
nakamoto modest two story house suburban los angeles. 
nakamoto did not admit being behind the phenomenon that since its launch has been hailed financial revolution despite scandals over its use the drugs trade and money laundering. 
and called the police when the magazines reporter knocked his door. 
but newsweek said the man whose quiet career involved classified work systems engineer for the government and government contractors initially tacitly acknowledged his role creating the crypto currency that has rocked the banking world. 
longer involved that and cannot discuss said. 
its been turned over other people. 
later thursday nakamoto told reporters camped outside his house not involved bitcoin. 
the bitcoin foundation which supports the development the currency would not confirm newsweeks story. 
the obsessively secretive founder bitcoin has been unmasked have seen zero conclusive evidence that the identified person the designer bitcoin. 
those closest the bitcoin project the informal team core developers have always been unaware nakamoto true identity nakamoto communicated purely through electronic means said. 
newsweek however laid out strong story scoop meant relaunch its first print issue after publishing online for two years. 
said nakamoto was born japan and immigrated the united states years later. 
studied physics california state polytechnic university and worked for number companies but has apparently not held steady job since. 
spends much his time his model train hobby and has apparently not tapped the millions dollars bitcoin wealth newsweek says comes from authoring the computer code behind.

smart intelligent mathematics engineering computers. 
you name can. 
but they described man with deep libertarian streak intensely private and distrustful the government and banks.

nakamotos bitcoin manifesto stressed the need for online electronic cash system that did not through financial institution which requires both trust the institution and payment for its role intermediary. 
analysts have called his structure brilliant the way issues bitcoin without central bank authority and keeps cryptographic record transactions via distributed computing that also protects users anonymity. 
gavin andresen chief scientist the bitcoin foundation said had corresponded online with man called satoshi nakamoto over one year they refined the bitcoin code. 
but they never spoke the telephone and andresen did not learn anything about his personal life.

after trading for cents per bitcoin for the first two years its existence began frenzied climb that took coin late and last year before falling off the current level.

your loud aggressive obnoxious stance doesnt your argument any favours matter how valid may. 
sounds like there may real cause for concern with agora will away and further research you suggest.

the idea never ever was planted buyers heads when silk road was trusted community with morals and escrow hacks were not common place. 
now days almost stupid trust escrow system vendor buyer for that matter because the inherent risks. 
saying never ever you are simply trusting the escrow host more than the vendor. 
when you step back and look the vendor should the one you trust you are ingesting his drugs you better have some sort trust about the person. 
the site hosting the escrow the same shadowy figure you have never met any vendor. 
but the difference that you can build trusting working relationship with vendor and narrow down the risks substantially where with escrow host you simply cannot. 
think this never motto way for buyers and noobs lazy their and not their due diligence far finding vendors. 
almost every buyer have will without having even ask becasue they understand the risk strictly end sans the hours after you fund escrow before ship and the volatility btc makes vending gut wrenching experience. 
this becasue they trust more than they trust any market all which have stolen lost funds them date.

felt like would never able recoup investment paid bond there. 
agora very nice place. 
given the layout somewhat primitive looking and they have been under ddos attack recently still say proudly that right now agora the new market. 
pandora has been around longer and they have had higher volume traffic until about month ago. 
suspect that has hit its plateau and will likely stand the position moving forward has since the fall smp and bmr. 
sad see die but they have been riddled with issues since day one. 
glad have reliable honest alternate options these days.

starting over nightmare. 
finally feel like have found couple safe markets through which business and them bam our source gets caught the flexcoin hack and yet again more losses beyond our control. 
agora has been good and has always come back after downtime with everyones funds tact. 
this endlessly reassuring but still have hold that tiny bit fear that one day will taken away from some form leo. 
stay safe out there. 
just got done looking over the info. 
looks like wad fud. 
its not that hard generate fake details like the ones posted. 
looks formatted the similar fashion that the viewable order page and not would inside traditional system. 
could mistaken but call this. 
also known that last weeks attack was brute force password attack which why they added the captcha. 
its entirely possible that few vendors names and passwords have been compromised and its their own fault for not using sufficiently strong password and not changing their passwords the day that this was announced. 
even though know for fact password was not compromised changed anyway. 
none should using the same password twice either. 
have this registered services and every one those has its own individual unique password.

hello guys from country non english talking hope you can understand. 
planning personal onion html based and very simple market only for offer products country begining with our city here are huge market. 
the problem that here exists that kind postal blue boxes usa where you can send letters things just using postage and without interacting with any postal office the most near thing buying postage the office and use but will have inside the postal office and let the package letters there without any signing and when purchase the postage ill have inside the postal too dont like because there are cams etc. 
was thinking rotatory aleatory site drops inside the city like this. 
the customer see product read the sec instructions and make the purchase sending his exactly amount our adress and the pgp message with the info that will the neighborwood some relative geoposition the city for what concern. 
recieve the and message near the site send without telling anybody only for now and never exactly the site and simply locate site for drop the package maybe trash container wall like marketing object dont know how traslate whatever there just lot possibilitys for make this with liitle creativity. 
have been intercepted contacted they will never know where exactly only relative location that will lot surface for cover. 
nobody know where this place because improvise the place site. 
left the place and when have good and secure distance send the last message encrypted with the exactly location the package. 
there always distance between and the customers case something and always using correct opsec and all required security online and offline surveillance etc etc. 
let know what you think you have any other idea for case will appreciate lot that have learned lot experience tcf and all that good forums and good people love your work. 
have you considered setting electrum wallet works well with tails and eliminates the need for third party wallets. 
second the notion contributing portion the funds charity. 
also cant hurt have many small markets help diffuse the traffic overload that the bigger markets will most certainly experience. 
mate its agora buyers moved herebut you will have keep watch btc your pricing dont seem move with btc price. 
glad see youre making the move. 
ill happy use your services there.

also known that last weeks attack was brute force password attack which why they added the captcha. 
its entirely possible that few vendors names and passwords have been compromised and its their own fault for not using sufficiently strong password and not changing their passwords the day that this was announced.

hello guys from country non english talking hope you can understand. 
planning personal onion html based and very simple market only for offer products country begining with our city here are huge market. 
the problem that here exists that kind postal blue boxes usa where you can send letters things just using postage and without interacting with any postal office the most near thing buying postage the office and use but will have inside the postal office and let the package letters there without any signing and when purchase the postage ill have inside the postal too dont like because there are cams etc. 
was thinking rotatory aleatory site drops inside the city like this. 
the customer see product read the sec instructions and make the purchase sending his exactly amount our adress and the pgp message with the info that will the neighborwood some relative geoposition the city for what concern. 
recieve the and message near the site send without telling anybody only for now and never exactly the site and simply locate site for drop the package maybe trash container wall like marketing object dont know how traslate whatever there just lot possibilitys for make this with liitle creativity. 
have been intercepted contacted they will never know where exactly only relative location that will lot surface for cover. 
nobody know where this place because improvise the place site. 
left the place and when have good and secure distance send the last message encrypted with the exactly location the package. 
there always distance between and the customers case something and always using correct opsec and all required security online and offline surveillance etc etc. 
let know what you think you have any other idea for case will appreciate lot that have learned lot experience tcf and all that good forums and good people love your work.

ill tell you what why dont you with the you want help. 
hello guys from country non english talking hope you can understand. 
planning personal onion html based and very simple market only for offer products country begining with our city here are huge market. 
the problem that here exists that kind postal blue boxes usa where you can send letters things just using postage and without interacting with any postal office the most near thing buying postage the office and use but will have inside the postal office and let the package letters there without any signing and when purchase the postage ill have inside the postal too dont like because there are cams etc. 
was thinking rotatory aleatory site drops inside the city like this. 
the customer see product read the sec instructions and make the purchase sending his exactly amount our adress and the pgp message with the info that will the neighborwood some relative geoposition the city for what concern. 
recieve the and message near the site send without telling anybody only for now and never exactly the site and simply locate site for drop the package maybe trash container wall like marketing object dont know how traslate whatever there just lot possibilitys for make this with liitle creativity. 
have been intercepted contacted they will never know where exactly only relative location that will lot surface for cover. 
nobody know where this place because improvise the place site. 
left the place and when have good and secure distance send the last message encrypted with the exactly location the package. 
there always distance between and the customers case something and always using correct opsec and all required security online and offline surveillance etc etc. 
let know what you think you have any other idea for case will appreciate lot that have learned lot experience tcf and all that good forums and good people love your work. 
thanks much appreciation. 
also find evo great emerging market. 
they not only have lot fraud related products and tuts but large and ever growing drug section well. 
this market takes security very seriously. 
the layout clean and extremely fast. 
just all around excellent market. 
yesterday was very slow today cant log all. 
its slow its just about down. 
finally logged but after tries still could not upload listing. 
its mixed experience. 
most yesterday couldnt log all but since last night have been able get every other attempt and get some work done. 
right now its being very obstinate but this high traffic period. 
earlier this morning was smooth could. 
suggest you find something else for while and casually ish mins apart try log. 
not keep spamming the refresh button only makes worse. 
far have been able get within trys but wont even bother trying log again until later tonight. 
just got done looking over the info. 
looks like wad fud. 
its not that hard generate fake details like the ones posted. 
looks formatted the similar fashion that the viewable order page and not would inside traditional system. 
could mistaken but call this. 
also known that last weeks attack was brute force password attack which why they added the captcha. 
its entirely possible that few vendors names and passwords have been compromised and its their own fault for not using sufficiently strong password and not changing their passwords the day that this was announced. 
even though know for fact password was not compromised changed anyway. 
none should using the same password twice either. 
have this registered services and every one those has its own individual unique password. 
there were few topics the subject not being able log not being able anything once logged. 
all those have been deleted. 
lets hope they are not going the direction. 
have only just been registered today vendors. 
will say that once got were stuck and could not navigate the site for long. 
has this been ongoing issue how the general atmosphere there the moment even pandora also seems having some difficulties with many support requests becoming unanswered. 
these are really tough times. 
lets hope things improve for whileregardsth. 
have you considered setting electrum wallet works well with tails and eliminates the need for third party wallets. 
second the notion contributing portion the funds charity. 
also cant hurt have many small markets help diffuse the traffic overload that the bigger markets will most certainly experience. 
from technohippy march pmthank you for your words good know that may come under attack robbed scammed and driven from our homes but long stand together and stand united can hopefully stay strong and. 
this why love you vendory customery kind way nothing sinister. 
its not just your commitment great quality and customer service its your entire ethos. 
forum account was advanced enough apportion kudos have just cleared out all kudos reserves. 
glad see youre making the move. 
ill happy use your services there. 
mate its agora buyers moved herebut you will have keep watch btc your pricing dont seem move with btc price.

but call this. 
read through some your last few posts and you have done nothing besides posting agora praises every post you make despite all their obvious opsec failures that makes wonder how much they pay their shills. 
that said must add misinterpreted that was their that was hacked into whereas more likely scenario the dictionary attack and them brute forcing usernames more likely the case which gave them access vendor accounts from where theyve retrieved user addresses etc and details which were not encrypted. 
first and most important point failure why all was dictionary attack was allowed agora clearly didnt take their users accounts seriously with having missed something simple captcha which should have prevented this compromise the first place. 
their lack foresight shows their opsec coudnt any worse. 
also any user who does not use pgp dnm deserves nothing better. 
the past weeks their total online time has been down few hours collectively and for those who can eventually login and get past the captcha problem dont get anything useful done and get timed out site unavailable past that. 
their lack support and now reports them deleting such posts the forum says all. 
maybe you might want chime with what your shill duties are like more interested that now. 
mistake you just made was insult integrity. 
good job quoting out context and taking support for thriving market mean must their pocket. 
just let you know its proper english insert ellipsis when you decide omit part the original text. 
now the real topic. 
you claim agoras pocket. 
you could not further from the truth. 
you point out their opsec failures and its true they are not perfect. 
however these failings not matter anyone with care for their own opsec would not have trifle with such insignificant failings. 
care about own integrity more than care about life.

now come the current. 
vend four markets now. 
those four agora was the signed with but they are more active than all the rest and generate more business than any other market participate. 
other market currently operating has both come back from this many major hurdles with everyones money where should and has the level traffic that agora handling. 
yes and pandora both generate more traffic right now but both those markets have lost peoples money failed address major down times and have more than questionable standing the darknet. 
sure have been posting lot about agora lately but the reason for that simply there more going the agora forum than other places this forum and furthermore how the hell you manage interpret patient and keep trying connectivity spotty right now keep trying and get what you need done asap infallibly supporting any market entirely possible that agora about run off with all our money sure. 
also possible they waited for the escrow wallet hit some predetermined value before cutting and running hell yes. 
nonetheless given that time and again they have returned and the fact that withdraws are still being processed live when you can get access highly doubt. 
now you still think some fucking shill the pocket any market ask you politely shut your fucking mouth and learn your role.

this not question wether its possible. 
its possible with every market out there not offerring some form transaction the event unforeseen issue case hack scam. 
but wonder where post did say they were scamming planned post was clearly highlight agoras poor opsec and warn people proceed with caution all why they should avoid. 
also live withdrawals might not necessarily good idea youd then have coins lost hacks shady admins claim them stolen through transaction malleability weve seen with different markets. 
much you might want twist the topic and sidetrack blaming the users themselves which only part the larger issue hand while overlooking agoras lacklustre opsec claiming them not scamming which again not the point the topic but instead their existing opsec. 
yes youve still got long way convince that youre not shill and good luck trying. 
yeah was having great difficulty with one the strings. 
think was the sudo command needed add. 
may have been different one. 
but all the instructions found both the tails website and other places didnt specify the command say you might need add.

can boot tails from macbook pro with problems except the retina display makes stuff super tiny.

everyone who has said tails works their apple product its macobook pro. 
unfortunately dont have one. 
the market for crap laptop can use solely for tails. 
net manual tutorial. 
you are going that extreme why not just deliver. 
bsm seems run one two people total its understandable that something could overlooked. 
they have seemed pretty proactive about fixing their mistakes. 
just opened shop blueskyi will also cannabis road when that market opens wellhit for some the best weed the darknet. 
cant even get the forum load today. 
its definitely down and will see they are able correct the problem not. 
would think that switching the url around like bmr did might help. 
its still experiencing dos attack patience the key during situations like this. 
remember when experienced dos attack that took down the server for week. 
just sit tight and everything will alright. 
hope this will not the end for agora prolonged ddos are always bad omen. 
still cant login all the moment whats the best quietest time login would have thought few hrs from now would good time any thoughts. 
from psychosis march ami still cant login all the moment whats the best quietest time login would have thought few hrs from now would good time any thoughts its fairly random. 
have had decent luck very early the usa time and the early evening. 
the best suggestion simply keep trying and eventually you will get lucky and slip past the attacks. 
just make sure your ready get whatever you need done immediately. 
sad who knows your going get successful page loads for full hour. 
treat like you could get kicked any second and you should able make happen. 
they have deleted the threads because people would post multiple nonsense threads all caps about server downtime when agora has already addressed the issue stickied forum post. 
has nothing with censorship. 
what you think about this crypto they claims the hidden services cryptocurrency. 
copy paste from his web quoteabout the coinanoncoin mainly targeting used through the invisible internet and tor. 
introducing another layer security within the cryptocurrency markets providing new coin features and services build top these. 
lets get with the facts. 
the coin cannot stopped central banks governments. 
this achieved combining the use clearnet invisible web and services. 
the coin being used tor there way identify who operating the nodes and clients. 
this will turn enable the production new better anonymous services. 
what the coins are being traced the blockchain coin mixer services operating through are development put stop coins being traced back any one wallet person. 
these will make possible mix coins you have received mined sending them the mixer service. 
coins sent there will mixed with all other coins within the service before being sent any address your choosing. 
what are the basic features anoncoin there can. 
million coins existence. 
blocks are worth. 
are worth anc. 
the blocks from. 
are worth anc then subsidy halves blocks every years. 
along with the exclusive features this should provide long and healthy lifespan. 
crypto services and users. 
anoncoin will keep gaining its strength the services offered and the numbers users utilizing these services. 
the coin growing stronger every day and this gives excellent chance further expand the invisible web services. 
all the users and anons already supporting the coin thank you clearnet alarm here are the bitcointalk official post. 
what you know think about this crypto any technical any type advice issue something good vibes.

from every march pmyour right did get bit off topic. 
way consider agoras security without flaws. 
glad were past our differences the issue meant highlight. 
from every march pmthe details posted are copy pasted generated some script. 
any vendor had their password compromised then their opsec even worse than any failing the market. 
vendors especially need use ultra secure passwords our login names are visible our profile pages all attacker needs figure out our passwords. 
were responsible for maintaining not only our safety but that our clients well. 
likely weak passwords hacked into possibly some accounts even created them. 
besides the captchas addtional two factor login important that market users can login decrypting snippet with their private key. 
essential and additional layer security help along with weak strong passwords. 
beyond that all boils down the market users top their own opsec both physically while sending receiving goods well while communicating online and always encrypted. 
planning this too better get some books and practice lot before you make the deal you know what mean. 
any links info about this would useful here. 
this very good marketing plan impressed hope really drives your traffic. 
can someone post some the basics php already alot css html and bit java. 
php seems the way the darknet and would love learn. 
from gumby march pmonline tutorials can helpful but youre novice coding which cant tell based some css html and java experience theres substitute for good book. 
read lots online tutorials about python but only felt that really understood after reading learning python. 
pro tip you can find pirated copies most programming books online. 
yeah ill prolly after some those pirated books. 
not real programmer man the least man sorry made sound like was will program arduino chips put make lights flash and make basic calculators and shit. 
hope get the status were can assemble and program own rasp but right now wana learn php broaden horizons here the darknet html and css good though. 
java know what does and how costomize but never make from the ground. 
self taught student you can tell lingo and wat not. 
problem has been party resolved and seems like will solved shortly. 
bsm good people. 
there also openmailbox. 
the past week weve had huge and unprecedented surge new users the lil shy two thousand users the past week alone and therefore the servers are tad overwhelmed with all this traffic. 
are disabling all new signups temporarily such accommodate the browsing needs existing users. 
much wed like but were not ready grow such breakneck pace only fuck. 
like some marketplaces have shown recently. 
support for our existing users priority well implementing some even more awesome features unseen marketplaces. 
would soon hiring well help. 
grow stay tuned for our upcoming post. 
again wed also like thank all our users for showing their trust our market security which has helped reach many milestones. 
our unique and one kind features speak for themselves. 
and thanks again for spreading the good word around cheers all. 
from spaceshit march ammy guess why theyre being deleted because theres already about million other threads saying the same thing. 
need spam the shit out the forums with something that everyone already knows about. 
they are being ddosd speak and claim working solution that why the site has been slow lately. 
theyre experiencing heavy dos attack server full worthless bullshit threads full people complaining only worsens the attack. 
the more room they have work the better.

getting bad feeling about this market. 
most the time the login page wont load. 
have been unable login for the last hours.

ive been trying get all morning and get the firefox cant find the page error. 
definitely server overload. 
trying get all orders out before noon but the way its looking that might not happen. 
the agora account the forums mentioned heavy dos attack apparantly someone jelous agora actually making little money. 
from honeyray march pmquote from tyrone march pmwell. 
there reason for that. 
admin the second phase the scam. 
the scam using fake feedback vendor accounts that admin mods control. 
they collect the money and send product. 
any depth this whatsoever also cannot provide evidence but also recognized some vendors for. 
cokecartel send from bolivia with lot pages but nearly nobody the known buyers ever ordered and nobody post review until today. 
only know one other guy who told ordered. 
also ordered last week because good and very exited will receive. 
not percent sure that this not real vendor account. 
then ill post here and for sure and search for solid vendors saw few more which make speculate this way. 
lets see what will come.

vendors especially need use ultra secure passwords our login names are visible our profile pages all attacker needs figure out our passwords. 
were responsible for maintaining not only our safety but that our clients well and that note its really irrelevant what security features the market has. 
are the ones taking the big risk loosing coins due market hack. 
that same time users responsibility encrypt their sensitive info. 
proper personal security taken both the vendors and the buyers the market generally unnecessary. 
always stay safe out there. 
literally just came from the agora fourms but cant seem log. 
keeps telling error occured but know typing correct credentials. 
test this created new account then logged out and immeditely tried log back and couldnt. 
dont know whats goin but hope they get fixed. 
just recently got referral link and enjoying myself agora. 
just wanted know any vendors accept ultracoins here its supposed the fastest cryptocurency out right now. 
bought myself few coins and transferring between wallets and exchanges only takes the coins about seconds arrive wallet fully confirmed. 
thought that might good reason for vendors start accepting that. 
anyone does please let know. 
you could open few llcs shell corporations that will act they were actual companies trading and doing business. 
you should able open bank accounts with these corporations and thus able transfer large sums cash between different accounts. 
cant even login the forums. 
keeps telling error has occured try again seconds.

agora still being ddosd speak and they are working solution thats why the site has been slow lately. 
not really worried. 
agoras staff seems like pretty competent bunch just wish could login the forums see whats going there. 
been reloading every minute for about hours with avail. 
guess why theyre being deleted because theres already about million other threads saying the same thing. 
need spam the shit out the forums with something that everyone already knows about. 
they are being ddosd speak and claim working solution that why the site has been slow lately. 
recanting previous statement for those who saw. 
use terminal mount the iso the drive. 
heres the proccess use. 
howto burn iso usb drive your macinsert your thumbdrive. 
you should see pop your desktop all nice and mounted ready for you use. 
you can see your desktop you can use the way need. 
diskutil listyou should see something like this dev disk type name size identifier guid partition scheme. 
disk apple corestorage. 
disk apple boot recovery. 
disk dev disk type name size identifier apple hfs macintosh. 
disk dev disk type name size identifier guid partition scheme. 
disk apple hfs passport. 
disk dev disk type name size identifier fdisk partition scheme. 
disk dos fat untitled. 
disk the instance above noted thumbdrive dev disk. 
happened untitled but could whatever name you may have given. 
anyhow essentially need unmount everything that disk but not remove completely from the system. 
diskutil unmountdisk dev disk unmount all volumes disk was successfulthat solves that. 
now where that iso image you have you need know where you can copy that thumbdrive. 
the way this thumbdrive that either backed other ways not useful like old and small whatever. 
you note the one using. 
lol got with cisco router that bought. 
came with management software that sucks. 
that thumbdrive when all over will have nothing but the iso you burning. 
the destructive part sudo desktop crunchbang. 
iso dev rdisk records records out bytes transferred. 
secs bytes sec should note you won see any activity more that second. 
you hit return and the computer goes work not telling working not. 
one those classic commands ain fancy pretty all high falutin. 
does one thing and does exactly what you told errors. 
should also note you screw point that something important like disk list above disk well you have the joy reinstalling the your mac most likely. 
breakdown sudo most you know what this. 
allows you things the superuser your mac. 
command convert and copy file don know why named that. 
input file output file block size you can use you get the idea. 
like there not much speed gained anything bigger. 
some you are looking that output file location and thinking where the heck did get rdisk from well the same location disk only raw device connection. 
stepping outside the rules little bit taking little known shortcut that doesn have any stoplights you will. 
you essentially move the same data about the time you dev rdisk the last thing that you should eject but how you that since you can drag the trash diskutil still has you covered. 
diskutil eject disk disk disk ejectedif you really need see something you need have install pipe viewer. 
unless you already have some system like macports homebrew have working and know how use just suck and deal with not seeing something. 
anyhow maybe you dork like and you have pipe viewer. 
instead the command used initially going modify. 
petr desktop crunchbang. 
iso sudo dev rdisk. 
mib eta there you. 
nice little visual guide for elapsed time how fast and estimate for how long going take. 
you want know more about pipe viewer there great article here. 
this turned out longer than expected. 
anyhow hope helps one you out there. 
you need answered what mac you have older macbookpro. 
think its better place the item somewhere before you tell the person the general location. 
they will watch what everyone does the area and will likely see you. 
place somewhere with gps coordinates and general description like the gray trash barrel the lamp post under the big bush under some leaves with soda can top better still just buy the stamps somewhere and bring your package the post office. 
they may have cam but will not able connect you the exact package unless you have stand line and give the person.

place somewhere with gps coordinates and general description like the gray trash barrel the lamp post under the big bush under some leaves with soda can top think that will imposible because the customer tell the general location for example the neighborhood lives near something like that. 
that could weak point ill keep your advice mind. 
maybe the solution more general location more surface the leas cant made exagerate ring the worst case yep that paranoid jaja. 
the gps coordinate its great idea there any way that could identified have gps navigator that kind signals. 
quotebetter still just buy the stamps somewhere and bring your package the post office. 
they may have cam but will not able connect you the exact package unless you have stand line and give the person. 
well they have different videos the places where the letters boxes were send from think that will very obvious strange that will risk. 
maybe theres way for distortionate the cam something like that any idea about this thanks for your helpful advice and answer organix quoteits called deaddrop and its been done since forever the buyer has trust that you arent leo but you build rep and use pgp case they are watching your email account then all will well just msg them the loc and they can pick themselveswow deaddrop didnt know that thanks for that thats exactly the idea make very good reputation ill the first here making that kind bussiness tor onion pgp you know what mean that can risk but advantage too have very secure and well. 
thanks for your answer any experience about this kind deliverys any other options sorry too intense about this but think that this maybe could help another people countrys like mine thanks. 
from organix march pmif you have the persons neighborhood that may problem. 
you hide something public many people might see you and dig after you leave has someplace where people will not see you leave and that can difficult. 
you use gps locate the coordinates the spot after you leave and then shut off the gps. 
they cant trace you that way sure. 
dont you have several post offices your area you could different one each time and rotate them. 
must easier that way than drive miles someone elses neighborhood. 
perhaps you can the drop for customers near and mail those farther away for the first thing planning lot hide places that can leave there without suspect have good ideas but comment here for security. 
thanks for gps advice here are less than offices public postal enterprise but lot more private couriers that require sign and more information maybe could dangerous but really dont know that its lot few offices. 
many that offices are malls ill caught more cams more risk for shipping all the country and maybe just maybe international continental postal mail its the better option and have think how send using any service public private without leaving any trace. 
any idea about this really have resolve this trouble because city can with deaddrops but planning expand the bussiness yes yes have use mail shipping. 
anyone have any idea ill appreciatte lot maybe another options remember the problem that here doesnt exist the postal boxes that blue ones usa for send letters boxes without register anywhere only using postage. 
postage can used here but have buy postal office and send the items postal offices without sign any paper but leaving cam traces and all stuff that comes with this risk. 
any idea about how send items here thanks guys. 
from trc march amif you are going that extreme why not just deliver well that will dangerous because the person who contact can. 
person interested caught that not good idea the thing that the customer never know who and never know where the drop until has gone from there. 
thanks for your answer anyway. 
quotei have delivered product via remote controller toy plane beforewow that may good idea some cases but its main city its big and that will rare. 
was thinking how camouflage visits the postal office maybe with sunglasses makeup something like that. 
like said have problems have personally the office for buy the postage and again for ship the package with postage dont have give real name something only leave the letters over there but maybe that can rare. 
the other option using private service like fedex but again have personally that its risk. 
anyone have other options than postal shipping that can commented here thanks for your attention.

from every march pmyour right did get bit off topic. 
way consider agoras security without flaws. 
glad were past our differences the issue meant highlight. 
from every march pmthe details posted are copy pasted generated some script. 
any vendor had their password compromised then their opsec even worse than any failing the market. 
vendors especially need use ultra secure passwords our login names are visible our profile pages all attacker needs figure out our passwords. 
were responsible for maintaining not only our safety but that our clients well. 
likely weak passwords hacked into possibly some accounts even created them. 
besides the captchas addtional two factor login important that market users can login decrypting snippet with their private key. 
essential and additional layer security help along with weak strong passwords. 
beyond that all boils down the market users top their own opsec both physically while sending receiving goods well while communicating online and always encrypted.

from march pmhave you considered setting electrum wallet works well with tails and eliminates the need for third party wallets. 
but going try blockchain. 
info wallet mean they seem the main source for all this stuff anyway hopefully more secure than campbx. 
guess why theyre being deleted because theres already about million other threads saying the same thing. 
need spam the shit out the forums with something that everyone already knows about. 
they are being ddosd speak and claim working solution that why the site has been slow lately. 
been reloading every minute for about hours with avail. 
from wilfred march ami cant get. 
kinda giving the creaps how few vendors accounts have been comprised. 
getting bad feeling about this market. 
most the time the login page wont load. 
have been unable login for the last hours. 
praying for fix. 
the market site right now but the forums not seem working for. 
whose accounts have been compromised your not referring that douchebag whyusheeps claims are you that guy full shit. 
agora still being ddosd speak and they are working solution thats why the site has been slow lately. 
not really worried. 
agoras staff seems like pretty competent bunch just wish could login the forums see whats going there. 
cant even login the forums. 
keeps telling error has occured try again seconds. 
doesnt matter how long wait still get the same message. 
noticed its not disabled there just new option where you can have multiple auto withdraw wallets order circumvent tracing bitcoin movement and out site. 
you could open few llcs shell corporations that will act they were actual companies trading and doing business. 
you should able open bank accounts with these corporations and thus able transfer large sums cash between different accounts.

any links info about this would useful here. 
yeah was having great difficulty with one the strings. 
think was the sudo command needed add. 
may have been different one. 
but all the instructions found both the tails website and other places didnt specify the command say you might need add.

the market for crap laptop can use solely for tails. 
from honeyray march pmquote from tyrone march pmwell. 
there reason for that. 
admin the second phase the scam. 
the scam using fake feedback vendor accounts that admin mods control. 
they collect the money and send product. 
any depth this whatsoever also cannot provide evidence but also recognized some vendors for. 
cokecartel send from bolivia with lot pages but nearly nobody the known buyers ever ordered and nobody post review until today. 
only know one other guy who told ordered. 
also ordered last week because good and very exited will receive. 
not percent sure that this not real vendor account. 
then ill post here and for sure and search for solid vendors saw few more which make speculate this way. 
lets see what will come. 
just got online get horny. 
not have use brain. 
the past week weve had huge and unprecedented surge new users the lil shy two thousand users the past week alone and therefore the servers are tad overwhelmed with all this traffic. 
are disabling all new signups temporarily such accommodate the browsing needs existing users. 
much wed like but were not ready grow such breakneck pace only fuck. 
like some marketplaces have shown recently. 
support for our existing users priority well implementing some even more awesome features unseen marketplaces. 
would soon hiring well help. 
grow stay tuned for our upcoming post. 
again wed also like thank all our users for showing their trust our market security which has helped reach many milestones. 
our unique and one kind features speak for themselves. 
and thanks again for spreading the good word around cheers all. 
its called deaddrop and its been done since forever the buyer has trust that you arent leo but you build rep and use pgp case they are watching your email account then all will well just msg them the loc and they can pick themselves.

you claim agoras pocket. 
the real topic the opsec agora. 
which apalling and that now endangered and compromised their userbase. 
from every march pmevery time take financial loss through fault customers myself suck and find way make the situation right for all involved. 
when shutdown shipped almost worth free products when smp was hacked turned scam shipped around free merch. 
when and started firing ddos cannons each other got the fuck out dodge and decided start new wanted part that. 
dont care what you did vendor any off what you claim true then kudos you and thats not the point discussion. 
from every march pmsure have been posting lot about agora lately but the reason for that simply there more going the agora forum than other places this forum and furthermore how the hell you manage interpret patient and keep trying connectivity spotty right now keep trying and get what you need done asap infallibly supporting any market precisely point pushing for market which clearly doesnt care for its users security doesnt read too well book. 
from every march pmis entirely possible that agora about run off with all our money sure. 
also possible they waited for the escrow wallet hit some predetermined value before cutting and running hell yes. 
nonetheless given that time and again they have returned and the fact that withdraws are still being processed live when you can get access highly doubt. 
this not question wether its possible. 
its possible with every market out there not offerring some form transaction the event unforeseen issue case hack scam. 
but wonder where post did say they were scamming planned post was clearly highlight agoras poor opsec and warn people proceed with caution all why they should avoid. 
also live withdrawals might not necessarily good idea youd then have coins lost hacks shady admins claim them stolen through transaction malleability weve seen with different markets. 
much you might want twist the topic and sidetrack blaming the users themselves which only part the larger issue hand while overlooking agoras lacklustre opsec claiming them not scamming which again not the point the topic but instead their existing opsec. 
yes youve still got long way convince that youre not shill and good luck trying. 
bsm seems run one two people total its understandable that something could overlooked. 
they have seemed pretty proactive about fixing their mistakes. 
was using them clean wallet buycoinaccount bitcoinfog campbx never had any trouble with them but then they lost one transactions and now dont like them anymore. 
cant imagine that theyre actually scam site seem pretty legitimate and ive never seen any bad press about them but they seem totally lost tracking down the transaction and posting account. 
ive sent them the blockchain. 
info links proving that the coins hit the right deposit address and all they keep sending stupid questions over and over. 
they are scam site guess theyre waiting for get tired and just give the fairly small amount coins maybe its working. 
campbx reputable although they dont send fiat bank accounts lately. 
they are trying find new bank work with. 
have had trouble with them the past. 
hey guys anyone else experiencing this problem all credentials are correct but keeps saying error has occured you will have wait about seconds login again sorry. 
can wait minutes and still tells the same thing. 
any input would greatly appreciated.

nonetheless given that time and again they have returned and the fact that withdraws are still being processed live when you can get access highly doubt.

ive sent them the blockchain.

onionworks very fast and charges straight per tumble.

from march pmhave you considered setting electrum wallet works well with tails and eliminates the need for third party wallets. 
but going try blockchain.

just know its the same use connect xbox. 
have delivered product via remote controller toy plane before. 
posted this the outlaw market subreddit yet thought was worthwhile posting here well. 
ive been ordering recreational meds through the dark web for couple years now and ive probably tried most the major markets during that time silk road silk road sheep bmr agora and most recently outlaw. 
experiences have varied wildly. 
overall experience with silk road was good and feel dpr operated bone fide market but all know how that ended. 
bmr sheep all ended being scams. 
ive been using agora lot recently but lately have had difficulty with getting response and cant even log today deja. 
the net result that lost escrow funds last and final order for each these markets. 
kinda figured that this was just cost doing business the dark web and resigned myself the fact that while market may appear legit the end was always going lose some btc either through action more likely scammer ops. 
recently got stung the whole. 
gox fiasco which imo was the largest scam all perpetrated that fat little frenchman cahoots with some big crime sydicates but digress. 
think outlaw different although little early tell for sure. 
theyve been around for few months and have built pretty impressive platform software engineer day job. 
sure the web site design could use some work but the security and functionality the backend impressive. 
this took some investment build and wasnt some quick bitwasp site quickly thrown together for the purposes running off with users escrow funds. 
its custom software and solid marketplace platform. 
the other thing that giving some good vibes great customer support. 
placed first order with vendor turtletime used another site and got goods few days. 
based the doing business with based vendor cuts out the risk and delays customs from international vendors. 
there dedicated admin who seems pretty focused serving this area. 
going keep using outlaw and post more about experiences sample size doesnt really count statistically. 
you arent going get around the fact that the headers give tons info even you pgp all the things. 
bote the superior solutionyour address simply public key. 
the emails are stored dht over all the nodes. 
the only thing that really not able hidden how many times you check your email and how many emails that you get. 
but since hides damn neary everything else its much better system. 
getting the same error.

but call this. 
read through some your last few posts and you have done nothing besides posting agora praises every post you make despite all their obvious opsec failures that makes wonder how much they pay their shills. 
that said must add misinterpreted that was their that was hacked into whereas more likely scenario the dictionary attack and them brute forcing usernames more likely the case which gave them access vendor accounts from where theyve retrieved user addresses etc and details which were not encrypted. 
first and most important point failure why all was dictionary attack was allowed agora clearly didnt take their users accounts seriously with having missed something simple captcha which should have prevented this compromise the first place. 
their lack foresight shows their opsec coudnt any worse. 
also any user who does not use pgp dnm deserves nothing better. 
the past weeks their total online time has been down few hours collectively and for those who can eventually login and get past the captcha problem dont get anything useful done and get timed out site unavailable past that. 
their lack support and now reports them deleting such posts the forum says all. 
maybe you might want chime with what your shill duties are like more interested that now. 
mistake you just made was insult integrity.

just let you know its proper english insert ellipsis when you decide omit part the original text. 
now the real topic. 
you claim agoras pocket. 
you could not further from the truth. 
you point out their opsec failures and its true they are not perfect. 
however these failings not matter anyone with care for their own opsec would not have trifle with such insignificant failings.

this not question wether its possible. 
its possible with every market out there not offerring some form transaction the event unforeseen issue case hack scam. 
but wonder where post did say they were scamming planned post was clearly highlight agoras poor opsec and warn people proceed with caution all why they should avoid. 
also live withdrawals might not necessarily good idea youd then have coins lost hacks shady admins claim them stolen through transaction malleability weve seen with different markets. 
much you might want twist the topic and sidetrack blaming the users themselves which only part the larger issue hand while overlooking agoras lacklustre opsec claiming them not scamming which again not the point the topic but instead their existing opsec. 
yes youve still got long way convince that youre not shill and good luck trying. 
yeah was having great difficulty with one the strings. 
think was the sudo command needed add. 
may have been different one. 
but all the instructions found both the tails website and other places didnt specify the command say you might need add.

yes youve still got long way convince that youre not shill and good luck trying. 
your right did get bit off topic. 
way consider agoras security without flaws. 
not going perpetuate this argument because its pointless. 
original statement was simple. 
the details posted are copy pasted generated some script. 
any vendor had their password compromised then their opsec even worse than any failing the market. 
vendors especially need use ultra secure passwords our login names are visible our profile pages all attacker needs figure out our passwords. 
were responsible for maintaining not only our safety but that our clients well and that note its really irrelevant what security features the market has. 
are the ones taking the big risk loosing coins due market hack. 
that same time users responsibility encrypt their sensitive info. 
proper personal security taken both the vendors and the buyers the market generally unnecessary. 
always stay safe out there.

yes and pandora both generate more traffic right now but both those markets have lost peoples money failed address major down times and have more than questionable standing the darknet. 
sure have been posting lot about agora lately but the reason for that simply there more going the agora forum than other places this forum and furthermore how the hell you manage interpret patient and keep trying connectivity spotty right now keep trying and get what you need done asap infallibly supporting any market entirely possible that agora about run off with all our money sure. 
also possible they waited for the escrow wallet hit some predetermined value before cutting and running hell yes. 
nonetheless given that time and again they have returned and the fact that withdraws are still being processed live when you can get access highly doubt. 
now you still think some fucking shill the pocket any market ask you politely shut your fucking mouth and learn your role. 
one the smartest vendors the markets. 
just opened shop blueskyi will also cannabis road when that market opens wellhit for some the best weed the darknet. 
ive been trying get all morning and get the firefox cant find the page error. 
definitely server overload. 
trying get all orders out before noon but the way its looking that might not happen. 
the agora account the forums mentioned heavy dos attack apparantly someone jelous agora actually making little money. 
kinda giving the creaps how few vendors accounts have been comprised. 
getting bad feeling about this market. 
most the time the login page wont load. 
have been unable login for the last hours. 
praying for fix. 
dont think this fud. 
has opened topic saying his account was comprimsed there well because had simular password. 
dumb fuck prob had the same password but any how. 
hes weed dealer here australia. 
think this for real. 
that guy full shit. 
all did was look through vendor listings and write down their names. 
say let him turn over all his information the feds which they wony able god damn thing with then someone pays btc dox this motherfucker people quit playing these games with this community. 
understand dpr move violence was the wrong choice but guarantee the word gets out people are paying for hackers they will think lot harder about. 
once labeled rat for the rest his life and will have lot more problems his hand. 
sorry beat dead horse but how many times has this happened dpr himself did tormarket. 
guess what one got trouble. 
say let this cocksucker squeal like pig. 
any documents gives cops will have their personal name and will public knowledge time. 
that would sad life the run after giving few passwords that are easibly changeable minutes. 
and hasnt evenyone figured out use pgp now this guys joker. 
especially posting reddit the place where high school hackers die. 
from spaceshit march ammy guess why theyre being deleted because theres already about million other threads saying the same thing. 
need spam the shit out the forums with something that everyone already knows about. 
they are being ddosd speak and claim working solution that why the site has been slow lately. 
theyre experiencing heavy dos attack server full worthless bullshit threads full people complaining only worsens the attack. 
the more room they have work the better. 
posted this the outlaw market subreddit yet thought was worthwhile posting here well. 
ive been ordering recreational meds through the dark web for couple years now and ive probably tried most the major markets during that time silk road silk road sheep bmr agora and most recently outlaw. 
experiences have varied wildly. 
overall experience with silk road was good and feel dpr operated bone fide market but all know how that ended. 
bmr sheep all ended being scams. 
ive been using agora lot recently but lately have had difficulty with getting response and cant even log today deja. 
the net result that lost escrow funds last and final order for each these markets. 
kinda figured that this was just cost doing business the dark web and resigned myself the fact that while market may appear legit the end was always going lose some btc either through action more likely scammer ops. 
recently got stung the whole. 
gox fiasco which imo was the largest scam all perpetrated that fat little frenchman cahoots with some big crime sydicates but digress. 
think outlaw different although little early tell for sure. 
theyve been around for few months and have built pretty impressive platform software engineer day job. 
sure the web site design could use some work but the security and functionality the backend impressive. 
this took some investment build and wasnt some quick bitwasp site quickly thrown together for the purposes running off with users escrow funds. 
its custom software and solid marketplace platform. 
the other thing that giving some good vibes great customer support. 
placed first order with vendor turtletime used another site and got goods few days. 
based the doing business with based vendor cuts out the risk and delays customs from international vendors. 
there dedicated admin who seems pretty focused serving this area. 
going keep using outlaw and post more about experiences sample size doesnt really count statistically. 
hey guys thought would cool give recognition those who donate the site and help move forward. 
personally feel this the only community would donate. 
myself will sending worth coins later today. 
lets give some recognition those helping post below with how much you've donated far also mods you'd like chime with what these donations will that would sweet. 
future updates projects planned ect ect. 
there mention the dangers mixing lsd and lithium. 
theres alot varying information out there but seems though this could very harmful combination. 
recently discovered that when helping freind intersted lsd see was prepared for. 
thankfully found information from few reliabel sources then led the conclusion that taking lsd while taking lithium isnt good idea. 
this aleady common knowledge. 
there also openmailbox.

why the fuck real torbrowser says different from real one and went whatismyip. 
com said the same the torbrowser but the the hub forums somehow knows real one. 
just know its the same use connect xbox. 
from every march pmi just got done looking over the info. 
looks like wad fud. 
but call this. 
read through some your last few posts and you have done nothing besides posting agora praises every post you make despite all their obvious opsec failures that makes wonder how much they pay their shills. 
that said must add misinterpreted that was their that was hacked into whereas more likely scenario the dictionary attack and them brute forcing usernames more likely the case which gave them access vendor accounts from where theyve retrieved user addresses etc and details which were not encrypted. 
first and most important point failure why all was dictionary attack was allowed agora clearly didnt take their users accounts seriously with having missed something simple captcha which should have prevented this compromise the first place. 
their lack foresight shows their opsec coudnt any worse. 
also any user who does not use pgp dnm deserves nothing better. 
the past weeks their total online time has been down few hours collectively and for those who can eventually login and get past the captcha problem dont get anything useful done and get timed out site unavailable past that. 
their lack support and now reports them deleting such posts the forum says all. 
maybe you might want chime with what your shill duties are like more interested that now. 
from every march pmyour right did get bit off topic. 
way consider agoras security without flaws. 
glad were past our differences the issue meant highlight. 
from every march pmthe details posted are copy pasted generated some script. 
any vendor had their password compromised then their opsec even worse than any failing the market. 
vendors especially need use ultra secure passwords our login names are visible our profile pages all attacker needs figure out our passwords. 
were responsible for maintaining not only our safety but that our clients well. 
likely weak passwords hacked into possibly some accounts even created them. 
besides the captchas addtional two factor login important that market users can login decrypting snippet with their private key. 
essential and additional layer security help along with weak strong passwords. 
beyond that all boils down the market users top their own opsec both physically while sending receiving goods well while communicating online and always encrypted. 
just wanted know any vendors accept ultracoins here its supposed the fastest cryptocurency out right now. 
bought myself few coins and transferring between wallets and exchanges only takes the coins about seconds arrive wallet fully confirmed. 
thought that might good reason for vendors start accepting that. 
anyone does please let know.

but going try blockchain. 
info wallet mean they seem the main source for all this stuff anyway hopefully more secure than campbx. 
guess why theyre being deleted because theres already about million other threads saying the same thing. 
need spam the shit out the forums with something that everyone already knows about. 
they are being ddosd speak and claim working solution that why the site has been slow lately.

agoras staff seems like pretty competent bunch just wish could login the forums see whats going there. 
cant even login the forums. 
keeps telling error has occured try again seconds. 
doesnt matter how long wait still get the same message. 
noticed its not disabled there just new option where you can have multiple auto withdraw wallets order circumvent tracing bitcoin movement and out site. 
you could open few llcs shell corporations that will act they were actual companies trading and doing business. 
you should able open bank accounts with these corporations and thus able transfer large sums cash between different accounts.

any links info about this would useful here. 
yeah was having great difficulty with one the strings. 
think was the sudo command needed add. 
may have been different one. 
but all the instructions found both the tails website and other places didnt specify the command say you might need add. 
took lot reading realize but once was added worked smoothly.

perhaps its your hardwares age probably. 
consider myself veteran troubleshooter cant solve issue figure cant possibly solved. 
everyone who has said tails works their apple product its macobook pro. 
unfortunately dont have one. 
the market for crap laptop can use solely for tails. 
from honeyray march pmquote from tyrone march pmwell. 
there reason for that. 
admin the second phase the scam. 
the scam using fake feedback vendor accounts that admin mods control. 
they collect the money and send product. 
any depth this whatsoever also cannot provide evidence but also recognized some vendors for. 
cokecartel send from bolivia with lot pages but nearly nobody the known buyers ever ordered and nobody post review until today. 
only know one other guy who told ordered. 
also ordered last week because good and very exited will receive. 
not percent sure that this not real vendor account. 
then ill post here and for sure and search for solid vendors saw few more which make speculate this way. 
lets see what will come. 
just got online get horny. 
not have use brain. 
the past week weve had huge and unprecedented surge new users the lil shy two thousand users the past week alone and therefore the servers are tad overwhelmed with all this traffic. 
are disabling all new signups temporarily such accommodate the browsing needs existing users. 
much wed like but were not ready grow such breakneck pace only fuck. 
like some marketplaces have shown recently. 
support for our existing users priority well implementing some even more awesome features unseen marketplaces. 
would soon hiring well help. 
grow stay tuned for our upcoming post. 
again wed also like thank all our users for showing their trust our market security which has helped reach many milestones. 
our unique and one kind features speak for themselves. 
and thanks again for spreading the good word around cheers all. 
its called deaddrop and its been done since forever the buyer has trust that you arent leo but you build rep and use pgp case they are watching your email account then all will well just msg them the loc and they can pick themselves. 
ive had some great luck with. 
onionworks very fast and charges straight per tumble. 
feel better about using when gets more users which would make more anonymous would have larger pool btc mix with. 
have delivered product via remote controller toy plane before. 
from every march pmnow the real topic. 
you claim agoras pocket. 
the real topic the opsec agora. 
which apalling and that now endangered and compromised their userbase. 
from every march pmevery time take financial loss through fault customers myself suck and find way make the situation right for all involved. 
when shutdown shipped almost worth free products when smp was hacked turned scam shipped around free merch. 
when and started firing ddos cannons each other got the fuck out dodge and decided start new wanted part that. 
dont care what you did vendor any off what you claim true then kudos you and thats not the point discussion. 
from every march pmsure have been posting lot about agora lately but the reason for that simply there more going the agora forum than other places this forum and furthermore how the hell you manage interpret patient and keep trying connectivity spotty right now keep trying and get what you need done asap infallibly supporting any market precisely point pushing for market which clearly doesnt care for its users security doesnt read too well book. 
from every march pmis entirely possible that agora about run off with all our money sure. 
also possible they waited for the escrow wallet hit some predetermined value before cutting and running hell yes. 
nonetheless given that time and again they have returned and the fact that withdraws are still being processed live when you can get access highly doubt. 
this not question wether its possible. 
its possible with every market out there not offerring some form transaction the event unforeseen issue case hack scam. 
but wonder where post did say they were scamming planned post was clearly highlight agoras poor opsec and warn people proceed with caution all why they should avoid. 
also live withdrawals might not necessarily good idea youd then have coins lost hacks shady admins claim them stolen through transaction malleability weve seen with different markets. 
much you might want twist the topic and sidetrack blaming the users themselves which only part the larger issue hand while overlooking agoras lacklustre opsec claiming them not scamming which again not the point the topic but instead their existing opsec. 
yes youve still got long way convince that youre not shill and good luck trying. 
bsm seems run one two people total its understandable that something could overlooked. 
they have seemed pretty proactive about fixing their mistakes. 
was using them clean wallet buycoinaccount bitcoinfog campbx never had any trouble with them but then they lost one transactions and now dont like them anymore. 
cant imagine that theyre actually scam site seem pretty legitimate and ive never seen any bad press about them but they seem totally lost tracking down the transaction and posting account. 
ive sent them the blockchain. 
info links proving that the coins hit the right deposit address and all they keep sending stupid questions over and over. 
they are scam site guess theyre waiting for get tired and just give the fairly small amount coins maybe its working. 
campbx reputable although they dont send fiat bank accounts lately. 
they are trying find new bank work with. 
have had trouble with them the past. 
hey guys anyone else experiencing this problem all credentials are correct but keeps saying error has occured you will have wait about seconds login again sorry. 
can wait minutes and still tells the same thing. 
any input would greatly appreciated.

this guy smart feller here. 
youve got the best product whats the point keeping the best name. 
there also openmailbox. 
have just begun the process putting some listings. 
let say that may take some time with the attacks going. 
lets hope done the morning. 
same here cant log the forums and site doesnt load but after billion tries. 
fuck now wondering really got hacked. 
worhts try for surewas impressed also with some its services. 
this very good marketing plan impressed hope really drives your traffic. 
you are going that extreme why not just deliver. 
you arent going get around the fact that the headers give tons info even you pgp all the things. 
bote the superior solutionyour address simply public key. 
the emails are stored dht over all the nodes. 
the only thing that really not able hidden how many times you check your email and how many emails that you get. 
but since hides damn neary everything else its much better system. 
does really matter find this guy not feel like this pointless search lol. 
use terminal mount the iso the drive. 
heres the proccess use. 
howto burn iso usb drive your macinsert your thumbdrive. 
you should see pop your desktop all nice and mounted ready for you use. 
you can see your desktop you can use the way need. 
diskutil listyou should see something like this dev disk type name size identifier guid partition scheme. 
disk apple corestorage. 
disk apple boot recovery. 
disk dev disk type name size identifier apple hfs macintosh. 
disk dev disk type name size identifier guid partition scheme. 
disk apple hfs passport. 
disk dev disk type name size identifier fdisk partition scheme. 
disk dos fat untitled. 
disk the instance above noted thumbdrive dev disk. 
happened untitled but could whatever name you may have given. 
anyhow essentially need unmount everything that disk but not remove completely from the system. 
diskutil unmountdisk dev disk unmount all volumes disk was successfulthat solves that. 
now where that iso image you have you need know where you can copy that thumbdrive. 
the way this thumbdrive that either backed other ways not useful like old and small whatever. 
you note the one using. 
lol got with cisco router that bought. 
came with management software that sucks. 
that thumbdrive when all over will have nothing but the iso you burning. 
the destructive part sudo desktop crunchbang. 
iso dev rdisk records records out bytes transferred. 
secs bytes sec should note you won see any activity more that second. 
you hit return and the computer goes work not telling working not. 
one those classic commands ain fancy pretty all high falutin. 
does one thing and does exactly what you told errors. 
should also note you screw point that something important like disk list above disk well you have the joy reinstalling the your mac most likely. 
breakdown sudo most you know what this. 
allows you things the superuser your mac. 
command convert and copy file don know why named that. 
input file output file block size you can use you get the idea. 
like there not much speed gained anything bigger. 
some you are looking that output file location and thinking where the heck did get rdisk from well the same location disk only raw device connection. 
stepping outside the rules little bit taking little known shortcut that doesn have any stoplights you will. 
you essentially move the same data about the time you dev rdisk the last thing that you should eject but how you that since you can drag the trash diskutil still has you covered. 
diskutil eject disk disk disk ejectedif you really need see something you need have install pipe viewer. 
unless you already have some system like macports homebrew have working and know how use just suck and deal with not seeing something. 
anyhow maybe you dork like and you have pipe viewer. 
instead the command used initially going modify. 
petr desktop crunchbang. 
iso sudo dev rdisk. 
mib eta there you. 
nice little visual guide for elapsed time how fast and estimate for how long going take. 
you want know more about pipe viewer there great article here. 
this turned out longer than expected. 
anyhow hope helps one you out there. 
you need answered what mac you have older macbookpro. 
can someone post some the basics php already alot css html and bit java. 
php seems the way the darknet and would love learn. 
there isnt any next posts. 
think its better place the item somewhere before you tell the person the general location. 
they will watch what everyone does the area and will likely see you. 
place somewhere with gps coordinates and general description like the gray trash barrel the lamp post under the big bush under some leaves with soda can top better still just buy the stamps somewhere and bring your package the post office. 
they may have cam but will not able connect you the exact package unless you have stand line and give the person.

place somewhere with gps coordinates and general description like the gray trash barrel the lamp post under the big bush under some leaves with soda can top think that will imposible because the customer tell the general location for example the neighborhood lives near something like that. 
that could weak point ill keep your advice mind. 
maybe the solution more general location more surface the leas cant made exagerate ring the worst case yep that paranoid jaja. 
the gps coordinate its great idea there any way that could identified have gps navigator that kind signals.

well they have different videos the places where the letters boxes were send from think that will very obvious strange that will risk. 
maybe theres way for distortionate the cam something like that any idea about this thanks for your helpful advice and answer organix quoteits called deaddrop and its been done since forever the buyer has trust that you arent leo but you build rep and use pgp case they are watching your email account then all will well just msg them the loc and they can pick themselveswow deaddrop didnt know that thanks for that thats exactly the idea make very good reputation ill the first here making that kind bussiness tor onion pgp you know what mean that can risk but advantage too have very secure and well. 
thanks for your answer any experience about this kind deliverys any other options sorry too intense about this but think that this maybe could help another people countrys like mine thanks. 
from organix march pmif you have the persons neighborhood that may problem. 
you hide something public many people might see you and dig after you leave has someplace where people will not see you leave and that can difficult. 
you use gps locate the coordinates the spot after you leave and then shut off the gps. 
they cant trace you that way sure. 
dont you have several post offices your area you could different one each time and rotate them. 
must easier that way than drive miles someone elses neighborhood. 
perhaps you can the drop for customers near and mail those farther away for the first thing planning lot hide places that can leave there without suspect have good ideas but comment here for security. 
thanks for gps advice here are less than offices public postal enterprise but lot more private couriers that require sign and more information maybe could dangerous but really dont know that its lot few offices. 
many that offices are malls ill caught more cams more risk for shipping all the country and maybe just maybe international continental postal mail its the better option and have think how send using any service public private without leaving any trace. 
any idea about this really have resolve this trouble because city can with deaddrops but planning expand the bussiness yes yes have use mail shipping. 
anyone have any idea ill appreciatte lot maybe another options remember the problem that here doesnt exist the postal boxes that blue ones usa for send letters boxes without register anywhere only using postage. 
postage can used here but have buy postal office and send the items postal offices without sign any paper but leaving cam traces and all stuff that comes with this risk. 
any idea about how send items here thanks guys. 
from trc march amif you are going that extreme why not just deliver well that will dangerous because the person who contact can. 
person interested caught that not good idea the thing that the customer never know who and never know where the drop until has gone from there. 
thanks for your answer anyway. 
quotei have delivered product via remote controller toy plane beforewow that may good idea some cases but its main city its big and that will rare. 
was thinking how camouflage visits the postal office maybe with sunglasses makeup something like that. 
like said have problems have personally the office for buy the postage and again for ship the package with postage dont have give real name something only leave the letters over there but maybe that can rare. 
the other option using private service like fedex but again have personally that its risk. 
anyone have other options than postal shipping that can commented here thanks for your attention.

from gumby march pmonline tutorials can helpful but youre novice coding which cant tell based some css html and java experience theres substitute for good book. 
read lots online tutorials about python but only felt that really understood after reading learning python. 
pro tip you can find pirated copies most programming books online. 
yeah ill prolly after some those pirated books. 
not real programmer man the least man sorry made sound like was will program arduino chips put make lights flash and make basic calculators and shit. 
hope get the status were can assemble and program own rasp but right now wana learn php broaden horizons here the darknet html and css good though. 
java know what does and how costomize but never make from the ground. 
self taught student you can tell lingo and wat not. 
getting the same error. 
feel should add. 
intentions are not spread fud. 
couldnt further from. 
just want know wtf going and why the hell. 
btc and account disappeared into the ether. 
will delete update this post soon this issue resolved. 
just wanted know any vendors accept ultracoins here its supposed the fastest cryptocurency out right now. 
bought myself few coins and transferring between wallets and exchanges only takes the coins about seconds arrive wallet fully confirmed. 
thought that might good reason for vendors start accepting that. 
anyone does please let know. 
hope this will not the end for agora prolonged ddos are always bad omen. 
still cant login all the moment whats the best quietest time login would have thought few hrs from now would good time any thoughts. 
from psychosis march ami still cant login all the moment whats the best quietest time login would have thought few hrs from now would good time any thoughts its fairly random. 
have had decent luck very early the usa time and the early evening. 
the best suggestion simply keep trying and eventually you will get lucky and slip past the attacks. 
just make sure your ready get whatever you need done immediately. 
sad who knows your going get successful page loads for full hour. 
treat like you could get kicked any second and you should able make happen. 
cant even get the forum load today. 
its definitely down and will see they are able correct the problem not. 
would think that switching the url around like bmr did might help. 
its still experiencing dos attack patience the key during situations like this. 
remember when experienced dos attack that took down the server for week. 
just sit tight and everything will alright. 
from checking march amquote from every march pmi just got done looking over the info. 
looks like wad fud. 
but call this. 
read through some your last few posts and you have done nothing besides posting agora praises every post you make despite all their obvious opsec failures that makes wonder how much they pay their shills. 
that said must add misinterpreted that was their that was hacked into whereas more likely scenario the dictionary attack and them brute forcing usernames more likely the case which gave them access vendor accounts from where theyve retrieved user addresses etc and details which were not encrypted. 
first and most important point failure why all was dictionary attack was allowed agora clearly didnt take their users accounts seriously with having missed something simple captcha which should have prevented this compromise the first place. 
their lack foresight shows their opsec coudnt any worse. 
also any user who does not use pgp dnm deserves nothing better. 
the past weeks their total online time has been down few hours collectively and for those who can eventually login and get past the captcha problem dont get anything useful done and get timed out site unavailable past that.

you could not further from the truth. 
you point out their opsec failures and its true they are not perfect. 
however these failings not matter anyone with care for their own opsec would not have trifle with such insignificant failings.

sure have been posting lot about agora lately but the reason for that simply there more going the agora forum than other places this forum and furthermore how the hell you manage interpret patient and keep trying connectivity spotty right now keep trying and get what you need done asap infallibly supporting any market entirely possible that agora about run off with all our money sure. 
also possible they waited for the escrow wallet hit some predetermined value before cutting and running hell yes. 
nonetheless given that time and again they have returned and the fact that withdraws are still being processed live when you can get access highly doubt. 
now you still think some fucking shill the pocket any market ask you politely shut your fucking mouth and learn your role. 
any evidence provided authorities third party hearsay. 
also known meaningless. 
from checking march amso much you might want twist the topic and sidetrack blaming the users themselves which only part the larger issue hand while overlooking agoras lacklustre opsec claiming them not scamming which again not the point the topic but instead their existing opsec. 
yes youve still got long way convince that youre not shill and good luck trying. 
your right did get bit off topic. 
way consider agoras security without flaws. 
not going perpetuate this argument because its pointless. 
original statement was simple. 
the details posted are copy pasted generated some script. 
any vendor had their password compromised then their opsec even worse than any failing the market. 
vendors especially need use ultra secure passwords our login names are visible our profile pages all attacker needs figure out our passwords. 
were responsible for maintaining not only our safety but that our clients well and that note its really irrelevant what security features the market has. 
are the ones taking the big risk loosing coins due market hack. 
that same time users responsibility encrypt their sensitive info. 
proper personal security taken both the vendors and the buyers the market generally unnecessary. 
always stay safe out there. 
they have deleted the threads because people would post multiple nonsense threads all caps about server downtime when agora has already addressed the issue stickied forum post. 
has nothing with censorship. 
what you think about this crypto they claims the hidden services cryptocurrency. 
copy paste from his web quoteabout the coinanoncoin mainly targeting used through the invisible internet and tor. 
introducing another layer security within the cryptocurrency markets providing new coin features and services build top these. 
lets get with the facts. 
the coin cannot stopped central banks governments. 
this achieved combining the use clearnet invisible web and services. 
the coin being used tor there way identify who operating the nodes and clients. 
this will turn enable the production new better anonymous services. 
what the coins are being traced the blockchain coin mixer services operating through are development put stop coins being traced back any one wallet person. 
these will make possible mix coins you have received mined sending them the mixer service. 
coins sent there will mixed with all other coins within the service before being sent any address your choosing. 
what are the basic features anoncoin there can. 
million coins existence. 
blocks are worth. 
are worth anc. 
the blocks from. 
are worth anc then subsidy halves blocks every years. 
along with the exclusive features this should provide long and healthy lifespan. 
crypto services and users. 
anoncoin will keep gaining its strength the services offered and the numbers users utilizing these services. 
the coin growing stronger every day and this gives excellent chance further expand the invisible web services. 
all the users and anons already supporting the coin thank you clearnet alarm here are the bitcointalk official post. 
what you know think about this crypto any technical any type advice issue something good vibes. 
could that the support were disorganized and made mistake have heard only good things about bsm. 
hope you get refunded. 
problem has been party resolved and seems like will solved shortly.

from honeyray march pmquote from tyrone march pmwell. 
there reason for that. 
admin the second phase the scam. 
the scam using fake feedback vendor accounts that admin mods control. 
they collect the money and send product. 
any depth this whatsoever also cannot provide evidence but also recognized some vendors for. 
cokecartel send from bolivia with lot pages but nearly nobody the known buyers ever ordered and nobody post review until today. 
only know one other guy who told ordered. 
also ordered last week because good and very exited will receive. 
not percent sure that this not real vendor account. 
then ill post here and for sure and search for solid vendors saw few more which make speculate this way. 
lets see what will come. 
just got online get horny. 
not have use brain. 
the past week weve had huge and unprecedented surge new users the lil shy two thousand users the past week alone and therefore the servers are tad overwhelmed with all this traffic. 
are disabling all new signups temporarily such accommodate the browsing needs existing users. 
much wed like but were not ready grow such breakneck pace only fuck. 
like some marketplaces have shown recently. 
support for our existing users priority well implementing some even more awesome features unseen marketplaces. 
would soon hiring well help. 
grow stay tuned for our upcoming post. 
again wed also like thank all our users for showing their trust our market security which has helped reach many milestones. 
our unique and one kind features speak for themselves. 
and thanks again for spreading the good word around cheers all. 
its called deaddrop and its been done since forever the buyer has trust that you arent leo but you build rep and use pgp case they are watching your email account then all will well just msg them the loc and they can pick themselves. 
ive had some great luck with. 
onionworks very fast and charges straight per tumble. 
feel better about using when gets more users which would make more anonymous would have larger pool btc mix with.

from every march pmis entirely possible that agora about run off with all our money sure. 
also possible they waited for the escrow wallet hit some predetermined value before cutting and running hell yes. 
nonetheless given that time and again they have returned and the fact that withdraws are still being processed live when you can get access highly doubt. 
this not question wether its possible. 
its possible with every market out there not offerring some form transaction the event unforeseen issue case hack scam. 
but wonder where post did say they were scamming planned post was clearly highlight agoras poor opsec and warn people proceed with caution all why they should avoid. 
also live withdrawals might not necessarily good idea youd then have coins lost hacks shady admins claim them stolen through transaction malleability weve seen with different markets. 
much you might want twist the topic and sidetrack blaming the users themselves which only part the larger issue hand while overlooking agoras lacklustre opsec claiming them not scamming which again not the point the topic but instead their existing opsec. 
yes youve still got long way convince that youre not shill and good luck trying. 
bsm seems run one two people total its understandable that something could overlooked. 
they have seemed pretty proactive about fixing their mistakes. 
was using them clean wallet buycoinaccount bitcoinfog campbx never had any trouble with them but then they lost one transactions and now dont like them anymore. 
cant imagine that theyre actually scam site seem pretty legitimate and ive never seen any bad press about them but they seem totally lost tracking down the transaction and posting account. 
ive sent them the blockchain. 
info links proving that the coins hit the right deposit address and all they keep sending stupid questions over and over. 
they are scam site guess theyre waiting for get tired and just give the fairly small amount coins maybe its working. 
campbx reputable although they dont send fiat bank accounts lately. 
they are trying find new bank work with. 
have had trouble with them the past. 
hey guys anyone else experiencing this problem all credentials are correct but keeps saying error has occured you will have wait about seconds login again sorry. 
can wait minutes and still tells the same thing.
