if you are going to go to that extreme why not just deliver?
email is email. you arent going to get around the fact that the headers give up tons of info even if you pgp all the things.i2p-bote is the superior solutionyour address is simply a public key. the emails are stored in a dht over all the nodes. the only thing that really is not able to be hidden is how many times you check your email and how many emails that you get. but since it hides damn neary everything else, its a much better system.
does it really matter if we find this guy or not? i feel like this is a pointless search lol

i think its better to place the item somewhere before you tell the person the general location. if it is le they will watch what everyone does in the area and will likely see you do it. place it somewhere with gps coordinates and a general description like "in the gray trash barrel by the lamp post" or "under the big bush under some leaves with a soda can on top"better still to just buy the stamps somewhere and bring in your package to the post office. they may have a cam but will not be able to connect you to the exact package unless you have to stand in line and give it to the person.

quote from: organix on march 10, 2014, 08:27:25 pmif you have to go to the persons neighborhood that may be a problem. if you hide something in public, many people might see you do it and go dig it up after you leave so it has to be someplace where people will not see you leave it and that can be difficult. you use gps to locate the coordinates of the spot after you leave it and then shut off the gps. no, they cant trace you that way, im sure.dont you have several post offices in your area? you could go to a different one each time and rotate them. it must be easier to do it that way than to drive 100 miles to someone elses neighborhood. perhaps you can do the drop for customers near by and mail it to those farther away?for the first thing, im planning a lot of "hide places" that can be leave there without suspect, i have good ideas but no comment here for security. thanks for gps advice!!!here are less than 30 offices of "public postal enterprise", but a lot more of "private couriers" that require sign and more information, so maybe could be dangerous but i really dont know if that its "a lot" or "a few" offices. many of that offices are in malls so, ill be caught in more cams, more risk!!!!!for shipping all the country (and maybe, just maybe international or continental), postal mail its the better option and i have to think how to send using any service (public/private) without leaving any trace... any idea about this?i really have to resolve this trouble, because in my city i can do with deaddrops, but im planning to expand the bussiness, so yes or yes i have to use mail shipping... if anyone have any idea, ill appreciatte a lot!!!!!!! maybe another options??remember, the problem is that here doesnt exist the "postal boxes" (that blue ones in usa) for send letters or boxes without register anywhere, only using postage. postage can be used here, but i have to buy it in a postal office and send the items in postal offices, without sign any paper but leaving "cam traces" and all stuff that comes with this risk.any idea about how to send items here?thanks guys!!!!!!!
quote from: trc on march 10, 2014, 04:51:20 amif you are going to go to that extreme why not just deliver?well, that will be so dangerous because the person who contact me can be a le of. or a person interested in caught me, so that is not a good idea, the thing is that the customer never know who i am and never know where is the drop until i has gone from there. thanks for your answer anyway. quotei have delivered product via remote controller toy plane beforewow!! that may be a good idea in some cases, but its a "main city", its so big and that will be so rare.i was thinking how to "camouflage" my visits to the postal office, maybe with sunglasses or makeup, something like that. like i said, i have 2 problems: i have to go personally to the office for buy the "postage" and again for ship the package, with "postage" i dont have to give my real name or something, only leave the letters over there but maybe that can be rare.the other option is using a private service like fedex, but again i have to go personally so, that its a risk.do anyone have other options than "postal shipping" that can be commented here???thanks for your attention!!!!!!

i feel i should add.... my intentions are not to spread fud. couldnt be further from it. i just want to know wtf is going on and why the hell my .51 btc and my account disappeared into the ether. i will delete or update this post as soon as this issue is resolved.
just wanted to know if any vendors accept ultracoins here as its supposed to be the fastest cryptocurency out right now.  i bought myself a few coins and in transferring between wallets and exchanges it only takes the coins about 20 seconds to arrive to my wallet fully confirmed.  thought that might be a good reason for vendors to start accepting that.  if anyone does please let me know.thank you

i cant even get the forum to load today. its definitely down and we will see if they are able to correct the problem or not. i would think that switching the url around like bmr did might help.

quote from: checking on march 10, 2014, 11:02:13 amso as much as you might want to twist the topic and sidetrack by blaming the users themselves (which is only a part of the larger issue at hand) while overlooking agoras lacklustre opsec or by claiming them to not to be scamming: which again is not the point of the topic but instead their existing opsec. so yes, youve still got a long way to go to convince me that youre not a shill and good luck trying.your right i did get a bit off topic. in no way do i consider agoras security to be without flaws. im not going to perpetuate this argument because its pointless. my original statement was simple. the details posted are copy pasted, or generated by some script. if any vendor had their password compromised then their opsec is even worse than any failing of the market. vendors especially need to use ultra secure passwords as our login names are visible on our profile pages, so all an attacker needs to do is figure out our passwords. were responsible for maintaining not only our safety but that of our clients as well, and on that note its really irrelevant what security features the market has. we are the ones taking the big risk of loosing coins due to a market hack. at that same time it is users responsibility to encrypt their sensitive info. if proper personal security is taken by both the vendors and the buyers the market is generally unnecessary . as always stay safe out there.
they have deleted the threads because people would post multiple nonsense threads in all caps about server downtime when agora has already addressed the issue in a stickied forum post.it has nothing to do with censorship.
what do you think about this crypto???they claims to be the "hidden services" cryptocurrency. i copy/paste from his web:quoteabout the coinanoncoin is mainly targeting to be used through the invisible internet i2p and tor.introducing another layer of security within the cryptocurrency markets by providing new coin features and services to build on top of these. lets get on with the facts.1. the coin cannot be stopped by central banks, or governments.this is is achieved by decentralization, combining the use of clearnet, invisible web, and services. if the coin is being used on i2p or tor there is no way to identify who is operating the nodes and clients. this will in turn enable the production of new, better anonymous services.2. what if the coins are being traced in the blockchain?coin mixer services operating through i2p are in development to put a stop to coins being traced back to any one wallet or person. these will make it possible to mix up coins you have received, or mined by sending them to the mixer service. coins sent there will be mixed with all other coins within the service before being sent to any address of your choosing.3. what are the basic features of anoncoin?there can be 4.2 million coins in existence. the first 42.000 blocks are worth 4.2 anc. the blocks up to 77.777 are worth 7 anc. the blocks from 77.778 are worth 5 anc, then subsidy halves 306600 blocks, every ~2 years. along with the exclusive features this should provide a long and healthy lifespan.4. strength in numbers. crypto, services, and users.anoncoin will keep gaining its strength by the services offered, and the numbers of users utilizing these services. the coin is growing stronger every day, and this gives us an excellent chance to further expand the invisible web services. to all the users and anons already supporting the coin, thank you!--- clearnet alarm ---here are the bitcointalk official post: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=227287.0what do you know or think about this crypto??? any technical or any type advice, issue or something?good vibes!
could be that the support were disorganized and made a mistake, i have heard only good things about bsm.hope you get refunded.
problem has been party resolved and seems like it will be 100% solved shortly. bsm = good people

so you sent bitcoins from a tor hidden service to an online wallet operated by a registered, kyc-compliant, georgia-based company, and youre blaming missing funds on the company with a mailing address?  there are more problems with your claims.  how can you tell if a transaction to campbx is or isnt confirmed if you just sent it through bitcoinfog?  the whole point of that service is to sever the connection and make your funds untraceable.bitcoinfog has been known to take up to a week longer than expected, i would contact them and double check the address used before it is wiped out.
i could be wrong, but i dont think any vendors are willing to subject their funds to the wild fluctuations of a tiny cryptocurreny in order to get their dough 30 minutes earlier.  im not aware of any marketplaces that operate of ultracoins.and one last thing: two-thirds of ultracoin is run by a single pool.

what are you doin on sr anyway? you deserve to lose customers.
theyd be at the conference wouldnt they?
honestly this sounds just like any other crap coin. the list of benefits are impressive, but mostly it just relates to things you could do with any crypto. what im waiting for is a coin that causes actually untraceable transactions. i had a theory about that a while back, designing a crypto that you never send coins to anyone, but rather to relay nodes that pass along requests and the coins are literally moved in randomly diced up segments from other peoples wallets. since the increments are standard its impossible to tell which slices belong to which transactions, but i got far to much else on my plate to actually try and pull that off.
i am just asking out of curiosity.  there are a number of new markets out there but i dont see a lot of vendors going to them.  i assume that buyers will go where the vendors go.  is it really just because things like utopia or sheep?  or is it more that a vendor gets busy being on agora and pandora that they dont want the extra load to have to deal with?  i have never vended so i dont know how busy they can get but i am sure they put their hours in.  me personally, i probably wouldnt use a new market until its been around a few months but with some of these new markets having free accounts and multi-sig, it seems much of the risk of a new market has been averted.  again, i only ask out of curiosity really.  i have my vendor that i use and am happy enough.
great, ill add it to the list.... #54.what do i think?  its got no chance.

varmasti joku muukin tätä ajattelee joten sanon sen tässä ääneen:onko ylimääräinen mainstream-julkisuus varmasti hyvä tai toivottu asia? en osaa sanoa. toisaalta jos systeemi on luotettava niin vaaraa ei kai ole. asiakkaita tulee varmasti lisää, mutta arveluttaa. olenko vain liian paranoidi?

rc4everyone, thanks a lot for your answer!!! it gave me a lot of answers and very good ideas!!! you are right, maybe im thinking too much, im so paranoid so, ill keep that in mind. if i could, i ll give you 100 karma man jajaja reallly, you give me a lot of info and good ideas, thanks man!!!!!with all your answers i got a really good ideas and resolve 90% of my problem. thank you so much for everyone!!!love this community!
i think you are over thinking this. i walk into post offices to purchase stamps / postage all the time. my normal non darknet routine involves me going into multiple postal locations frequently. it does not look that unusual for someone to visit the post on a regular basis, and purchase dozens of stamps at one time and do nothing else. when you go to drop off your packages just act calm and normal man. walk in with all of your packages in a box or a cloth bag to prevent you having to touch them while also avoiding looking odd for wearing gloves in the summer time. for your drop you dont make eye contact with the cameras and wear a hat to make it harder to id you. you just walk in dump your bag into the bin or casually pour them onto the counter for the po employee to handle from then. then just walk out. change up which post offices you ship out of and rotate your shipping days. ie pick 2-3 days per week that you will ship orders. do all your prep early in the day when you can take your time and be very clean about packaging. make a run to one of the 4-6 post offices you use. after a few months change your days up. so if you were shipping say mon, wed, fri change it up to like tues, fri, sat, or something like that. change your appearance so its hard to identify you are the same person each time you make a drop. changing your hat / general attire slightly helps this. go get a few outfits that are several sizes too large to use for this. the loose clothing will further obscure your physical description.it never looks odd for someone to be shipping packages from a post office. people acting sketchy in a post office attracts attention. just figure out a method that you are comfortable with and practice it. hell send thank you cards or invitaitons to long lost friends or random people for a couple of runs until you get comfortable with your surroundings. you may even consider continuing this process after you begin shipping your product as again it further obscures your intentions and provides a nice legit reason for you to be in the po so frequently.the best of us out there understand that the most effective disguise is to hide in plain sight. my domestic stealth is not the most advanced i have experienced, but at the same time you would never guess my package is what it is without knowing in advance. it looks just like any other random piece of mail. i never use the same exact style of stealth for two drop runs in a row. ie i have about 9 different materials i use to make up my packages. of those materials i can create up to around 15 unique styles of stealth package. all of them are very plain jane looking on the outside and flat plus the materials i use are fairly inexpensive. this same policy applies to shipping your merchandise. the best way to hide is to look like your not doing anything wrong. walk in looking pleasant, but in a slight hurry. its important not to look nervous. make idle comments to random people in the lobby if you have to wait in line. keep your conversation mundane and unrevealing. be safe out there.

i could be wrong, but i dont think any vendors are willing to subject their funds to the wild fluctuations of a tiny cryptocurreny in order to get their dough 30 minutes earlier.  im not aware of any marketplaces that operate of ultracoins.and one last thing: two-thirds of ultracoin is run by a single pool.
so you sent bitcoins from a tor hidden service to an online wallet operated by a registered, kyc-compliant, georgia-based company, and youre blaming missing funds on the company with a mailing address?  there are more problems with your claims.  how can you tell if a transaction to campbx is or isnt confirmed if you just sent it through bitcoinfog?  the whole point of that service is to sever the connection and make your funds untraceable.bitcoinfog has been known to take up to a week longer than expected, i would contact them and double check the address used before it is wiped out.
mine shows 192.168.0.10 and that is definitely not my ip address.  i dont use 192 addressing.i thought because the way tor works that their hidden service would listen at 192.168.0.10 and redirect to port 80 on localhost where the web server is listening.  if their hidden service is in torrc is using 192.168.0.10 then that is what everyones ip will say.  it shouldnt have anything to do with my personal localhost address as the whole point of tor and hidden services is to keep that anonymous.i think the real question here is why doesnt the hub use 127.0.0.1 rather than a private address?

i am just asking out of curiosity.  there are a number of new markets out there but i dont see a lot of vendors going to them.  i assume that buyers will go where the vendors go.  is it really just because things like utopia or sheep?  or is it more that a vendor gets busy being on agora and pandora that they dont want the extra load to have to deal with?  i have never vended so i dont know how busy they can get but i am sure they put their hours in.  me personally, i probably wouldnt use a new market until its been around a few months but with some of these new markets having free accounts and multi-sig, it seems much of the risk of a new market has been averted.  again, i only ask out of curiosity really.  i have my vendor that i use and am happy enough.
this is good stuff here, thanks!

honestly this sounds just like any other crap coin. the list of benefits are impressive, but mostly it just relates to things you could do with any crypto. what im waiting for is a coin that causes actually untraceable transactions. i had a theory about that a while back, designing a crypto that you never send coins to anyone, but rather to relay nodes that pass along requests and the coins are literally moved in randomly diced up segments from other peoples wallets. since the increments are standard its impossible to tell which slices belong to which transactions, but i got far to much else on my plate to actually try and pull that off.

rc4everyone, thanks a lot for your answer!!! it gave me a lot of answers and very good ideas!!! you are right, maybe im thinking too much, im so paranoid so, ill keep that in mind. if i could, i ll give you 100 karma man jajaja reallly, you give me a lot of info and good ideas, thanks man!!!!!with all your answers i got a really good ideas and resolve 90% of my problem. thank you so much for everyone!!!love this community!
i think you are over thinking this. i walk into post offices to purchase stamps / postage all the time. my normal non darknet routine involves me going into multiple postal locations frequently. it does not look that unusual for someone to visit the post on a regular basis, and purchase dozens of stamps at one time and do nothing else. when you go to drop off your packages just act calm and normal man. walk in with all of your packages in a box or a cloth bag to prevent you having to touch them while also avoiding looking odd for wearing gloves in the summer time. for your drop you dont make eye contact with the cameras and wear a hat to make it harder to id you. you just walk in dump your bag into the bin or casually pour them onto the counter for the po employee to handle from then. then just walk out. change up which post offices you ship out of and rotate your shipping days. ie pick 2-3 days per week that you will ship orders. do all your prep early in the day when you can take your time and be very clean about packaging. make a run to one of the 4-6 post offices you use. after a few months change your days up. so if you were shipping say mon, wed, fri change it up to like tues, fri, sat, or something like that. change your appearance so its hard to identify you are the same person each time you make a drop. changing your hat / general attire slightly helps this. go get a few outfits that are several sizes too large to use for this. the loose clothing will further obscure your physical description.it never looks odd for someone to be shipping packages from a post office. people acting sketchy in a post office attracts attention. just figure out a method that you are comfortable with and practice it. hell send thank you cards or invitaitons to long lost friends or random people for a couple of runs until you get comfortable with your surroundings. you may even consider continuing this process after you begin shipping your product as again it further obscures your intentions and provides a nice legit reason for you to be in the po so frequently.the best of us out there understand that the most effective disguise is to hide in plain sight. my domestic stealth is not the most advanced i have experienced, but at the same time you would never guess my package is what it is without knowing in advance. it looks just like any other random piece of mail. i never use the same exact style of stealth for two drop runs in a row. ie i have about 9 different materials i use to make up my packages. of those materials i can create up to around 15 unique styles of stealth package. all of them are very plain jane looking on the outside and flat plus the materials i use are fairly inexpensive. this same policy applies to shipping your merchandise. the best way to hide is to look like your not doing anything wrong. walk in looking pleasant, but in a slight hurry. its important not to look nervous. make idle comments to random people in the lobby if you have to wait in line. keep your conversation mundane and unrevealing. be safe out there.
i am just asking out of curiosity.  there are a number of new markets out there but i dont see a lot of vendors going to them.  i assume that buyers will go where the vendors go.  is it really just because things like utopia or sheep?  or is it more that a vendor gets busy being on agora and pandora that they dont want the extra load to have to deal with?  i have never vended so i dont know how busy they can get but i am sure they put their hours in.  me personally, i probably wouldnt use a new market until its been around a few months but with some of these new markets having free accounts and multi-sig, it seems much of the risk of a new market has been averted.  again, i only ask out of curiosity really.  i have my vendor that i use and am happy enough.
honestly this sounds just like any other crap coin. the list of benefits are impressive, but mostly it just relates to things you could do with any crypto. what im waiting for is a coin that causes actually untraceable transactions. i had a theory about that a while back, designing a crypto that you never send coins to anyone, but rather to relay nodes that pass along requests and the coins are literally moved in randomly diced up segments from other peoples wallets. since the increments are standard its impossible to tell which slices belong to which transactions, but i got far to much else on my plate to actually try and pull that off.

i could be wrong, but i dont think any vendors are willing to subject their funds to the wild fluctuations of a tiny cryptocurreny in order to get their dough 30 minutes earlier.  im not aware of any marketplaces that operate of ultracoins.and one last thing: two-thirds of ultracoin is run by a single pool.
so you sent bitcoins from a tor hidden service to an online wallet operated by a registered, kyc-compliant, georgia-based company, and youre blaming missing funds on the company with a mailing address?  there are more problems with your claims.  how can you tell if a transaction to campbx is or isnt confirmed if you just sent it through bitcoinfog?  the whole point of that service is to sever the connection and make your funds untraceable.bitcoinfog has been known to take up to a week longer than expected, i would contact them and double check the address used before it is wiped out.
mine shows 192.168.0.10 and that is definitely not my ip address.  i dont use 192 addressing.i thought because the way tor works that their hidden service would listen at 192.168.0.10 and redirect to port 80 on localhost where the web server is listening.  if their hidden service is in torrc is using 192.168.0.10 then that is what everyones ip will say.  it shouldnt have anything to do with my personal localhost address as the whole point of tor and hidden services is to keep that anonymous.i think the real question here is why doesnt the hub use 127.0.0.1 rather than a private address?

quote from: fuck_her on march 11, 2014, 09:05:11 pmheres where i need feedback: 1) im thinking about asking for an electrum mpk to receive fees on. what do you think about this? 2) the admins key should also be generated from an electrum mpk. there is no reason the key needs to be stored on the site. has anyone ever looked at multisignature transactions in electrum, where the wallet only has one key? i think there is a way to display transactions fit for electrum to sign, but documentation of the code is scarce.. 3) right now, as weve seen, bitcoin-qt and bitcoind are fine for multisignature transactions. but i feel electrum would be way better. if anyone has any information on how electrum works with multisig please send them my way. 4) how do sites that implement true multisignature escrow do it?how does this sound? does the process sound like something end users would be easily trained to do? i think it becomes pretty straightforward, as you can see using multisig.bitwasp.co, there are only 2-3 actions the users need to do. one less step when we automate key generation. thats the price they pay for absolute security for their bitcoin. no more heists, all transactions occur in the blockchain, and are only considered valid when in the blockchain.it means no more live wallet, so the possibility for the negative balance hack is removed, and the trust in the site becomes minimal. if the site is run by an attacker, they simply cant run off with the money. even if there is unexpected downtime, or the admin goes awol, buyer and vendor have their public keys, so can try negotiate on another channel to at least sort out their funds themselves.feedback on this is critical to bitwasps success, so please, fire away.---any input is appreachiated. thanks guys.i will tip very good replies with some bitcoins. (10$ till 30$)although, i doubt you are going to give me a penny. address is in my signature. 1, 2, 3) electrum relies on using their servers. please keep this in mind when using electrum, because electrum is more of a centralized idea than bitcoin-qt and bitcoind which connects to the other nodes. if the electrum servers go down, you get screwed. also electrum is not well supported for multisig right now.4) they use either bitcoin-qt or bitcoind just like bitwasp. it sounds to me like you are wanting to set up a marketplace using bitwasp but using electrum? might be a bad idea if your market relies on electrum because if their servers go down, so does your market.
its a suprise to see you in this venue!first, some thoughts on the implementation ...quoteregardless of whether the payment is finalize early or escrow, then the site will poll the blockchain for payments to that address. once the full amount is paid, then the order is marked as paid, and all users messaged a link to a page that shows the generated transaction, paying the vendor the full amount, minus the sites fee (a raw transaction spending all the transactions sent to the multisg address, and sending to the vendor in one output, and to the sites fees address in another).everyone will be shown the transaction paying the vendor. if the buyer raises a dispute, then the users will start to discuss the order, and the admin will generate a new transaction paying the appropriate amount to both parties. but if its all successful, then one of the users will sign the transaction, and paste the partially signed transaction on the site. then the other user will sign the transaction, broadcast it, where it will be identified by bitwasp when it makes it into the blockchain.im not sure i like showing the raw, unsigned tx, before deciding on where the btc is going to go. this is an information leak. at the very least, the address the vendor uses will have to be burnt, and a sloppy vendor reusing addresses or using the same address to get funds from every tx is going to expose a lot, and this is at very little risk to the person doing the attack. all they would have to do is cancel the order before the vendor fufills it and they would lose a trivial amount to transaction fees. i think its better to wait until its been decided on where the funds go before generating the raw tx to be signed. also, buyers tend to be awful at signing payments. i think from a buyer view, they dont need to ever see a tx unless they need to get a refund of some sort. also, a cautious person might always want their tx to be broadcast as some predetermined time (say 0:10 utc or something), in order to allow to time information leaks. because of this, i think its better for the site to sign the tx, and then have the other party do the final signing and broadcast it themselves. as to your specific questionsquote 1) im thinking about asking for an electrum mpk to receive fees on. what do you think about this?i think itd be better to accept an extended public key bip032 style, or give the user an option to input in advance to give them an arbitrary number of addresses to be chosen from randomly. electrum is moving away from their current key implemantion, even the distributed source has code it in for true bip_32 wallets -- altho im not sure if its actually ever used.quote2) the admins key should also be generated from an electrum mpk. there is no reason the key needs to be stored on the site. has anyone ever looked at multisignature transactions in electrum, where the wallet only has one key? i think there is a way to display transactions fit for electrum to sign, but documentation of the code is scarce.. i think the admin keys should probably be random. there are two reasons for this. one, is that i think the site should have the private keys available because i think the normal signatures should be site + whoever is getting the btc. buyer + vendor should be for unusual situations. this means that youd have to store the extended master private key, which is a huge security problem should that be compromised. the second is that even if you do only store some version of an extended public key, if that is compromised, youd readily be able to tract transactions in the blockchain by looking for tx that redeem a p2sh style address with one of the public keys in the reedemscript. quote3) right now, as weve seen, bitcoin-qt and bitcoind are fine for multisignature transactions. but i feel electrum would be way better. if anyone has any information on how electrum works with multisig please send them my way. as it stands, electrums multi-sig is horribly broken. the only way its gonna work until the new version if you take tmps plugin and use that.  my code on it is all in pubilc domain, and so is vitalik buterins code from pybtctools that ive used to do some format conversions. im not sure how tmpschultz feels about his code being used, however. he wrote all the actual widget code that deals with the ui and came up with the concept of using deposit addresses to store the keys. additionally, electrum stores its transactions internally in a wierdo format. its not really going to be useful, as it stands, for tracking things in the blockchainquote4) how do sites that implement true multisignature escrow do it?im not sure of the internals, but tmp requires vendors to predetermine large numbers of public keys to be used during the order process, and then also predetermine a number of addresses payments go to (this could be as low as 1 address, however).electrum is moving towards real bip032 support. i dont see the point in implementing right now something that uses their wonky key derivation. the tmp plugin will, if it cant find the key in your deposit list, just ask for the correct private key. i think a solution like that, except with real bip032 is the best.
thanks for the news!
quote from: ofl0pwmolzg6i on march 12, 2014, 09:24:14 amgotta be honest, i think just depositing into btc-e and then withdrawing is a fine mixing method.  they have an internal accounting-based system, so the deposit address isnt used as the withdraw address.  so just put money into btc-e, do a few staggered withdraws to different addresses, so the amounts are different, and youre set.  if youre worried about them stealing the money, stagger the process with smaller amounts-- dont deposit again until your last withdraw has gotten in the blockchain.  i dont think it really needs to be more complicated than that.if you do not think they are logging all deposit and withdraw address, you are deluding your self. a big part of why mtgox had so much bitcoin seized early on was the feds wanted leverage to get more evidence against sr people. it was not just about compliance to money transmitting rules. they are aware of people like you, and dont they are not watching. you have been warned.
do you have any established vendors that can vouch for your service, safepostage?
welcome! post in this forum if you have any questions, there aare a few bsm vets on here that know the features pretty well. ie.rc4everyone & myself
glad to see someone is actually noticing us!  allow me to alleviate any concerns about safepostage.com.  we now have a .onion also - 4b5f56q4rcnm6jtq.onionwe use hundreds of different postal accounts at the moment.  its very easy for us to make a new and unctraceable accounts to purchase postage with, and we do so on your behalf.  the odds of a person being linked and having packages intercepted based on the account from where the postage is purchased is very small.  it could happen, but this is why we use new accounts all the time.  every day we make new accounts, that are unlinked through layers of anoymous ips.  we do not discriminate based on who is using the service.  some people just have bitcoin and dont feel like cashing it out.  we also sell stamps.keep in mind, were not responsible for the shipping contents.  we just send you the label.  if anything, i would assume that a package that has a legit shipping label is much less scrutinized than something that has a hand written label and some stamps.
look i know yall prolly wont listen to me, but silkroad is not a scam website. defcon and his team are paying back the stolen bitcoin as we speak. you can check my silkroad forum credentials to see im not a troll. http://silkroad5v7dywlc.onion/index.php?action=profile;u=2877i have been with silkroad since before ross was takendown and have watched sr 2 grow since october 28
i keep getting spam talking about "due to captcha error on agora..." the link is indeed legit but its a referral link to trick you into registering with there link, so they can make a commision fee off of your purchases(which is what the linkare for)
getting a fake id and opening a few llcs should get you "legitimate" bank accounts, and then you just use them for the calendar year, and then just ditch them and disappear come tax time.  then you have a normal working bank account that you can use for a while without all the hassle youre going through.  then you only go through that hassle once a year.if your operation is that big though, it might be time to consider opening a legit business as a laundering front, although that obviously would open you up to paying taxes.

go on youtube and look at some php tutorials. there are plenty of good ones on there. just keep in mind that basic php is very insecure and when you start building things like databases and things that interact with users, you need to validate or sanitize everything. in other words, if somebody types name: jolly<script>alert(hi)</script>roger. this is going to make a javascript alert box pop up. very dangerous when considering you can use it to steal peoples session ids which allow you to login as somebody else.so while you are learning about php, and likely sql (databases), make sure you learn also about preventing xss attacks, sql injection and cross request site forgery. all very important stuff to know, otherwise hackers will eat you for breakfast.check out what my post above really looks like after all the data is sanitized.quotego on youtube and look at some php tutorials. there are plenty of good ones on there. <br /><br />just keep in mind that basic php is very insecure and when you start building things like databases and things that interact with users, you need to validate or sanitize everything. <br /><br />in other words, if somebody types <br /><br />name: jolly&lt;script&gt;alert(&#039;hi&#039;)&lt;/script&gt;roger. this is going to make a javascript alert box pop up. very dangerous when considering you can use it to steal people&#039;s session ids which allow you to login as somebody else.<br /><br />so while you are learning about php, and likely sql (databases), make sure you learn also about preventing xss attacks, sql injection and cross request site forgery. all very important stuff to know, otherwise hackers will eat you for breakfast.
your quite welcome. just remember to remain confident, and plan out how your going to do things. rushed decisions lead to mistakes. in this business mistakes = jail time. no one wants that. remember to always use your head first, and stay safe.
really hoping that this last, but it seems like agora is actually running relatively well today. ive been banging my head on the desk trying to get my work done for a few days now. i just hope it last.
how many vendors are on there?
too many markets have been getting shut down back to back as a result of greed and manipulation of power ! go to the pirate market , its a smaller one which reduces a helluva lotta risk posed by larger markets .. i plan on watchin this market grow security wise and pass all other failing marketplaces .
how about we all disregard messages about disregarding messages, huh???quick muckin up thees forums brotha
i also suggest customers to mix coins. if you buy them at an online exchange linked to your identity, and a vendor gets busted, le will most likely be able to track the coins back to you.now... whats the best option to mix coins?a) bitcoinfog: it seems to be having allot of problems lately: slow deposits, coins not showing up, etc. b) using blockchain.info shared send: this spooks me out a little since they obviously keep logs and will share it with le when requestedc) using an online exchange to sell/buy your btc or other cryptocurrencies, then withdraw fresh coins to a new wallet. this option sounds good but youll have to find an exchange outside of your jurisdiction that doesnt ask for identification.i honestly dont know what would be best, so so if someone has some tips, please share.luckily i still have some clean coins for purchases...

(10$ till 30$)although, i doubt you are going to give me a penny. address is in my signature. 1, 2, 3) electrum relies on using their servers. please keep this in mind when using electrum, because electrum is more of a centralized idea than bitcoin-qt and bitcoind which connects to the other nodes. if the electrum servers go down, you get screwed. also electrum is not well supported for multisig right now.4) they use either bitcoin-qt or bitcoind just like bitwasp. it sounds to me like you are wanting to set up a marketplace using bitwasp but using electrum? might be a bad idea if your market relies on electrum because if their servers go down, so does your market.
its a suprise to see you in this venue!first, some thoughts on the implementation ...quoteregardless of whether the payment is finalize early or escrow, then the site will poll the blockchain for payments to that address. once the full amount is paid, then the order is marked as paid, and all users messaged a link to a page that shows the generated transaction, paying the vendor the full amount, minus the sites fee (a raw transaction spending all the transactions sent to the multisg address, and sending to the vendor in one output, and to the sites fees address in another).everyone will be shown the transaction paying the vendor. if the buyer raises a dispute, then the users will start to discuss the order, and the admin will generate a new transaction paying the appropriate amount to both parties. but if its all successful, then one of the users will sign the transaction, and paste the partially signed transaction on the site. then the other user will sign the transaction, broadcast it, where it will be identified by bitwasp when it makes it into the blockchain.im not sure i like showing the raw, unsigned tx, before deciding on where the btc is going to go. this is an information leak. at the very least, the address the vendor uses will have to be burnt, and a sloppy vendor reusing addresses or using the same address to get funds from every tx is going to expose a lot, and this is at very little risk to the person doing the attack. all they would have to do is cancel the order before the vendor fufills it and they would lose a trivial amount to transaction fees. i think its better to wait until its been decided on where the funds go before generating the raw tx to be signed. also, buyers tend to be awful at signing payments. i think from a buyer view, they dont need to ever see a tx unless they need to get a refund of some sort. also, a cautious person might always want their tx to be broadcast as some predetermined time (say 0:10 utc or something), in order to allow to time information leaks. because of this, i think its better for the site to sign the tx, and then have the other party do the final signing and broadcast it themselves. as to your specific questionsquote 1) im thinking about asking for an electrum mpk to receive fees on. what do you think about this?i think itd be better to accept an extended public key bip032 style, or give the user an option to input in advance to give them an arbitrary number of addresses to be chosen from randomly. electrum is moving away from their current key implemantion, even the distributed source has code it in for true bip_32 wallets -- altho im not sure if its actually ever used.quote2) the admins key should also be generated from an electrum mpk. there is no reason the key needs to be stored on the site. has anyone ever looked at multisignature transactions in electrum, where the wallet only has one key? i think there is a way to display transactions fit for electrum to sign, but documentation of the code is scarce.. i think the admin keys should probably be random. there are two reasons for this. one, is that i think the site should have the private keys available because i think the normal signatures should be site + whoever is getting the btc. buyer + vendor should be for unusual situations. this means that youd have to store the extended master private key, which is a huge security problem should that be compromised. the second is that even if you do only store some version of an extended public key, if that is compromised, youd readily be able to tract transactions in the blockchain by looking for tx that redeem a p2sh style address with one of the public keys in the reedemscript. quote3) right now, as weve seen, bitcoin-qt and bitcoind are fine for multisignature transactions. but i feel electrum would be way better. if anyone has any information on how electrum works with multisig please send them my way. as it stands, electrums multi-sig is horribly broken. the only way its gonna work until the new version if you take tmps plugin and use that.  my code on it is all in pubilc domain, and so is vitalik buterins code from pybtctools that ive used to do some format conversions. im not sure how tmpschultz feels about his code being used, however. he wrote all the actual widget code that deals with the ui and came up with the concept of using deposit addresses to store the keys. additionally, electrum stores its transactions internally in a wierdo format. its not really going to be useful, as it stands, for tracking things in the blockchainquote4) how do sites that implement true multisignature escrow do it?im not sure of the internals, but tmp requires vendors to predetermine large numbers of public keys to be used during the order process, and then also predetermine a number of addresses payments go to (this could be as low as 1 address, however).electrum is moving towards real bip032 support. i dont see the point in implementing right now something that uses their wonky key derivation. the tmp plugin will, if it cant find the key in your deposit list, just ask for the correct private key. i think a solution like that, except with real bip032 is the best.

quote from: navudenas on march 10, 2014, 05:06:09 pmthis is about the ip address i see next to my post. why the fuck is it my real ip???!?!??!?!?!torbrowser says my ip is different from my real one and i went to "whatismyip.com" said the same ip as the torbrowser, but the the hub forums somehow knows my real one........127.0.0.1 is your local computer talking to itself.192.*.*.* is your local router, so could be any computer on your local home network, or maybe it represents the local ip on the hub network servers.  either way, it doesnt matter, its not your ip.my posts also have 192.something as my ip address.  dont worry op, thats just as useless as it saying 127.0.0.1.  its not your real ip.edit: yeah all my posts list 192.168.0.10 as my ip, and on other forums its 127.0.0.1, so this probably has something to do with the architecture of the way the hub is set up.
too many markets have been getting shut down back to back as a result of greed and manipulation of power ! go to the pirate market , its a smaller one which reduces a helluva lotta risk posed by larger markets .. i plan on watchin this market grow security wise and pass all other failing marketplaces .
getting a fake id and opening a few llcs should get you "legitimate" bank accounts, and then you just use them for the calendar year, and then just ditch them and disappear come tax time.  then you have a normal working bank account that you can use for a while without all the hassle youre going through.  then you only go through that hassle once a year.if your operation is that big though, it might be time to consider opening a legit business as a laundering front, although that obviously would open you up to paying taxes.
glad to see someone is actually noticing us!  allow me to alleviate any concerns about safepostage.com.  we now have a .onion also - 4b5f56q4rcnm6jtq.onionwe use hundreds of different postal accounts at the moment.  its very easy for us to make a new and unctraceable accounts to purchase postage with, and we do so on your behalf.  the odds of a person being linked and having packages intercepted based on the account from where the postage is purchased is very small.  it could happen, but this is why we use new accounts all the time.  every day we make new accounts, that are unlinked through layers of anoymous ips.  we do not discriminate based on who is using the service.  some people just have bitcoin and dont feel like cashing it out.  we also sell stamps.keep in mind, were not responsible for the shipping contents.  we just send you the label.  if anything, i would assume that a package that has a legit shipping label is much less scrutinized than something that has a hand written label and some stamps.
i keep getting spam talking about "due to captcha error on agora..." the link is indeed legit but its a referral link to trick you into registering with there link, so they can make a commision fee off of your purchases(which is what the linkare for)

quote from: tub on march 11, 2014, 09:42:43 pmso you sent bitcoins from a tor hidden service to an online wallet operated by a registered, kyc-compliant, georgia-based company, and youre blaming missing funds on the company with a mailing address?  there are more problems with your claims.  how can you tell if a transaction to campbx is or isnt confirmed if you just sent it through bitcoinfog?  the whole point of that service is to sever the connection and make your funds untraceable.bitcoinfog has been known to take up to a week longer than expected, i would contact them and double check the address used before it is wiped out.well, the funds are only untraceable if you dont know the address. since i do know the address, i can just check the blockchain, see that bitcoinfog (or yeah, youre right, some random agent, who cares) sent the coins to that address, confirmed hundreds of times, and the coins are still sitting right there - but they have not been posted to my campbx account - after a week of back and forth bullshit with their support guys. so, its actually pretty easy to place the blame with the registered scammers.
go on youtube and look at some php tutorials. there are plenty of good ones on there. just keep in mind that basic php is very insecure and when you start building things like databases and things that interact with users, you need to validate or sanitize everything. in other words, if somebody types name: jolly<script>alert(hi)</script>roger. this is going to make a javascript alert box pop up. very dangerous when considering you can use it to steal peoples session ids which allow you to login as somebody else.so while you are learning about php, and likely sql (databases), make sure you learn also about preventing xss attacks, sql injection and cross request site forgery. all very important stuff to know, otherwise hackers will eat you for breakfast.check out what my post above really looks like after all the data is sanitized.quotego on youtube and look at some php tutorials. there are plenty of good ones on there. <br /><br />just keep in mind that basic php is very insecure and when you start building things like databases and things that interact with users, you need to validate or sanitize everything. <br /><br />in other words, if somebody types <br /><br />name: jolly&lt;script&gt;alert(&#039;hi&#039;)&lt;/script&gt;roger. this is going to make a javascript alert box pop up. very dangerous when considering you can use it to steal people&#039;s session ids which allow you to login as somebody else.<br /><br />so while you are learning about php, and likely sql (databases), make sure you learn also about preventing xss attacks, sql injection and cross request site forgery. all very important stuff to know, otherwise hackers will eat you for breakfast.
thanks for the news!
really hoping that this last, but it seems like agora is actually running relatively well today. ive been banging my head on the desk trying to get my work done for a few days now. i just hope it last.
its a suprise to see you in this venue!first, some thoughts on the implementation ...quoteregardless of whether the payment is finalize early or escrow, then the site will poll the blockchain for payments to that address. once the full amount is paid, then the order is marked as paid, and all users messaged a link to a page that shows the generated transaction, paying the vendor the full amount, minus the sites fee (a raw transaction spending all the transactions sent to the multisg address, and sending to the vendor in one output, and to the sites fees address in another).everyone will be shown the transaction paying the vendor. if the buyer raises a dispute, then the users will start to discuss the order, and the admin will generate a new transaction paying the appropriate amount to both parties. but if its all successful, then one of the users will sign the transaction, and paste the partially signed transaction on the site. then the other user will sign the transaction, broadcast it, where it will be identified by bitwasp when it makes it into the blockchain.im not sure i like showing the raw, unsigned tx, before deciding on where the btc is going to go. this is an information leak. at the very least, the address the vendor uses will have to be burnt, and a sloppy vendor reusing addresses or using the same address to get funds from every tx is going to expose a lot, and this is at very little risk to the person doing the attack. all they would have to do is cancel the order before the vendor fufills it and they would lose a trivial amount to transaction fees. i think its better to wait until its been decided on where the funds go before generating the raw tx to be signed. also, buyers tend to be awful at signing payments. i think from a buyer view, they dont need to ever see a tx unless they need to get a refund of some sort. also, a cautious person might always want their tx to be broadcast as some predetermined time (say 0:10 utc or something), in order to allow to time information leaks. because of this, i think its better for the site to sign the tx, and then have the other party do the final signing and broadcast it themselves. as to your specific questionsquote 1) im thinking about asking for an electrum mpk to receive fees on. what do you think about this?i think itd be better to accept an extended public key bip032 style, or give the user an option to input in advance to give them an arbitrary number of addresses to be chosen from randomly. electrum is moving away from their current key implemantion, even the distributed source has code it in for true bip_32 wallets -- altho im not sure if its actually ever used.quote2) the admins key should also be generated from an electrum mpk. there is no reason the key needs to be stored on the site. has anyone ever looked at multisignature transactions in electrum, where the wallet only has one key? i think there is a way to display transactions fit for electrum to sign, but documentation of the code is scarce.. i think the admin keys should probably be random. there are two reasons for this. one, is that i think the site should have the private keys available because i think the normal signatures should be site + whoever is getting the btc. buyer + vendor should be for unusual situations. this means that youd have to store the extended master private key, which is a huge security problem should that be compromised. the second is that even if you do only store some version of an extended public key, if that is compromised, youd readily be able to tract transactions in the blockchain by looking for tx that redeem a p2sh style address with one of the public keys in the reedemscript. quote3) right now, as weve seen, bitcoin-qt and bitcoind are fine for multisignature transactions. but i feel electrum would be way better. if anyone has any information on how electrum works with multisig please send them my way. as it stands, electrums multi-sig is horribly broken. the only way its gonna work until the new version if you take tmps plugin and use that.  my code on it is all in pubilc domain, and so is vitalik buterins code from pybtctools that ive used to do some format conversions. im not sure how tmpschultz feels about his code being used, however. he wrote all the actual widget code that deals with the ui and came up with the concept of using deposit addresses to store the keys. additionally, electrum stores its transactions internally in a wierdo format. its not really going to be useful, as it stands, for tracking things in the blockchainquote4) how do sites that implement true multisignature escrow do it?im not sure of the internals, but tmp requires vendors to predetermine large numbers of public keys to be used during the order process, and then also predetermine a number of addresses payments go to (this could be as low as 1 address, however).electrum is moving towards real bip032 support. i dont see the point in implementing right now something that uses their wonky key derivation. the tmp plugin will, if it cant find the key in your deposit list, just ask for the correct private key. i think a solution like that, except with real bip032 is the best.

(10$ till 30$)although, i doubt you are going to give me a penny. address is in my signature. 1, 2, 3) electrum relies on using their servers. please keep this in mind when using electrum, because electrum is more of a centralized idea than bitcoin-qt and bitcoind which connects to the other nodes. if the electrum servers go down, you get screwed. also electrum is not well supported for multisig right now.4) they use either bitcoin-qt or bitcoind just like bitwasp. it sounds to me like you are wanting to set up a marketplace using bitwasp but using electrum? might be a bad idea if your market relies on electrum because if their servers go down, so does your market.

yeah you would have to trust it the same way you trust the markets to not rob your money. these people also have no real way to extort you anyhow. what are they gonna say? give us one meelion dollars or ill tell the popo you mailed something that was probably illegalthey have no idea what the fuck it is youre mailing. and you could not be arrested for buying stamps. the only real way this service could harm you (other than them being le) is from packages being seized. it would be quite a stretch to plan extortion based on that and if they dont keep logs (which, if they arent le and arent extorting they have no reason to) then le have pretty much nothing if they were to ever bust these guys for selling stamps.so the risk is low.

i need to anonymously access a website but i need to use it in its fully function state..can someone please point me in the correct direction.best i can think of is running tor in a vm and allowing javascript to run in the browser.please any tech gurus with an alternative method to what i mentioned, pm me for a $10 reward.(no sitting in a cafe or using public wifi is not a solution its an additional security precaution.)thanks

you should really be careful using javascript altogether from what i understand. but if you do choose to use whonix, i do believe the whonix developers recommend using a physical gateway and a vm workstation, rather than using two virtual machines. https://www.whonix.org/wiki/main_pagehowever, i would imagine there should be another option other than using javascript at all. javascript, flash, iframe, as well as some other plugins really arent recommended if you are attempting to stay anonymous, whether you are using virtualization technology or not.certainly using a vm or whonix would be your best option, as has been mentioned, but javascript truly should be avoided altogether whenever possible, as even vm technology itself has its flaws and vulnerabilities as well. so perhaps there is another option to using javascript altogether? why do you feel it is absolutely necessary to use javascript in your situation?

vendors like to stay were they can access the biggest customer base which at the moment is sr2 and agora. there are some good new markets but they just dont have the traffic for vendors to put in the time logging in to them every day.ive been on both tor bazaar and tor escow for over 2 weeks and have only recieved one sale on each.

physical isolation is great if you need maximum protection against unknown adversaries but i think buying two computers to visit this one web site is overkill unless he thinks theres a good chance the nsa will be exploiting it.

use whonix.  take a snapshot of your whonix workstation before you start.  enable javascript, do whatever you need to.when youre done, revert the snapshot of whonix workstation to its previous backup.   obviously, anything you saved in the whonix workstation will be gone after you restore, so if you need to save something, use a shared folder or make other arrangements.not perfect, because anything that manages to break out of the whonix workstation and into virtualbox could still persist, but thats probably the safest easy way to do it.

quote from: weeble on march 06, 2014, 02:48:50 amjust read the whitepaper over at bitmessage.org. it looks interesting.  it uses bitcoin-like principles to hide the sender/receiver and everyone gets all the messages to make it impossible for anyone watching to tell whats going on.  you can send messages to a specific address or to those who subscribe to a mailing list.  it uses the proof-of-work concept (like bitcoin) to help prevent spam.is anyone on here using it? if so what do you think?  easier than pgp/email?bitmessage is easy to use and provides transparent encryption that is touted to be equivalent to 16000 bit rsa. there has never been an independent security audit however, which is a real sticking point. seems a good way to fly under the radar. for my guide with screenshots on how to setup and use bitmessage you can visit http://i4rx33ibdndtqayh.onion/index.php/topic,4784.msg47634.html#msg47634

quote from: shitstormy on march 07, 2014, 11:45:00 pmbitblender youre a little late to the game, btcfog is nearing eol at this point with darkcoin and darkwallet (two seperate coinjoin projects) reaching completion. also it takes alot of participation to make a mixer work and without peer review its impossible to say whether your service works or not. we got two trust based mixers now, they will be dead by the end of the year.coinjoin mixers like shared coin and the planned dark wallet are not completely anonymous like bitcoin fog. they do not guarantee zero percent taint. since blockchain.info discontinued send shared bitcoin fog seems to be the most trusted traditional mixing service. darkcoin is an interesting concept but doubt it will ever replace bitcoin.

yeah you would have to trust it the same way you trust the markets to not rob your money. these people also have no real way to extort you anyhow. what are they gonna say? give us one meelion dollars or ill tell the popo you mailed something that was probably illegalthey have no idea what the fuck it is youre mailing. and you could not be arrested for buying stamps. the only real way this service could harm you (other than them being le) is from packages being seized. it would be quite a stretch to plan extortion based on that and if they dont keep logs (which, if they arent le and arent extorting they have no reason to) then le have pretty much nothing if they were to ever bust these guys for selling stamps.so the risk is low.
*if its legit* its a great idea. people who know how to be secure have no idea how not-secure the majority is. people dont even encrypt their addresses when buying guns <- i know this for a fact. if there is a service that can help the noobs, its awesome. noobs need this sort of thing. and i myself hate the idea of going in the post office with a box full of drugs in my hand and talking to the post office people. i must admit though, i would much rather do that than have the shipping labels mailed directly to me via some onion service. sounds sketch.stop giving these guys a hard time. noobs need these services.

you should really be careful using javascript altogether from what i understand. but if you do choose to use whonix, i do believe the whonix developers recommend using a physical gateway and a vm workstation, rather than using two virtual machines. https://www.whonix.org/wiki/main_pagehowever, i would imagine there should be another option other than using javascript at all. javascript, flash, iframe, as well as some other plugins really arent recommended if you are attempting to stay anonymous, whether you are using virtualization technology or not.certainly using a vm or whonix would be your best option, as has been mentioned, but javascript truly should be avoided altogether whenever possible, as even vm technology itself has its flaws and vulnerabilities as well. so perhaps there is another option to using javascript altogether? why do you feel it is absolutely necessary to use javascript in your situation?

you should really be careful using javascript altogether from what i understand. but if you do choose to use whonix, i do believe the whonix developers recommend using a physical gateway and a vm workstation, rather than using two virtual machines. https://www.whonix.org/wiki/main_pagehowever, i would imagine there should be another option other than using javascript at all. javascript, flash, iframe, as well as some other plugins really arent recommended if you are attempting to stay anonymous, whether you are using virtualization technology or not.certainly using a vm or whonix would be your best option, as has been mentioned, but javascript truly should be avoided altogether whenever possible, as even vm technology itself has its flaws and vulnerabilities as well. so perhaps there is another option to using javascript altogether? why do you feel it is absolutely necessary to use javascript in your situation?

yeah you would have to trust it the same way you trust the markets to not rob your money. these people also have no real way to extort you anyhow. what are they gonna say? give us one meelion dollars or ill tell the popo you mailed something that was probably illegalthey have no idea what the fuck it is youre mailing. and you could not be arrested for buying stamps. the only real way this service could harm you (other than them being le) is from packages being seized. it would be quite a stretch to plan extortion based on that and if they dont keep logs (which, if they arent le and arent extorting they have no reason to) then le have pretty much nothing if they were to ever bust these guys for selling stamps.so the risk is low.
*if its legit* its a great idea. people who know how to be secure have no idea how not-secure the majority is. people dont even encrypt their addresses when buying guns <- i know this for a fact. if there is a service that can help the noobs, its awesome. noobs need this sort of thing. and i myself hate the idea of going in the post office with a box full of drugs in my hand and talking to the post office people. i must admit though, i would much rather do that than have the shipping labels mailed directly to me via some onion service. sounds sketch.stop giving these guys a hard time. noobs need these services.

use whonix.  take a snapshot of your whonix workstation before you start.  enable javascript, do whatever you need to.when youre done, revert the snapshot of whonix workstation to its previous backup.   obviously, anything you saved in the whonix workstation will be gone after you restore, so if you need to save something, use a shared folder or make other arrangements.not perfect, because anything that manages to break out of the whonix workstation and into virtualbox could still persist, but thats probably the safest easy way to do it.

quote from: firelight on march 13, 2014, 09:02:10 amphysical isolation is great if you need maximum protection against unknown adversaries but i think buying two computers to visit this one web site is overkill unless he thinks theres a good chance the nsa will be exploiting it.never forget you can always just root a cheap android smartphone to run debian linux. or just use a $25 raspberry pi as a physical gateway, as was mentioned. so there is not always a need to buy two computers/laptops to create a physical gateway. and it truly is far safer to do so, as well as recommended by the whonix developers themselves, rather than using two virtual machines.  all the information you need is on the whonix website listed above.
i also agree that axas guide to secure email providers is one of the most complete i have seen on the internet. good job axa! just be sure to do your research before placing trust in any email provider, as individual rules, as well as data-retention laws and other such factors vary between providers, and countries as well. and always use gpg regardless.
well from what i can gather it is looking more and more like agora has run its race.i say this with great dissapointment. not just because of more lost vendor bonds and such. but ther is fuck all else left.thank god deepify has the answer.all i have got for the last 3 hours is this ... iceweasel cant find the file at http://agorabasakxmewww.onion/login.so its not on its server is it?
well these last 4 months have cetainly felt like 4 years worth of drama.its demoralizing.

its interesting the whole group think thing.  i mean, you have all these buyers who crowd on one market and then they wonder why that market runs away with their funds.  maybe a million bucks is just too much temptation.i think the markets ought to work together in some way to spread the load.  maybe that is a stupid idea, i dont really know.  i know the markets want to make all the money, but having one place is just silly really.  i still think back to backopy and bmr and why he wanted to shutdown.  without more markets to spread load and le action then it is just too risky.i understand about having to check a bunch of sites everyday and do orders or whatever.  only so many hours i guess.
great to hear your on agoria!!you were my reg vendor last year, everything allways top notch!!
correct me, please. you are not talking about darkwallet, but about a new alt coin called darkcoin? cause i never heard of it.
how does it work?1. advertise the pirate market somewhere.2. create an image and upload it to anony.ws3. send us a private message with: your username on the pirate market, image link and link to the advertisment.does somewhere mean online or not or both?
if you start learning today, you might be good enough to make a market in two to four years. but you also need to learn how to secure a server, so more like 4 to 6 years if you are starting from what is essentially nothing. its a great plan to start learning these things, but dont read php for dummies and then run out and host a market you set up on windows server over rdp.

god damnit this shit is making me mad. all i ask for in life is one god damn site thats open more than 6 months at a time!
beyond aggravating when you cant even be logged in long enough to answer messages and do customer support. ughh im loving this market, too! hope they fix this - and soon.

tipulla kyllä hyviä pointteja... miksei tämä olemassa oleva kauppa riitä ? aina kun jokin asia laajenee, se on vaikeammin hallittavissa, virhealttius kasvaa ja mitä isompi bisnes, sitä enemmän se kerää huomiota kateellisilta ja virkavallalta. valitettavasti isomman bisneksen myötä tulee aina isommat voitot, mikä saattaa hieman sokeuttaa ja saada aikaan " voittamattoman " olotilan...

i havent any luck with trying to setup a new account as well, just no replies. but weve moved onto to other markets since. good luck.
there are support people there and the admins are active, there has just been an absolute flood of support messages (site has grown 4x+ in a month).past few days they have been working on clearing out the latest lot of scammers and refunding money to those who were ripped off.send your message again, theyll eventually get to it.

correct me, please. you are not talking about darkwallet, but about a new alt coin called darkcoin? cause i never heard of it.
i definately agree different people have diiferent threat models. and therefore buyers and sellers should act accordingly.
great to hear your on agoria!!you were my reg vendor last year, everything allways top notch!!
thank you for your time owock! all in working order.one question purely out if interest: my public key looks noticeably longer than ops, is that because i am using a 4096 key size and op isnt? or am i missing something?

well from what i can gather it is looking more and more like agora has run its race.i say this with great dissapointment. not just because of more lost vendor bonds and such. but ther is fuck all else left.thank god deepify has the answer.all i have got for the last 3 hours is this ... iceweasel cant find the file at http://agorabasakxmewww.onion/login.so its not on its server is it?
well these last 4 months have cetainly felt like 4 years worth of drama.its demoralizing.
...and its gone. (at this time anyways)
how does it work?1. advertise the pirate market somewhere.2. create an image and upload it to anony.ws3. send us a private message with: your username on the pirate market, image link and link to the advertisment.does somewhere mean online or not or both?

its interesting the whole group think thing.  i mean, you have all these buyers who crowd on one market and then they wonder why that market runs away with their funds.  maybe a million bucks is just too much temptation.i think the markets ought to work together in some way to spread the load.  maybe that is a stupid idea, i dont really know.  i know the markets want to make all the money, but having one place is just silly really.  i still think back to backopy and bmr and why he wanted to shutdown.  without more markets to spread load and le action then it is just too risky.i understand about having to check a bunch of sites everyday and do orders or whatever.  only so many hours i guess.

correct me, please. you are not talking about darkwallet, but about a new alt coin called darkcoin? cause i never heard of it.
sanotaan vaikka "land of hope" tai "realm of hope"hope sanan tilalle mahollisesti dreamstoivoa paremmasta kansalle siisja ylläpitäjä voisi olla vaikka "the protector" tai "overseer"joo, ei oikeen irtoo nyt, pitää koittaa jotain parempaa miettiä joskus jos jaksaa.
i havent any luck with trying to setup a new account as well, just no replies. but weve moved onto to other markets since. good luck.
there are support people there and the admins are active, there has just been an absolute flood of support messages (site has grown 4x+ in a month).past few days they have been working on clearing out the latest lot of scammers and refunding money to those who were ripped off.send your message again, theyll eventually get to it.
anywhere on the clearnet too? what if i create a pic and upload it as my avatar so every post i make any forums. that would be a new advertisement everytime and youre willing to pay me 0.01 btc for every post i make? youve got to be kidding. if not, am game! the math just doesnt add up? i see no sense in this but look forward to hear from you.
ok, ill check it out
i dont see much point in getting darkcoins unless you can use them to buy something or expect the value to go up. the fact that they will use coinjoin by default isnt too important when you can use coinjoin with bitcoins and there are a lot more people to mix your coins with.

im not disputing the fact that physical isolation is the most secure, merely bringing up the fact that different people have different threat models. you know theres a non-zero chance that you might get shot at any time but you dont wear a bullet proof vest all the time. think about why. whonix is *probably* good enough to visit the site that op is talking about and its free and can be deployed in under half an hour. so theres not much point to debating this any further.

its interesting the whole group think thing.  i mean, you have all these buyers who crowd on one market and then they wonder why that market runs away with their funds.  maybe a million bucks is just too much temptation.i think the markets ought to work together in some way to spread the load.  maybe that is a stupid idea, i dont really know.  i know the markets want to make all the money, but having one place is just silly really.  i still think back to backopy and bmr and why he wanted to shutdown.  without more markets to spread load and le action then it is just too risky.i understand about having to check a bunch of sites everyday and do orders or whatever.  only so many hours i guess.

if you start learning today, you might be good enough to make a market in two to four years. but you also need to learn how to secure a server, so more like 4 to 6 years if you are starting from what is essentially nothing. its a great plan to start learning these things, but dont read php for dummies and then run out and host a market you set up on windows server over rdp.

no, bitcoin could not possibly be it because it runs counter to everything the control freakish elites and the nwo stand for. neither btc not gold and silver fulfill that role.

well from what i can gather it is looking more and more like agora has run its race.i say this with great dissapointment. not just because of more lost vendor bonds and such. but ther is fuck all else left.thank god deepify has the answer.all i have got for the last 3 hours is this ... iceweasel cant find the file at http://agorabasakxmewww.onion/login.so its not on its server is it?
well these last 4 months have cetainly felt like 4 years worth of drama.its demoralizing.
...and its gone. (at this time anyways)
how does it work?1. advertise the pirate market somewhere.2. create an image and upload it to anony.ws3. send us a private message with: your username on the pirate market, image link and link to the advertisment.does somewhere mean online or not or both?

i also agree that axas guide to secure email providers is one of the most complete i have seen on the internet. good job axa! just be sure to do your research before placing trust in any email provider, as individual rules, as well as data-retention laws and other such factors vary between providers, and countries as well. and always use gpg regardless.

i have heard of bitblender? and that one is fairly instant. http://bitblendervrfkzr.onionbut overall bitfog takes the cake. it offers the best mixing service (only one to be studied) and i think the time it takes is no big deal once you get coins flowing.
please do not advertise goods or link to your marketplace before you are verified as a vendor at http://thehubaoydxrommh.onion/index.php?topic=12.0.- captain jack
countermail is a good service and they accept bitcoin now, but cost is $60/year. why pay that much when there are very good free (or lower cost) options? lelantos mail on tor is my number 1 recommendation, they only charge $18 a year or $32 for a lifetime subscription. you can access your lelantos mail account by one of two webmail interfaces (with or without javascript) or by imap or pop3, see my guide to setting up thunderbird with foxyproxy to access lelantos mail on tor at -  http://i4rx33ibdndtqayh.onion/index.php/topic,2091.msg23581.html#msg23581once you have thunderbird setup right you will really enjoy using lelantos mail that much more. highly recommended!
quote from: enigma on march 15, 2014, 06:53:56 amvmail.me is also a good option i didnt see in your list axa. they are tor-friendly and pretty legit, having been around for a while as well. and offer a web interface as well, which can be handy at times. although using tails with clawsmail or thunderbird with enigmail and torbirdy is still likely safer. but in a pinch? they seem pretty secure. or just as a back-up email or whatever. check em out..thanks for the tip, checked out vmail.me and the service is legit, added to list at http://thehubaoydxrommh.onion/index.php?topic=764.msg8917#msg8917
i value everyones opsec advice on this forum.  if i were to setup a tor middlebox, something like an onionpi, what would be the best browser setup.  i want to run something similar to the torbrowser without running tor over tor.  would something like firefox with noscript and httpseverywhere be secure enough?  ive read that using the torbutton addon for firefox is no longer secure.  any advice would be greatly appreciated.

the longer it takes to get your coins out, the harder taint analysis (tracking) is.  so, i would use bitcoinfog (the second one you posted) and set it to 12+ hours.  and expect it to take up to 30 hours, the site has been known to have delays.
does anyone know what is the best place to launder and anonymize bitcoins??i tried these three services so far:https://bitlaunder.com - clearnet site, 2 or 3% fee, fast, easy to use, several laundering options, tested successfully with 0.25btc (2.5hr laundering time)http://fogcore5n3ov3tui.onion/ - darknet site, 2 - 3% fee, somewhat slow (6-8hrs), easy to use, only one laundering option, tested successfully with 0.25 btc (7hr laundering time)http://bitcoinlaundry.com/ - i was afraid to test this site because it looked very suspicious. anyone recommend some others, or want to review bitcoinlaundry?

i value everyones opsec advice on this forum.  if i were to setup a tor middlebox, something like an onionpi, what would be the best browser setup.  i want to run something similar to the torbrowser without running tor over tor.  would something like firefox with noscript and httpseverywhere be secure enough?  ive read that using the torbutton addon for firefox is no longer secure.  any advice would be greatly appreciated.
if i were a buyer, i would want my address going to as few people folks, and i would want to make sure it is encrypted.  this doesnt seem possible with safepostage.

countermail is a good service and they accept bitcoin now, but cost is $60/year. why pay that much when there are very good free (or lower cost) options? lelantos mail on tor is my number 1 recommendation, they only charge $18 a year or $32 for a lifetime subscription. you can access your lelantos mail account by one of two webmail interfaces (with or without javascript) or by imap or pop3, see my guide to setting up thunderbird with foxyproxy to access lelantos mail on tor at -  http://i4rx33ibdndtqayh.onion/index.php/topic,2091.msg23581.html#msg23581once you have thunderbird setup right you will really enjoy using lelantos mail that much more. highly recommended!

blue sky was outted as a scam long time ago but alfred likes to keep scam sites listed here.
the longer it takes to get your coins out, the harder taint analysis (tracking) is.  so, i would use bitcoinfog (the second one you posted) and set it to 12+ hours.  and expect it to take up to 30 hours, the site has been known to have delays.

i checked out the site, and was not impressed. the site requires too much from you, slow, and now unresponsive.too little freedom on the site. not even sure how people are meant to see your listings, when you cant see them yourself.
bump.
it had been rather slow taking off, but am guessing thats the case with every new market as there are so many to chose from, and then folks are very wary with all new dnms.. from having been scammed multiple times lately. it takes time to build trust and for folks to part with their coins over a relatively new marketplace. but that said things have picked up over the last couple of weeks, mostly migrants from agora and the registrations have been steadily growing by the day.that in turn has brought about a good momentum in sales, but unfortunately for you its mostly from the drug selections and not ccs. though there have been a few cc inquiries on the support forum to which you could chip in. also i guess theres only so much a market can do after all. offer free vendor accounts for a couple of months along with zero commisions on all orders etc. payout bonus for referrals besides making sure by having a secure and bug free site for smooth transactions, but guess then the onus lies with the site users to get the good word around and refer their clients. were gradually getting there and good things take time!

if you do not want to use bitcoin fog your best alternative right now is probably shared coin. because you never lose control of your bitcoin it is not possible to lose coins. cannot happen. in a coinjoin mixer like shared coin multiple users sign a transaction, instead of just one user. now its hard to tell which user initiated the transaction, hence increased privacy. not as anonymous as bitcoin fog though.
any legit mixing service will take the time to get a listing at the bitcoin wiki page at:https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/category:mixing_servicesbefore sending your coins to a newer service it is a good idea to visit the bitcoin forum and check to see if there is a review thread for the service:https://bitcointalk.org/
whonix!!!https://www.whonix.orgthat said, if you dont know the difference between java and javascript, you shouldnt be using the darknet.  they are completely unrelated aside from the name and both being object-oriented.

i mean its always so fast and smooth. almost never a hiccup, its refreshing. i just wish the traffic would pick up a bit. the sr forums bashed bsm in the beginning as being a "scam" and they halted the growth. but i think the last 4 months have easily been my most flawless vending experience on the dn. the guys running it aare always making improvments. this makes me feel like its not some quick hit & run scam like smp, they simply spend so much time improving and adding security. post your experience at bsm in this thread!

im fairly new to the deep web (new year) and have perused through a few different markets but so far i like blue sky. agora was nice until all the traffic hit and silk road was sketchy from the start. ive completed about 15 transactions total across the three markets ive tried and have not received a package once (it got seized for a domestic order). so my luck has been pretty good.i like blue sky better so far for a few reasons. first, i like the feedback system. second, i like the stats bsm shows for each vendor. third, the speed of the marketplace is very good. once i make more transactions at bsm ill have a better idea of how i like it overall but so far i like it better than agora or sr2

what is happening with tba? i have seen some people starting to push out referral links hoping to cream off some buyers that use tba but other than that i have heard nothing. nothing at all. i logged on today, 4 days before i have been there for 2 months and i am still yet to sell a thing. im not complaining, i am here wondering why with sr2 going down, agora under ddos, people saying pandora vendors scam, there hasnt been a bigger charge towards tba.to just sit there doesnt bother me, i check in every few days to see if i have any questions to answer or orders to fill but i never have. is there not many vendors on tba or are buyers put off for some reason?
its the mentality. this is what goes through peoples heads tor bazzar? no listings. fuck that! agora? ddos? lots of stuff? well if they have lots of stuff ill go there! no one really cares about security it seems. im just waiting for mst to be implemented then i will push it hard to the people who value security + knows how a computer works. then we should have many tech savvy smart people buying + selling.

whonix!!!https://www.whonix.orgthat said, if you dont know the difference between java and javascript, you shouldnt be using the darknet.  they are completely unrelated aside from the name and both being object-oriented.
i would say all the new sites are running slow for trade. there are so many to choose from now so those that left the main ones are spread across a dozen or so sites. unless every buyer comes to this site the existence of many new markets is unknown.as with every business you have to go out and get the trade. its up to us vendors to steer any buyers we know in the direction. certainly tba will be one of the main sites in future as it is run well. out of the ten or so sites i vend only 2-3 are showing potential currently. tba is one of themalso quite noticeable in new sites is the absence of scammers. lets face it the main sites are getting flooded with them. some are selective scammers. they will have trouble getting onto some of these sites.

it had been rather slow taking off, but am guessing thats the case with every new market as there are so many to chose from, and then folks are very wary with all new dnms.. from having been scammed multiple times lately. it takes time to build trust and for folks to part with their coins over a relatively new marketplace. but that said things have picked up over the last couple of weeks, mostly migrants from agora and the registrations have been steadily growing by the day.that in turn has brought about a good momentum in sales, but unfortunately for you its mostly from the drug selections and not ccs. though there have been a few cc inquiries on the support forum to which you could chip in. also i guess theres only so much a market can do after all. offer free vendor accounts for a couple of months along with zero commisions on all orders etc. payout bonus for referrals besides making sure by having a secure and bug free site for smooth transactions, but guess then the onus lies with the site users to get the good word around and refer their clients. were gradually getting there and good things take time!
any legit mixing service will take the time to get a listing at the bitcoin wiki page at:https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/category:mixing_servicesbefore sending your coins to a newer service it is a good idea to visit the bitcoin forum and check to see if there is a review thread for the service:https://bitcointalk.org/
if you do not want to use bitcoin fog your best alternative right now is probably shared coin. because you never lose control of your bitcoin it is not possible to lose coins. cannot happen. in a coinjoin mixer like shared coin multiple users sign a transaction, instead of just one user. now its hard to tell which user initiated the transaction, hence increased privacy. not as anonymous as bitcoin fog though.

thanks for the input. tails looks interesting but, i'm not at that level of paranoia atm. coinbase seems to be the way to go. reddit praises it - i just don't like the idea of linking my bank account with something. i kind of want a more secure way of exchaning. anyone have experience with it?blockchain and hive are my two current wallets. one online & one hardware. i think i'll stop at that.
hello all,i've downloaded a wallet: hive for osx.i'm googling where to purchase coins and places like coincafe, coinbase all require me to make a wallet there too. so, i assume i create a wallet on those sites, purchase the coins, and transfer them to my hard drive wallet to be safe?what would you recommend to get started?

if you were really serious about it you could read the jolly roger's reference library in the security section on the hubhttp://thehubaoydxrommh.onion/index.phptoo much info for my tiny little mind
im fairly new to the deep web (new year) and have perused through a few different markets but so far i like blue sky. agora was nice until all the traffic hit and silk road was sketchy from the start. ive completed about 15 transactions total across the three markets ive tried and have not received a package once (it got seized for a domestic order). so my luck has been pretty good.i like blue sky better so far for a few reasons. first, i like the feedback system. second, i like the stats bsm shows for each vendor. third, the speed of the marketplace is very good. once i make more transactions at bsm ill have a better idea of how i like it overall but so far i like it better than agora or sr2

there are many far more knowledgable than me, but i'll answer a bit to help you along.coinbase is probably the most coin for your buck when it comes to easy places to buy bitcoin. there are other ways that you can buy cheaper bitcoins (btc-e), but its a royal pain in the ass if you live in the us.you can make and have as many wallets as you want to store your bitcoin in, either on your computer, or online. blockchain.info is trusted for online wallets. i am currently looking into running electrum from tails as a more secure wallet setup, and i believe that is the consensus for good basic opsec (operational security).i would reccomend that you use tails to minimize the possibility of your computer leaking info about you. it also makes things like pgp and otr messaging way easier as its all included in the os.its really easy to set up too, just download the iso image, and mount it to a dvd, thumb drive, or sd card. https://tails.boum.org/

quote from: damiel on march 16, 2014, 08:51:46 pmseconded, fast and smooth from the buyer point of view too.what was the bluesky fud spread on the silk road forums when bluesky first opened?  i dont remember seeing that.right around christmas when sr was hitting rough waters a few people posted links for bsm, agora, and pandora. bsm was instantly deemed "a scam". then nobody mentioned it anymore. for the last 3-4 months bsm has been anything but a scam. agora does that "referral" program where people get paid to spam their address so it was way overhyped and is probably going to be the first to fall. it got too big too fast. blue sky has had time to mature and from what the staff told me they are only at like 2% capacity so i feel like it will be around longer than the other two. sr forums pretty much dictate what happens w/ dnms and they jumped the gun on bsm basically halting growth. but as it perseveres and outlasts market after market, it will grow. the admins are always updating things. its really nice to see a market where the operators really care.
i mean its always so fast and smooth. almost never a hiccup, its refreshing. i just wish the traffic would pick up a bit. the sr forums bashed bsm in the beginning as being a "scam" and they halted the growth. but i think the last 4 months have easily been my most flawless vending experience on the dn. the guys running it aare always making improvments. this makes me feel like its not some quick hit & run scam like smp, they simply spend so much time improving and adding security. post your experience at bsm in this thread!

when i try to log in it says "wrong username or password", i tried it 3 days, but still doesnt work.special problem with my account, or is agora still down?

best option is to run tor browser with its many privacy and security patches. if youre running a tor middle box, presumably you are running linux on the main box? whonix developers recommend to run it in a vm to hide hardware serial numbers, mac address, etc.i use this script as start-tor-browser to run tor browser without tor (so no tor over tor).#!/bin/bashexport tor_skip_launch=1    cd ~~/tor-browser_en-us/browser/firefox --profile ~/tor-browser_en-us/data/browser/profile.default
thanks for the input. tails looks interesting but, i'm not at that level of paranoia atm. coinbase seems to be the way to go. reddit praises it - i just don't like the idea of linking my bank account with something. i kind of want a more secure way of exchaning. anyone have experience with it?blockchain and hive are my two current wallets. one online & one hardware. i think i'll stop at that.
hello all,i've downloaded a wallet: hive for osx.i'm googling where to purchase coins and places like coincafe, coinbase all require me to make a wallet there too. so, i assume i create a wallet on those sites, purchase the coins, and transfer them to my hard drive wallet to be safe?what would you recommend to get started?
bump.

i would say all the new sites are running slow for trade. there are so many to choose from now so those that left the main ones are spread across a dozen or so sites. unless every buyer comes to this site the existence of many new markets is unknown.as with every business you have to go out and get the trade. its up to us vendors to steer any buyers we know in the direction. certainly tba will be one of the main sites in future as it is run well. out of the ten or so sites i vend only 2-3 are showing potential currently. tba is one of themalso quite noticeable in new sites is the absence of scammers. lets face it the main sites are getting flooded with them. some are selective scammers. they will have trouble getting onto some of these sites.

if you do not want to use bitcoin fog your best alternative right now is probably shared coin. because you never lose control of your bitcoin it is not possible to lose coins. cannot happen. in a coinjoin mixer like shared coin multiple users sign a transaction, instead of just one user. now its hard to tell which user initiated the transaction, hence increased privacy. not as anonymous as bitcoin fog though.
any legit mixing service will take the time to get a listing at the bitcoin wiki page at:https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/category:mixing_servicesbefore sending your coins to a newer service it is a good idea to visit the bitcoin forum and check to see if there is a review thread for the service:https://bitcointalk.org/
if you were really serious about it you could read the jolly roger's reference library in the security section on the hubhttp://thehubaoydxrommh.onion/index.phptoo much info for my tiny little mind
im fairly new to the deep web (new year) and have perused through a few different markets but so far i like blue sky. agora was nice until all the traffic hit and silk road was sketchy from the start. ive completed about 15 transactions total across the three markets ive tried and have not received a package once (it got seized for a domestic order). so my luck has been pretty good.i like blue sky better so far for a few reasons. first, i like the feedback system. second, i like the stats bsm shows for each vendor. third, the speed of the marketplace is very good. once i make more transactions at bsm ill have a better idea of how i like it overall but so far i like it better than agora or sr2
according to all his words accentuate about traffic... a good market requires traffic.easy handling, no problems for deposits, no problems for withdrawals, good system for contact pgp, correct communication with admins ,  etc.for now it is fast and safe. cheers !!
seconded, fast and smooth from the buyer point of view too.what was the bluesky fud spread on the silk road forums when bluesky first opened?  i dont remember seeing that.
there are many far more knowledgable than me, but i'll answer a bit to help you along.coinbase is probably the most coin for your buck when it comes to easy places to buy bitcoin. there are other ways that you can buy cheaper bitcoins (btc-e), but its a royal pain in the ass if you live in the us.you can make and have as many wallets as you want to store your bitcoin in, either on your computer, or online. blockchain.info is trusted for online wallets. i am currently looking into running electrum from tails as a more secure wallet setup, and i believe that is the consensus for good basic opsec (operational security).i would reccomend that you use tails to minimize the possibility of your computer leaking info about you. it also makes things like pgp and otr messaging way easier as its all included in the os.its really easy to set up too, just download the iso image, and mount it to a dvd, thumb drive, or sd card. https://tails.boum.org/
kiinnostaisi kyllä tietää, että mitä tämä kansainvälistyminen käytännössä tarkoittaa.
miksi pitää mennä kansainväliseksi? miksi edes ulkomaalaisia kiinnostaisi tämä kauppapaikka, niillähän on monia muita sitä varten. itse ainakin toivoisin että tämä pysyisi vain suomalaisten keskuudessa, eikä edes tarvitsisi mainostaa liikaa ettei täältä rupea alaikäiset tilaamaan tavaraa ja saa lukea sitten lehdistä kun ovat päätyneet sairaalaan.

it had been rather slow taking off, but am guessing thats the case with every new market as there are so many to chose from, and then folks are very wary with all new dnms.. from having been scammed multiple times lately. it takes time to build trust and for folks to part with their coins over a relatively new marketplace. but that said things have picked up over the last couple of weeks, mostly migrants from agora and the registrations have been steadily growing by the day.that in turn has brought about a good momentum in sales, but unfortunately for you its mostly from the drug selections and not ccs. though there have been a few cc inquiries on the support forum to which you could chip in. also i guess theres only so much a market can do after all. offer free vendor accounts for a couple of months along with zero commisions on all orders etc. payout bonus for referrals besides making sure by having a secure and bug free site for smooth transactions, but guess then the onus lies with the site users to get the good word around and refer their clients. were gradually getting there and good things take time!
i checked out the site, and was not impressed. the site requires too much from you, slow, and now unresponsive.too little freedom on the site. not even sure how people are meant to see your listings, when you cant see them yourself.
i mean its always so fast and smooth. almost never a hiccup, its refreshing. i just wish the traffic would pick up a bit. the sr forums bashed bsm in the beginning as being a "scam" and they halted the growth. but i think the last 4 months have easily been my most flawless vending experience on the dn. the guys running it aare always making improvments. this makes me feel like its not some quick hit & run scam like smp, they simply spend so much time improving and adding security. post your experience at bsm in this thread!
quote from: damiel on march 16, 2014, 08:51:46 pmseconded, fast and smooth from the buyer point of view too.what was the bluesky fud spread on the silk road forums when bluesky first opened?  i dont remember seeing that.right around christmas when sr was hitting rough waters a few people posted links for bsm, agora, and pandora. bsm was instantly deemed "a scam". then nobody mentioned it anymore. for the last 3-4 months bsm has been anything but a scam. agora does that "referral" program where people get paid to spam their address so it was way overhyped and is probably going to be the first to fall. it got too big too fast. blue sky has had time to mature and from what the staff told me they are only at like 2% capacity so i feel like it will be around longer than the other two. sr forums pretty much dictate what happens w/ dnms and they jumped the gun on bsm basically halting growth. but as it perseveres and outlasts market after market, it will grow. the admins are always updating things. its really nice to see a market where the operators really care.
i was also impressed with the deposit time. i used blockchains tumbling service for the first time to do my deposit (i had always used bitcoinfog before) and my btc was in my bsm wallet within twenty minutes. i was very happy and impressed.i have a thought on "partial-fe": why dont we rename that option to "down payment".. lol

hello,it doesnt matter where you advertise.you are only once allowed to enter the event.greetings
what is happening with tba? i have seen some people starting to push out referral links hoping to cream off some buyers that use tba but other than that i have heard nothing. nothing at all. i logged on today, 4 days before i have been there for 2 months and i am still yet to sell a thing. im not complaining, i am here wondering why with sr2 going down, agora under ddos, people saying pandora vendors scam, there hasnt been a bigger charge towards tba.to just sit there doesnt bother me, i check in every few days to see if i have any questions to answer or orders to fill but i never have. is there not many vendors on tba or are buyers put off for some reason?
its the mentality. this is what goes through peoples heads tor bazzar? no listings. fuck that! agora? ddos? lots of stuff? well if they have lots of stuff ill go there! no one really cares about security it seems. im just waiting for mst to be implemented then i will push it hard to the people who value security + knows how a computer works. then we should have many tech savvy smart people buying + selling.
