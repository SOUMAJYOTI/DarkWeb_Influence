you should think twice about bitcoin fog though quite few people calling them out selective scammers the moment.

from presidente january amupdate this post has been updated take into account current gnupg behavior and encryption sub key selection. 
are motivated post this recent post from the subject comments from hux nightcrawler and one two queries received the topic. 
that well thought out post here and would suggest worth read. 
php topic cannot find any step step instructions for rolling keys here the forum have put this post together. 
risk rationalethere risk attached the fact that over time can collect many messages all which are encrypted the same encryption sub key and all which can decrypted using single static pgp private key. 
the effect this data aggregation and lack key change significantly increase the impact key compromise. 
data retention practices have been poor for whatever reason historic data extractable then this problem can become very significant. 
counter measureswe are able counter the effects data aggregation some extent periodically changing rolling the encryption key and there are two obvious ways doing that throw away the old key and use new key perhaps signing the new key with the old prove that the key change legitimate and redistributeor keep the existing pgp key and identity but periodically change the encryption sub key and post will describe the option which useful where the keyholder wants keep their identity but still benefit from rolling encryption keys periodically. 
also useful when wanting increase key size while retaining your the original key identity. 
the period should short practically possible but remember that you will have make copy your new key available each time key expires choose something achievable like months. 
with month roll period you reduce your maximum exposure single key compromise worst case months. 
that means your key compromised adversary they will only have access maximum months encrypted data. 
most two encryption keys are stored the pgp key any one time provide overlap period and that why the maximum exposure month keys. 
most the time the exposure actually only months. 
the overall process fairly although requires discipline create your pgp public key you have not already configure your encryption sub key expire months time distribute your key months later month before the first sub key expires you must create additional encryption sub key set expire months time month later shortly after the first sub key expires you must delete. 
this will leave you with the single current encryption sub key again. 
back step warning once you have deleted encryption sub key anything you encrypted lost forever. 
the steps detailed below are primarily for linux users although they are applicable any reasonable version gnupg that incorporates the command line client gpg gpg. 
have used seahorse where possible relatively use for non technical users. 
initial key hash hardeningthe first step perform your key select stronger hashes default rather than sha. 
this not essential but recommended and one time process. 
you should complete these small steps from the command line execute gpg edit key where your pgp keyid the gpg prompt enter setpref sha sha sha sha aes aes aes cast zlib bzip zip uncompressed confirm changes and when you are back the gpg prompt type save using the example key shall use illustrate rolling encryption keys the above looks like this code select user server gpg edit key gpg gnupg.

onion gpg save now actually set expiry and get your encryption sub keys rolling regular basis. 
provide two methods using seahorse simple gui using gpg the command line tool. 
key rolling using seahorsethe following steps illustrate how use seahorse gui based key management application create manage and maintain rolling encryption sub keys make sure you have copy your keypair your whole keyring before proceeding just case. 
download seahorse you dont already have this will make the job key maintenance easier think start seahorse and locate your key double click and click the details tab and locate the subkeys section. 
the bottom the tab section called subkeys here you can add remove and edit all keys easily. 
the top sub key listed the master key. 
will ignore that one your primary identity. 
the second key your encryption sub key this the sub key that are going edit and start roll periodically. 
select the second subkey hopefully the encryption subkey and click expire you have not yet set expire. 
the pop calendar unclick never expires and select date the future when you want the key expire let choose months the future. 
when done click change. 
you are done for now make sure works then delete that backup you took earlier and redistribute your public key. 
the main public key your identity will remain the same there little reason for anyone doubt the legitimacy the key change. 
the new key effectively signed does not necessarily need further explanation recipients. 
month before your encryption sub key expires time create replacement and redistribute follows. 
month before expiry fire seahorse. 
select your key double click and click the details tab navigating the sub keys section click add key add the next encryption sub key and select the following settings key type rsa encrypt only key length bit expiration date set this months from now redistribute your keya month later when your old encryption sub key expires you remove the expired key leaving you with the current key that you created above step. 
there need redistribute your key this stage. 
using seahorse again select your key double click and click the details tab the sub keys section select the now expired sub key and click delete now back above step month before the next key expires. 
this cycle repeats for the operational lifetime the key. 
key rolling using the gpg command line toolthe gpg command line tools provides the most granular control keys and usually accessible most systems. 
make sure you have copy your keypair your whole keyring before proceeding just case. 
execute gpg list key where your pgp keyid this point you should see output which shows the main public key and encryption sub key below code select user server gpg list keys pub uid rollf keyz ein rollfz mein keyz. 
onion sub here see that the main key with pub listed before and following that see subkey with sub listed before. 
some you may only have single key shown this the case then you will first need add encryption sub key. 
execute gpg edit key where your pgp keyid the gpg prompt enter key this will select the subkey the prompt enter expire and when prompted enter for the time period months confirm changes and when you are back the gpg prompt type save you are done make sure works then delete that backup you took earlier and redistribute your public key.

onion gpg save now you have two encryption sub keys the first technically valid for the next month expiring april and the second which will valid for the next months will expiring june. 
there conflict here pgp software will default the newest encryption sub key and will automatically start using the new sub key. 
lets wind forward month when your current encryption sub key expires. 
you will remove the expired key leaving you with the new current key that you created earlier steps there need redistribute your key this point.

onion gpg savenow you will see that our original encryption sub key has gone. 
will longer possible use this pgp key recover any messages data encrypted that original encryption sub key. 
our current key due expire june and one month before this happens will generate new sub key per step. 
this cycle repeats for the operational lifetime the key and requires redistribute our key every months. 
remember though the actual key identity remains the same just the encryption sub key that changing. 
final noteit important purge any and all backups your key every time you roll the encryption sub keys otherwise there little point rolling encryption keys. 
you must aware that all data encrypted old and expired sub keys that you have deleted purged will not recoverable. 
this may seem daunting but certainly makes good sense from risk reduction perspective. 
using the seahorse method above relatively painless and may save your ass.

and use auto they are coming out all the time. 
sorry willow maybe support can sort you out. 
have had problems recently whatsoever began think that the weird blockchain stuff saw was some kind tumbling being implemented experimentally and after another nearly hour wait everything ended where was supposed. 
closed second ticket last night but today support got back ill copy paste sorry werent able reply before you closed the ticket. 
were the process changing our payment system increase security and make tracing btc more difficult. 
apologize for any delays resulting from this. 
also had one batch payments run two instances simultaneously several days ago which what you most likely noticed the form double payment sent you. 
that was one time issue and will not happen again and all accounts have been balanced after that. 
just for reference consider user and bitcoin safety our highest priority and having delayed and completely detached payment system keeps our system protected from number potential attacks that other markets have experienced. 
imo bsm continues have the best support the biz yay good hear. 
they are constantly making security updates. 
really gives positive vibes. 
not only that the site secure and very anonymous but that they wouldnt spend much time coding they were gonna just grab and run. 
really gives feeling stability. 
remember never made any noticable changes and didnt even fix the simple things like auto finalize this kept lot more money the site stolen and look what happened.

hola drugees and drugettes damiel present here the hub and bluesky from time time. 
were lucky have blackstar and jules winnfield keeping this subforum alive and kicking. 
from wit march ami noticed that far the roll call only showing vendors. 
how many you mention the blue sky sub the hub your customers thing blue sky has forum and because the hub not affiliated anywhere its very unlikely that bsm owners will actively divert users here from their market site doubt many users even know exists. 
hey wit any idea why darknetmarkets doesnt link the hub cant see obvious conflict interest there. 
personally much more comfy posting vendor review.

netvfe mail has been around since and now has their own way reducing metadata attached email. 
vfemails metadata mitigator automatically rewrites the from address the mail unique address for each email sent creating virtual forwarding boxes which renders the gathering and cataloging useless your real email address never shown. 
prevents the nsa any other eavesdropper from tracking your communications back you profiling your communications based email metadata information.

sorry willow maybe support can sort you out. 
have had problems recently whatsoever began think that the weird blockchain stuff saw was some kind tumbling being implemented experimentally and after another nearly hour wait everything ended where was supposed. 
closed second ticket last night but today support got back ill copy paste sorry werent able reply before you closed the ticket. 
were the process changing our payment system increase security and make tracing btc more difficult. 
apologize for any delays resulting from this. 
also had one batch payments run two instances simultaneously several days ago which what you most likely noticed the form double payment sent you. 
that was one time issue and will not happen again and all accounts have been balanced after that. 
just for reference consider user and bitcoin safety our highest priority and having delayed and completely detached payment system keeps our system protected from number potential attacks that other markets have experienced. 
imo bsm continues have the best support the biz yay good hear. 
they are constantly making security updates. 
really gives positive vibes. 
not only that the site secure and very anonymous but that they wouldnt spend much time coding they were gonna just grab and run. 
really gives feeling stability. 
remember never made any noticable changes and didnt even fix the simple things like auto finalize this kept lot more money the site stolen and look what happened. 
bsm not like that all. 
wasnt able import the key you had posted until changed looked like some the lines crossed each other and had messed the key. 
good for you acidcat pgp must our world.

until then yawning chasm exists between what they want and what theyre going get. 
unfortunately for the most part ease use antithetical security. 
recent years have seen some sad examples hushmail and haystacks name just two. 
suspect that there are not inconsiderable number people who have done are doing hard time due the fact that they trusted hushmails fatally flawed security model. 
those people paid very dear price for ease use.

that well thought out post here and would suggest worth read. 
php topic cannot find any step step instructions for rolling keys here the forum have put this post together. 
risk rationalethere risk attached the fact that over time can collect many messages all which are encrypted the same encryption sub key and all which can decrypted using single static pgp private key. 
the effect this data aggregation and lack key change significantly increase the impact key compromise. 
data retention practices have been poor for whatever reason historic data extractable then this problem can become very significant. 
counter measureswe are able counter the effects data aggregation some extent periodically changing rolling the encryption key and there are two obvious ways doing that throw away the old key and use new key perhaps signing the new key with the old prove that the key change legitimate and redistributeor keep the existing pgp key and identity but periodically change the encryption sub key and post will describe the option which useful where the keyholder wants keep their identity but still benefit from rolling encryption keys periodically. 
also useful when wanting increase key size while retaining your the original key identity. 
the period should short practically possible but remember that you will have make copy your new key available each time key expires choose something achievable like months. 
with month roll period you reduce your maximum exposure single key compromise worst case months. 
that means your key compromised adversary they will only have access maximum months encrypted data. 
most two encryption keys are stored the pgp key any one time provide overlap period and that why the maximum exposure month keys. 
most the time the exposure actually only months. 
the overall process fairly although requires discipline create your pgp public key you have not already configure your encryption sub key expire months time distribute your key months later month before the first sub key expires you must create additional encryption sub key set expire months time month later shortly after the first sub key expires you must delete. 
this will leave you with the single current encryption sub key again. 
back step warning once you have deleted encryption sub key anything you encrypted lost forever. 
the steps detailed below are primarily for linux users although they are applicable any reasonable version gnupg that incorporates the command line client gpg gpg.

when done click change. 
you are done for now make sure works then delete that backup you took earlier and redistribute your public key.

from presidente january amupdate this post has been updated take into account current gnupg behavior and encryption sub key selection. 
are motivated post this recent post from the subject comments from hux nightcrawler and one two queries received the topic. 
that well thought out post here and would suggest worth read. 
php topic cannot find any step step instructions for rolling keys here the forum have put this post together. 
risk rationalethere risk attached the fact that over time can collect many messages all which are encrypted the same encryption sub key and all which can decrypted using single static pgp private key. 
the effect this data aggregation and lack key change significantly increase the impact key compromise. 
data retention practices have been poor for whatever reason historic data extractable then this problem can become very significant. 
counter measureswe are able counter the effects data aggregation some extent periodically changing rolling the encryption key and there are two obvious ways doing that throw away the old key and use new key perhaps signing the new key with the old prove that the key change legitimate and redistributeor keep the existing pgp key and identity but periodically change the encryption sub key and post will describe the option which useful where the keyholder wants keep their identity but still benefit from rolling encryption keys periodically. 
also useful when wanting increase key size while retaining your the original key identity. 
the period should short practically possible but remember that you will have make copy your new key available each time key expires choose something achievable like months. 
with month roll period you reduce your maximum exposure single key compromise worst case months. 
that means your key compromised adversary they will only have access maximum months encrypted data. 
most two encryption keys are stored the pgp key any one time provide overlap period and that why the maximum exposure month keys. 
most the time the exposure actually only months. 
the overall process fairly although requires discipline create your pgp public key you have not already configure your encryption sub key expire months time distribute your key months later month before the first sub key expires you must create additional encryption sub key set expire months time month later shortly after the first sub key expires you must delete. 
this will leave you with the single current encryption sub key again. 
back step warning once you have deleted encryption sub key anything you encrypted lost forever. 
the steps detailed below are primarily for linux users although they are applicable any reasonable version gnupg that incorporates the command line client gpg gpg. 
have used seahorse where possible relatively use for non technical users. 
initial key hash hardeningthe first step perform your key select stronger hashes default rather than sha. 
this not essential but recommended and one time process. 
you should complete these small steps from the command line execute gpg edit key where your pgp keyid the gpg prompt enter setpref sha sha sha sha aes aes aes cast zlib bzip zip uncompressed confirm changes and when you are back the gpg prompt type save using the example key shall use illustrate rolling encryption keys the above looks like this code select user server gpg edit key gpg gnupg.

onion gpg save now actually set expiry and get your encryption sub keys rolling regular basis. 
provide two methods using seahorse simple gui using gpg the command line tool. 
key rolling using seahorsethe following steps illustrate how use seahorse gui based key management application create manage and maintain rolling encryption sub keys make sure you have copy your keypair your whole keyring before proceeding just case. 
download seahorse you dont already have this will make the job key maintenance easier think start seahorse and locate your key double click and click the details tab and locate the subkeys section. 
the bottom the tab section called subkeys here you can add remove and edit all keys easily. 
the top sub key listed the master key. 
will ignore that one your primary identity. 
the second key your encryption sub key this the sub key that are going edit and start roll periodically. 
select the second subkey hopefully the encryption subkey and click expire you have not yet set expire. 
the pop calendar unclick never expires and select date the future when you want the key expire let choose months the future. 
when done click change. 
you are done for now make sure works then delete that backup you took earlier and redistribute your public key. 
the main public key your identity will remain the same there little reason for anyone doubt the legitimacy the key change. 
the new key effectively signed does not necessarily need further explanation recipients. 
month before your encryption sub key expires time create replacement and redistribute follows. 
month before expiry fire seahorse. 
select your key double click and click the details tab navigating the sub keys section click add key add the next encryption sub key and select the following settings key type rsa encrypt only key length bit expiration date set this months from now redistribute your keya month later when your old encryption sub key expires you remove the expired key leaving you with the current key that you created above step. 
there need redistribute your key this stage. 
using seahorse again select your key double click and click the details tab the sub keys section select the now expired sub key and click delete now back above step month before the next key expires. 
this cycle repeats for the operational lifetime the key. 
key rolling using the gpg command line toolthe gpg command line tools provides the most granular control keys and usually accessible most systems. 
make sure you have copy your keypair your whole keyring before proceeding just case. 
execute gpg list key where your pgp keyid this point you should see output which shows the main public key and encryption sub key below code select user server gpg list keys pub uid rollf keyz ein rollfz mein keyz. 
onion sub here see that the main key with pub listed before and following that see subkey with sub listed before. 
some you may only have single key shown this the case then you will first need add encryption sub key. 
execute gpg edit key where your pgp keyid the gpg prompt enter key this will select the subkey the prompt enter expire and when prompted enter for the time period months confirm changes and when you are back the gpg prompt type save you are done make sure works then delete that backup you took earlier and redistribute your public key.

onion gpg save now you have two encryption sub keys the first technically valid for the next month expiring april and the second which will valid for the next months will expiring june. 
there conflict here pgp software will default the newest encryption sub key and will automatically start using the new sub key. 
lets wind forward month when your current encryption sub key expires. 
you will remove the expired key leaving you with the new current key that you created earlier steps there need redistribute your key this point. 
the steps for this key deletion are execute gpg edit key where your pgp keyid the gpg prompt enter key this will select the now expired sub key the gpg prompt enter delkey confirm changes and when you are back the gpg prompt type save this key purge looks like this using our example key code select user server gpg edit key gpg gnupg.

onion gpg savenow you will see that our original encryption sub key has gone. 
will longer possible use this pgp key recover any messages data encrypted that original encryption sub key. 
our current key due expire june and one month before this happens will generate new sub key per step. 
this cycle repeats for the operational lifetime the key and requires redistribute our key every months. 
remember though the actual key identity remains the same just the encryption sub key that changing. 
final noteit important purge any and all backups your key every time you roll the encryption sub keys otherwise there little point rolling encryption keys. 
you must aware that all data encrypted old and expired sub keys that you have deleted purged will not recoverable. 
this may seem daunting but certainly makes good sense from risk reduction perspective. 
using the seahorse method above relatively painless and may save your ass.

but that the price for privacy and good way achieve. 
axolotl realize anything new will need prove itself over time.

bitmessage pans out maybe they will get their wish nor not. 
until then yawning chasm exists between what they want and what theyre going get. 
unfortunately for the most part ease use antithetical security. 
recent years have seen some sad examples hushmail and haystacks name just two. 
suspect that there are not inconsiderable number people who have done are doing hard time due the fact that they trusted hushmails fatally flawed security model. 
those people paid very dear price for ease use. 
from weeble march pmim not speaking for myself.

only response these people would harsh one tell them get their heads out their asses wake and smell the coffee.

addition whats already been said about encrypting stuff yourself you can also add hidden encrypt xlongkeyidhere your gpg.

use that with most pgp messages can always back and read what ive written others.

you can fake bitcoin transaction. 
but its not something lila and his ipad can accomplish. 
understanding you need have good the overall hash rate and able process whole blocks your own. 
you proccess block and somehow edit into saying you have have not sent btc certain address. 
can confirmed multiple times but the more confirmations needs the more processing power you need. 
sorry for the incredibly non technical explanation. 
havent read too far into. 
only have like processing power. 
that completely incorrect. 
nobody can fake bitcoin transaction. 
the most you can with attack slow transactions from being confirmed mine longer chain secret that you can undo confirmed transaction not mining your longer secret chain and then publishing your longer chain and effectively doing the transaction. 
but thats because the now official longer chain that transaction never happened only got mined into the now orphaned chain. 
thats the danger attack. 
you cannot fake bitcoin transactions. 
all bitcoin transactions are digitally signed the private key with the funds which means the message alice sends money bob cannot altered without invalidating the signature. 
onion are currently working for. 
please not direct people email any other direct message system for the purpose trade. 
also not advertise goods link your marketplace before you are verified vendor. 
here how works. 
let take alice bob carol and david. 
alice mines the coins herself. 
this her proof the coins existence. 
alice sends the coins from alice bob. 
order this alice has prove that she owns the coins she provides the transaction which shows she mined the coins then when sending the coins bob accepted the bitcoin network nodes. 
next bob wants send the coins carol. 
bob proves owns the coins providing the transaction that alice sent coins bob proof ownership then can send the coins carol and again should accepted the bitcoin network. 
then carol can send the coins david providing proof and forth. 
can fake bitcoins created yes and has been done before. 
quotetwo hackers have been arrested accused creating fake cache the bitcoin internet currency germany. 
police said they used the processing power linked hacked computers generate the bitcoins cryptography based digital currency. 
world news europe hackers arrested over fake bitcoins. 
htmlin other words they used botnet create them. 
how did they they falsely created blocks and broadcasted them the bitcoin network. 
the way that this works that every block the blockchain contains string transactions accepted the network. 
your job hacker create your own block including some real transactions and some false ones that pay you and have accepted the other miners before another miners block accepted. 
then whoever wins the race having their block accepted will have their block become part the blockchain. 
whenever there dispute between blocks the blockchain splits and the longest chain meaning the one with the most blocks wins and accepted. 
again this has been done before but getting more and more difficult this especially with the patches being released the bitcoin developers but you had enough computational power could done. 
just hope you over tor which will significantly reduce your chances getting your block into the longest chain but will also protect you from getting caught. 
very very very difficult. 
well its not like that wasnt the cards for few months now. 
russia out china out. 
will russia and china another crypto think they are allowed they banned bitcoin not cryptos. 
one thing you can never get real gauge watching those troll boxes. 
you want see real fud chucking take peek sometime. 
its hour show.

tails looks interesting but i'm not that level paranoia atm. 
coinbase seems the way. 
reddit praises just don't like the idea linking bank account with something. 
kind want more secure way exchaning. 
anyone have experience with blockchain and hive are two current wallets. 
one online one hardware. 
think i'll stop that. 
coinbase legit and very easy use. 
waiting period sucks you don't have visa linked the account but its worth for convenience's sake imo. 
wouldn't worried about linking your bank account why would you trust any less than say paypal paypal much shadier company and admit have account linked them well. 
shit hits the fan there's legal recourse and due the nature bitcoin your purchases made with them will not issue.

then whoever wins the race having their block accepted will have their block become part the blockchain. 
whenever there dispute between blocks the blockchain splits and the longest chain meaning the one with the most blocks wins and accepted. 
again this has been done before but getting more and more difficult this especially with the patches being released the bitcoin developers but you had enough computational power could done. 
just hope you over tor which will significantly reduce your chances getting your block into the longest chain but will also protect you from getting caught. 
very very very difficult. 
well its not like that wasnt the cards for few months now. 
russia out china out. 
will russia and china another crypto think they are allowed they banned bitcoin not cryptos. 
one thing you can never get real gauge watching those troll boxes. 
you want see real fud chucking take peek sometime. 
its hour show. 
like long since passed grand pappy used say. 
used say boy used say. 
boy dont you worry about the price coin will always rebound and excell itself every time. 
look again and its. 
from jules winnfield march ami really sincerely hope that when wake tomorrow and see coin price will say something the range. 
yeah like dream too jules. 
but that would about just right where need for the day isnt going happen. 
have odds sitting around ish upon waking. 
lets see who wins this duel. 
does anybody have any real news what going the exchanges reason why this. 
yeah it's going make paying for some things difficult for but this the nature bitcoin. 
it's quite annoying and expensive need buffer any amount buy account for changes the price but there's not really any better system. 
the price changes today were fairly big last recall it'd dropped about per coin clue what's causing the price plummet. 
wise words viking just makes feel like idiot not being able through with the original plans. 
had messaged vendor asking for order never replied now coins are worth. 
this has been long stressful day now when said vendor replies have ask for even smaller amount because how volatile the market right now. 
from acidcat march ami had messaged vendor asking for order never replied now coins are worth. 
this has been long stressful day now when said vendor replies have ask for even smaller amount because how volatile the market right now. 
hey brother this place more relaxed environment it's not like other marketplaces. 
you need place order instantly use marketplace because you lock price and that what the marketplace format for. 
vendors cannot predict the market and base their whole schedule accomdate constantly fluctuating currency. 
bitcoin would have doubled that time you wouldnt complaining about. 
but the beauty bitcoin that allows what with ease and security. 
just today lost probably lost someone's quarterly salary but i'm okay with that because know the risks involved. 
it's the nature the beast friend. 
bump hurry there are still some samples left. 
want some too. 
from evilgrin march pmlol. 
you can fake bitcoin transaction. 
but its not something lila and his ipad can accomplish. 
understanding you need have good the overall hash rate and able process whole blocks your own. 
you proccess block and somehow edit into saying you have have not sent btc certain address. 
can confirmed multiple times but the more confirmations needs the more processing power you need. 
sorry for the incredibly non technical explanation. 
havent read too far into. 
only have like processing power. 
that completely incorrect. 
nobody can fake bitcoin transaction. 
the most you can with attack slow transactions from being confirmed mine longer chain secret that you can undo confirmed transaction not mining your longer secret chain and then publishing your longer chain and effectively doing the transaction. 
but thats because the now official longer chain that transaction never happened only got mined into the now orphaned chain. 
thats the danger attack. 
you cannot fake bitcoin transactions. 
all bitcoin transactions are digitally signed the private key with the funds which means the message alice sends money bob cannot altered without invalidating the signature. 
they dont plan they already have its called windows. 
php darkwallet roadmap months and this where their atquotebase wallet key management bip yes check. 
png receive yes check. 
png send yes check. 
png show history yes check. 
png looks like they almost have basic functioning wallet. 
updates their indigogo page says they will longer updating the project there and the above site which also features updates. 
com projects bitcoin dark wallet comments look these comments the only ones posted over the last three months johnfox said days agono update here either. 
anonymous contributor said days agodid not receive the backerit email max said days agonever received anything. 
haven gotten email from backerkit either. 
even sent email after the last update saying that should email didn get the backerkit link. 
didn receive reply about month. 
just nada don pomeroy said days agonever received shirt tom gorman said days agonever received the shirt but more importantly still darkwallet updates. 
whats happening team jesse rodgers said month agoalso wondering about perks happy contribute the campaign but was looking forward bitcoin magazine subscription. 
tried emailing once but haven heard anything. 
shouldr said month agowhat happening still have not heard from backerkit about claiming perk and been trying get touch with you guys for over week. 
osclark said month agoi with peter. 
wtf going heard nothing since this thing ended. 
trying join the btc market but want secure wallet. 
that was the whole idea right let get this thing going please. 
peter said month agohey guys whats with this project any news over month now since the campaign was funded estimated delivery for some perks was december and still not even update looking forward here some news from you cheersbut they have highly produced video and professionally designed website extolling all their fundementals. 
net usd and bitcoins raised piece quotenever received the shirt but more importantly still darkwallet updates. 
whats happening team jesse rodgers said month agoand didnt even get lousy shirt. 
onion are currently working for. 
load qoinpros site and read what says the tab lol personally wouldnt trust anyone with cryptocurrency they cant even spell litecoin. 
also was thinking about this correct wrong but say signed for qoinpro account the clearnet using proper email address linked real name then posted unique referral link for others use sign for account darknet forum through tor under anonymous nym itd pretty easy for law enforcement and qoinpro trace the referral link left the nym back the identifiable email address used sign thus the nym. 
also anyone using that link sign the link being watched could potentially have their activity addresses watched seeing they obtained their link from the darknet they might worth watching. 
just speculating dont know much about the subject yet really could someone smarter than comment this please just thought before the onslaught referral links begins. 
really sincerely hope that when wake tomorrow and see coin price will say something the range. 
dont see how the whole hedging thing would work any market. 
the rate coins volatability lately feel like loosing money vending. 
considered this also. 
its why havent put link here yet. 
think would have subpenea have warrant get user details from the site individual basis.

thought china was already out the btc game. 
from trc march amso russia out china out. 
will russia and china another crypto international intrigue grandfather always looked horse the mouth before trading for. 
then would always handy case needed get its attention. 
thinking its various things. 
what you said about china has tad bit with. 
bitcoin sales being taxed the usa websites the clear and hidden net being attacked. 
negative media which influences peoples choices regardless the news being fud not. 
its spring summer fall time lots heads the usa and are festival mode meaning their sourcing drugs elsewhere hidden markets are kind slow. 
although may look like sales are increasing blue agora pandora and maybe even the new ones that has more probably with people trying dump the bitcoins for other liquidatable goods before the bitcoins theyre holding loose value. 
passing the bag off speak. 
believe huge portion bitcoin holders use for illegal activity more than the bitcoin community wants admit. 
many top vendors that would bring massive increase and profits hidden markets and also increase the demand for bitcoins have gone under the radar dealing exclusively through emails and possibly dumping the need for bitcoin. 
wont ever know for sure that matter. 
there also the matter that the feds and mtgox might start dumping many bitcoins andd the market saturated speak there definetly enough supply for the demand driving the price down. 
competition with them holding that many coins motherfucker. 
then you have the miner pools which need dump enough pay for their efforts mining. 
will when becomes way expensive for even the mining pools produce them. 
fakers are takers. 
why not keep your shop open and have your vendor name seen the market still small but which market wasnt the beginning time people will learn about evolution and will migrate for sure.

need another way get btc annonamusly besides localbitcoins. 
its usually like markup and that just blows. 
have couple ideas for getting cheap bitcoin annonamously but nothing solid yet. 
maybe you guys can help. 
i'd love able trade btc and some the smaller exchanges. 
but they all require. 
the good thing you can send them fake docs and still get account think. 
what i'm thinking get account with fake docs btc but i'm loss how get cash into the account. 
i've explored all the deposit options and havent' been able get any work for yet usa. 
anyone know where buy perfect money cards the usa another way i've seen the bitcointalk forums some people there will cash the mail for pretty good price. 
but finding trusted vendors bit tough. 
i'd love find someone local that would trade market rate but unfortunately one local bitcoins willing.

from axolotl march amexcellent advice. 
think that placing strings quotation marks might also help alleviate this problem well. 
axolotlthank you axolotl liked the quoting solution that you suggested decided put the test. 
below you will find experiments test that solutionand also the email address solution. 
testing the quoting solution. 
the quoting solution suggests that the problem when processing the recipient argumentis solved simply putting the key name quotes shown below gpg output. 
enc someone file. 
txtwe can now attempt decrypt the message seewhich keys were used when was encrypted gpg decrypt output. 
encyou need passphrase unlock the secret key foruser myname myname. 
onion bit rsa key created main key eaeb gpg encrypted with bit rsa key created myname myname. 
onion collapse the petro dollar collapse usdstill mention this file being encrypted withsomeones key. 
the quoting solution least with version gpg doesnt work. 
but note thats cygwin not linux perhaps works with other versions. 
testing the email address solution. 
the email address solution suggests that the way avoid the substring matching problem specify thekey specifying the email address presented the key. 
for example gpg output. 
enc someone domain. 
txtwhere the available public keys are gpg list keyspub eaeb expires uid myname myname. 
onion sub expires pub expires uid someone. 
com sub expires this does solve the problem gpg output. 
encgpg encrypted with bit rsa key created someone. 
com gpg decryption failed secret key not availablethis the expected response. 
this message has not been encrypted with the myname public key. 
can not decrypt this message because its been encrypted with the publickey for someone and dont have the private key for someone. 
have two solutions the substring matching problemwhen the recipient argument processed specify the recipient public key with the key specify the recipient public key with the full email address someone domain. 
comany other solutions. 
perspectives this problem are warmly welcomed. 
have nice day. 
and happy playground.

not trying sound like mirage here. 
but judging from what have heard regarding apples relationship with the nsa assume encrypting your macbook with the buit disk encryption program less than secure against the feds.

figured had inside joke something. 
well that certainly inconvenient. 
verified with referral link and getting the same error. 
suspect this was done temporary measure against all the down time the site was experiencing last few weeks. 
this service was recently mentioned post bitcoin blender site. 
org forum thread. 
yes lot people seem use key linked clearnet mail service. 
also its very cumbersome the key uses another nickname than the name the market. 
use gpg interactively the terminal which allows you see immediately which recipient was selected and yeah its always worked that way. 
dont think its bug per. 
more like the intended behavior which may not match user expectations.

think that placing strings quotation marks might also help alleviate this problem well. 
axolotlthank you axolotl liked the quoting solution that you suggested decided put the test. 
below you will find experiments test that solutionand also the email address solution. 
testing the quoting solution. 
the quoting solution suggests that the problem when processing the recipient argumentis solved simply putting the key name quotes shown below gpg output. 
enc someone file. 
txtwe can now attempt decrypt the message seewhich keys were used when was encrypted gpg decrypt output. 
encyou need passphrase unlock the secret key foruser myname myname. 
onion bit rsa key created main key eaeb gpg encrypted with bit rsa key created myname myname. 
onion collapse the petro dollar collapse usdstill mention this file being encrypted withsomeones key. 
the quoting solution least with version gpg doesnt work. 
but note thats cygwin not linux perhaps works with other versions. 
testing the email address solution. 
the email address solution suggests that the way avoid the substring matching problem specify thekey specifying the email address presented the key. 
for example gpg output. 
enc someone domain. 
txtwhere the available public keys are gpg list keyspub eaeb expires uid myname myname. 
onion sub expires pub expires uid someone. 
com sub expires this does solve the problem gpg output. 
encgpg encrypted with bit rsa key created someone. 
com gpg decryption failed secret key not availablethis the expected response. 
this message has not been encrypted with the myname public key. 
can not decrypt this message because its been encrypted with the publickey for someone and dont have the private key for someone. 
have two solutions the substring matching problemwhen the recipient argument processed specify the recipient public key with the key specify the recipient public key with the full email address someone domain. 
comany other solutions.

from blueviking march amquote from acidcat march ami had messaged vendor asking for order never replied now coins are worth. 
this has been long stressful day now when said vendor replies have ask for even smaller amount because how volatile the market right now. 
hey brother this place more relaxed environment it's not like other marketplaces. 
you need place order instantly use marketplace because you lock price and that what the marketplace format for. 
vendors cannot predict the market and base their whole schedule accomdate constantly fluctuating currency. 
bitcoin would have doubled that time you wouldnt complaining about. 
but the beauty bitcoin that allows what with ease and security. 
just today lost probably lost someone's quarterly salary but i'm okay with that because know the risks involved. 
it's the nature the beast friend. 
couldnt agree more. 
also since its such relaxed environment here sure the vendor would have sent your order for less know would have. 
sometimes you win little sometimes you lose little but its the same for the vendors too. 
when encrypting message does the sender need sign. 
yes lot people seem use key linked clearnet mail service. 
also its very cumbersome the key uses another nickname than the name the market.

from evilgrin march amnot trying sound like mirage here. 
but judging from what have heard regarding apples relationship with the nsa assume encrypting your macbook with the buit disk encryption program less than secure against the feds. 
better use truecrypt some other open source crypto software place closed source proprietary software like filevault. 
that said however for the average user the nsa likely never going get involved the fbi secret service will likely use access datas software attempt break the crypto dictionary attack the password attempting brute force the hope that short and weak.

from firelight april amquote from owockeznan april amif you really want sure who you are sending dont use the short form keyid. 
use the keys fingerprint which you can get with the with fingerprint option when listing keys. 
you can also put this gpg. 
confkeyid format xlongand youll see the long format with every gpg list keys. 
from playground april amwhen you say use gpg interactively the terminal which allows you see immediately which recipient was selected. 
are you using regular gpg gpg with some special interface its regular command line gpg. 
type gpg and hit enter. 
now youre using interactively. 
gpg has lot options but you only have supply one. 
will interactively ask you for everything else. 
for just put armor gpg. 
conf and comment out the few times want binary. 
firelight thanks for your suggestions learned something. 
imagined interactively you were alluding some kind ncurses similar interface thatmight present options select from for recipients for files encrypt etc. 
now understand that interactively youre referring executing the gpg command without the recipient argument. 
this will cause gpg prompt the user for list recipientsits the difference between gpg output. 
enc keyid email file. 
txt thanks for this was useful suggestion. 
here demonstration this suggestion action found most useful first get listing all keys that matched the key names keyids email address ofthe keys wished use encrypt the message you can get subset listing all your public keysby specifying the key names ids emails the command line gpg list keys myname someonepub eaeb expires uid myname myname. 
onion sub expires pub expires uid someone. 
com sub expires now when execute the encryption command without the recipient argument can simply copy and paste the email addresses keyids from the listing above. 
notice that gpg prompts you for multiple recipients. 
after you specify each recipient gpg lists all the public keysthat will used encrypt the message. 
terminate the entry recipient keys just press return. 
txtyou did not specify user. 
you may use enter the user. 
end with empty line eaeb current recipients myname myname. 
onion enter the user. 
end with empty line bacurrent recipients someone. 
com myname myname. 
onion enter the user. 
end with empty line and check which keys were used the encryption gpg output. 
encyou need passphrase unlock the secret key foruser myname myname. 
onion bit rsa key created main key eaeb gpg encrypted with bit rsa key created someone. 
com gpg encrypted with bit rsa key created myname myname. 
onion collapse the petro dollar collapse usdso its absolutely true using gpg interactively omitting the recipient argument the command line allows you see which keys are being used encrypt message. 
possibly this the best practice usage for encrypting msgs. 
good work firelight when able. 
will award you some karma points. 
have nice day. 
how have you ended with many karma points already theres inactive karma thread here. 
are you buying them joking. 
was very happy with the time using bitblender. 
the one mentioned the above post. 
there was also link had posted back the thread about the techincals. 
after waiting for days get btc was less then hour wash the btc the bitblender site.

from playground march pmquote from axolotl march amexcellent advice. 
think that placing strings quotation marks might also help alleviate this problem well. 
axolotlthank you axolotl liked the quoting solution that you suggested decided put the test. 
below you will find experiments test that solutionand also the email address solution. 
testing the quoting solution. 
the quoting solution suggests that the problem when processing the recipient argumentis solved simply putting the key name quotes shown below gpg output. 
enc someone file. 
txtwe can now attempt decrypt the message seewhich keys were used when was encrypted gpg decrypt output. 
encyou need passphrase unlock the secret key foruser myname myname. 
onion bit rsa key created main key eaeb gpg encrypted with bit rsa key created myname myname. 
onion collapse the petro dollar collapse usdstill mention this file being encrypted withsomeones key. 
the quoting solution least with version gpg doesnt work. 
but note thats cygwin not linux perhaps works with other versions. 
serves right for giving out off the cuff answer without checking first. 
pretty sure that all versions pgp gpg will exhibit the same behavior. 
from firelight march pmi use gpg interactively the terminal which allows you see immediately which recipient was selected and yeah its always worked that way. 
dont think its bug per. 
more like the intended behavior which may not match user expectations. 
firelight want clear about what youre actually doing. 
using gpg the command line. 
typing commands encrypt file like this gpg output. 
enc someone somefile. 
txtthis will encrypt the file somefile. 
txt with someones public key and put the result file called output. 
when you say use gpg interactively the terminal which allows you see immediately which recipient was selected. 
are you using regular gpg gpg with some special interface you type gpg version that the command line what does say.

from weeble march pmquote from axolotl march pmquote from axa march pmbefore making claims that bitmessage resource hog you should download the client and try out for yourself. 
axolotlsince sends two days worth all messages the system everyone and you need try decode each message see for you you could certainly argue that horribly inefficient. 
but that the price for privacy and good way achieve. 
bitmessage literally the most resource intensive version pir there. 
its also horribly inefficient many other ways. 
have nothing against but its clearly made amateurs.

from jules winnfield march amquote from march amyes lot people seem use key linked clearnet mail service. 
also its very cumbersome the key uses another nickname than the name the market. 
with their real names attached. 
notice this when they give address and notice that they have their email their pgp public key using their real name and gmail address. 
actually have written that reply this post without reading the first post which only involves people with short common key name but this issue the gpg keys with cleartext addresses needs addressed more serious manner. 
people are very easy with giving away public keys and markets not even scan the keys for security issues like email address other information and refuse accept compromising gpg keys. 
the should immediately address this problem. 
who agrees with this. 
will try raise the issue with the security thread seperate post. 
lazy tired and high its just copying pasting into security. 
questions were courteously answered between and hours from deemster april pmi have opened ticket support about certain withdrawl that need verifying asap have just noticed some are handled manually and can take hours stressing out has anubody here dealt with support and how long did take for them get back you thanks. 
bsm support usually gets back few hours. 
your transaction going for manual verification then you pretty much need wait out. 
multi bit powered bitcoinj thats really where you should looking for answers. 
first multibit doesnt support the features bitcoinj that allow proxy support that means that every node you directly talk the network knows your and knows you broadcast transaction. 
the only way get around that currently use something like whoonix which will enforce tor connections for all outgoing traffic running virtual machine. 
second multibit will use bloom filters speed block chain sync. 
bloom filters are potential privacy leak because they can tie addresses together. 
node that knows your bloom filter will able say know that certain transactions may related you altho isnt proven. 
you want nothing your wallet tied together via almost any means will take some work. 
keep your wallet completely offline. 
update balances for each address using seperate tor exit nodes and ideally several different public blockchain sites. 
never tie two your addresses together into single send recieve money from the same address your wallet. 
you need spend grab the outputs from your address spent using online computer sign offline and then push the out using anonymous method like. 
wizkid newstats pushtxn. 
php which will push the out eligiuss pool.

the idea seems that people who would not willing take the fairly short amount time learn use pgp encryption would able secure their mail trusting third party this case the folks safe mail. 
reject that idea several grounds. 
first the company that provides internet services for hosting the safe mail. 
net system barak.

third safe mail. 
net makes the usual disclosure that they may disclose your account activity stored mails and other information upon court order law enforcement request. 
they make the unusual variation this disclosure stating that they may disclose these things whenever their interest. 
this vague contract clause should scare anyone who thinks about even briefly.

again would appear matter whether you have reason trust the israeli government.

for example usa government agency wanted information someone who happens use safe mail.

also its very cumbersome the key uses another nickname than the name the market. 
with their real names attached. 
notice this when they give address and notice that they have their email their pgp public key using their real name and gmail address. 
actually have written that reply this post without reading the first post which only involves people with short common key name but this issue the gpg keys with cleartext addresses needs addressed more serious manner. 
people are very easy with giving away public keys and markets not even scan the keys for security issues like email address other information and refuse accept compromising gpg keys.

from playground march pmquote from axolotl march amexcellent advice. 
think that placing strings quotation marks might also help alleviate this problem well. 
axolotlthank you axolotl liked the quoting solution that you suggested decided put the test. 
below you will find experiments test that solutionand also the email address solution. 
testing the quoting solution. 
the quoting solution suggests that the problem when processing the recipient argumentis solved simply putting the key name quotes shown below gpg output. 
enc someone file.

onion collapse the petro dollar collapse usdstill mention this file being encrypted withsomeones key. 
the quoting solution least with version gpg doesnt work. 
but note thats cygwin not linux perhaps works with other versions. 
serves right for giving out off the cuff answer without checking first. 
pretty sure that all versions pgp gpg will exhibit the same behavior.

com anabolic lounge off topic discussion those who use safe mail net. 
html provides some insight for those who use safe mail. 
netimperial units measure being increasingly forgotten the peck should defined measure dry volume approximately two gallons size. 
other words one should eat quite few meals over period year more with someone before you trust him. 
appropriate that this anonymous proverb forms the opening for this issue being sovereign because one our anonymous colleagues has done quite bit research safe mail. 
net the israel based encrypted mail provider. 
wanted share some this information for your benefit. 
the way weve eaten peck salt with our anonymous colleague and have other reasons trust him. 
net one several mail services that offer provide secure encrypted web based mail service the general public. 
the idea seems that people who would not willing take the fairly short amount time learn use pgp encryption would able secure their mail trusting third party this case the folks safe mail. 
reject that idea several grounds. 
first the company that provides internet services for hosting the safe mail. 
net system barak. 
based our review the domain registration for safe mail. 
one three companies with license from the israeli government for providing similar internet services according the english language version their web site understand. 
perhaps merely coincidence that ehud barak was once head the israeli defense forces intelligence branch. 
second the safe mail. 
net system trap. 
our anonymous friend indicates that your address linked your mail account. 
the user agreement indicates that violation the user agreement employ anonymous proxy otherwise attempt mask your true address. 
while identifying information name address phone requested when you set account your address may traced your physical location least your specific internet service provider even dynamic addresses are used. 
thus your location and possibly your identity would exposed. 
also addresses are not stripped from mails you send from your safe mail account your recipients see this information. 
and course you may tempted identify yourself your correspondents within your purportedly encrypted mails. 
third safe mail. 
net makes the usual disclosure that they may disclose your account activity stored mails and other information upon court order law enforcement request. 
they make the unusual variation this disclosure stating that they may disclose these things whenever their interest. 
this vague contract clause should scare anyone who thinks about even briefly. 
given that barak. 
licensed the israeli government would seem quite likely that the israeli government could command that the data from all safe mail. 
net accounts provided the government and would clearly the best interests barak. 
and conceivably extension safe mail. 
net make such disclosure. 
then would seem become question whether you have reason trust the israeli government. 
found details about the encryption algorithms used provide for security with safe mail. 
investigation israeli law suggests that there mandate that encryption have back doors key escrow for use israeli authorities. 
again would appear matter whether you have reason trust the israeli government. 
dont have anything against the israeli government that dont also hold against nearly all other governments worldwide. 
widely known that israeli security and intelligence services have cooperative relationships with the related services other countries. 
for example usa government agency wanted information someone who happens use safe mail. 
net account seems logical suppose that request formal informal might made the israeli government. 
while impossible know whether not safe mail. 
net accounts are mossad transparent kind intelligence sting operation run the mossad others within the israeli government what publicly stated about the system seems closely aligned with what one would expect find that case. 
have information presently hand that would tend disprove the hypothesis that safe mail. 
net intelligence sting operation. 
there always free meat bear trap. 
whether you believe this post you the point why take chance there are much better free options than safe mail.

but how come there absolutely search functionality and how come the directory comepletely disorganized every possible way how are vendors and buyers supposed find each other. 
multi bit powered bitcoinj thats really where you should looking for answers. 
first multibit doesnt support the features bitcoinj that allow proxy support that means that every node you directly talk the network knows your and knows you broadcast transaction. 
the only way get around that currently use something like whoonix which will enforce tor connections for all outgoing traffic running virtual machine. 
second multibit will use bloom filters speed block chain sync. 
bloom filters are potential privacy leak because they can tie addresses together. 
node that knows your bloom filter will able say know that certain transactions may related you altho isnt proven. 
you want nothing your wallet tied together via almost any means will take some work. 
keep your wallet completely offline. 
update balances for each address using seperate tor exit nodes and ideally several different public blockchain sites. 
never tie two your addresses together into single send recieve money from the same address your wallet. 
you need spend grab the outputs from your address spent using online computer sign offline and then push the out using anonymous method like. 
wizkid newstats pushtxn. 
php which will push the out eligiuss pool. 
from weeble march pmquote from axolotl march pmquote from axa march pmbefore making claims that bitmessage resource hog you should download the client and try out for yourself. 
axolotlsince sends two days worth all messages the system everyone and you need try decode each message see for you you could certainly argue that horribly inefficient. 
but that the price for privacy and good way achieve. 
bitmessage literally the most resource intensive version pir there. 
its also horribly inefficient many other ways. 
have nothing against but its clearly made amateurs. 
they made many horrible mistakes the beginning. 
just wouldnt rely people who encrypted payload data with rsa implement encryption for. 
from blackstar march amso what the banks cant speculate with. 
the people are the ones oppressed and trying fly under the radar. 
its also great way for them get paid for counterfiet merch which you all know china has bunch. 
same with russia the people russia will use tor and btc evade government facisim right think just will take some time for the infrastructure become solid and then will grow steadily. 
right sure hope haha. 
gotta put the thoughts and positive energy into the atmosphere. 
indeed bitcoin for life. 
and the kind soul who pm'd. 
there any way have this enabled default. 
not really but some people choose sign messages way verify themselves. 
this can used you change key for example just sign the new key with your old can verified. 
from acidcat april amdamn that really does suck it's really dropping low. 
i'm sorry hear you've lost much makes seem like nothing all can't imagine what vendors are going through. 
how're you all doing things have been crazy pandora and boss budcentral and can't say that it'd safe sell solely that market. 
and we'd like bring our customers here fees and forums are such beautiful combination. 
i've got great feeling about this market. 
damn that really does suck it's really dropping low. 
i'm sorry hear you've lost much makes seem like nothing all. 
have couple coins stashed away but when need buy drugs dont touch the coins already have buy new bitcoin and use that immediately that way feel like not getting too badly affected the fluctuation price.

offense intended but wtf are you talking about the more people that hits with exploit the more likely someone notice. 
the mass deployment the exploit every visitor guaranteed that would discovered.

the exploit was day and majority visitors were immune either because they had date browser bundles werent windows. 
was basically fishing expedition for the lowest hanging fruit boy talk about mixed metaphors.

wonder this was the exploit another site. 
states that the malware would deployed for days but only logged users. 
read numerous reports that the exploit was served anyone who visited any site hosted. 
that kind drive deployment malware innocent people should illegal but doesnt appear. 
think there are few possibilities here. 
the document describing the exploit but was targeted specific users like web site admins for few weeks. 
then when they busted the admin and were ready take the server down they deployed against everyone last ditch effort catch the low hanging fruit. 
its possible that they were targeting high value users like admins sites for weeks earlier when the exploit basically was day. 
the document describing the exploit but they decided not target specific users and deployed for short time. 
the document describing site unrelated. 
from ambiguity april pmi see just lowly hashish eater here. 
also seems clear that some you guys know awful lot about. 
just saying wonder how that vfkpevtj hooker runs. 
from presidente april pmtj hooker runsnah its just logic. 
the more eyes there are the more likely something seen. 
once its seen people can protect themselves from. 
you dont burn valuable exploits the masses low value targets. 
also according snowden documents they target high value subjects with days but they used day everyone visiting.

from owockeznan april amif you really want sure who you are sending dont use the short form keyid.

you can also put this gpg.

are you using regular gpg gpg with some special interface its regular command line gpg. 
type gpg and hit enter. 
now youre using interactively. 
gpg has lot options but you only have supply one. 
will interactively ask you for everything else. 
for just put armor gpg.

dont know how you guys use command line gpg without properly configured gpg. 
try adding these options use agentno greetingno emit versionno commentstrust model alwayscharset utf utf list modekeyid format xlongkeyserver.

from jules winnfield march amquote from march amyes lot people seem use key linked clearnet mail service. 
also its very cumbersome the key uses another nickname than the name the market. 
with their real names attached. 
notice this when they give address and notice that they have their email their pgp public key using their real name and gmail address. 
actually have written that reply this post without reading the first post which only involves people with short common key name but this issue the gpg keys with cleartext addresses needs addressed more serious manner. 
people are very easy with giving away public keys and markets not even scan the keys for security issues like email address other information and refuse accept compromising gpg keys. 
the should immediately address this problem. 
who agrees with this. 
will try raise the issue with the security thread seperate post. 
lazy tired and high its just copying pasting into security. 
yeah cmon guys dont start spreading fud about bluesky market now. 
works never seen down its clean and quick they have auto withdrawls for finalized orders btc rate lock and the admins are fair and responsive. 
that said ive never heard bluesky traders. 
yep are publishing some updates itll tad slow for few more minutes sorry for the lag. 
the directory was just launched and your feedback has been noted. 
your idea search good one. 
from firelight march pmi use gpg interactively the terminal which allows you see immediately which recipient was selected and yeah its always worked that way. 
dont think its bug per. 
more like the intended behavior which may not match user expectations. 
firelight want clear about what youre actually doing. 
using gpg the command line. 
typing commands encrypt file like this gpg output. 
enc someone somefile.

txt with someones public key and put the result file called output. 
when you say use gpg interactively the terminal which allows you see immediately which recipient was selected. 
are you using regular gpg gpg with some special interface you type gpg version that the command line what does say. 
from owockeznan april amif you really want sure who you are sending dont use the short form keyid.

imagined interactively you were alluding some kind ncurses similar interface thatmight present options select from for recipients for files encrypt etc. 
now understand that interactively youre referring executing the gpg command without the recipient argument. 
this will cause gpg prompt the user for list recipientsits the difference between gpg output. 
enc keyid email file. 
txt thanks for this was useful suggestion. 
here demonstration this suggestion action found most useful first get listing all keys that matched the key names keyids email address ofthe keys wished use encrypt the message you can get subset listing all your public keysby specifying the key names ids emails the command line gpg list keys myname someonepub eaeb expires uid myname myname. 
onion sub expires pub expires uid someone. 
com sub expires now when execute the encryption command without the recipient argument can simply copy and paste the email addresses keyids from the listing above. 
notice that gpg prompts you for multiple recipients. 
after you specify each recipient gpg lists all the public keysthat will used encrypt the message. 
terminate the entry recipient keys just press return. 
txtyou did not specify user. 
you may use enter the user. 
end with empty line eaeb current recipients myname myname.

end with empty line bacurrent recipients someone.

possibly this the best practice usage for encrypting msgs. 
good work firelight when able. 
will award you some karma points. 
have nice day. 
how have you ended with many karma points already theres inactive karma thread here. 
are you buying them joking. 
from playground march pmquote from axolotl march amexcellent advice. 
think that placing strings quotation marks might also help alleviate this problem well. 
axolotlthank you axolotl liked the quoting solution that you suggested decided put the test. 
below you will find experiments test that solutionand also the email address solution. 
testing the quoting solution. 
the quoting solution suggests that the problem when processing the recipient argumentis solved simply putting the key name quotes shown below gpg output. 
enc someone file. 
txtwe can now attempt decrypt the message seewhich keys were used when was encrypted gpg decrypt output. 
encyou need passphrase unlock the secret key foruser myname myname. 
onion bit rsa key created main key eaeb gpg encrypted with bit rsa key created myname myname. 
onion collapse the petro dollar collapse usdstill mention this file being encrypted withsomeones key. 
the quoting solution least with version gpg doesnt work. 
but note thats cygwin not linux perhaps works with other versions. 
serves right for giving out off the cuff answer without checking first. 
pretty sure that all versions pgp gpg will exhibit the same behavior.

from april pmplease what did miss about safe mail mean you encrypt sensitive anyway whats the down side encrypt sensitive you should encrypting everything. 
also bear mind that while you can control what you you cannot control what others. 
you cant anything about people sending you unencrypted email theyre dumb enough use clearnet email providers without tor. 
that said pgp does not protect the metadata. 
the email headers. 
these contain lot information interest the authorities. 
right now you can login safe mail through tor what they suddenly start blocking known tor exit nodes you only option logon through clearnet. 
non tor session then they can capture your address.

com anabolic lounge off topic discussion those who use safe mail net. 
html provides some insight for those who use safe mail. 
netimperial units measure being increasingly forgotten the peck should defined measure dry volume approximately two gallons size. 
other words one should eat quite few meals over period year more with someone before you trust him. 
appropriate that this anonymous proverb forms the opening for this issue being sovereign because one our anonymous colleagues has done quite bit research safe mail. 
net the israel based encrypted mail provider. 
wanted share some this information for your benefit. 
the way weve eaten peck salt with our anonymous colleague and have other reasons trust him. 
net one several mail services that offer provide secure encrypted web based mail service the general public. 
the idea seems that people who would not willing take the fairly short amount time learn use pgp encryption would able secure their mail trusting third party this case the folks safe mail. 
reject that idea several grounds. 
first the company that provides internet services for hosting the safe mail. 
net system barak. 
based our review the domain registration for safe mail. 
one three companies with license from the israeli government for providing similar internet services according the english language version their web site understand. 
perhaps merely coincidence that ehud barak was once head the israeli defense forces intelligence branch. 
second the safe mail. 
net system trap. 
our anonymous friend indicates that your address linked your mail account. 
the user agreement indicates that violation the user agreement employ anonymous proxy otherwise attempt mask your true address. 
while identifying information name address phone requested when you set account your address may traced your physical location least your specific internet service provider even dynamic addresses are used. 
thus your location and possibly your identity would exposed. 
also addresses are not stripped from mails you send from your safe mail account your recipients see this information. 
and course you may tempted identify yourself your correspondents within your purportedly encrypted mails. 
third safe mail. 
net makes the usual disclosure that they may disclose your account activity stored mails and other information upon court order law enforcement request. 
they make the unusual variation this disclosure stating that they may disclose these things whenever their interest. 
this vague contract clause should scare anyone who thinks about even briefly. 
given that barak. 
licensed the israeli government would seem quite likely that the israeli government could command that the data from all safe mail. 
net accounts provided the government and would clearly the best interests barak. 
and conceivably extension safe mail. 
net make such disclosure. 
then would seem become question whether you have reason trust the israeli government. 
found details about the encryption algorithms used provide for security with safe mail. 
investigation israeli law suggests that there mandate that encryption have back doors key escrow for use israeli authorities. 
again would appear matter whether you have reason trust the israeli government. 
dont have anything against the israeli government that dont also hold against nearly all other governments worldwide. 
widely known that israeli security and intelligence services have cooperative relationships with the related services other countries. 
for example usa government agency wanted information someone who happens use safe mail. 
net account seems logical suppose that request formal informal might made the israeli government. 
while impossible know whether not safe mail. 
net accounts are mossad transparent kind intelligence sting operation run the mossad others within the israeli government what publicly stated about the system seems closely aligned with what one would expect find that case. 
have information presently hand that would tend disprove the hypothesis that safe mail. 
net intelligence sting operation. 
there always free meat bear trap. 
whether you believe this post you the point why take chance there are much better free options than safe mail.

also its very cumbersome the key uses another nickname than the name the market. 
with their real names attached. 
notice this when they give address and notice that they have their email their pgp public key using their real name and gmail address. 
actually have written that reply this post without reading the first post which only involves people with short common key name but this issue the gpg keys with cleartext addresses needs addressed more serious manner. 
people are very easy with giving away public keys and markets not even scan the keys for security issues like email address other information and refuse accept compromising gpg keys. 
the should immediately address this problem.

this will cause gpg prompt the user for list recipientsits the difference between gpg output.

terminate the entry recipient keys just press return.

from playground march pmquote from axolotl march amexcellent advice. 
think that placing strings quotation marks might also help alleviate this problem well. 
axolotlthank you axolotl liked the quoting solution that you suggested decided put the test. 
below you will find experiments test that solutionand also the email address solution. 
testing the quoting solution. 
the quoting solution suggests that the problem when processing the recipient argumentis solved simply putting the key name quotes shown below gpg output. 
enc someone file.

onion collapse the petro dollar collapse usdstill mention this file being encrypted withsomeones key. 
the quoting solution least with version gpg doesnt work. 
but note thats cygwin not linux perhaps works with other versions. 
serves right for giving out off the cuff answer without checking first. 
pretty sure that all versions pgp gpg will exhibit the same behavior.

com anabolic lounge off topic discussion those who use safe mail net. 
html provides some insight for those who use safe mail. 
netimperial units measure being increasingly forgotten the peck should defined measure dry volume approximately two gallons size. 
other words one should eat quite few meals over period year more with someone before you trust him. 
appropriate that this anonymous proverb forms the opening for this issue being sovereign because one our anonymous colleagues has done quite bit research safe mail. 
net the israel based encrypted mail provider. 
wanted share some this information for your benefit. 
the way weve eaten peck salt with our anonymous colleague and have other reasons trust him. 
net one several mail services that offer provide secure encrypted web based mail service the general public. 
the idea seems that people who would not willing take the fairly short amount time learn use pgp encryption would able secure their mail trusting third party this case the folks safe mail. 
reject that idea several grounds. 
first the company that provides internet services for hosting the safe mail. 
net system barak. 
based our review the domain registration for safe mail. 
one three companies with license from the israeli government for providing similar internet services according the english language version their web site understand. 
perhaps merely coincidence that ehud barak was once head the israeli defense forces intelligence branch. 
second the safe mail. 
net system trap. 
our anonymous friend indicates that your address linked your mail account. 
the user agreement indicates that violation the user agreement employ anonymous proxy otherwise attempt mask your true address. 
while identifying information name address phone requested when you set account your address may traced your physical location least your specific internet service provider even dynamic addresses are used. 
thus your location and possibly your identity would exposed. 
also addresses are not stripped from mails you send from your safe mail account your recipients see this information. 
and course you may tempted identify yourself your correspondents within your purportedly encrypted mails. 
third safe mail. 
net makes the usual disclosure that they may disclose your account activity stored mails and other information upon court order law enforcement request. 
they make the unusual variation this disclosure stating that they may disclose these things whenever their interest. 
this vague contract clause should scare anyone who thinks about even briefly. 
given that barak. 
licensed the israeli government would seem quite likely that the israeli government could command that the data from all safe mail. 
net accounts provided the government and would clearly the best interests barak. 
and conceivably extension safe mail. 
net make such disclosure. 
then would seem become question whether you have reason trust the israeli government. 
found details about the encryption algorithms used provide for security with safe mail. 
investigation israeli law suggests that there mandate that encryption have back doors key escrow for use israeli authorities. 
again would appear matter whether you have reason trust the israeli government. 
dont have anything against the israeli government that dont also hold against nearly all other governments worldwide. 
widely known that israeli security and intelligence services have cooperative relationships with the related services other countries. 
for example usa government agency wanted information someone who happens use safe mail. 
net account seems logical suppose that request formal informal might made the israeli government. 
while impossible know whether not safe mail. 
net accounts are mossad transparent kind intelligence sting operation run the mossad others within the israeli government what publicly stated about the system seems closely aligned with what one would expect find that case. 
have information presently hand that would tend disprove the hypothesis that safe mail. 
net intelligence sting operation. 
there always free meat bear trap. 
whether you believe this post you the point why take chance there are much better free options than safe mail.

but how come there absolutely search functionality and how come the directory comepletely disorganized every possible way how are vendors and buyers supposed find each other. 
multi bit powered bitcoinj thats really where you should looking for answers. 
first multibit doesnt support the features bitcoinj that allow proxy support that means that every node you directly talk the network knows your and knows you broadcast transaction. 
the only way get around that currently use something like whoonix which will enforce tor connections for all outgoing traffic running virtual machine. 
second multibit will use bloom filters speed block chain sync. 
bloom filters are potential privacy leak because they can tie addresses together. 
node that knows your bloom filter will able say know that certain transactions may related you altho isnt proven. 
you want nothing your wallet tied together via almost any means will take some work. 
keep your wallet completely offline. 
update balances for each address using seperate tor exit nodes and ideally several different public blockchain sites. 
never tie two your addresses together into single send recieve money from the same address your wallet. 
you need spend grab the outputs from your address spent using online computer sign offline and then push the out using anonymous method like.

you need least strong. 
dude while realize that your intent was humorous you nevertheless raise excellent question even only inference just how many characters you need secure the subject passwords and passphrases has been discussed considerable detail over the last two decades. 
let attempt boil things down were one the most fundamental concepts information theory that order versus randomness. 
order for message meaningful must contain some information meaning that has both structure well content. 
for example beautiful day today the sky blue the birds are singing. 
the above string sentence has structure has both order and meaning. 
usmgjtins ozp axmwz utcsb jlcm eowi pxov glwin contrast this string has structure has neither order nor meaning essentially random noise. 
the object cryptography take the first string characters english sentence and using some method usually based mathematical function transform into something resembling the second random string characters order keep the information out the hands unauthorized persons. 
over the centuries variety methods have been devised accomplish this one the more common use today the cipher. 
cipher method usually based mathematical principles functions for transforming data into apparent gibberish. 
some the most common ciphers use today pgp are aes the advanced encryption standard triple des often abbreviated des cast and idea. 
the strength ciphers and passphrases are frequently expressed bits thus have variants the aes cipher aes aes and aes where the keys used these ciphers are bits bits and bits respectively. 
other ciphers used pgp are also bit idea and cast. 
exception des bits. 
ciphers bits more are considered unbreakable brute force attack. 
here interesting note from pgps jon callas describing the difficulty cracking modern bit ciphers quotemodern cryptographic systems are essentially unbreakable particularly adversary restricted intercepts. 
have argued for designed and built systems with bits security precisely because they are essentially unbreakable.

from thedude march amquote from rounded march pmi have character strong password and full disk encryption. 
you need least strong. 
dude while realize that your intent was humorous you nevertheless raise excellent question even only inference just how many characters you need secure the subject passwords and passphrases has been discussed considerable detail over the last two decades. 
let attempt boil things down were one the most fundamental concepts information theory that order versus randomness. 
order for message meaningful must contain some information meaning that has both structure well content. 
for example beautiful day today the sky blue the birds are singing. 
the above string sentence has structure has both order and meaning. 
usmgjtins ozp axmwz utcsb jlcm eowi pxov glwin contrast this string has structure has neither order nor meaning essentially random noise. 
the object cryptography take the first string characters english sentence and using some method usually based mathematical function transform into something resembling the second random string characters order keep the information out the hands unauthorized persons. 
over the centuries variety methods have been devised accomplish this one the more common use today the cipher. 
cipher method usually based mathematical principles functions for transforming data into apparent gibberish. 
some the most common ciphers use today pgp are aes the advanced encryption standard triple des often abbreviated des cast and idea. 
the strength ciphers and passphrases are frequently expressed bits thus have variants the aes cipher aes aes and aes where the keys used these ciphers are bits bits and bits respectively. 
other ciphers used pgp are also bit idea and cast. 
exception des bits. 
ciphers bits more are considered unbreakable brute force attack. 
here interesting note from pgps jon callas describing the difficulty cracking modern bit ciphers quotemodern cryptographic systems are essentially unbreakable particularly adversary restricted intercepts. 
have argued for designed and built systems with bits security precisely because they are essentially unbreakable.

firelight owockeznan why would you want connected keyserver understand that the non darknet world convenient. 
but why would you want publish your darknet public keys leo can easily access them. 
leo doesnt need the troubleof busting vendor buyer pick pieces theycan put together later. 
leo raids keyserver wont they have access the logs for the keyserver perhaps those logs identify the address the original submitter the key and those who chose access your keys later.
