comfind someone selling btc for vanilla cvs riteaid walmart etc and put your cash onto vanilla reload card. 
give the seller your digit vanilla reload code. 
you will have your btc matter moments. 
idea how you could having trouble getting btc. 
you can also meet someone and purchase with cash locally. 
add tt's post. 
one can also purchase through local bitcoins with cash via online methods. 
look for listings that offer cash deposit certain bank branches. 
these require you the bank branch choice and fill out out state deposit slip you fill this form out and give the cash the teller and they deposit into the account the btc seller. 
your btc's are then released you. 
you don't even have member the bank bank america has always been very fast and hassle free. 
also with this method you usually aren't charged ridiculous price for your cryptocurrency. 
just remember tumble your coins intermediate wallet before using them purchase from vendor.

seriously having trouble finding way buy btc the without attaching bank account the service. 
does anyone know way can use anonymous card loaded with cash purchase btc without this knowledge have been unable order and killing inside slowly. 
using gpa pgp for windows. 
lost public key can someone please explan how can replace find. 
there are many different things that you could use possibly satisfy this requirement. 
perhaps the easiest would simply zip file that has been password protected. 
course ive never done audit nor seen one the codebase ensure that the crypto that system doesnt have any implentation bugs. 
there are many other functionally similar methods doing the same thing. 
this would the encrypted tarball approach. 
the second approach would mount the file actual disk. 
this has the advantage being easy work with looks and feels just like native volume. 
there are few contenders that have both nix and windows compatabality this domain. 
the two ones that come mind are truecrypt and luks dmcrypt there are others well.

would love get discussion going this topic thanks. 
its highly probable and somewhat documented that all lettered agency are using all the information they can gather make risk assesments all people world wide. 
all create fingerprints online. 
even when were offline our fingerprints are still there. 
very difficult mask them and can rarely prevent them. 
they are made every single click time between task click scroll etc words you type how you type them and where you type them. 
imagine like event log every little tedious detail form fingerprint. 
using that information lets them unmask you and reveal your anonymous self. 
people think creating different nyms usernames online and hiding behind each different one allows you become new person. 
just like real life our fingerprints tell our true identity and theyve very hard remove. 
they are moving towards future where its rather hard hide ones fingerprints ipv. 
that being said and was gambling candy bar and one was order foodsaver machine foodsaver bags baggies rolling papers smoking related products. 
etc ebay and amazon they are going labeled person who possibly saves weed for long term usage highly likely smokes said weed and isnt afraid tie their legal name such actions. 
your most definitely going put list. 
this person also isnt very big threat because they dont seem like they are distributing said weed and are stupid enough lead the trail. 
but thats only they dont know your other fingerprints which they most likely. 
all leave trail one way another. 
the best thing can try deminish that trail. 
can try our best but feel keep going the same train currently are doesnt look positive. 
some things person can stretch the trail making more difficult track crumbs metadata fingerprints using anonymous. 
why anonymous there said three letter agency really wanted track those crumbs they most definitely have the means manpower and money find those crumbs leading back you. 
few key factors that most likely wont put you their shit list are not tie your legit legal name illegal activities things that invlolve illegal acitivies not open discuss those illegal activities with others real life and especially online become the lurkness monster and try your best stay away from people that openly partake discuss illegal activities. 
you feel like the past you might fit one all these criteria its sad say have shit list winner. 
the most successful vendors buyers stay below the radar and dont want attention. 
hopefully the shitbarometer broken and there wont shitpocalipse but only time will tell.

have done trade with senior member bitcointalk using greendot moneypak and escrow. 
his repuatation and general demeanor made trust him and the trade was successful. 
will moneypak trades bitstamp rate for btc. 
better deal than lbc any day. 
also looking into cash the mail options well. 
want help keep our btc world seperate from our drug world wont posting his contact details publicly for the info youre interested and please dont post publicly. 
not saying trust this guy with thousands dollars saying trusted him with few hundred and worked out fine. 
proceed your own risk. 
also offers fee free escrow service but that kind moot point the trade with him. 
would trust him with more for next trade but proceed your own risk. 
for what its worth seems like pretty established btc trader and think his coins are freshly mined well.

you want the name btc trader bitcointalk. 
org the main hub info for btc. 
will greendot moneypak codes for btc bitstamp rate cash btc. 
don't talk about darknet stuff with him all you're doing buying btc. 
you can buy moneypak most grocery and convience stores. 
make sure you get the reload card not the debit card looks like phone card. 
trusted him with couple hundred dollars and went fine he's senior member and has good trust rating. 
could still rip you off though proceed with caution.

thank you guys for the response and sure the question sounded stupid. 
very new and reading much can. 
obviously need learn bit more before any further.

its highly probable and somewhat documented that all lettered agency are using all the information they can gather make risk assesments all people world wide. 
all create fingerprints online. 
even when were offline our fingerprints are still there. 
very difficult mask them and can rarely prevent them. 
they are made every single click time between task click scroll etc words you type how you type them and where you type them. 
imagine like event log every little tedious detail form fingerprint. 
using that information lets them unmask you and reveal your anonymous self. 
people think creating different nyms usernames online and hiding behind each different one allows you become new person. 
just like real life our fingerprints tell our true identity and theyve very hard remove. 
they are moving towards future where its rather hard hide ones fingerprints ipv.

from playground april pmhello siblings what would like some encryption facility that can load onto usb key that will give access encrypted files encrypted vault files that will work equally well plug into windows machine linux machine. 
presume this will program guess will need have twoversions one that executes from usb key windows and one thatexecutes from usb key ubuntu. 
both versions linux and windows need looking the same set encrypted files vault files. 
that have access these files whether using linux machine windows machine. 
anyone knows such program please let know. 
three additional related questions.

executables are available for varietyof platforms including linux and windows. 
from owockeznan april pmthere are many different things that you could use possibly satisfy this requirement. 
perhaps the easiest would simply zip file that has been password protected. 
course ive never done audit nor seen one the codebase ensure that the crypto that system doesnt have any implentation bugs. 
there are many other functionally similar methods doing the same thing. 
this would the encrypted tarball approach. 
the second approach would mount the file actual disk. 
this has the advantage being easy work with looks and feels just like native volume. 
there are few contenders that have both nix and windows compatabality this domain.

update tumbler page. 
not throw fuel this fire but angora has been going down lot since the url change last week. 
may growing pains and like trees have faith the market but can bit irritating times. 
think that btc known for being anon friendly. 
from donkeysausage may may growing pains and like trees have faith the market but can bit irritating times. 
you can say that last part again. 
its been source major frustration for late. 
during years tor have seen countless scam attempts and many sad faces those who were ripped off. 
here the deep web scammers will always exist plain and simple. 
matter how hard all try bust them down their presence will always remain. 
you will find them forums their own websites and throughout all major and established dark markets. 
now that all have accepted this sad issue lets discuss the many methods help prevent you from falling into this trap. 
first and foremost the number one rule when doing business the deep web always trust your instinct. 
sure all you heard this old saying before its too good true probably. 
know its very cliche but still holds lot merit. 
most scam victims fail follow this and with their impulses instead. 
they see product deal astounding price that they dont think anything else but having the items their hands. 
its like being hypnotized sense. 
dont worry not talking down anyone. 
its human nature follow with impulses. 
just remember that next time you see amazing deal think through and see this can realistic. 
now that covered the golden rule. 
now going discuss the different types scam methods that are present thought the deep web. 
please post left anything out you have any questions comments. 
the hidden wiki thw thw probably one the oldest sites still existance tor. 
more then likely one the first sites many people new tor visit. 
can quite amazing discovery seeing all the differnt businesses selling drugs weapons fraud items stolen electronics etc. 
for lack words its really awesome see that you now have access pretty much anything you want when you didnt prior setting tor. 
now the problem here that thw can moderated pretty much anyone who has registered account. 
some the nefarious hidden wiki staff are very aware the many new comers deep web. 
this why safe that just about every commercial site thw are scams. 
plan and simple. 
even legitimate and well known markets featured thw are more then likely phishing sites set steal your account information. 
long story short avoid the hidden wiki when searching for market links. 
example phishing site for. 
onion best way tell that the url obviously the wrong one. 
you need link market site visit the subreddit darknetmarkets. 
com darknetmarkets the deep dot web. 
these sites provide legitimate market links that are never altered. 
anyone knows any other sites new comers can use find legit links please toss them. 
non market commercial sitesjust like the ones listed thw pretty much all the small sites that sell products and services are all pretty much scams. 
the only exception are sites that operated established market vendors who are well recognized and can verified with their pgp. 
anyone needs help verifying someones pgp you are more then welcome message and ill glad help. 
plus there are few sites that catalog vendor pgps and offer verification well. 
ill show you some examples sites and how tell the are rippers. 
green notes counter. 
onion here site that sells counterfeit coins. 
sadly they not accept escrow and give the typical scammer reason that they not trust escrow sites. 
but for some ill logic reason its okay trust them. 
lol yeah right. 
double your btc. 
onion here site that promises return you the double amount btc you send them. 
lets think about this who earth will give you free money one thats who. 
they have such wonderful method doubling bitcoin then why would they share and not just keep themselves get rich well actually they have method for getting rich its stealing others coin. 
onion wow site that sells cloned debit cards with pin that you can just easily walk any atm and cash out. 
just like with the double your btc service who their right mind would give away free money why couldnt they just keep the cards and cash them out themselves these are the question you have ask and the true simple answer that they dont have any cards. 
they just want your coin and bolt. 
peoples drug store. 
onion just another rip off site that offers escrow protection and just wants steal from you. 
same with the other mentioned sites they state that once payment received they will mail you the shipping information. 
hate say but you will waiting long time for that info. 
important keep and eye out with other sites using the same format. 
they are hosted pseudo organization called torshops. 
avoid all their sites all costs iphones for. 
onion just gonna say all these electronic stores are scams. 
never have seen legit ones. 
either they feed you line shit why they dont escrow and there are ones that offer fake escrow service. 
the sites with escrow accepted will usually send you link site you probably never heard and ask you depoist money and simply release when you get your item. 
sadly the electronic site most likely owns that escrow site and will just take the btc and avoid your emails. 
wont into lot detail but the self operated sites that sell guns and offer hitman services. 
they are all scams plain and simple. 
the solution just stick the established markets and use their escrow system. 
remember escrow the main line defense that protects you from losing your coin. 
scammers commercial marketsthis section will cover how spot and deal with rippers that use established markets host their scam. 
some them demand everything others will appear have outstanding feedback and there are even some that offer escrow too. 
here are the ways spot them and some tactics they use steal your coins. 
the first and easy ones spot are the brand new vendors site with reputation and off the bat request. 
they either sell great variety different products red flag great price hoping grab many customers possible. 
they have few big and expensive products and wait until someone takes the bait. 
when you spot these people question them why they dont accept escrow. 
the most common replies scammers give are they dont trust escrow btc too unpredictable. 
whatever excuse they give you just walk away. 
know thats killer deal they offer but wouldnt you rather peace mind there are plenty legit vendors that accept escrow. 
dont risk and with them. 
forgot mention always check their feedback and the forums find any reviews the vendor may have. 
this will give you better assurance whether not deal with the vendor. 
lot the time. 
you will find scammers with amazing feedback. 
how could this well they use the tactic called feedback stacking. 
this when scammer registers numerous buyer accounts and buy from themselves and leave amazing feedback. 
here what look for when spotting padded feedback numerous complete orders the same day price extremely low item was deleted same username same comments are used over and over again. 
example you have pandora login and check out this sellers profile note this not attack pandora was just example found. 
these are found every market. 
onion profile scroll all the way down and look the feedback long way down. 
sellers way hiding. 
this probably the most obvious padded feedback ever seen. 
some are more clever then that but they always slip showing pattern. 
youll notice when you come across. 
when you order from vendor and the item escrow make sure you note the shipping time. 
lot rippers will set short shipping time hoping that you wont notice that the order will auto finalize. 
just remember when funds are released whether after feing the order auto finalized the first thing that vendor will quickly withdraw the coin their wallet. 
now out the staffs hands recover your money. 
one final note careful when posting the wanted buyer request section markets forum. 
this where lot rip offs occur. 
you may get plenty pms from people who arent even vendor saying they can help you out. 
just remember tell them hell and wait for verified vendor reply. 
because you know whats gonna you decide follow through with that offer. 
well this what got far. 
pretty long winded know. 
please feel free ask question toss any extra info forgot discuss. 
stay safe out there everyone and remember that golden rule its too good true probably. 
marketplace was down slow for about hours yesterday but all working expected now. 
great selection drugs child porn orpgp login available. 
onion register vzclxsvkkei could not find agora sub folder the first few pages that surprised. 
please merge mods missed. 
always use pgp for sensitive information.

important keep and eye out with other sites using the same format. 
they are hosted pseudo organization called torshops. 
avoid all their sites all costs iphones for. 
onion just gonna say all these electronic stores are scams. 
never have seen legit ones. 
either they feed you line shit why they dont escrow and there are ones that offer fake escrow service. 
the sites with escrow accepted will usually send you link site you probably never heard and ask you depoist money and simply release when you get your item. 
sadly the electronic site most likely owns that escrow site and will just take the btc and avoid your emails. 
wont into lot detail but the self operated sites that sell guns and offer hitman services. 
they are all scams plain and simple. 
the solution just stick the established markets and use their escrow system. 
remember escrow the main line defense that protects you from losing your coin. 
scammers commercial marketsthis section will cover how spot and deal with rippers that use established markets host their scam. 
some them demand everything others will appear have outstanding feedback and there are even some that offer escrow too. 
here are the ways spot them and some tactics they use steal your coins. 
the first and easy ones spot are the brand new vendors site with reputation and off the bat request. 
they either sell great variety different products red flag great price hoping grab many customers possible. 
they have few big and expensive products and wait until someone takes the bait. 
when you spot these people question them why they dont accept escrow. 
the most common replies scammers give are they dont trust escrow btc too unpredictable. 
whatever excuse they give you just walk away. 
know thats killer deal they offer but wouldnt you rather peace mind there are plenty legit vendors that accept escrow. 
dont risk and with them. 
forgot mention always check their feedback and the forums find any reviews the vendor may have. 
this will give you better assurance whether not deal with the vendor. 
lot the time. 
you will find scammers with amazing feedback. 
how could this well they use the tactic called feedback stacking. 
this when scammer registers numerous buyer accounts and buy from themselves and leave amazing feedback. 
here what look for when spotting padded feedback numerous complete orders the same day price extremely low item was deleted same username same comments are used over and over again. 
example you have pandora login and check out this sellers profile note this not attack pandora was just example found. 
these are found every market. 
onion profile scroll all the way down and look the feedback long way down. 
sellers way hiding. 
this probably the most obvious padded feedback ever seen. 
some are more clever then that but they always slip showing pattern. 
youll notice when you come across.

from donkeysausage may may growing pains and like trees have faith the market but can bit irritating times. 
you can say that last part again. 
its been source major frustration for late. 
during years tor have seen countless scam attempts and many sad faces those who were ripped off. 
here the deep web scammers will always exist plain and simple. 
matter how hard all try bust them down their presence will always remain. 
you will find them forums their own websites and throughout all major and established dark markets. 
now that all have accepted this sad issue lets discuss the many methods help prevent you from falling into this trap. 
first and foremost the number one rule when doing business the deep web always trust your instinct. 
sure all you heard this old saying before its too good true probably. 
know its very cliche but still holds lot merit. 
most scam victims fail follow this and with their impulses instead. 
they see product deal astounding price that they dont think anything else but having the items their hands. 
its like being hypnotized sense. 
dont worry not talking down anyone. 
its human nature follow with impulses. 
just remember that next time you see amazing deal think through and see this can realistic. 
now that covered the golden rule. 
now going discuss the different types scam methods that are present thought the deep web. 
please post left anything out you have any questions comments. 
the hidden wiki thw thw probably one the oldest sites still existance tor. 
more then likely one the first sites many people new tor visit. 
can quite amazing discovery seeing all the differnt businesses selling drugs weapons fraud items stolen electronics etc. 
for lack words its really awesome see that you now have access pretty much anything you want when you didnt prior setting tor. 
now the problem here that thw can moderated pretty much anyone who has registered account. 
some the nefarious hidden wiki staff are very aware the many new comers deep web. 
this why safe that just about every commercial site thw are scams. 
plan and simple. 
even legitimate and well known markets featured thw are more then likely phishing sites set steal your account information. 
long story short avoid the hidden wiki when searching for market links. 
example phishing site for. 
onion best way tell that the url obviously the wrong one. 
you need link market site visit the subreddit darknetmarkets. 
com darknetmarkets the deep dot web. 
these sites provide legitimate market links that are never altered. 
anyone knows any other sites new comers can use find legit links please toss them. 
non market commercial sitesjust like the ones listed thw pretty much all the small sites that sell products and services are all pretty much scams. 
the only exception are sites that operated established market vendors who are well recognized and can verified with their pgp. 
anyone needs help verifying someones pgp you are more then welcome message and ill glad help. 
plus there are few sites that catalog vendor pgps and offer verification well. 
ill show you some examples sites and how tell the are rippers. 
green notes counter. 
onion here site that sells counterfeit coins. 
sadly they not accept escrow and give the typical scammer reason that they not trust escrow sites. 
but for some ill logic reason its okay trust them. 
lol yeah right. 
double your btc. 
onion here site that promises return you the double amount btc you send them. 
lets think about this who earth will give you free money one thats who. 
they have such wonderful method doubling bitcoin then why would they share and not just keep themselves get rich well actually they have method for getting rich its stealing others coin. 
onion wow site that sells cloned debit cards with pin that you can just easily walk any atm and cash out. 
just like with the double your btc service who their right mind would give away free money why couldnt they just keep the cards and cash them out themselves these are the question you have ask and the true simple answer that they dont have any cards. 
they just want your coin and bolt. 
peoples drug store. 
onion just another rip off site that offers escrow protection and just wants steal from you. 
same with the other mentioned sites they state that once payment received they will mail you the shipping information. 
hate say but you will waiting long time for that info. 
important keep and eye out with other sites using the same format. 
they are hosted pseudo organization called torshops. 
avoid all their sites all costs iphones for. 
onion just gonna say all these electronic stores are scams. 
never have seen legit ones. 
either they feed you line shit why they dont escrow and there are ones that offer fake escrow service. 
the sites with escrow accepted will usually send you link site you probably never heard and ask you depoist money and simply release when you get your item. 
sadly the electronic site most likely owns that escrow site and will just take the btc and avoid your emails. 
wont into lot detail but the self operated sites that sell guns and offer hitman services. 
they are all scams plain and simple. 
the solution just stick the established markets and use their escrow system. 
remember escrow the main line defense that protects you from losing your coin. 
scammers commercial marketsthis section will cover how spot and deal with rippers that use established markets host their scam. 
some them demand everything others will appear have outstanding feedback and there are even some that offer escrow too. 
here are the ways spot them and some tactics they use steal your coins. 
the first and easy ones spot are the brand new vendors site with reputation and off the bat request. 
they either sell great variety different products red flag great price hoping grab many customers possible. 
they have few big and expensive products and wait until someone takes the bait. 
when you spot these people question them why they dont accept escrow. 
the most common replies scammers give are they dont trust escrow btc too unpredictable. 
whatever excuse they give you just walk away. 
know thats killer deal they offer but wouldnt you rather peace mind there are plenty legit vendors that accept escrow. 
dont risk and with them. 
forgot mention always check their feedback and the forums find any reviews the vendor may have. 
this will give you better assurance whether not deal with the vendor. 
lot the time. 
you will find scammers with amazing feedback. 
how could this well they use the tactic called feedback stacking. 
this when scammer registers numerous buyer accounts and buy from themselves and leave amazing feedback. 
here what look for when spotting padded feedback numerous complete orders the same day price extremely low item was deleted same username same comments are used over and over again. 
example you have pandora login and check out this sellers profile note this not attack pandora was just example found. 
these are found every market. 
onion profile scroll all the way down and look the feedback long way down. 
sellers way hiding. 
this probably the most obvious padded feedback ever seen. 
some are more clever then that but they always slip showing pattern. 
youll notice when you come across. 
when you order from vendor and the item escrow make sure you note the shipping time. 
lot rippers will set short shipping time hoping that you wont notice that the order will auto finalize. 
just remember when funds are released whether after feing the order auto finalized the first thing that vendor will quickly withdraw the coin their wallet. 
now out the staffs hands recover your money. 
one final note careful when posting the wanted buyer request section markets forum. 
this where lot rip offs occur. 
you may get plenty pms from people who arent even vendor saying they can help you out. 
just remember tell them hell and wait for verified vendor reply.

owock thanks for posting the wei. 
youve lead very productive path. 
from what can gather there way wipe shred single file held usb flash drive. 
the original deleted file remains the medium. 
you cant see because its not listed but remains situand unless the usb drive very full probably tact too. 
there are lots tools out there that take advantage this fact allowing you recover deleted files from flash drives. 
here are two free ones that tried. 
deleted files recovery. 
has nice interface. 
but only seems show you recently created deleted files. 
cardrecovery really excellent much better than recuva. 
performs seemingly exhaustive scan. 
what did have usb key that been preparing receive gpg usb. 
some days ago emptied the usb key copying its content another drive and deleting each file. 
then cleaned the usb putting two partitions and formatting them individually. 
one with fat the other with ext. 
when ran cardrecovery the ostensibly clean fat partitioni was shocked the number files all types that found there. 
there were and files. 
the videos did the files tested. 
some those files must have been there for over months. 
they have survived deletion and disc partitioning and disc formatting. 
also found decrypted and raw messages that recently deletedafter testing the command line gpg. 
that ships with gpg usb. 
having played with the cardrecovery program its crystal clearto now that files are not actually deleted from usb key theyre simply removed from the directory listing. 
presumably when leo confiscates your phone laptop computer usb keyand inspects the media for evidence they use some program like cardrecovery see history virtually everything you havebeen doing. 
did some further tests encrypting and compressing gpg usband secret encryption messages using zip. 
and deleting the originals. 
now you might imagine this process compressing and encrypting yoursecret messages would nice stealthy way hiding any incriminating evidence. 
the original secret messages are still there their pristine encrypted and decrypted formats. 
when you create the file you simply add newfile the total files held the medium. 
every time you use your usb key youre simply accumulating historyof your activities the usb drive. 
this important because several usb keys ship within encryption software the called encryption vaults. 
youre invited believe that storingfiles this vault will keep them safe from prying eyes. 
father would say. 
you store file your usb drive and then run the encryption vaultthe software will encrypt and delete the original thats true. 
but theoriginal isnt deleted. 
its effectively doing the same thing that didwith zip encryption and compression experiment mentioned above. 
presumably recognition this that some prefer use wholedrive encryption. 
however even here usb stick steady historyof your activities accumulates the usb drive. 
you decrypt the disk you will presumably find data images all the files youve previously deleted just occurs the unencrypted usb drive scenario. 
the only apparent solution this history activity problem seems sanitize the entire usb drive. 
but that seems little excessive. 
suppose the simplest solution would never use the usb drive for message storage. 
use only for application execution. 
perhaps you could set the permissions the usb drive read and execute but not write everywhere except the directoryin which your pubring secring gpg. 
conf files reside. 
you run the encryption software off the usb drive. 
but you keep the encryption messages the host machine. 
when youre done you encrypt all the data you want take withyou and copy the usb drive same folder pubring secring gpg. 
you then should use something like wipe shred the files you want delete your working directory the host machine. 
the big lesson for from all this longer rely file. 
txt del file.

now understand the need shred wipe sdelete them.

whoops forgot mention some ways catch scammers their pictures. 
here are two awesome sites use your disposal. 
google yes google. 
com imghp this can used for reverse image searching. 
have caught tons scammers this way. 
copy their posting and upload the picture. 
you will find where they stole the image they are claiming their product. 
com scans the metadata and does error level analysis. 
perfect for finding out they photo shopped that piece paper with their signature and date. 
hilarious when you see their reaction when you call them out ill post more when think them. 
sorry the shitty grammar the. 
its not forte. 
from zaphod may pmquote from timothy leary may pmok thank you that really feels bad cause see bitmessage very good and secure way communicate. 
peacein theory bitmessage secure that has yet established. 
you insist using bitmessage you might wish consider using the bitmessage gateway. 
were your shoes would pgp encrypt all messages prior sending them through bitmessage just case. 
bitmessage may turn out the best thing since sliced bread only time will tell. 
until know for sure that secure use caution and pgp encrypt all messages before submitting them bitmessage. 
why use bitmessage mail gateway with bitmessage. 
email address you not need set bitmessage client reach user bitmessage and anyone bitmessage can send you email directly from their bitmessage client. 
also since bitmessages expire two days and are deleted you can use bitmessage. 
while vacation and not miss any mail from your contacts bitmessage. 
bitmessage mail gateway free and run one the moderators the bitmessage forum.

format wont delete data matter usb whatever. 
from owockeznan april amon flash based memory either you have hope the controller supports the ata secure erase command correctly most not you have blank the entire thing with. 
you cant run shred anything like that flash system. 
this paper may prove interesting and speaks more the subject. 
org legacy events fast tech full papers wei. 
pdfthis why would either encrypt the entire partition with the info because encrypted data should look just like normal random data use program encrypt all before its disk. 
you really need work document temporarily you want mount partition loopback device memory. 
owock thanks for posting the wei. 
youve lead very productive path. 
from what can gather there way wipe shred single file held usb flash drive. 
the original deleted file remains the medium. 
you cant see because its not listed but remains situand unless the usb drive very full probably tact too. 
there are lots tools out there that take advantage this fact allowing you recover deleted files from flash drives. 
here are two free ones that tried. 
deleted files recovery. 
has nice interface. 
but only seems show you recently created deleted files. 
cardrecovery really excellent much better than recuva. 
performs seemingly exhaustive scan. 
what did have usb key that been preparing receive gpg usb. 
some days ago emptied the usb key copying its content another drive and deleting each file. 
then cleaned the usb putting two partitions and formatting them individually. 
one with fat the other with ext. 
when ran cardrecovery the ostensibly clean fat partitioni was shocked the number files all types that found there. 
there were and files. 
the videos did the files tested. 
some those files must have been there for over months. 
they have survived deletion and disc partitioning and disc formatting. 
also found decrypted and raw messages that recently deletedafter testing the command line gpg. 
that ships with gpg usb. 
having played with the cardrecovery program its crystal clearto now that files are not actually deleted from usb key theyre simply removed from the directory listing. 
presumably when leo confiscates your phone laptop computer usb keyand inspects the media for evidence they use some program like cardrecovery see history virtually everything you havebeen doing. 
did some further tests encrypting and compressing gpg usband secret encryption messages using zip. 
and deleting the originals. 
now you might imagine this process compressing and encrypting yoursecret messages would nice stealthy way hiding any incriminating evidence. 
the original secret messages are still there their pristine encrypted and decrypted formats. 
when you create the file you simply add newfile the total files held the medium. 
every time you use your usb key youre simply accumulating historyof your activities the usb drive. 
this important because several usb keys ship within encryption software the called encryption vaults. 
youre invited believe that storingfiles this vault will keep them safe from prying eyes. 
father would say. 
you store file your usb drive and then run the encryption vaultthe software will encrypt and delete the original thats true. 
but theoriginal isnt deleted. 
its effectively doing the same thing that didwith zip encryption and compression experiment mentioned above.

however even here usb stick steady historyof your activities accumulates the usb drive.

agreed and any type authoritarian body simply thrive complacency. 
not reacting heartbleed appropriately pure brazen laziness and negligence. 
are insulting their users acting though they are impenetrable fortress especially with their history being exactly the opposite. 
most intelligent people have already abandoned surely now its time for the rest the same. 
feel regret saying that the original left awestruck and spellbound and opened new chapter life sad anyone seeing what has become.

was trying explain one their staff about being the safe side and also humoring the community but apparently much too good for those types things. 
that amongst several reasons have decided discontinue doing business the. 
wonderful tip offs usual. 
part vendor protection against scam attemptsbeing vendor myself can fully understand and sympathize for all the hard work and business management they must through. 
albeit these instances are less common they still happen and pretty much any vendor whose been the game long more than likely have any the following occur. 
buyer disputes order stating that not what they expected item did not arrive even though didas stated there are far more awesome and honest buyers than bad apples. 
but sadly does happen mainly with either low lifes kids thinking they can pull fast one. 
cannot stress this enough when creating new listing sure give much detail possible. 
this will prevent any confusion and dispute occurs you can refer the buyer and staff telling them that sold product accordance with the description. 
plus when you have customers before them saying they were satisfied with the item received you will have much higher chances winning dispute. 
when buyer claim the package show make sure you either the following prevent this. 
place tracking all your items that you ship. 
for security try not give out unless necessary. 
this great proof show staff that you did indeed ship out the item. 
you not use tracking make sure known your profile that this the case and you cannot give refunds lost packages. 
would the buyers discretion whether not order. 
buyer threatens leave negative feedback unless given refundive actually had this happen. 
this was plain and simple case that was looking for free stuff and wanted ass and this route. 
really frustrated because was very nice and polite the dude and decided pull this shit. 
well handled professional manner and backed off. 
this what did and what you can too this situation. 
basically called his bluff. 
explained him that have customers before him which true buy the same product and every single one them was completely satisfied. 
given that information told him that wasnt going give him refund and ahead and leave the negative feedback you wish. 
had left the negative feedback wouldve retorted that this customer was just troll looking for free stuff and given positive track record with this item did not feel refund with order. 
never did leave the feedback and released the escrow which happy also depending your market staff will remove negative feedback was unjustified. 
just report staff and see what they say. 
actually know vendor who was the same situation. 
actually refunded the buyer and the asshole buyer still left negative feedback. 
man did that vendor throw fit. 
thankfully the staff took care. 
competitor who will have unethical and disgruntled vendor that jealous your booming business and wants something sabotage. 
lot the times they will make multiple buyer accounts buy the cheapest product you sell and then turn around and either call you scammer the product and service was bad. 
you are victim this report the staff and your customers soon possible. 
let them all know about the situation and given your track record they will understanding. 
most customers can determine you have either troll competitor attacking you and will not think bad you with the given false feedback. 
often staff will recognize the attack and ban the shill accounts and remove the feedback. 
its sad see vendors sink that low such attack. 
trolls disgruntled customersoften times you will come across these when when discussing products and prices about your product. 
what generally happens that youll get buyer that not happy with your price and then offers some low ball figure you can have buyers that want freebie tossed their way. 
you tell them and the price stands. 
most are understanding this while you have some that act like children and throw temper tantrum because they cannot get their way. 
they end going the forums and posting false statements calling you scammer and that your service terrible blah blah blah. 
handle this just politely and professionally explain the situation that you never even done business with this clown and how earth could you scammer when coin was exchanged also explain that their behavior ridiculous and just wanted something cheap free. 
then everybody will realize what ass this buyer just made themselves and will easily join your side this situation. 
well thats all have for right now. 
any vendor would like add and share any their experiences would love hear them. 
thanks for reading and stay safe everybody.

sure you are right anarcho that there are some scams there. 
the fact that they offer escrow makes much more attractive buyer. 
thats how read the ops post. 
not that there are scams over there but that your coins are safer escrow. 
tend believe that correct. 
the buyer safer there escrow. 
wonderful tip offs usual. 
part vendor protection against scam attemptsbeing vendor myself can fully understand and sympathize for all the hard work and business management they must through. 
albeit these instances are less common they still happen and pretty much any vendor whose been the game long more than likely have any the following occur. 
buyer disputes order stating that not what they expected item did not arrive even though didas stated there are far more awesome and honest buyers than bad apples. 
but sadly does happen mainly with either low lifes kids thinking they can pull fast one. 
cannot stress this enough when creating new listing sure give much detail possible. 
this will prevent any confusion and dispute occurs you can refer the buyer and staff telling them that sold product accordance with the description. 
plus when you have customers before them saying they were satisfied with the item received you will have much higher chances winning dispute. 
when buyer claim the package show make sure you either the following prevent this. 
place tracking all your items that you ship. 
for security try not give out unless necessary. 
this great proof show staff that you did indeed ship out the item. 
you not use tracking make sure known your profile that this the case and you cannot give refunds lost packages. 
would the buyers discretion whether not order. 
buyer threatens leave negative feedback unless given refundive actually had this happen. 
this was plain and simple case that was looking for free stuff and wanted ass and this route. 
really frustrated because was very nice and polite the dude and decided pull this shit. 
well handled professional manner and backed off. 
this what did and what you can too this situation. 
basically called his bluff. 
explained him that have customers before him which true buy the same product and every single one them was completely satisfied. 
given that information told him that wasnt going give him refund and ahead and leave the negative feedback you wish. 
had left the negative feedback wouldve retorted that this customer was just troll looking for free stuff and given positive track record with this item did not feel refund with order. 
never did leave the feedback and released the escrow which happy also depending your market staff will remove negative feedback was unjustified. 
just report staff and see what they say. 
actually know vendor who was the same situation. 
actually refunded the buyer and the asshole buyer still left negative feedback. 
man did that vendor throw fit. 
thankfully the staff took care. 
competitor who will have unethical and disgruntled vendor that jealous your booming business and wants something sabotage. 
lot the times they will make multiple buyer accounts buy the cheapest product you sell and then turn around and either call you scammer the product and service was bad. 
you are victim this report the staff and your customers soon possible. 
let them all know about the situation and given your track record they will understanding. 
most customers can determine you have either troll competitor attacking you and will not think bad you with the given false feedback. 
often staff will recognize the attack and ban the shill accounts and remove the feedback. 
its sad see vendors sink that low such attack. 
trolls disgruntled customersoften times you will come across these when when discussing products and prices about your product. 
what generally happens that youll get buyer that not happy with your price and then offers some low ball figure you can have buyers that want freebie tossed their way. 
you tell them and the price stands. 
most are understanding this while you have some that act like children and throw temper tantrum because they cannot get their way. 
they end going the forums and posting false statements calling you scammer and that your service terrible blah blah blah. 
handle this just politely and professionally explain the situation that you never even done business with this clown and how earth could you scammer when coin was exchanged also explain that their behavior ridiculous and just wanted something cheap free. 
then everybody will realize what ass this buyer just made themselves and will easily join your side this situation. 
well thats all have for right now. 
any vendor would like add and share any their experiences would love hear them. 
thanks for reading and stay safe everybody.

not reacting heartbleed appropriately pure brazen laziness and negligence.

tend believe that correct. 
the buyer safer there escrow. 
wonderful tip offs usual. 
part vendor protection against scam attemptsbeing vendor myself can fully understand and sympathize for all the hard work and business management they must through. 
albeit these instances are less common they still happen and pretty much any vendor whose been the game long more than likely have any the following occur. 
buyer disputes order stating that not what they expected item did not arrive even though didas stated there are far more awesome and honest buyers than bad apples. 
but sadly does happen mainly with either low lifes kids thinking they can pull fast one. 
cannot stress this enough when creating new listing sure give much detail possible. 
this will prevent any confusion and dispute occurs you can refer the buyer and staff telling them that sold product accordance with the description. 
plus when you have customers before them saying they were satisfied with the item received you will have much higher chances winning dispute. 
when buyer claim the package show make sure you either the following prevent this. 
place tracking all your items that you ship. 
for security try not give out unless necessary. 
this great proof show staff that you did indeed ship out the item. 
you not use tracking make sure known your profile that this the case and you cannot give refunds lost packages. 
would the buyers discretion whether not order. 
buyer threatens leave negative feedback unless given refundive actually had this happen. 
this was plain and simple case that was looking for free stuff and wanted ass and this route. 
really frustrated because was very nice and polite the dude and decided pull this shit. 
well handled professional manner and backed off. 
this what did and what you can too this situation. 
basically called his bluff. 
explained him that have customers before him which true buy the same product and every single one them was completely satisfied. 
given that information told him that wasnt going give him refund and ahead and leave the negative feedback you wish. 
had left the negative feedback wouldve retorted that this customer was just troll looking for free stuff and given positive track record with this item did not feel refund with order. 
never did leave the feedback and released the escrow which happy also depending your market staff will remove negative feedback was unjustified. 
just report staff and see what they say. 
actually know vendor who was the same situation. 
actually refunded the buyer and the asshole buyer still left negative feedback. 
man did that vendor throw fit. 
thankfully the staff took care. 
competitor who will have unethical and disgruntled vendor that jealous your booming business and wants something sabotage. 
lot the times they will make multiple buyer accounts buy the cheapest product you sell and then turn around and either call you scammer the product and service was bad. 
you are victim this report the staff and your customers soon possible. 
let them all know about the situation and given your track record they will understanding. 
most customers can determine you have either troll competitor attacking you and will not think bad you with the given false feedback. 
often staff will recognize the attack and ban the shill accounts and remove the feedback. 
its sad see vendors sink that low such attack. 
trolls disgruntled customersoften times you will come across these when when discussing products and prices about your product. 
what generally happens that youll get buyer that not happy with your price and then offers some low ball figure you can have buyers that want freebie tossed their way. 
you tell them and the price stands. 
most are understanding this while you have some that act like children and throw temper tantrum because they cannot get their way. 
they end going the forums and posting false statements calling you scammer and that your service terrible blah blah blah. 
handle this just politely and professionally explain the situation that you never even done business with this clown and how earth could you scammer when coin was exchanged also explain that their behavior ridiculous and just wanted something cheap free. 
then everybody will realize what ass this buyer just made themselves and will easily join your side this situation. 
well thats all have for right now. 
any vendor would like add and share any their experiences would love hear them. 
thanks for reading and stay safe everybody.

stealth that works ditch the food grade vac sealpost sierraromeo which believe got off the forum boogie wake call food grade vac sealing vapor permeable and detectable fifteen minutes. 
what the answer well happily there are number options available right now. 
all you need know are mbb moisture barrier bags mylar bags heat seal foil bagsa non permeable layer must included for example when shipping small quantities powders the layering can consist few variations may good idea dispense with the zip lock baggy the zip can felt through the envelope. 
the use double mbb cleaning each thoroughly with isotropic alcohol remove any particle traces one very effective method. 
the final stage must course done clean environment avoid transferring any particle residue the outer packaging wear gloves and discard before completing this stage. 
the best stealth sometimes the simplest envelopes must flat possible with all the usual norms that make them blend into the thousands others going through the system. 
envelope singled out for extra attention its gone that usually only happens when dog reacts. 
vendors already using these methods are listed below please note that the vendors listed below are done solely their use non permeable stealth packaging techniques advised the vendor. 
other factors have been considered this time you are strongly encouraged fully research any vendor before placing order tba how mail sorted when planning your packaging take into consideration this procedure which not specific particular country only applies for letters not parcels. 
mail arrives into said country big sack containing hundreds thousands letters. 
arriving from flagged country its directed sorting area which mail undergoes extra scrutiny from non flagged country its directed sorting area for normal manual sorting. 
the designated sorting area all the mail poured onto sorting tray and manually sorted with the sorter removing anything thats oversize damaged suspicious looking again there would guidelines the sorters follow based profiling and gathered intelligence. 
over sized items are sent the parcel area damaged items are repaired destroyed and suspicious letters are inspected further manual ray dog. 
once manual sorting done the mail sent down conveyor belt the automatic sorting machine while going down the conveyor belt drug detection dog runs over all mail heading down and alerts letters containing whatever the dog trained find these are turn removed for further inspection manual ray the rest carry the machine and are sent for distribution around the country. 
any mail that cant automatically sorted for distribution usually due addresses the wrong format hand written messily too thick fit etc are manually sorted again. 
using the above information one case see that the risk areas are the country origin the initial manual sorter the drug detection dog and the final automatic sorting machine. 
country origin the intelligence which particular countries the receiving country has flagged isnt made publicly available but one could assume they include the netherlands belgium colombia bolivia peru china vietnam thailand among others. 
well countries added based intelligence received and profiling. 
initial mail sorter has manually sort hundreds letters once make sure your letter doesnt attract second glimpse. 
ensure you use high quality envelope not cheap one thats thin and soft and likely tear. 
ensure looks harmless and boring from the outside and ensure its thin possible and packaged the contents cannot felt handled and that handled feels like paper inside not foil bag drug detection dog use moisture barrier bags and foil layered are the best followed and mylar. 
you should doing your packaging clean environment because any molecules from your product end the outside that bag the envelope youve wasted your time and will detected. 
final automatic sorting machine make sure the address clearly readable and the correct format for that country. 
make sure your envelope standard size. 
see the first post this thread for standard envelope sizes use the above information and create your letters how you wish you still get any shows particular country change what your letters look like because your current ones have been photographed and added database. 
this includes the return address and any identifiable logos etc. 
how ensure your mail goes through the sorting machines without needing sorted manually one those pesky humans specific the info below taken from the australia post guidelines for international mail and theyre based around the specs required for mail into the auto sorter machines letter falls outside these guidelines theres much bigger chance will end being manually sorted person. 
when you receive letter than doesnt have one those faint orange barcodes means its been manually sorted. 
this doesnt apply bulk mail that big companies send out people though recommended envelope sizes and max weight and thickness small letter maxc maxno more than thicklarge letter maxc maxb maxno more than thickenvelope quality white gsm paperaddress font courier helvetica font point pitchit should contain full stops commas other punctuation. 
you can use but its recommended not. 
there should advertising logos etc near the address.

com watch wumr qpqp some important info for vendors from farmer bob. 
very useful terms picking the right packaging and cleaning the surface ensure any traces have been removed. 
author farmerbob link topic. 
msg msg date glad see this finally getting adopted but theres lot misinformation going around. 
ignore mylar foil only use laminates that were designed and manufactured used moisture barrier bagging. 
mbbs are subset mylar but mylar does not equate mbb. 
many products that are referred mylar and maybe even look and feel just like mbbs are not suitable for use here. 
beware product substitution. 
dont use irons curling irons food vac sealers. 
they wont give you the consistency quality impulse sealer. 
get quality impulse sealer width and read online how check seal quality. 
you should able see the outline the seal line insulation fabric imprinted one side. 
bond some pieces and pull the bag should tear rather than the seal peeling apart. 
once you get your heat setting where you like keep there but check every few hundred seals. 
leave some air the package clean sink with detergent soap and rinse bleachwater. 
when its the detergent sink squeeze the bags look for air leakage bubble should come out. 
before you pull them out the bleach bucket wash your hands well. 
this point neither bloodhound nor mass spectrometer will pick scent from any enclosed drugs provided you dont contaminate the bag contaminate the mailing materials. 
purchase mbbs from wherever you like plutopete amazon ebay etc anonymously. 
there are survivalists hobbyists and plenty small businesses that buy these. 
they went out style with the big time smugglers decades ago. 
purchasing them wont suspicious and its perfectly legal. 
removing trace particles properly author farmerbob link topic. 
msg msg date the right way ensure you wash off both polar and nopolar surface contaminants. 
detergent wash followed ipa and acetone followed deionized water rinse would the technique youd use you could properly. 
the issue properly good cleanroom surface cleaning technique difficult master. 
you have wipe one direction only and rotate the rag you wipe you have spray the bag from the top down and let gravity wash the contamination down. 
the risk that most people even trained professionals cleaning with alcohol will simply smear contamination around and not actually remove. 
sodium hypochlorite bleach clorox north america probably better choice for the masses. 
bleach will oxidize most organic molecules. 
residues that are left behind after detergent wash will react with the bleach the bucket the oxidized byproducts would likely pass even careful laboratory analysis swab test. 
alternative for the lazy just throw the packs your dishwasher with splash bleach. 
ive done that when was vending and had lot weed orders out and didnt feel like spending too much time cleaning them. 
case used peroxide bleach but everyone else should fine with clorox.

further this file encrypted and one can actually see what you have saved there unless they know your password. 
this sounds extremely high tech but actually very easy set. 
org and click downloads. 
under latest stable version under windows vista click download. 
the file will called true crypt setup. 
exe something similar. 
run this file. 
prompted that program needs your permission continue click continue. 
check accept and agree bound these license terms. 
ensure that install selected and click next. 
you will see dialog stating truecrypt has been successfully installed. 
click when asked you wish view the tutorial user guide. 
click finish this point truecrypt now installed. 
now will set truecrypt that can begin using store sensitive information. 
click the windows logo start button the lower left corner your screen. 
click all programs. 
click the truecrypt applicationand now can begin. 
click the button create volume. 
ensuring that create encrypted file container selected click next. 
select hidden truecrypt volume and click next. 
ensuring that normal mode selected click next. 
click select file note which directory you are your computer. 
look the top the dialog that has opened and you will see the path you are most likely the home directory for your username. 
input box provided with flashing cursor asking you type file name. 
here you will type the following filename random. 
txt you may course replace random. 
txt with anything you like. 
this file going created and will used store many other files inside. 
not use filename for file that already exists. 
the idea here that you are creating entirely new file. 
also recommended though not required that you hide this file somewhere less obvious. 
your home directory then someone who has access your computer may find easier. 
you can also choose put this file any other media doesn have your hard disk. 
you could for example save your truecrypt file usb flash drive card some other media. 
once you have typed the file name click save. 
make sure never save history checked. 
the outer volume screen click next again. 
the default encryption algorithm and hash algorithm are fine. 
choose file size. 
order benefit the most from this guide you should have least gigabytes free disk space. 
not then worth for you purchase some form media such removable harddrive large card etc. 
truecrypt can used all forms digital media not just your hard disk. 
you choose proceed without obtaining least ten gigabytes disk space then select size that you are comfortable with such. 
ideally you want choose enough space work with. 
remember that you need more space later you can always create additional truecrypt volumes using exactly these same steps. 
now you are prompted for password. 
this very important. 
read this carefullyread this section carefullythe password you choose here decoy password. 
that means this the password you would give someone under duress. 
suppose that someone suspects that you were accessing sensitive information and they threaten beat you worse you not reveal the password. 
this the password that you give them. 
when you give someone this password will nearly impossible for them prove that not the right password. 
further they cannot even know that there second password. 
here are some tips for your password. 
choose password you will never forget. 
may ten years from now that you need. 
make simple like your birthday repeated three times. 
make sure seems reasonable that appears real password. 
the password something stupid like then they may not believe you. 
remember that this password that you would give someone forced. 
not your actual password. 
not make this password too similar what you plan really use. 
you not want someone guess your main password from this one. 
and with all this mind choose your password. 
when you have typed twice click next. 
large files here you are asked whether not you plan store files larger than gigabytes. 
choose and click next. 
outer volume format here you will notice some random numbers and letters next where says random pool. 
ahead and move your mouse around fora bit. 
this will increase the randomness and give you better encryption. 
after about ten seconds this click format. 
depending the file size you selected will take some time finish formatting. 
what happening truecrypt creating the file you asked such random. 
building file system contained entirely within that one file. 
this file system can used store files directories and more. 
further encrypting this file system such way that without the right password will impossible for anyone access. 
anyone other than you this file will appear just mess random characters. 
one will even know that truecrypt volume. 
outer volume contents click the button called open outer volume empty folder has opened. 
this empty because you have yet put any files into your truecrypt volume. 
not put any sensitive content herethis the decoy. 
this what someone would see you gave them the password you used the previous step. 
this not where you are going store your sensitive data. 
you have been forced into situation where you had reveal your password some individual then that individual will see whatever this folder. 
you need have data this folder that appears sensitive enough protected truecrypt order fool them. 
here are some important tips keep mind. 
not use porn. 
adult models can sometimes appear underaged and this can cause you incriminate yourself. 
not use drawings renderings writings porn. 
many jurisdictions these are just illegal photographs. 
good choices for what put here include backups documents emails financial documents etc. 
once you have placed files into this folder never place any more files the future. 
doing may damage your hidden content. 
generally you want store innocent data where some individual looking would find cause against you and yet the same time they would understand why you used truecrypt secure that data. 
now ahead and find files and store them this folder. 
sure that you leave least ten gigabytes free. 
the more the better. 
when you are all done copying files into this folder close the folder clicking the the top right corner. 
prompted that program needs your permission continue click continue. 
hidden volume click next. 
the default encryption and hash algorithms are fine click next. 
hidden volume size the maximum available space indicated bold below the text box. 
round down the nearest full unit. 
gbis available select. 
are available select. 
warning dialog comes asking are you sure you wish continue select yes. 
hidden volume password important read thishere you are going select the real password. 
this the password you will never reveal anyone else under any circumstances. 
only you will know. 
one will able figure out even know that there second password. 
aware that individual intent obtaining your sensitive information may lie you and claim able figure this out. 
highly recommended that you choose character password here. 
difficult remember character password choose character password and simply repeat times. 
date naturally has exactly numbers and significant date your life repeated times would just fine. 
type your password twice and click next. 
large files select yes and click next. 
hidden volume format before move your mouse around for about ten seconds randomly and tehn click format. 
prompted program needs your permission continue select continue. 
dialog will come telling you that the hidden truecrypt volume has been successfully created. 
click exit you have just set encrypted file container your hard drive. 
anything you store here will inaccessible anyone except you. 
further you have protected this content with two passwords. 
one that you will give someone under threat and one that only you will know. 
keep your real password well protected and never write down give anyone else for any reason. 
now should test both passwords. 
testing truecrypt volumesonce you have completed the above section you will back truecrypt. 
ahead and follow these steps test the volumes you have made. 
click select file. 
locate the file you created the last section most likely called random. 
txt something similar. 
remember that even though there both outer anda hidden volume both volumes are contained single file. 
there are not two files only one. 
choose drive letter that you are not using anything past probably just fine. 
click that for example click highlight. 
now you are prompted for password. 
read the below carefully the password you provide here will determine which volume mounted the drive letter you specified. 
you type your decoy password then will show all the files and directories you copied that you would reveal forced. 
you type your real password then will show the files and directories that you never intend anyone see. 
after successfully typing your password you will see additional detail the right the drive letter including the full path the file you selected well the kind volume for example hidden. 
right click your windows logo start menu icon and scroll down the bottom where you can see your different drive letters. 
you will see the drive letter you selected for example local disk. 
you selected your decoy password you will see all the files and folders that you moved there during the installation phase. 
you selected the real password you will see whatever files and directories you have placed far into the hidden volume any. 
you selected your hidden volume password you may now begin moving any sensitive information you wish. 
aware that simply moving from your main hard disk not enough. 
will discuss how ensure deleted data actually deleted later the guide. 
what happening when you select file and mount drive you are telling your computer that you have new drive with files and folders. 
the same thing you had plugged usb flash drive removable harddrive card into your computer. 
truecrypt causes your computer think that there entirely new disk drive your computer. 
you can use this disk drive just was actually usb flash drive. 
you can copy files directories and use just you would use usb flash drive. 
when you are done simply close all open windows folders applications that are using your truecrypt drive letter and then click dismount from within truecrypt while you have the drive letter highlighted. 
this will once again hide all this data accessible only mounting with the correct password. 
very important safety true crypt hidden volume mounted someone who has access your computer can access anything that inside that hidden volume. 
for example you left your computer running while truecrypt volume was mounted then someone gained access your computer they would able see everything you have that volume. 
therefore always remember dismount any truecrypt volume containing any sensitive information when you are not using your computeryou can tell that dismounted because the drive letter inside truecrypt control panel will appear the same all the other drive letters with information the right the drive letter. 
you should practice mounting and dismounting few times with both passwords make sure you understand this process. 
once you have copied files folders into the hidden volume not touch the files folders the outer volume anymore. 
remember that both volumes occupy the same single file and therefore changing the outer volume can damage the hidden volume. 
once you have copied files folders into the outer volume during the installation process that the last time you should. 
from that point forward use only the hidden volume. 
the outer volume exists only decoy you need.

stealth that works ditch the food grade vac sealpost sierraromeo which believe got off the forum boogie wake call food grade vac sealing vapor permeable and detectable fifteen minutes. 
what the answer well happily there are number options available right now. 
all you need know are mbb moisture barrier bags mylar bags heat seal foil bagsa non permeable layer must included for example when shipping small quantities powders the layering can consist few variations may good idea dispense with the zip lock baggy the zip can felt through the envelope. 
the use double mbb cleaning each thoroughly with isotropic alcohol remove any particle traces one very effective method. 
the final stage must course done clean environment avoid transferring any particle residue the outer packaging wear gloves and discard before completing this stage. 
the best stealth sometimes the simplest envelopes must flat possible with all the usual norms that make them blend into the thousands others going through the system. 
envelope singled out for extra attention its gone that usually only happens when dog reacts. 
vendors already using these methods are listed below please note that the vendors listed below are done solely their use non permeable stealth packaging techniques advised the vendor. 
other factors have been considered this time you are strongly encouraged fully research any vendor before placing order tba how mail sorted when planning your packaging take into consideration this procedure which not specific particular country only applies for letters not parcels. 
mail arrives into said country big sack containing hundreds thousands letters. 
arriving from flagged country its directed sorting area which mail undergoes extra scrutiny from non flagged country its directed sorting area for normal manual sorting. 
the designated sorting area all the mail poured onto sorting tray and manually sorted with the sorter removing anything thats oversize damaged suspicious looking again there would guidelines the sorters follow based profiling and gathered intelligence. 
over sized items are sent the parcel area damaged items are repaired destroyed and suspicious letters are inspected further manual ray dog. 
once manual sorting done the mail sent down conveyor belt the automatic sorting machine while going down the conveyor belt drug detection dog runs over all mail heading down and alerts letters containing whatever the dog trained find these are turn removed for further inspection manual ray the rest carry the machine and are sent for distribution around the country. 
any mail that cant automatically sorted for distribution usually due addresses the wrong format hand written messily too thick fit etc are manually sorted again. 
using the above information one case see that the risk areas are the country origin the initial manual sorter the drug detection dog and the final automatic sorting machine. 
country origin the intelligence which particular countries the receiving country has flagged isnt made publicly available but one could assume they include the netherlands belgium colombia bolivia peru china vietnam thailand among others. 
well countries added based intelligence received and profiling. 
initial mail sorter has manually sort hundreds letters once make sure your letter doesnt attract second glimpse. 
ensure you use high quality envelope not cheap one thats thin and soft and likely tear. 
ensure looks harmless and boring from the outside and ensure its thin possible and packaged the contents cannot felt handled and that handled feels like paper inside not foil bag drug detection dog use moisture barrier bags and foil layered are the best followed and mylar. 
you should doing your packaging clean environment because any molecules from your product end the outside that bag the envelope youve wasted your time and will detected. 
final automatic sorting machine make sure the address clearly readable and the correct format for that country. 
make sure your envelope standard size. 
see the first post this thread for standard envelope sizes use the above information and create your letters how you wish you still get any shows particular country change what your letters look like because your current ones have been photographed and added database. 
this includes the return address and any identifiable logos etc. 
how ensure your mail goes through the sorting machines without needing sorted manually one those pesky humans specific the info below taken from the australia post guidelines for international mail and theyre based around the specs required for mail into the auto sorter machines letter falls outside these guidelines theres much bigger chance will end being manually sorted person. 
when you receive letter than doesnt have one those faint orange barcodes means its been manually sorted.

rather than drop link pdf file. 
could drop link postscript file. 
and other darknet userswho clicked this link wouldnt have worry about accidentally anonymizing themselves. 
least thats theory. 
just not sure that correct.

hello siblings understand that risky open pdf and doc type documents sincethese formats access the internet when you open them and couldreveal your ipaddress. 
which document types not this howabout post script files thanks for your helphave nice day. 
hey hubsters have tons security tutorials that ive collected over time. 
nerd and always fan useful guides. 
happy share with you collection. 
ill keep posting find them computer and when have time. 
you have any please toss them. 
ill try best reference them can remember encrypting your hard drive with verto owner evolution market introductionif you save anything your computer likely that you not want just anyone able see what you have saved. 
you want way protect that information that you can access and absolutely one else except those you trust. 
therefore makes sense set system which protects your information and safeguards against prying eyes. 
the best such system for this called true crypt. 
true crypt encryption software program which allows you store many files and directories inside single file your harddrive. 
further this file encrypted and one can actually see what you have saved there unless they know your password. 
this sounds extremely high tech but actually very easy set. 
org and click downloads. 
under latest stable version under windows vista click download. 
the file will called true crypt setup. 
exe something similar. 
run this file. 
prompted that program needs your permission continue click continue. 
check accept and agree bound these license terms. 
ensure that install selected and click next. 
you will see dialog stating truecrypt has been successfully installed. 
click when asked you wish view the tutorial user guide. 
click finish this point truecrypt now installed. 
now will set truecrypt that can begin using store sensitive information. 
click the windows logo start button the lower left corner your screen. 
click all programs. 
click the truecrypt applicationand now can begin. 
click the button create volume. 
ensuring that create encrypted file container selected click next. 
select hidden truecrypt volume and click next. 
ensuring that normal mode selected click next. 
click select file note which directory you are your computer. 
look the top the dialog that has opened and you will see the path you are most likely the home directory for your username. 
input box provided with flashing cursor asking you type file name. 
here you will type the following filename random. 
txt you may course replace random. 
txt with anything you like. 
this file going created and will used store many other files inside. 
not use filename for file that already exists. 
the idea here that you are creating entirely new file. 
also recommended though not required that you hide this file somewhere less obvious. 
your home directory then someone who has access your computer may find easier. 
you can also choose put this file any other media doesn have your hard disk. 
you could for example save your truecrypt file usb flash drive card some other media. 
once you have typed the file name click save. 
make sure never save history checked. 
the outer volume screen click next again. 
the default encryption algorithm and hash algorithm are fine. 
choose file size. 
order benefit the most from this guide you should have least gigabytes free disk space. 
not then worth for you purchase some form media such removable harddrive large card etc. 
truecrypt can used all forms digital media not just your hard disk. 
you choose proceed without obtaining least ten gigabytes disk space then select size that you are comfortable with such. 
ideally you want choose enough space work with. 
remember that you need more space later you can always create additional truecrypt volumes using exactly these same steps. 
now you are prompted for password. 
this very important. 
read this carefullyread this section carefullythe password you choose here decoy password. 
that means this the password you would give someone under duress. 
suppose that someone suspects that you were accessing sensitive information and they threaten beat you worse you not reveal the password. 
this the password that you give them. 
when you give someone this password will nearly impossible for them prove that not the right password. 
further they cannot even know that there second password. 
here are some tips for your password. 
choose password you will never forget. 
may ten years from now that you need. 
make simple like your birthday repeated three times. 
make sure seems reasonable that appears real password. 
the password something stupid like then they may not believe you. 
remember that this password that you would give someone forced. 
not your actual password. 
not make this password too similar what you plan really use. 
you not want someone guess your main password from this one. 
and with all this mind choose your password. 
when you have typed twice click next. 
large files here you are asked whether not you plan store files larger than gigabytes. 
choose and click next. 
outer volume format here you will notice some random numbers and letters next where says random pool. 
ahead and move your mouse around fora bit. 
this will increase the randomness and give you better encryption. 
after about ten seconds this click format. 
depending the file size you selected will take some time finish formatting. 
what happening truecrypt creating the file you asked such random. 
building file system contained entirely within that one file. 
this file system can used store files directories and more. 
further encrypting this file system such way that without the right password will impossible for anyone access. 
anyone other than you this file will appear just mess random characters. 
one will even know that truecrypt volume. 
outer volume contents click the button called open outer volume empty folder has opened. 
this empty because you have yet put any files into your truecrypt volume. 
not put any sensitive content herethis the decoy. 
this what someone would see you gave them the password you used the previous step. 
this not where you are going store your sensitive data. 
you have been forced into situation where you had reveal your password some individual then that individual will see whatever this folder. 
you need have data this folder that appears sensitive enough protected truecrypt order fool them. 
here are some important tips keep mind. 
not use porn. 
adult models can sometimes appear underaged and this can cause you incriminate yourself. 
not use drawings renderings writings porn. 
many jurisdictions these are just illegal photographs. 
good choices for what put here include backups documents emails financial documents etc. 
once you have placed files into this folder never place any more files the future. 
doing may damage your hidden content. 
generally you want store innocent data where some individual looking would find cause against you and yet the same time they would understand why you used truecrypt secure that data. 
now ahead and find files and store them this folder. 
sure that you leave least ten gigabytes free. 
the more the better. 
when you are all done copying files into this folder close the folder clicking the the top right corner. 
prompted that program needs your permission continue click continue. 
hidden volume click next. 
the default encryption and hash algorithms are fine click next. 
hidden volume size the maximum available space indicated bold below the text box. 
round down the nearest full unit. 
gbis available select. 
are available select. 
warning dialog comes asking are you sure you wish continue select yes. 
hidden volume password important read thishere you are going select the real password. 
this the password you will never reveal anyone else under any circumstances. 
only you will know. 
one will able figure out even know that there second password. 
aware that individual intent obtaining your sensitive information may lie you and claim able figure this out. 
highly recommended that you choose character password here. 
difficult remember character password choose character password and simply repeat times. 
date naturally has exactly numbers and significant date your life repeated times would just fine. 
type your password twice and click next. 
large files select yes and click next. 
hidden volume format before move your mouse around for about ten seconds randomly and tehn click format. 
prompted program needs your permission continue select continue. 
dialog will come telling you that the hidden truecrypt volume has been successfully created. 
click exit you have just set encrypted file container your hard drive. 
anything you store here will inaccessible anyone except you. 
further you have protected this content with two passwords. 
one that you will give someone under threat and one that only you will know. 
keep your real password well protected and never write down give anyone else for any reason. 
now should test both passwords. 
testing truecrypt volumesonce you have completed the above section you will back truecrypt. 
ahead and follow these steps test the volumes you have made. 
click select file. 
locate the file you created the last section most likely called random. 
txt something similar. 
remember that even though there both outer anda hidden volume both volumes are contained single file. 
there are not two files only one. 
choose drive letter that you are not using anything past probably just fine. 
click that for example click highlight. 
now you are prompted for password. 
read the below carefully the password you provide here will determine which volume mounted the drive letter you specified. 
you type your decoy password then will show all the files and directories you copied that you would reveal forced. 
you type your real password then will show the files and directories that you never intend anyone see. 
after successfully typing your password you will see additional detail the right the drive letter including the full path the file you selected well the kind volume for example hidden. 
right click your windows logo start menu icon and scroll down the bottom where you can see your different drive letters. 
you will see the drive letter you selected for example local disk. 
you selected your decoy password you will see all the files and folders that you moved there during the installation phase. 
you selected the real password you will see whatever files and directories you have placed far into the hidden volume any. 
you selected your hidden volume password you may now begin moving any sensitive information you wish. 
aware that simply moving from your main hard disk not enough. 
will discuss how ensure deleted data actually deleted later the guide. 
what happening when you select file and mount drive you are telling your computer that you have new drive with files and folders. 
the same thing you had plugged usb flash drive removable harddrive card into your computer. 
truecrypt causes your computer think that there entirely new disk drive your computer. 
you can use this disk drive just was actually usb flash drive. 
you can copy files directories and use just you would use usb flash drive. 
when you are done simply close all open windows folders applications that are using your truecrypt drive letter and then click dismount from within truecrypt while you have the drive letter highlighted. 
this will once again hide all this data accessible only mounting with the correct password. 
very important safety true crypt hidden volume mounted someone who has access your computer can access anything that inside that hidden volume. 
for example you left your computer running while truecrypt volume was mounted then someone gained access your computer they would able see everything you have that volume. 
therefore always remember dismount any truecrypt volume containing any sensitive information when you are not using your computeryou can tell that dismounted because the drive letter inside truecrypt control panel will appear the same all the other drive letters with information the right the drive letter. 
you should practice mounting and dismounting few times with both passwords make sure you understand this process. 
once you have copied files folders into the hidden volume not touch the files folders the outer volume anymore. 
remember that both volumes occupy the same single file and therefore changing the outer volume can damage the hidden volume. 
once you have copied files folders into the outer volume during the installation process that the last time you should. 
from that point forward use only the hidden volume. 
the outer volume exists only decoy you need. 
stealth that works ditch the food grade vac sealpost sierraromeo which believe got off the forum boogie wake call food grade vac sealing vapor permeable and detectable fifteen minutes. 
what the answer well happily there are number options available right now. 
all you need know are mbb moisture barrier bags mylar bags heat seal foil bagsa non permeable layer must included for example when shipping small quantities powders the layering can consist few variations may good idea dispense with the zip lock baggy the zip can felt through the envelope. 
the use double mbb cleaning each thoroughly with isotropic alcohol remove any particle traces one very effective method. 
the final stage must course done clean environment avoid transferring any particle residue the outer packaging wear gloves and discard before completing this stage. 
the best stealth sometimes the simplest envelopes must flat possible with all the usual norms that make them blend into the thousands others going through the system. 
envelope singled out for extra attention its gone that usually only happens when dog reacts. 
vendors already using these methods are listed below please note that the vendors listed below are done solely their use non permeable stealth packaging techniques advised the vendor. 
other factors have been considered this time you are strongly encouraged fully research any vendor before placing order tba how mail sorted when planning your packaging take into consideration this procedure which not specific particular country only applies for letters not parcels. 
mail arrives into said country big sack containing hundreds thousands letters. 
arriving from flagged country its directed sorting area which mail undergoes extra scrutiny from non flagged country its directed sorting area for normal manual sorting. 
the designated sorting area all the mail poured onto sorting tray and manually sorted with the sorter removing anything thats oversize damaged suspicious looking again there would guidelines the sorters follow based profiling and gathered intelligence. 
over sized items are sent the parcel area damaged items are repaired destroyed and suspicious letters are inspected further manual ray dog. 
once manual sorting done the mail sent down conveyor belt the automatic sorting machine while going down the conveyor belt drug detection dog runs over all mail heading down and alerts letters containing whatever the dog trained find these are turn removed for further inspection manual ray the rest carry the machine and are sent for distribution around the country. 
any mail that cant automatically sorted for distribution usually due addresses the wrong format hand written messily too thick fit etc are manually sorted again. 
using the above information one case see that the risk areas are the country origin the initial manual sorter the drug detection dog and the final automatic sorting machine. 
country origin the intelligence which particular countries the receiving country has flagged isnt made publicly available but one could assume they include the netherlands belgium colombia bolivia peru china vietnam thailand among others. 
well countries added based intelligence received and profiling. 
initial mail sorter has manually sort hundreds letters once make sure your letter doesnt attract second glimpse. 
ensure you use high quality envelope not cheap one thats thin and soft and likely tear. 
ensure looks harmless and boring from the outside and ensure its thin possible and packaged the contents cannot felt handled and that handled feels like paper inside not foil bag drug detection dog use moisture barrier bags and foil layered are the best followed and mylar. 
you should doing your packaging clean environment because any molecules from your product end the outside that bag the envelope youve wasted your time and will detected. 
final automatic sorting machine make sure the address clearly readable and the correct format for that country. 
make sure your envelope standard size. 
see the first post this thread for standard envelope sizes use the above information and create your letters how you wish you still get any shows particular country change what your letters look like because your current ones have been photographed and added database. 
this includes the return address and any identifiable logos etc. 
how ensure your mail goes through the sorting machines without needing sorted manually one those pesky humans specific the info below taken from the australia post guidelines for international mail and theyre based around the specs required for mail into the auto sorter machines letter falls outside these guidelines theres much bigger chance will end being manually sorted person. 
when you receive letter than doesnt have one those faint orange barcodes means its been manually sorted.

here are some important tips keep mind. 
not use porn. 
adult models can sometimes appear underaged and this can cause you incriminate yourself. 
not use drawings renderings writings porn. 
many jurisdictions these are just illegal photographs. 
good choices for what put here include backups documents emails financial documents etc. 
once you have placed files into this folder never place any more files the future. 
doing may damage your hidden content. 
generally you want store innocent data where some individual looking would find cause against you and yet the same time they would understand why you used truecrypt secure that data. 
now ahead and find files and store them this folder. 
sure that you leave least ten gigabytes free. 
the more the better. 
when you are all done copying files into this folder close the folder clicking the the top right corner. 
prompted that program needs your permission continue click continue. 
hidden volume click next. 
the default encryption and hash algorithms are fine click next.

hidden volume password important read thishere you are going select the real password. 
this the password you will never reveal anyone else under any circumstances. 
only you will know. 
one will able figure out even know that there second password. 
aware that individual intent obtaining your sensitive information may lie you and claim able figure this out. 
highly recommended that you choose character password here. 
difficult remember character password choose character password and simply repeat times. 
date naturally has exactly numbers and significant date your life repeated times would just fine. 
type your password twice and click next. 
large files select yes and click next. 
hidden volume format before move your mouse around for about ten seconds randomly and tehn click format. 
prompted program needs your permission continue select continue. 
dialog will come telling you that the hidden truecrypt volume has been successfully created. 
click exit you have just set encrypted file container your hard drive. 
anything you store here will inaccessible anyone except you. 
further you have protected this content with two passwords. 
one that you will give someone under threat and one that only you will know. 
keep your real password well protected and never write down give anyone else for any reason. 
now should test both passwords. 
testing truecrypt volumesonce you have completed the above section you will back truecrypt. 
ahead and follow these steps test the volumes you have made. 
click select file. 
locate the file you created the last section most likely called random. 
txt something similar. 
remember that even though there both outer anda hidden volume both volumes are contained single file. 
there are not two files only one. 
choose drive letter that you are not using anything past probably just fine. 
click that for example click highlight. 
now you are prompted for password. 
read the below carefully the password you provide here will determine which volume mounted the drive letter you specified. 
you type your decoy password then will show all the files and directories you copied that you would reveal forced. 
you type your real password then will show the files and directories that you never intend anyone see. 
after successfully typing your password you will see additional detail the right the drive letter including the full path the file you selected well the kind volume for example hidden. 
right click your windows logo start menu icon and scroll down the bottom where you can see your different drive letters. 
you will see the drive letter you selected for example local disk. 
you selected your decoy password you will see all the files and folders that you moved there during the installation phase. 
you selected the real password you will see whatever files and directories you have placed far into the hidden volume any. 
you selected your hidden volume password you may now begin moving any sensitive information you wish. 
aware that simply moving from your main hard disk not enough. 
will discuss how ensure deleted data actually deleted later the guide. 
what happening when you select file and mount drive you are telling your computer that you have new drive with files and folders. 
the same thing you had plugged usb flash drive removable harddrive card into your computer. 
truecrypt causes your computer think that there entirely new disk drive your computer. 
you can use this disk drive just was actually usb flash drive. 
you can copy files directories and use just you would use usb flash drive. 
when you are done simply close all open windows folders applications that are using your truecrypt drive letter and then click dismount from within truecrypt while you have the drive letter highlighted. 
this will once again hide all this data accessible only mounting with the correct password. 
very important safety true crypt hidden volume mounted someone who has access your computer can access anything that inside that hidden volume. 
for example you left your computer running while truecrypt volume was mounted then someone gained access your computer they would able see everything you have that volume. 
therefore always remember dismount any truecrypt volume containing any sensitive information when you are not using your computeryou can tell that dismounted because the drive letter inside truecrypt control panel will appear the same all the other drive letters with information the right the drive letter. 
you should practice mounting and dismounting few times with both passwords make sure you understand this process. 
once you have copied files folders into the hidden volume not touch the files folders the outer volume anymore. 
remember that both volumes occupy the same single file and therefore changing the outer volume can damage the hidden volume. 
once you have copied files folders into the outer volume during the installation process that the last time you should. 
from that point forward use only the hidden volume. 
the outer volume exists only decoy you need. 
stealth that works ditch the food grade vac sealpost sierraromeo which believe got off the forum boogie wake call food grade vac sealing vapor permeable and detectable fifteen minutes. 
what the answer well happily there are number options available right now. 
all you need know are mbb moisture barrier bags mylar bags heat seal foil bagsa non permeable layer must included for example when shipping small quantities powders the layering can consist few variations may good idea dispense with the zip lock baggy the zip can felt through the envelope. 
the use double mbb cleaning each thoroughly with isotropic alcohol remove any particle traces one very effective method. 
the final stage must course done clean environment avoid transferring any particle residue the outer packaging wear gloves and discard before completing this stage. 
the best stealth sometimes the simplest envelopes must flat possible with all the usual norms that make them blend into the thousands others going through the system. 
envelope singled out for extra attention its gone that usually only happens when dog reacts. 
vendors already using these methods are listed below please note that the vendors listed below are done solely their use non permeable stealth packaging techniques advised the vendor. 
other factors have been considered this time you are strongly encouraged fully research any vendor before placing order tba how mail sorted when planning your packaging take into consideration this procedure which not specific particular country only applies for letters not parcels. 
mail arrives into said country big sack containing hundreds thousands letters. 
arriving from flagged country its directed sorting area which mail undergoes extra scrutiny from non flagged country its directed sorting area for normal manual sorting. 
the designated sorting area all the mail poured onto sorting tray and manually sorted with the sorter removing anything thats oversize damaged suspicious looking again there would guidelines the sorters follow based profiling and gathered intelligence. 
over sized items are sent the parcel area damaged items are repaired destroyed and suspicious letters are inspected further manual ray dog. 
once manual sorting done the mail sent down conveyor belt the automatic sorting machine while going down the conveyor belt drug detection dog runs over all mail heading down and alerts letters containing whatever the dog trained find these are turn removed for further inspection manual ray the rest carry the machine and are sent for distribution around the country. 
any mail that cant automatically sorted for distribution usually due addresses the wrong format hand written messily too thick fit etc are manually sorted again. 
using the above information one case see that the risk areas are the country origin the initial manual sorter the drug detection dog and the final automatic sorting machine. 
country origin the intelligence which particular countries the receiving country has flagged isnt made publicly available but one could assume they include the netherlands belgium colombia bolivia peru china vietnam thailand among others. 
well countries added based intelligence received and profiling. 
initial mail sorter has manually sort hundreds letters once make sure your letter doesnt attract second glimpse. 
ensure you use high quality envelope not cheap one thats thin and soft and likely tear. 
ensure looks harmless and boring from the outside and ensure its thin possible and packaged the contents cannot felt handled and that handled feels like paper inside not foil bag drug detection dog use moisture barrier bags and foil layered are the best followed and mylar. 
you should doing your packaging clean environment because any molecules from your product end the outside that bag the envelope youve wasted your time and will detected. 
final automatic sorting machine make sure the address clearly readable and the correct format for that country. 
make sure your envelope standard size. 
see the first post this thread for standard envelope sizes use the above information and create your letters how you wish you still get any shows particular country change what your letters look like because your current ones have been photographed and added database. 
this includes the return address and any identifiable logos etc. 
how ensure your mail goes through the sorting machines without needing sorted manually one those pesky humans specific the info below taken from the australia post guidelines for international mail and theyre based around the specs required for mail into the auto sorter machines letter falls outside these guidelines theres much bigger chance will end being manually sorted person. 
when you receive letter than doesnt have one those faint orange barcodes means its been manually sorted.

mbbs are subset mylar but mylar does not equate mbb. 
many products that are referred mylar and maybe even look and feel just like mbbs are not suitable for use here. 
beware product substitution. 
dont use irons curling irons food vac sealers. 
they wont give you the consistency quality impulse sealer. 
get quality impulse sealer width and read online how check seal quality.

the issue properly good cleanroom surface cleaning technique difficult master. 
you have wipe one direction only and rotate the rag you wipe you have spray the bag from the top down and let gravity wash the contamination down. 
the risk that most people even trained professionals cleaning with alcohol will simply smear contamination around and not actually remove. 
sodium hypochlorite bleach clorox north america probably better choice for the masses. 
bleach will oxidize most organic molecules. 
residues that are left behind after detergent wash will react with the bleach the bucket the oxidized byproducts would likely pass even careful laboratory analysis swab test. 
alternative for the lazy just throw the packs your dishwasher with splash bleach. 
ive done that when was vending and had lot weed orders out and didnt feel like spending too much time cleaning them.

you want way protect that information that you can access and absolutely one else except those you trust. 
therefore makes sense set system which protects your information and safeguards against prying eyes. 
the best such system for this called true crypt. 
true crypt encryption software program which allows you store many files and directories inside single file your harddrive. 
further this file encrypted and one can actually see what you have saved there unless they know your password. 
this sounds extremely high tech but actually very easy set.

ensure that install selected and click next. 
you will see dialog stating truecrypt has been successfully installed.

click select file note which directory you are your computer. 
look the top the dialog that has opened and you will see the path you are most likely the home directory for your username. 
input box provided with flashing cursor asking you type file name. 
here you will type the following filename random. 
txt you may course replace random. 
txt with anything you like. 
this file going created and will used store many other files inside. 
not use filename for file that already exists. 
the idea here that you are creating entirely new file. 
also recommended though not required that you hide this file somewhere less obvious. 
your home directory then someone who has access your computer may find easier. 
you can also choose put this file any other media doesn have your hard disk. 
you could for example save your truecrypt file usb flash drive card some other media. 
once you have typed the file name click save. 
make sure never save history checked. 
the outer volume screen click next again. 
the default encryption algorithm and hash algorithm are fine. 
choose file size. 
order benefit the most from this guide you should have least gigabytes free disk space. 
not then worth for you purchase some form media such removable harddrive large card etc. 
truecrypt can used all forms digital media not just your hard disk. 
you choose proceed without obtaining least ten gigabytes disk space then select size that you are comfortable with such. 
ideally you want choose enough space work with. 
remember that you need more space later you can always create additional truecrypt volumes using exactly these same steps. 
now you are prompted for password. 
this very important. 
read this carefullyread this section carefullythe password you choose here decoy password. 
that means this the password you would give someone under duress. 
suppose that someone suspects that you were accessing sensitive information and they threaten beat you worse you not reveal the password.

this will increase the randomness and give you better encryption. 
after about ten seconds this click format. 
depending the file size you selected will take some time finish formatting. 
what happening truecrypt creating the file you asked such random. 
building file system contained entirely within that one file. 
this file system can used store files directories and more. 
further encrypting this file system such way that without the right password will impossible for anyone access. 
anyone other than you this file will appear just mess random characters. 
one will even know that truecrypt volume. 
outer volume contents click the button called open outer volume empty folder has opened. 
this empty because you have yet put any files into your truecrypt volume. 
not put any sensitive content herethis the decoy. 
this what someone would see you gave them the password you used the previous step.

any advice would greatly appreciated cheers rhett. 
also really that bad just auto connect being already connected thru tor node. 
agora seems allow their vendors who require feing lot lattitude when those vendors are then called out scammers both the review page and the forums. 
also have idea who you can talk about vendor that has scammed you nor sure what takes for them banned least have their vendor page suspended. 
however least agora has escrow option. 
still waiting for that which seems nothing but scamming vendors.

ill doing this very soon thanks. 
from owockeznan may amwhy does the buyer have deposit into the evo wallet first why can not get the address and redeemscript inspect for accuracy before move our coin from boogie may pmalso having your coin the market site for min isnt gonna that much big deal hang. 
doesnt that beat the entire purpose multisig have thought the idea multisig not having any coins sent market wallet bro some people would think that big deal. 
technically the scope for loss coins from market hack admin heist still exists right just playing the devils advocate here. 
agora seems allow their vendors who require feing lot lattitude when those vendors are then called out scammers both the review page and the forums. 
also have idea who you can talk about vendor that has scammed you nor sure what takes for them banned least have their vendor page suspended. 
however least agora has escrow option. 
still waiting for that which seems nothing but scamming vendors. 
from meerkovo march amsent about two messages two support its been about week maybe more still reply this normal meerkovomate could wrong but say theres only couple people involved agora would pay dividends possibly employ some moderators for both the forums and the market.

the issues are more than likely too much traffic the server ddos right.

iso file step select your usb drive letter format the drive its not empty already step click create button then wait for finish. 
will few minutes least. 
restart the computer and boot into tails from the usb drive see below for details booting from usb drive booting from usb drive does not automatically boot the usb drive you need select the boot order some newer computers will allow you select which drive boot with small menu without changing bios settings. 
you might instead need edit the bios settings restart your computer and watch for message telling you which key press enter the bios setup. 
will usually one del esc. 
press this key while your computer booting edit your bios settings. 
you need edit the boot order. 
depending your computer you should see entry for removable drive usb media. 
move this the top the list force the computer attempt boot from usb before booting from the hard disk.

org contribute how donate bitcoinnext installing persistent volume alongside liveusb copy tails this why you need two usb drives you should now presented with log prompt for temporary session administration password this reset every time you load tails optional enter this used allow current session access system functions you get any errors about access rights try using admin password log. 
also this point you can optionally select use windows camo skin make tails look more like youre public place for example this also optional.

the size the persistent volume automatically determined how much left over space the usb drive after installing tails the previous steps. 
choose your pass phrase for the persistent volume you will need enter this every time you login tails. 
the persistent volume encrypted partition protected pass phrase. 
once the persistent volume created you can choose activate not each time you start tails.

now only you know what type internet connection you pay for cannot help you with that personal internet connection was amazingly simple setup was quite surprised its pre configured setups has many different countries options for local telcos pre installed. 
another note tails pre configured through tor pre installed with vidalia and torified browser called iceweasel. 
should automatically open when connected the internet. 
not use the iceweasel browser menu shortcut get onto the road. 
also this operating system not persistent for security measures meaning that any changes you make that are not saved the persistent volume will not saved restarting tails you are now finished feel free click through all the menus and play with the applications. 
agora seems allow their vendors who require feing lot lattitude when those vendors are then called out scammers both the review page and the forums. 
also have idea who you can talk about vendor that has scammed you nor sure what takes for them banned least have their vendor page suspended. 
however least agora has escrow option. 
still waiting for that which seems nothing but scamming vendors. 
will when have spare coins from next orderi think erowid. 
org also worth mentioning its just great what they are doing. 
definitely into kicking down some coin when orders start coming hell any vendor that comes from agora whatever other godawful market and starts doing business here could doing this and still making more loot than before theyre longer paying bonds fees commissions etc. 
seconding supporting erowid cant imagine how many terrible trips bad combinations and deaths have been prevented them. 
plus you send them good sized donation theyve got some cool psychedelic poetry magnets and glass molecules theyll send your way. 
from schuldig may pmit pre installed with vidalia and torified browser called iceweasel.

not use the iceweasel browser menu shortcut get onto the road. 
iceweasel opened automatically for tails version. 
but ive had use the shortcut the last two versions. 
just being impatient have set connect ckl obj gypcu. 
onion this worked fine before temp leave. 
should just wait out for the connection have tried other servers and they did not connect either. 
any advice would greatly appreciated cheers rhett. 
also really that bad just auto connect being already connected thru tor node.

therefore makes sense set system which protects your information and safeguards against prying eyes. 
the best such system for this called true crypt. 
true crypt encryption software program which allows you store many files and directories inside single file your harddrive. 
further this file encrypted and one can actually see what you have saved there unless they know your password. 
this sounds extremely high tech but actually very easy set.

ensure that install selected and click next. 
you will see dialog stating truecrypt has been successfully installed. 
click when asked you wish view the tutorial user guide. 
click finish this point truecrypt now installed.

click the truecrypt applicationand now can begin. 
click the button create volume.

select hidden truecrypt volume and click next. 
ensuring that normal mode selected click next. 
click select file note which directory you are your computer. 
look the top the dialog that has opened and you will see the path you are most likely the home directory for your username. 
input box provided with flashing cursor asking you type file name. 
here you will type the following filename random. 
txt you may course replace random. 
txt with anything you like. 
this file going created and will used store many other files inside. 
not use filename for file that already exists. 
the idea here that you are creating entirely new file. 
also recommended though not required that you hide this file somewhere less obvious. 
your home directory then someone who has access your computer may find easier. 
you can also choose put this file any other media doesn have your hard disk. 
you could for example save your truecrypt file usb flash drive card some other media. 
once you have typed the file name click save. 
make sure never save history checked. 
the outer volume screen click next again. 
the default encryption algorithm and hash algorithm are fine. 
choose file size. 
order benefit the most from this guide you should have least gigabytes free disk space. 
not then worth for you purchase some form media such removable harddrive large card etc. 
truecrypt can used all forms digital media not just your hard disk. 
you choose proceed without obtaining least ten gigabytes disk space then select size that you are comfortable with such. 
ideally you want choose enough space work with. 
remember that you need more space later you can always create additional truecrypt volumes using exactly these same steps. 
now you are prompted for password. 
this very important. 
read this carefullyread this section carefullythe password you choose here decoy password. 
that means this the password you would give someone under duress. 
suppose that someone suspects that you were accessing sensitive information and they threaten beat you worse you not reveal the password. 
this the password that you give them. 
when you give someone this password will nearly impossible for them prove that not the right password. 
further they cannot even know that there second password. 
here are some tips for your password. 
choose password you will never forget. 
may ten years from now that you need. 
make simple like your birthday repeated three times. 
make sure seems reasonable that appears real password. 
the password something stupid like then they may not believe you. 
remember that this password that you would give someone forced. 
not your actual password. 
not make this password too similar what you plan really use. 
you not want someone guess your main password from this one. 
and with all this mind choose your password. 
when you have typed twice click next. 
large files here you are asked whether not you plan store files larger than gigabytes. 
choose and click next. 
outer volume format here you will notice some random numbers and letters next where says random pool. 
ahead and move your mouse around fora bit. 
this will increase the randomness and give you better encryption. 
after about ten seconds this click format. 
depending the file size you selected will take some time finish formatting. 
what happening truecrypt creating the file you asked such random. 
building file system contained entirely within that one file. 
this file system can used store files directories and more. 
further encrypting this file system such way that without the right password will impossible for anyone access. 
anyone other than you this file will appear just mess random characters. 
one will even know that truecrypt volume. 
outer volume contents click the button called open outer volume empty folder has opened. 
this empty because you have yet put any files into your truecrypt volume. 
not put any sensitive content herethis the decoy. 
this what someone would see you gave them the password you used the previous step. 
this not where you are going store your sensitive data. 
you have been forced into situation where you had reveal your password some individual then that individual will see whatever this folder. 
you need have data this folder that appears sensitive enough protected truecrypt order fool them. 
here are some important tips keep mind. 
not use porn. 
adult models can sometimes appear underaged and this can cause you incriminate yourself. 
not use drawings renderings writings porn. 
many jurisdictions these are just illegal photographs. 
good choices for what put here include backups documents emails financial documents etc. 
once you have placed files into this folder never place any more files the future. 
doing may damage your hidden content. 
generally you want store innocent data where some individual looking would find cause against you and yet the same time they would understand why you used truecrypt secure that data. 
now ahead and find files and store them this folder. 
sure that you leave least ten gigabytes free. 
the more the better. 
when you are all done copying files into this folder close the folder clicking the the top right corner. 
prompted that program needs your permission continue click continue. 
hidden volume click next. 
the default encryption and hash algorithms are fine click next. 
hidden volume size the maximum available space indicated bold below the text box. 
round down the nearest full unit. 
gbis available select. 
are available select. 
warning dialog comes asking are you sure you wish continue select yes. 
hidden volume password important read thishere you are going select the real password. 
this the password you will never reveal anyone else under any circumstances. 
only you will know. 
one will able figure out even know that there second password. 
aware that individual intent obtaining your sensitive information may lie you and claim able figure this out. 
highly recommended that you choose character password here. 
difficult remember character password choose character password and simply repeat times. 
date naturally has exactly numbers and significant date your life repeated times would just fine. 
type your password twice and click next. 
large files select yes and click next. 
hidden volume format before move your mouse around for about ten seconds randomly and tehn click format. 
prompted program needs your permission continue select continue. 
dialog will come telling you that the hidden truecrypt volume has been successfully created. 
click exit you have just set encrypted file container your hard drive. 
anything you store here will inaccessible anyone except you. 
further you have protected this content with two passwords. 
one that you will give someone under threat and one that only you will know. 
keep your real password well protected and never write down give anyone else for any reason. 
now should test both passwords. 
testing truecrypt volumesonce you have completed the above section you will back truecrypt. 
ahead and follow these steps test the volumes you have made. 
click select file. 
locate the file you created the last section most likely called random. 
txt something similar. 
remember that even though there both outer anda hidden volume both volumes are contained single file. 
there are not two files only one. 
choose drive letter that you are not using anything past probably just fine. 
click that for example click highlight. 
now you are prompted for password. 
read the below carefully the password you provide here will determine which volume mounted the drive letter you specified. 
you type your decoy password then will show all the files and directories you copied that you would reveal forced. 
you type your real password then will show the files and directories that you never intend anyone see. 
after successfully typing your password you will see additional detail the right the drive letter including the full path the file you selected well the kind volume for example hidden. 
right click your windows logo start menu icon and scroll down the bottom where you can see your different drive letters. 
you will see the drive letter you selected for example local disk. 
you selected your decoy password you will see all the files and folders that you moved there during the installation phase. 
you selected the real password you will see whatever files and directories you have placed far into the hidden volume any. 
you selected your hidden volume password you may now begin moving any sensitive information you wish. 
aware that simply moving from your main hard disk not enough. 
will discuss how ensure deleted data actually deleted later the guide. 
what happening when you select file and mount drive you are telling your computer that you have new drive with files and folders. 
the same thing you had plugged usb flash drive removable harddrive card into your computer. 
truecrypt causes your computer think that there entirely new disk drive your computer. 
you can use this disk drive just was actually usb flash drive. 
you can copy files directories and use just you would use usb flash drive. 
when you are done simply close all open windows folders applications that are using your truecrypt drive letter and then click dismount from within truecrypt while you have the drive letter highlighted. 
this will once again hide all this data accessible only mounting with the correct password. 
very important safety true crypt hidden volume mounted someone who has access your computer can access anything that inside that hidden volume. 
for example you left your computer running while truecrypt volume was mounted then someone gained access your computer they would able see everything you have that volume. 
therefore always remember dismount any truecrypt volume containing any sensitive information when you are not using your computeryou can tell that dismounted because the drive letter inside truecrypt control panel will appear the same all the other drive letters with information the right the drive letter. 
you should practice mounting and dismounting few times with both passwords make sure you understand this process. 
once you have copied files folders into the hidden volume not touch the files folders the outer volume anymore. 
remember that both volumes occupy the same single file and therefore changing the outer volume can damage the hidden volume. 
once you have copied files folders into the outer volume during the installation process that the last time you should. 
from that point forward use only the hidden volume. 
the outer volume exists only decoy you need. 
very careful encrypting your laptop with truecrypt full disk encryption unless you want toaster. 
some laptops like have bios issues and can not use truecrypt fde. 
also you can always just replace the with linux distro that has built fde.

keep your real password well protected and never write down give anyone else for any reason. 
now should test both passwords. 
testing truecrypt volumesonce you have completed the above section you will back truecrypt. 
ahead and follow these steps test the volumes you have made. 
click select file. 
locate the file you created the last section most likely called random. 
txt something similar. 
remember that even though there both outer anda hidden volume both volumes are contained single file. 
there are not two files only one. 
choose drive letter that you are not using anything past probably just fine. 
click that for example click highlight. 
now you are prompted for password. 
read the below carefully the password you provide here will determine which volume mounted the drive letter you specified. 
you type your decoy password then will show all the files and directories you copied that you would reveal forced. 
you type your real password then will show the files and directories that you never intend anyone see. 
after successfully typing your password you will see additional detail the right the drive letter including the full path the file you selected well the kind volume for example hidden. 
right click your windows logo start menu icon and scroll down the bottom where you can see your different drive letters. 
you will see the drive letter you selected for example local disk. 
you selected your decoy password you will see all the files and folders that you moved there during the installation phase. 
you selected the real password you will see whatever files and directories you have placed far into the hidden volume any. 
you selected your hidden volume password you may now begin moving any sensitive information you wish. 
aware that simply moving from your main hard disk not enough. 
will discuss how ensure deleted data actually deleted later the guide. 
what happening when you select file and mount drive you are telling your computer that you have new drive with files and folders. 
the same thing you had plugged usb flash drive removable harddrive card into your computer. 
truecrypt causes your computer think that there entirely new disk drive your computer. 
you can use this disk drive just was actually usb flash drive. 
you can copy files directories and use just you would use usb flash drive. 
when you are done simply close all open windows folders applications that are using your truecrypt drive letter and then click dismount from within truecrypt while you have the drive letter highlighted. 
this will once again hide all this data accessible only mounting with the correct password. 
very important safety true crypt hidden volume mounted someone who has access your computer can access anything that inside that hidden volume. 
for example you left your computer running while truecrypt volume was mounted then someone gained access your computer they would able see everything you have that volume. 
therefore always remember dismount any truecrypt volume containing any sensitive information when you are not using your computeryou can tell that dismounted because the drive letter inside truecrypt control panel will appear the same all the other drive letters with information the right the drive letter. 
you should practice mounting and dismounting few times with both passwords make sure you understand this process. 
once you have copied files folders into the hidden volume not touch the files folders the outer volume anymore. 
remember that both volumes occupy the same single file and therefore changing the outer volume can damage the hidden volume. 
once you have copied files folders into the outer volume during the installation process that the last time you should. 
from that point forward use only the hidden volume. 
the outer volume exists only decoy you need. 
very careful encrypting your laptop with truecrypt full disk encryption unless you want toaster. 
some laptops like have bios issues and can not use truecrypt fde. 
also you can always just replace the with linux distro that has built fde. 
down only relevant the server actually down. 
the issues are more than likely too much traffic the server ddos right. 
just being impatient have set connect ckl obj gypcu. 
onion this worked fine before temp leave. 
should just wait out for the connection have tried other servers and they did not connect either. 
any advice would greatly appreciated cheers rhett. 
also really that bad just auto connect being already connected thru tor node. 
all and whats. 
seconding supporting erowid can't imagine how many terrible trips bad combinations and deaths have been prevented them. 
plus you send them good sized donation they've got some cool psychedelic poetry magnets and glass molecules they'll send your way. 
i'm definitely into kicking down some coin when orders start coming hell any vendor that comes from agora whatever other godawful market and starts doing business here could doing this and still making more loot than before they're longer paying bonds fees commissions etc. 
will when have spare coins from next orderi think erowid. 
org also worth mentioning it's just great what they are doing. 
all and whats. 
from owockeznan may amwhy does the buyer have deposit into the evo wallet first why can not get the address and redeemscript inspect for accuracy before move our coin from boogie may pmalso having your coin the market site for min isnt gonna that much big deal hang. 
doesnt that beat the entire purpose multisig have thought the idea multisig not having any coins sent market wallet bro some people would think that big deal. 
technically the scope for loss coins from market hack admin heist still exists right just playing the devils advocate here. 
very good point axa. 
appreciate you adding that. 
you have any tuts also feel free post any friend. 
have been trying for over week. 
site has been down for days and still down. 
have been able get into both but the agora forum thread tools new thread reply any posting has been absent. 
everyone trying new identity correct. 
guys please not direct people contact you for the purpose trade. 
agora seems allow their vendors who require feing lot lattitude when those vendors are then called out scammers both the review page and the forums. 
also have idea who you can talk about vendor that has scammed you nor sure what takes for them banned least have their vendor page suspended. 
however least agora has escrow option. 
still waiting for that which seems nothing but scamming vendors. 
from pops may pmwell done boogie hell lot infomation and good advice. 
your post should sticky itll save lot people lot pain and coin. 
well done again popsthank you pops appreciate the kind words.

from boogie may pmhey hubsters have tons security tutorials that ive collected over time. 
nerd and always fan useful guides. 
happy share with you collection. 
ill keep posting find them computer and when have time. 
you have any please toss them. 
ill try best reference them can remember encrypting your hard drive with verto owner evolution market introductionif you save anything your computer likely that you not want just anyone able see what you have saved. 
you want way protect that information that you can access and absolutely one else except those you trust. 
therefore makes sense set system which protects your information and safeguards against prying eyes. 
the best such system for this called true crypt. 
true crypt encryption software program which allows you store many files and directories inside single file your harddrive. 
further this file encrypted and one can actually see what you have saved there unless they know your password. 
this sounds extremely high tech but actually very easy set. 
org and click downloads. 
under latest stable version under windows vista click download. 
the file will called true crypt setup. 
exe something similar. 
run this file. 
prompted that program needs your permission continue click continue. 
check accept and agree bound these license terms. 
ensure that install selected and click next. 
you will see dialog stating truecrypt has been successfully installed. 
click when asked you wish view the tutorial user guide. 
click finish this point truecrypt now installed. 
now will set truecrypt that can begin using store sensitive information. 
click the windows logo start button the lower left corner your screen. 
click all programs. 
click the truecrypt applicationand now can begin. 
click the button create volume. 
ensuring that create encrypted file container selected click next. 
select hidden truecrypt volume and click next. 
ensuring that normal mode selected click next. 
click select file note which directory you are your computer. 
look the top the dialog that has opened and you will see the path you are most likely the home directory for your username. 
input box provided with flashing cursor asking you type file name. 
here you will type the following filename random. 
txt you may course replace random. 
txt with anything you like. 
this file going created and will used store many other files inside. 
not use filename for file that already exists. 
the idea here that you are creating entirely new file. 
also recommended though not required that you hide this file somewhere less obvious. 
your home directory then someone who has access your computer may find easier. 
you can also choose put this file any other media doesn have your hard disk. 
you could for example save your truecrypt file usb flash drive card some other media. 
once you have typed the file name click save. 
make sure never save history checked. 
the outer volume screen click next again. 
the default encryption algorithm and hash algorithm are fine. 
choose file size. 
order benefit the most from this guide you should have least gigabytes free disk space. 
not then worth for you purchase some form media such removable harddrive large card etc. 
truecrypt can used all forms digital media not just your hard disk. 
you choose proceed without obtaining least ten gigabytes disk space then select size that you are comfortable with such. 
ideally you want choose enough space work with. 
remember that you need more space later you can always create additional truecrypt volumes using exactly these same steps. 
now you are prompted for password. 
this very important. 
read this carefullyread this section carefullythe password you choose here decoy password. 
that means this the password you would give someone under duress. 
suppose that someone suspects that you were accessing sensitive information and they threaten beat you worse you not reveal the password. 
this the password that you give them. 
when you give someone this password will nearly impossible for them prove that not the right password. 
further they cannot even know that there second password. 
here are some tips for your password. 
choose password you will never forget. 
may ten years from now that you need. 
make simple like your birthday repeated three times. 
make sure seems reasonable that appears real password.

you not want someone guess your main password from this one. 
and with all this mind choose your password. 
when you have typed twice click next. 
large files here you are asked whether not you plan store files larger than gigabytes. 
choose and click next. 
outer volume format here you will notice some random numbers and letters next where says random pool. 
ahead and move your mouse around fora bit. 
this will increase the randomness and give you better encryption. 
after about ten seconds this click format. 
depending the file size you selected will take some time finish formatting. 
what happening truecrypt creating the file you asked such random. 
building file system contained entirely within that one file. 
this file system can used store files directories and more. 
further encrypting this file system such way that without the right password will impossible for anyone access. 
anyone other than you this file will appear just mess random characters. 
one will even know that truecrypt volume. 
outer volume contents click the button called open outer volume empty folder has opened. 
this empty because you have yet put any files into your truecrypt volume. 
not put any sensitive content herethis the decoy. 
this what someone would see you gave them the password you used the previous step. 
this not where you are going store your sensitive data. 
you have been forced into situation where you had reveal your password some individual then that individual will see whatever this folder. 
you need have data this folder that appears sensitive enough protected truecrypt order fool them. 
here are some important tips keep mind. 
not use porn. 
adult models can sometimes appear underaged and this can cause you incriminate yourself. 
not use drawings renderings writings porn. 
many jurisdictions these are just illegal photographs. 
good choices for what put here include backups documents emails financial documents etc. 
once you have placed files into this folder never place any more files the future. 
doing may damage your hidden content. 
generally you want store innocent data where some individual looking would find cause against you and yet the same time they would understand why you used truecrypt secure that data. 
now ahead and find files and store them this folder. 
sure that you leave least ten gigabytes free. 
the more the better. 
when you are all done copying files into this folder close the folder clicking the the top right corner. 
prompted that program needs your permission continue click continue.

aware that simply moving from your main hard disk not enough. 
will discuss how ensure deleted data actually deleted later the guide. 
what happening when you select file and mount drive you are telling your computer that you have new drive with files and folders. 
the same thing you had plugged usb flash drive removable harddrive card into your computer. 
truecrypt causes your computer think that there entirely new disk drive your computer. 
you can use this disk drive just was actually usb flash drive. 
you can copy files directories and use just you would use usb flash drive. 
when you are done simply close all open windows folders applications that are using your truecrypt drive letter and then click dismount from within truecrypt while you have the drive letter highlighted. 
this will once again hide all this data accessible only mounting with the correct password. 
very important safety true crypt hidden volume mounted someone who has access your computer can access anything that inside that hidden volume. 
for example you left your computer running while truecrypt volume was mounted then someone gained access your computer they would able see everything you have that volume. 
therefore always remember dismount any truecrypt volume containing any sensitive information when you are not using your computeryou can tell that dismounted because the drive letter inside truecrypt control panel will appear the same all the other drive letters with information the right the drive letter. 
you should practice mounting and dismounting few times with both passwords make sure you understand this process. 
once you have copied files folders into the hidden volume not touch the files folders the outer volume anymore. 
remember that both volumes occupy the same single file and therefore changing the outer volume can damage the hidden volume. 
once you have copied files folders into the outer volume during the installation process that the last time you should. 
from that point forward use only the hidden volume. 
the outer volume exists only decoy you need. 
very careful encrypting your laptop with truecrypt full disk encryption unless you want toaster. 
some laptops like have bios issues and can not use truecrypt fde. 
also you can always just replace the with linux distro that has built fde.

the pirate market now has multi sig thats right the pirate market now supports multi signiture transactions. 
how the multi sig works. 
the buyer makes order buyer can only have unaccepted multi sig orders one time. 
the vendor can choose cancel accept the order. 
accepted the vendor enters his receiving wallet and generated pubkey from. 
multisig dont forget keep the private key. 
buyer sends the payment given wallet. 
enter transaction after payment has more confirmations. 
the user can finalize open dispute. 
the buyer finalizes the order the bitcoins will sent the vendor. 
how the dispute system works. 
either the buyer vendor unhappy with the transaction they are able open dispute. 
admin then able help resolve the dispute they able come conclusion themselves through the chat the multisig pagewe also added convenient chat box the vendor buyer and admin can resolve the dispute easier. 
vesalso because the recent update are willing upgrade any trusted vendor who has proof products sell our market. 
you are interested this offer contact mrwhite myself captain flint tpm forums.

the purpose just ensure you get paid because paying address works like every wallet now its harder pay address than any other. 
payment was the only reason let suggest alternative. 
when checkout complete you are given few outputs including the and some other tumbler addresses each with the number satoshi required redeemed the outputs that exceeds the amount the purchase fee. 
order complete payment you need provide signed with sighash all sighash anyonecanpay that funds the address the proscibed vigorish. 
the server than merges this with internally created tumbler and broadcasts the network. 
this way you can sure get your funds because they are part the payment and the buyer can sure that their funds the very worst would unspent. 
the buyer knows that the site cannot misspent the funds beacuse the way they released them made them conditional the correct amount going the address. 
this would allow control escrow funds never the sites hands ensure the site gets paid for all transactions and allows for tumbling mechanism the same time.

that case you dont get certificate error because the connection simply downgraded http and you must observant that the url bar.

from checking may pmyoure sounding bit too defensive for your own good and the fact that youre attempting downplay genuine operational concern worrisome. 
besides straight lets just agree disagree that your half assed attempt implementing multisig does not translate any sort multisig transaction books. 
not when you expect make payment market wallet when instead should paying directly generated multisig address. 
stated earlier that still leaves ample scope for loss coins due market hack scamming admins. 
imho really find this mountain out mole hill situation. 
personally find worrisome that you are freaking out over something minute coin being the market for min order for multi sig much more user friendly. 
give break friend the majority people are more then happy with this setup. 
personally dont see any hacking ripping off the future and you really have issue with this setup then you are more then welcome not use. 
everyone titled their opinion and respect that. 
what not respect are pretentious douche bags flaming thread because they dont are unwilling understand our reason for structuring our multi sig this manner. 
unless you have something constructive and professional say then please leave you are doing one any favors attacking martkets escrow method because you not agree with. 
thank you kindly. 
from inthefuture may pmquote from checking may pmquote from boogie may amhonestly this really making mountain out mole hill situation. 
need get overwhelmed fellas youre sounding bit too defensive for your own good and the fact that youre attempting downplay genuine operational concern worrisome. 
besides straight lets just agree disagree that your half assed attempt implementing multisig does not translate any sort multisig transaction books. 
not when you expect make payment market wallet when instead should paying directly generated multisig address. 
stated earlier that still leaves ample scope for loss coins due market hack scamming admins. 
and youre being too offensive. 
you have made some incredible accusations this forum before but this does nothing except spread fud. 
multi sig implementation perfect not even tmps all multi sig protection lost when rogue market decides lock out all the vendors and begins accepting new multi sig orders using their accounts. 
there not ample scope for loss coins with evolutions setup you are exaggerating but there scope. 
the duration between moving the coins the evolution wallet and then the multi sig provides short opportunity for them stolen hacked but this contrasts with traditional escrow where the coins are vulnerable for the entire duration the payment shipping and delivery. 
you are complaining about their implementation but you would probably never have made purchase through their website anyway. 
having implementation that user friendly important otherwise the multi sig function quite simply wont even used. 
that all being said the coins should ideally not moved through centralized wallets. 
thank you for your kind words the future that very sweet you state that. 
people are just here nothing more but cause trouble and really appreciate what you have say. 
here fellas would like what our admin had say regarding the multi sig. 
honestly this really making mountain out mole hill situation. 
need get overwhelmed fellas from kimblehi name kimble and one the owners evolution. 
like take the time address few your concerns. 
lets start with the fact that yes you indeed have deposit funds into our site wallet before you can place multi sig order. 
opted for this solution reduces the complexity for buyers less prone mistakes and fair enough also guarantees that commission fees can collected. 
you might think half assed but the truth that think that this solution offers very much all the protection multisig without making needlessly complicated. 
sure youll agree that doing can actually persuade more people adopt instead scaring them off with page long tutorials how use. 
upon placing the order transfer funds from our site wallet multisig address that generated using your the vendors and evo public key. 
you can verify these keys the order details page. 
you will shown all the keys used generate the address you can verify the authenticity the multisig address and also provide you with the bitcoind command make easy. 
suppose there valid concern for having send funds our site wallet first but deposits are usually processed within minutes this riskiness reduced relatively small time frame. 
and regarding the redeemscript. 
from kimblethe redeemscript can found the order details page. 
really hope this answers anyones concerns and questions. 
other marketplaces exist with the same set just wish make user friendly possible while still containing the same features multi sig. 
plus still want keep traditional escrow board everyone may choose their own preference. 
really hope this clears the air for everyone take care boogie.

dark wallet basically bitcoin wallet with built features like coin mixing and other attributes that help with anonimity. 
seems like lot big name programmers that follow the blond wig ideology are working this wallet and also what believe marketplace called the dark market. 
its cool how much progress has been made with this tech. 
and yes the concept the knight faith big interest especially that requires total willingness accept the divine absurd despite reality. 
think that this mindset similar schizophrenia psychosis way. 
still have lot more learn and glad someone caught the reference.

from dankbank may pmgood guide you. 
ive always heard about tails but never knew really what was until now. 
ill doing this very soon thanksget tails now seriously. 
its more secure and wraps almost everything you need for darknet activities neat lil. 
here fellas would like what our admin had say regarding the multi sig. 
honestly this really making mountain out mole hill situation. 
need get overwhelmed fellas from kimblehi name kimble and one the owners evolution. 
like take the time address few your concerns. 
lets start with the fact that yes you indeed have deposit funds into our site wallet before you can place multi sig order. 
opted for this solution reduces the complexity for buyers less prone mistakes and fair enough also guarantees that commission fees can collected. 
you might think half assed but the truth that think that this solution offers very much all the protection multisig without making needlessly complicated. 
sure youll agree that doing can actually persuade more people adopt instead scaring them off with page long tutorials how use. 
upon placing the order transfer funds from our site wallet multisig address that generated using your the vendors and evo public key. 
you can verify these keys the order details page. 
you will shown all the keys used generate the address you can verify the authenticity the multisig address and also provide you with the bitcoind command make easy. 
suppose there valid concern for having send funds our site wallet first but deposits are usually processed within minutes this riskiness reduced relatively small time frame. 
and regarding the redeemscript. 
from kimblethe redeemscript can found the order details page. 
really hope this answers anyones concerns and questions. 
other marketplaces exist with the same set just wish make user friendly possible while still containing the same features multi sig. 
plus still want keep traditional escrow board everyone may choose their own preference. 
really hope this clears the air for everyone take care boogie. 
from inthefuture may pmquote from checking may pmquote from boogie may amhonestly this really making mountain out mole hill situation. 
need get overwhelmed fellas youre sounding bit too defensive for your own good and the fact that youre attempting downplay genuine operational concern worrisome. 
besides straight lets just agree disagree that your half assed attempt implementing multisig does not translate any sort multisig transaction books. 
not when you expect make payment market wallet when instead should paying directly generated multisig address. 
stated earlier that still leaves ample scope for loss coins due market hack scamming admins. 
and youre being too offensive. 
you have made some incredible accusations this forum before but this does nothing except spread fud. 
multi sig implementation perfect not even tmps all multi sig protection lost when rogue market decides lock out all the vendors and begins accepting new multi sig orders using their accounts. 
there not ample scope for loss coins with evolutions setup you are exaggerating but there scope. 
the duration between moving the coins the evolution wallet and then the multi sig provides short opportunity for them stolen hacked but this contrasts with traditional escrow where the coins are vulnerable for the entire duration the payment shipping and delivery. 
you are complaining about their implementation but you would probably never have made purchase through their website anyway. 
having implementation that user friendly important otherwise the multi sig function quite simply wont even used. 
that all being said the coins should ideally not moved through centralized wallets. 
thank you for your kind words the future that very sweet you state that. 
people are just here nothing more but cause trouble and really appreciate what you have say.

personally find worrisome that you are freaking out over something minute coin being the market for min order for multi sig much more user friendly.

dark wallet basically bitcoin wallet with built features like coin mixing and other attributes that help with anonimity. 
seems like lot big name programmers that follow the bitcoin ideology are working this wallet and also what believe marketplace called the dark market. 
it's cool how much progress has been made with this tech.

would great get all these tutorials one thread with index the. 
many the security tutorials from srf were reposted the early days srf and can found going the last page the security forum and browsing backwards. 
guru had his own index pgp tutorials unfortunately deleted all his posts along with over half the tutorials his index. 
pine had few good tutorials too like how install linux and disable the networking open pdfs but think that made much easier tails and whonix today. 
someone has good archive srf that can grepped user name topic title look through posts guru nightcrawler loiuscyphre pine bazille comsec astor and kmfkewm. 
word thats quite collection you have there axa great shit thanks man. 
here are some examples what mean. 
some them are threads their own right and would make one consolidated security tutorial thread too long but theyve been lost the dust bin srf. 
should repost them here and use sticky index them. 
jeks reposted many the old security tutorials. 
look through his post history. 
php action profile area showposts opsec collection tutorial research info pgp tails whonix data more. 
unfortunately many those links are deleted now but some that survive includethe opsec reading list. 
lets talk about security. 
secure data erasure professional analysis. 
forensic analysis tor use. 
bazille tutorial encrypted and torified linux virtual machine windows usb. 
howto install electrum bitcoin wallet tails liveusb. 
astor gpg usb tutorial.

nightcrawler word warning all versions pgp are not created equally. 
nightcrawler two factor authentication tfa right. 
jolly rogers tutorials for beginners. 
unfortunately nightcrawler deleted his account like guru did ncs posts are hard find and like said most gurus over half dozen great pgp tutorials are gone unless someone archived the forum before left. 
some people have backups srf. 
with enough digging could resurrect dozens the good tutorials from that forum that didnt get reposted srf.

this way you can sure get your funds because they are part the payment and the buyer can sure that their funds the very worst would unspent.

the pirate market now has multi sig thats right the pirate market now supports multi signiture transactions. 
how the multi sig works. 
the buyer makes order buyer can only have unaccepted multi sig orders one time. 
the vendor can choose cancel accept the order. 
accepted the vendor enters his receiving wallet and generated pubkey from. 
multisig dont forget keep the private key. 
buyer sends the payment given wallet. 
enter transaction after payment has more confirmations. 
the user can finalize open dispute. 
the buyer finalizes the order the bitcoins will sent the vendor. 
how the dispute system works. 
either the buyer vendor unhappy with the transaction they are able open dispute. 
admin then able help resolve the dispute they able come conclusion themselves through the chat the multisig pagewe also added convenient chat box the vendor buyer and admin can resolve the dispute easier. 
vesalso because the recent update are willing upgrade any trusted vendor who has proof products sell our market.

need get overwhelmed fellas youre sounding bit too defensive for your own good and the fact that youre attempting downplay genuine operational concern worrisome. 
besides straight lets just agree disagree that your half assed attempt implementing multisig does not translate any sort multisig transaction books. 
not when you expect make payment market wallet when instead should paying directly generated multisig address. 
stated earlier that still leaves ample scope for loss coins due market hack scamming admins. 
the pirate market now has multi sig thats right the pirate market now supports multi signiture transactions. 
how the multi sig works. 
the buyer makes order buyer can only have unaccepted multi sig orders one time. 
the vendor can choose cancel accept the order. 
accepted the vendor enters his receiving wallet and generated pubkey from. 
multisig dont forget keep the private key. 
buyer sends the payment given wallet. 
enter transaction after payment has more confirmations. 
the user can finalize open dispute. 
the buyer finalizes the order the bitcoins will sent the vendor. 
how the dispute system works. 
either the buyer vendor unhappy with the transaction they are able open dispute. 
admin then able help resolve the dispute they able come conclusion themselves through the chat the multisig pagewe also added convenient chat box the vendor buyer and admin can resolve the dispute easier. 
vesalso because the recent update are willing upgrade any trusted vendor who has proof products sell our market. 
you are interested this offer contact mrwhite myself captain flint tpm forums. 
note will still keeping escrow and the market new darknet users may find this fairly complicated.

from zhar april pmon allowing for multisig escrow its tricky concept. 
any wallet will allow you pay multisig address. 
the problem comes when you have provide your signature allow the spending from the address. 
most wallets today not give easy interface for users that. 
for example can done bitcoind but the command line and for non expert would difficult. 
other wallets have bits and pieces the necessary functionality but not nice bundled way. 
there are python libraries that make breeze for developers but that doesnt help much youre not developer. 
some services are offering web based escrow and web wallets. 
using multisig but they are just using multisig internally their architecture give some defence against thefit which not quite what you need when interacting with dark net market. 
the marketplace itself would have provide you with least some hand holding providing you with the payout transaction sign and then giving you detailed instructions how sign and send back them constituting your agreement the payout. 
thats the problem wallets should doing that part for you. 
you should able click button sign authorize this transaction. 
but the standard ones dont yet. 
darkwallet for example development and apparently offering this feature. 
take what say with caution though ive only been somewhat involved bitcoin related development recently and dont actually know exactly what the various darknet markets are doing. 
thats the main reason here actually find out. 
edit further reading found this addresses are addresses controlled more than one person. 
they are created with set requirements that dictate how the funds the address can moved. 
signature addresses are jointly controlled people say the site operator the buyer and the seller but funds can only moved two people authorize and sign transaction.

virtual machine vpn tor are two basic setups that will protect you from most attacks deanonymize yourself. 
plus they dont sacrifice lot speed. 
have disagree with this advice. 
using vpn before connecting anonymous network like tor isnt going help much going hurt. 
think about the reasons that you would want have this setup you want obfuscate your usage the anonymous network from your isp your locality makes difficult access anonymous networksthese two situations are exactly what bridges obfsproxy are for. 
connecting vpn first just leaves trail. 
even you paid anonymously with bitcoins well hope you tumbled your coins separately from your hot wallet for day day use that would immediately start linking you your hidden activities. 
anonymous vpn after tor does make sense you are visiting clearnet sites frequently. 
many them block tor outproxies. 
inexpensive vpn vps can make your life lot easier when visiting these kinds sites. 
timing based your best bet constantly connected your anonymous network and passing traffic order make not possible know you are actually doing something your computer doing something. 
this can accomplished number ways each with different risks and benefits.
