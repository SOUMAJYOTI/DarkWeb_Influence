you arent going get around the fact that the headers give tons info even you pgp all the things. 
bote the superior solutionyour address simply public key. 
the emails are stored dht over all the nodes. 
the only thing that really not able hidden how many times you check your email and how many emails that you get. 
but since hides damn neary everything else its much better system. 
does really matter find this guy not feel like this pointless search lol. 
use terminal mount the iso the drive. 
heres the proccess use. 
howto burn iso usb drive your macinsert your thumbdrive. 
you should see pop your desktop all nice and mounted ready for you use. 
you can see your desktop you can use the way need. 
diskutil listyou should see something like this dev disk type name size identifier guid partition scheme. 
disk apple corestorage. 
disk apple boot recovery. 
disk dev disk type name size identifier apple hfs macintosh. 
disk dev disk type name size identifier guid partition scheme. 
disk apple hfs passport. 
disk dev disk type name size identifier fdisk partition scheme. 
disk dos fat untitled. 
disk the instance above noted thumbdrive dev disk. 
happened untitled but could whatever name you may have given. 
anyhow essentially need unmount everything that disk but not remove completely from the system. 
diskutil unmountdisk dev disk unmount all volumes disk was successfulthat solves that. 
now where that iso image you have you need know where you can copy that thumbdrive. 
the way this thumbdrive that either backed other ways not useful like old and small whatever. 
you note the one using. 
lol got with cisco router that bought. 
came with management software that sucks. 
that thumbdrive when all over will have nothing but the iso you burning. 
the destructive part sudo desktop crunchbang. 
iso dev rdisk records records out bytes transferred. 
secs bytes sec should note you won see any activity more that second. 
you hit return and the computer goes work not telling working not. 
one those classic commands ain fancy pretty all high falutin. 
does one thing and does exactly what you told errors. 
should also note you screw point that something important like disk list above disk well you have the joy reinstalling the your mac most likely. 
breakdown sudo most you know what this. 
allows you things the superuser your mac. 
command convert and copy file don know why named that. 
input file output file block size you can use you get the idea. 
like there not much speed gained anything bigger. 
some you are looking that output file location and thinking where the heck did get rdisk from well the same location disk only raw device connection. 
stepping outside the rules little bit taking little known shortcut that doesn have any stoplights you will. 
you essentially move the same data about the time you dev rdisk the last thing that you should eject but how you that since you can drag the trash diskutil still has you covered. 
diskutil eject disk disk disk ejectedif you really need see something you need have install pipe viewer. 
unless you already have some system like macports homebrew have working and know how use just suck and deal with not seeing something. 
anyhow maybe you dork like and you have pipe viewer. 
instead the command used initially going modify. 
petr desktop crunchbang. 
iso sudo dev rdisk. 
mib eta there you. 
nice little visual guide for elapsed time how fast and estimate for how long going take. 
you want know more about pipe viewer there great article here. 
this turned out longer than expected. 
anyhow hope helps one you out there. 
you need answered what mac you have older macbookpro. 
can someone post some the basics php already alot css html and bit java. 
php seems the way the darknet and would love learn. 
there isnt any next posts. 
think its better place the item somewhere before you tell the person the general location. 
they will watch what everyone does the area and will likely see you. 
place somewhere with gps coordinates and general description like the gray trash barrel the lamp post under the big bush under some leaves with soda can top better still just buy the stamps somewhere and bring your package the post office. 
they may have cam but will not able connect you the exact package unless you have stand line and give the person. 
quotei think its better place the item somewhere before you tell the person the general location.

place somewhere with gps coordinates and general description like the gray trash barrel the lamp post under the big bush under some leaves with soda can top think that will imposible because the customer tell the general location for example the neighborhood lives near something like that. 
that could weak point ill keep your advice mind. 
maybe the solution more general location more surface the leas cant made exagerate ring the worst case yep that paranoid jaja. 
the gps coordinate its great idea there any way that could identified have gps navigator that kind signals. 
quotebetter still just buy the stamps somewhere and bring your package the post office. 
they may have cam but will not able connect you the exact package unless you have stand line and give the person. 
well they have different videos the places where the letters boxes were send from think that will very obvious strange that will risk. 
maybe theres way for distortionate the cam something like that any idea about this thanks for your helpful advice and answer organix quoteits called deaddrop and its been done since forever the buyer has trust that you arent leo but you build rep and use pgp case they are watching your email account then all will well just msg them the loc and they can pick themselveswow deaddrop didnt know that thanks for that thats exactly the idea make very good reputation ill the first here making that kind bussiness tor onion pgp you know what mean that can risk but advantage too have very secure and well. 
thanks for your answer any experience about this kind deliverys any other options sorry too intense about this but think that this maybe could help another people countrys like mine thanks. 
from organix march pmif you have the persons neighborhood that may problem. 
you hide something public many people might see you and dig after you leave has someplace where people will not see you leave and that can difficult. 
you use gps locate the coordinates the spot after you leave and then shut off the gps. 
they cant trace you that way sure. 
dont you have several post offices your area you could different one each time and rotate them. 
must easier that way than drive miles someone elses neighborhood. 
perhaps you can the drop for customers near and mail those farther away for the first thing planning lot hide places that can leave there without suspect have good ideas but comment here for security. 
thanks for gps advice here are less than offices public postal enterprise but lot more private couriers that require sign and more information maybe could dangerous but really dont know that its lot few offices. 
many that offices are malls ill caught more cams more risk for shipping all the country and maybe just maybe international continental postal mail its the better option and have think how send using any service public private without leaving any trace. 
any idea about this really have resolve this trouble because city can with deaddrops but planning expand the bussiness yes yes have use mail shipping. 
anyone have any idea ill appreciatte lot maybe another options remember the problem that here doesnt exist the postal boxes that blue ones usa for send letters boxes without register anywhere only using postage. 
postage can used here but have buy postal office and send the items postal offices without sign any paper but leaving cam traces and all stuff that comes with this risk. 
any idea about how send items here thanks guys. 
from trc march amif you are going that extreme why not just deliver well that will dangerous because the person who contact can. 
person interested caught that not good idea the thing that the customer never know who and never know where the drop until has gone from there. 
thanks for your answer anyway. 
quotei have delivered product via remote controller toy plane beforewow that may good idea some cases but its main city its big and that will rare. 
was thinking how camouflage visits the postal office maybe with sunglasses makeup something like that. 
like said have problems have personally the office for buy the postage and again for ship the package with postage dont have give real name something only leave the letters over there but maybe that can rare. 
the other option using private service like fedex but again have personally that its risk. 
anyone have other options than postal shipping that can commented here thanks for your attention.

can boot tails from macbook pro with problems except the retina display makes stuff super tiny. 
perhaps its your hardwares age probably. 
consider myself veteran troubleshooter cant solve issue figure cant possibly solved. 
everyone who has said tails works their apple product its macobook pro. 
unfortunately dont have one.

from gumby march pmonline tutorials can helpful but youre novice coding which cant tell based some css html and java experience theres substitute for good book. 
read lots online tutorials about python but only felt that really understood after reading learning python. 
pro tip you can find pirated copies most programming books online. 
yeah ill prolly after some those pirated books. 
not real programmer man the least man sorry made sound like was will program arduino chips put make lights flash and make basic calculators and shit. 
hope get the status were can assemble and program own rasp but right now wana learn php broaden horizons here the darknet html and css good though. 
java know what does and how costomize but never make from the ground. 
self taught student you can tell lingo and wat not. 
getting the same error.

couldnt further from. 
just want know wtf going and why the hell. 
btc and account disappeared into the ether. 
will delete update this post soon this issue resolved. 
just wanted know any vendors accept ultracoins here its supposed the fastest cryptocurency out right now. 
bought myself few coins and transferring between wallets and exchanges only takes the coins about seconds arrive wallet fully confirmed. 
thought that might good reason for vendors start accepting that. 
anyone does please let know. 
hope this will not the end for agora prolonged ddos are always bad omen.

from psychosis march ami still cant login all the moment whats the best quietest time login would have thought few hrs from now would good time any thoughts its fairly random. 
have had decent luck very early the usa time and the early evening. 
the best suggestion simply keep trying and eventually you will get lucky and slip past the attacks. 
just make sure your ready get whatever you need done immediately. 
sad who knows your going get successful page loads for full hour.

would think that switching the url around like bmr did might help. 
its still experiencing dos attack patience the key during situations like this. 
remember when experienced dos attack that took down the server for week. 
just sit tight and everything will alright. 
from checking march amquote from every march pmi just got done looking over the info. 
looks like wad fud. 
but call this. 
read through some your last few posts and you have done nothing besides posting agora praises every post you make despite all their obvious opsec failures that makes wonder how much they pay their shills. 
that said must add misinterpreted that was their that was hacked into whereas more likely scenario the dictionary attack and them brute forcing usernames more likely the case which gave them access vendor accounts from where theyve retrieved user addresses etc and details which were not encrypted. 
first and most important point failure why all was dictionary attack was allowed agora clearly didnt take their users accounts seriously with having missed something simple captcha which should have prevented this compromise the first place. 
their lack foresight shows their opsec coudnt any worse. 
also any user who does not use pgp dnm deserves nothing better. 
the past weeks their total online time has been down few hours collectively and for those who can eventually login and get past the captcha problem dont get anything useful done and get timed out site unavailable past that. 
their lack support and now reports them deleting such posts the forum says all. 
maybe you might want chime with what your shill duties are like more interested that now. 
mistake you just made was insult integrity. 
good job quoting out context and taking support for thriving market mean must their pocket. 
just let you know its proper english insert ellipsis when you decide omit part the original text. 
now the real topic. 
you claim agoras pocket. 
you could not further from the truth. 
you point out their opsec failures and its true they are not perfect. 
however these failings not matter anyone with care for their own opsec would not have trifle with such insignificant failings. 
care about own integrity more than care about life.

yes and pandora both generate more traffic right now but both those markets have lost peoples money failed address major down times and have more than questionable standing the darknet. 
sure have been posting lot about agora lately but the reason for that simply there more going the agora forum than other places this forum and furthermore how the hell you manage interpret patient and keep trying connectivity spotty right now keep trying and get what you need done asap infallibly supporting any market entirely possible that agora about run off with all our money sure. 
also possible they waited for the escrow wallet hit some predetermined value before cutting and running hell yes. 
nonetheless given that time and again they have returned and the fact that withdraws are still being processed live when you can get access highly doubt. 
now you still think some fucking shill the pocket any market ask you politely shut your fucking mouth and learn your role. 
any evidence provided authorities third party hearsay. 
also known meaningless. 
from checking march amso much you might want twist the topic and sidetrack blaming the users themselves which only part the larger issue hand while overlooking agoras lacklustre opsec claiming them not scamming which again not the point the topic but instead their existing opsec. 
yes youve still got long way convince that youre not shill and good luck trying. 
your right did get bit off topic. 
way consider agoras security without flaws. 
not going perpetuate this argument because its pointless. 
original statement was simple. 
the details posted are copy pasted generated some script. 
any vendor had their password compromised then their opsec even worse than any failing the market. 
vendors especially need use ultra secure passwords our login names are visible our profile pages all attacker needs figure out our passwords. 
were responsible for maintaining not only our safety but that our clients well and that note its really irrelevant what security features the market has. 
are the ones taking the big risk loosing coins due market hack. 
that same time users responsibility encrypt their sensitive info. 
proper personal security taken both the vendors and the buyers the market generally unnecessary. 
always stay safe out there. 
they have deleted the threads because people would post multiple nonsense threads all caps about server downtime when agora has already addressed the issue stickied forum post. 
has nothing with censorship. 
what you think about this crypto they claims the hidden services cryptocurrency. 
copy paste from his web quoteabout the coinanoncoin mainly targeting used through the invisible internet and tor. 
introducing another layer security within the cryptocurrency markets providing new coin features and services build top these. 
lets get with the facts. 
the coin cannot stopped central banks governments. 
this achieved combining the use clearnet invisible web and services. 
the coin being used tor there way identify who operating the nodes and clients. 
this will turn enable the production new better anonymous services. 
what the coins are being traced the blockchain coin mixer services operating through are development put stop coins being traced back any one wallet person. 
these will make possible mix coins you have received mined sending them the mixer service. 
coins sent there will mixed with all other coins within the service before being sent any address your choosing. 
what are the basic features anoncoin there can. 
million coins existence. 
blocks are worth. 
are worth anc. 
the blocks from. 
are worth anc then subsidy halves blocks every years. 
along with the exclusive features this should provide long and healthy lifespan. 
crypto services and users. 
anoncoin will keep gaining its strength the services offered and the numbers users utilizing these services. 
the coin growing stronger every day and this gives excellent chance further expand the invisible web services. 
all the users and anons already supporting the coin thank you clearnet alarm here are the bitcointalk official post. 
what you know think about this crypto any technical any type advice issue something good vibes. 
could that the support were disorganized and made mistake have heard only good things about bsm. 
hope you get refunded. 
problem has been party resolved and seems like will solved shortly.

how can you tell transaction campbx isnt confirmed you just sent through bitcoinfog the whole point that service sever the connection and make your funds untraceable. 
bitcoinfog has been known take week longer than expected would contact them and double check the address used before wiped out. 
could wrong but dont think any vendors are willing subject their funds the wild fluctuations tiny cryptocurreny order get their dough minutes earlier. 
not aware any marketplaces that operate ultracoins.

com silkroadtwohub forum url. 
notes warning not recommended allsite was hacked all bitcoins stolen was just scam still not sure. 
what are you doin anyway you deserve lose customers. 
theyd the conference wouldnt they. 
honestly this sounds just like any other crap coin. 
the list benefits are impressive but mostly just relates things you could with any crypto. 
what waiting for coin that causes actually untraceable transactions. 
had theory about that while back designing crypto that you never send coins anyone but rather relay nodes that pass along requests and the coins are literally moved randomly diced segments from other peoples wallets. 
since the increments are standard its impossible tell which slices belong which transactions but got far much else plate actually try and pull that off. 
just asking out curiosity. 
there are number new markets out there but dont see lot vendors going them. 
assume that buyers will where the vendors. 
really just because things like utopia sheep more that vendor gets busy being agora and pandora that they dont want the extra load have deal with have never vended dont know how busy they can get but sure they put their hours. 
personally probably wouldnt use new market until its been around few months but with some these new markets having free accounts and multi sig seems much the risk new market has been averted. 
again only ask out curiosity really. 
have vendor that use and happy enough. 
great ill add the list.

have never seen anything different. 
your actual localhost address though. 
the one you type edit your network settings. 
everyone thanks lot for your answer gave lot answers and very good ideas you are right maybe thinking too much paranoid ill keep that mind. 
could give you karma man jajaja you give lot info and good ideas thanks man with all your answers got really good ideas and resolve problem. 
thank you much for everyone love this community. 
think you are over thinking this. 
walk into post offices purchase stamps postage all the time. 
normal non darknet routine involves going into multiple postal locations frequently. 
does not look that unusual for someone visit the post regular basis and purchase dozens stamps one time and nothing else. 
when you drop off your packages just act calm and normal man. 
walk with all your packages box cloth bag prevent you having touch them while also avoiding looking odd for wearing gloves the summer time. 
for your drop you dont make eye contact with the cameras and wear hat make harder you. 
you just walk dump your bag into the bin casually pour them onto the counter for the employee handle from then. 
then just walk out. 
change which post offices you ship out and rotate your shipping days. 
pick days per week that you will ship orders. 
all your prep early the day when you can take your time and very clean about packaging. 
make run one the post offices you use. 
after few months change your days. 
you were shipping say mon wed fri change like tues fri sat something like that. 
change your appearance its hard identify you are the same person each time you make drop. 
changing your hat general attire slightly helps this. 
get few outfits that are several sizes too large use for this. 
the loose clothing will further obscure your physical description. 
never looks odd for someone shipping packages from post office. 
people acting sketchy post office attracts attention. 
just figure out method that you are comfortable with and practice. 
hell send thank you cards invitaitons long lost friends random people for couple runs until you get comfortable with your surroundings. 
you may even consider continuing this process after you begin shipping your product again further obscures your intentions and provides nice legit reason for you the frequently. 
the best out there understand that the most effective disguise hide plain sight. 
domestic stealth not the most advanced have experienced but the same time you would never guess package what without knowing advance. 
looks just like any other random piece mail. 
never use the same exact style stealth for two drop runs row. 
have about different materials use make packages. 
those materials can create around unique styles stealth package. 
all them are very plain jane looking the outside and flat plus the materials use are fairly inexpensive. 
this same policy applies shipping your merchandise. 
the best way hide look like your not doing anything wrong. 
walk looking pleasant but slight hurry. 
its important not look nervous. 
make idle comments random people the lobby you have wait line. 
keep your conversation mundane and unrevealing. 
safe out there.

bitcoinfog has been known take week longer than expected would contact them and double check the address used before wiped out. 
and that definitely not address. 
dont use addressing. 
thought because the way tor works that their hidden service would listen. 
and redirect port localhost where the web server listening. 
their hidden service torrc using. 
then that what everyones will say. 
shouldnt have anything with personal localhost address the whole point tor and hidden services keep that anonymous.

anyways best luck man. 
from fuck her march pmheres where need feedback thinking about asking for electrum mpk receive fees. 
what you think about this the admins key should also generated from electrum mpk. 
there reason the key needs stored the site. 
has anyone ever looked multisignature transactions electrum where the wallet only has one key think there way display transactions fit for electrum sign but documentation the code scarce. 
right now weve seen bitcoin and bitcoind are fine for multisignature transactions. 
but feel electrum would way better. 
anyone has any information how electrum works with multisig please send them way. 
how sites that implement true multisignature escrow how does this sound does the process sound like something end users would easily trained think becomes pretty you can see using multisig. 
there are only actions the users need. 
one less step when automate key generation. 
thats the price they pay for absolute security for their bitcoin. 
more heists all transactions occur the blockchain and are only considered valid when the blockchain. 
means more live wallet the possibility for the negative balance hack removed and the trust the site becomes minimal. 
the site run attacker they simply cant run off with the money. 
even there unexpected downtime the admin goes awol buyer and vendor have their public keys can try negotiate another channel least sort out their funds themselves. 
feedback this critical bitwasps success please fire away. 
any input appreachiated. 
will tip very good replies with some bitcoins. 
till although doubt you are going give penny. 
electrum relies using their servers. 
please keep this mind when using electrum because electrum more centralized idea than bitcoin and bitcoind which connects the other nodes. 
the electrum servers down you get screwed. 
also electrum not well supported for multisig right now. 
they use either bitcoin bitcoind just like bitwasp. 
sounds like you are wanting set marketplace using bitwasp but using electrum might bad idea your market relies electrum because their servers down does your market. 
its suprise see you this venue first some thoughts the implementation. 
whether the payment finalize early escrow then the site will poll the blockchain for payments that address. 
once the full amount paid then the order marked paid and all users messaged link page that shows the generated transaction paying the vendor the full amount minus the sites fee raw transaction spending all the transactions sent the multisg address and sending the vendor one output and the sites fees address another. 
everyone will shown the transaction paying the vendor. 
the buyer raises dispute then the users will start discuss the order and the admin will generate new transaction paying the appropriate amount both parties. 
but its all successful then one the users will sign the transaction and paste the partially signed transaction the site. 
then the other user will sign the transaction broadcast where will identified bitwasp when makes into the blockchain. 
not sure like showing the raw unsigned before deciding where the btc going. 
this information leak. 
the very least the address the vendor uses will have burnt and sloppy vendor reusing addresses using the same address get funds from every going expose lot and this very little risk the person doing the attack. 
all they would have cancel the order before the vendor fufills and they would lose trivial amount transaction fees. 
think its better wait until its been decided where the funds before generating the raw signed. 
also buyers tend awful signing payments. 
think from buyer view they dont need ever see unless they need get refund some sort. 
also cautious person might always want their broadcast some predetermined time say utc something order allow time information leaks. 
because this think its better for the site sign the and then have the other party the final signing and broadcast themselves. 
your specific questionsquote thinking about asking for electrum mpk receive fees. 
what you think about this think itd better accept extended public key bip style give the user option input advance give them arbitrary number addresses chosen from randomly. 
electrum moving away from their current key implemantion even the distributed source has code for true bip wallets altho not sure its actually ever used. 
the admins key should also generated from electrum mpk. 
there reason the key needs stored the site. 
has anyone ever looked multisignature transactions electrum where the wallet only has one key think there way display transactions fit for electrum sign but documentation the code scarce. 
think the admin keys should probably random. 
there are two reasons for this. 
one that think the site should have the private keys available because think the normal signatures should site whoever getting the btc. 
buyer vendor should for unusual situations. 
this means that youd have store the extended master private key which huge security problem should that compromised. 
the second that even you only store some version extended public key that compromised youd readily able tract transactions the blockchain looking for that redeem style address with one the public keys the reedemscript. 
right now weve seen bitcoin and bitcoind are fine for multisignature transactions. 
but feel electrum would way better. 
anyone has any information how electrum works with multisig please send them way. 
stands electrums multi sig horribly broken. 
the only way its gonna work until the new version you take tmps plugin and use that. 
code all pubilc domain and vitalik buterins code from pybtctools that ive used some format conversions. 
not sure how tmpschultz feels about his code being used however. 
wrote all the actual widget code that deals with the and came with the concept using deposit addresses store the keys. 
additionally electrum stores its transactions internally wierdo format. 
its not really going useful stands for tracking things the how sites that implement true multisignature escrow not sure the internals but tmp requires vendors predetermine large numbers public keys used during the order process and then also predetermine number addresses payments this could low address however. 
electrum moving towards real bip support. 
dont see the point implementing right now something that uses their wonky key derivation. 
the tmp plugin will cant find the key your deposit list just ask for the correct private key. 
think solution like that except with real bip the best.

you buy them online exchange linked your identity and vendor gets busted will most likely able track the coins back you. 
whats the best option mix coins bitcoinfog seems having allot problems lately slow deposits coins not showing etc.

from fuck her march pmheres where need feedback thinking about asking for electrum mpk receive fees. 
what you think about this the admins key should also generated from electrum mpk. 
there reason the key needs stored the site. 
has anyone ever looked multisignature transactions electrum where the wallet only has one key think there way display transactions fit for electrum sign but documentation the code scarce. 
right now weve seen bitcoin and bitcoind are fine for multisignature transactions. 
but feel electrum would way better. 
anyone has any information how electrum works with multisig please send them way. 
how sites that implement true multisignature escrow how does this sound does the process sound like something end users would easily trained think becomes pretty you can see using multisig. 
there are only actions the users need. 
one less step when automate key generation. 
thats the price they pay for absolute security for their bitcoin. 
more heists all transactions occur the blockchain and are only considered valid when the blockchain. 
means more live wallet the possibility for the negative balance hack removed and the trust the site becomes minimal. 
the site run attacker they simply cant run off with the money. 
even there unexpected downtime the admin goes awol buyer and vendor have their public keys can try negotiate another channel least sort out their funds themselves. 
feedback this critical bitwasps success please fire away. 
any input appreachiated. 
will tip very good replies with some bitcoins. 
till although doubt you are going give penny. 
electrum relies using their servers. 
please keep this mind when using electrum because electrum more centralized idea than bitcoin and bitcoind which connects the other nodes. 
the electrum servers down you get screwed. 
also electrum not well supported for multisig right now. 
they use either bitcoin bitcoind just like bitwasp. 
sounds like you are wanting set marketplace using bitwasp but using electrum might bad idea your market relies electrum because their servers down does your market. 
its suprise see you this venue first some thoughts the implementation. 
whether the payment finalize early escrow then the site will poll the blockchain for payments that address. 
once the full amount paid then the order marked paid and all users messaged link page that shows the generated transaction paying the vendor the full amount minus the sites fee raw transaction spending all the transactions sent the multisg address and sending the vendor one output and the sites fees address another. 
everyone will shown the transaction paying the vendor. 
the buyer raises dispute then the users will start discuss the order and the admin will generate new transaction paying the appropriate amount both parties. 
but its all successful then one the users will sign the transaction and paste the partially signed transaction the site. 
then the other user will sign the transaction broadcast where will identified bitwasp when makes into the blockchain. 
not sure like showing the raw unsigned before deciding where the btc going. 
this information leak. 
the very least the address the vendor uses will have burnt and sloppy vendor reusing addresses using the same address get funds from every going expose lot and this very little risk the person doing the attack. 
all they would have cancel the order before the vendor fufills and they would lose trivial amount transaction fees. 
think its better wait until its been decided where the funds before generating the raw signed. 
also buyers tend awful signing payments. 
think from buyer view they dont need ever see unless they need get refund some sort. 
also cautious person might always want their broadcast some predetermined time say utc something order allow time information leaks. 
because this think its better for the site sign the and then have the other party the final signing and broadcast themselves. 
your specific questionsquote thinking about asking for electrum mpk receive fees. 
what you think about this think itd better accept extended public key bip style give the user option input advance give them arbitrary number addresses chosen from randomly. 
electrum moving away from their current key implemantion even the distributed source has code for true bip wallets altho not sure its actually ever used. 
the admins key should also generated from electrum mpk. 
there reason the key needs stored the site. 
has anyone ever looked multisignature transactions electrum where the wallet only has one key think there way display transactions fit for electrum sign but documentation the code scarce. 
think the admin keys should probably random. 
there are two reasons for this. 
one that think the site should have the private keys available because think the normal signatures should site whoever getting the btc. 
buyer vendor should for unusual situations. 
this means that youd have store the extended master private key which huge security problem should that compromised. 
the second that even you only store some version extended public key that compromised youd readily able tract transactions the blockchain looking for that redeem style address with one the public keys the reedemscript. 
right now weve seen bitcoin and bitcoind are fine for multisignature transactions. 
but feel electrum would way better.

well the funds are only untraceable you dont know the address. 
since know the address can just check the blockchain see that bitcoinfog yeah youre right some random agent who cares sent the coins that address confirmed hundreds times and the coins are still sitting right there but they have not been posted campbx account after week back and forth bullshit with their support guys. 
its actually pretty easy place the blame with the registered scammers. 
youtube and look some php tutorials. 
there are plenty good ones there. 
just keep mind that basic php very insecure and when you start building things like databases and things that interact with users you need validate sanitize everything. 
other words somebody types name jollyalert roger.

really hoping that this last but seems like agora actually running relatively well today. 
ive been banging head the desk trying get work done for few days now. 
just hope last. 
its suprise see you this venue first some thoughts the implementation. 
whether the payment finalize early escrow then the site will poll the blockchain for payments that address. 
once the full amount paid then the order marked paid and all users messaged link page that shows the generated transaction paying the vendor the full amount minus the sites fee raw transaction spending all the transactions sent the multisg address and sending the vendor one output and the sites fees address another. 
everyone will shown the transaction paying the vendor. 
the buyer raises dispute then the users will start discuss the order and the admin will generate new transaction paying the appropriate amount both parties. 
but its all successful then one the users will sign the transaction and paste the partially signed transaction the site. 
then the other user will sign the transaction broadcast where will identified bitwasp when makes into the blockchain. 
not sure like showing the raw unsigned before deciding where the btc going. 
this information leak. 
the very least the address the vendor uses will have burnt and sloppy vendor reusing addresses using the same address get funds from every going expose lot and this very little risk the person doing the attack. 
all they would have cancel the order before the vendor fufills and they would lose trivial amount transaction fees. 
think its better wait until its been decided where the funds before generating the raw signed. 
also buyers tend awful signing payments. 
think from buyer view they dont need ever see unless they need get refund some sort. 
also cautious person might always want their broadcast some predetermined time say utc something order allow time information leaks. 
because this think its better for the site sign the and then have the other party the final signing and broadcast themselves. 
your specific questionsquote thinking about asking for electrum mpk receive fees. 
what you think about this think itd better accept extended public key bip style give the user option input advance give them arbitrary number addresses chosen from randomly. 
electrum moving away from their current key implemantion even the distributed source has code for true bip wallets altho not sure its actually ever used. 
the admins key should also generated from electrum mpk. 
there reason the key needs stored the site. 
has anyone ever looked multisignature transactions electrum where the wallet only has one key think there way display transactions fit for electrum sign but documentation the code scarce. 
think the admin keys should probably random. 
there are two reasons for this. 
one that think the site should have the private keys available because think the normal signatures should site whoever getting the btc. 
buyer vendor should for unusual situations. 
this means that youd have store the extended master private key which huge security problem should that compromised. 
the second that even you only store some version extended public key that compromised youd readily able tract transactions the blockchain looking for that redeem style address with one the public keys the reedemscript. 
right now weve seen bitcoin and bitcoind are fine for multisignature transactions. 
but feel electrum would way better. 
anyone has any information how electrum works with multisig please send them way. 
stands electrums multi sig horribly broken. 
the only way its gonna work until the new version you take tmps plugin and use that. 
code all pubilc domain and vitalik buterins code from pybtctools that ive used some format conversions. 
not sure how tmpschultz feels about his code being used however. 
wrote all the actual widget code that deals with the and came with the concept using deposit addresses store the keys. 
additionally electrum stores its transactions internally wierdo format. 
its not really going useful stands for tracking things the how sites that implement true multisignature escrow not sure the internals but tmp requires vendors predetermine large numbers public keys used during the order process and then also predetermine number addresses payments this could low address however. 
electrum moving towards real bip support. 
dont see the point implementing right now something that uses their wonky key derivation. 
the tmp plugin will cant find the key your deposit list just ask for the correct private key. 
think solution like that except with real bip the best.

how sites that implement true multisignature escrow how does this sound does the process sound like something end users would easily trained think becomes pretty you can see using multisig. 
there are only actions the users need. 
one less step when automate key generation. 
thats the price they pay for absolute security for their bitcoin. 
more heists all transactions occur the blockchain and are only considered valid when the blockchain. 
means more live wallet the possibility for the negative balance hack removed and the trust the site becomes minimal. 
the site run attacker they simply cant run off with the money. 
even there unexpected downtime the admin goes awol buyer and vendor have their public keys can try negotiate another channel least sort out their funds themselves. 
feedback this critical bitwasps success please fire away. 
any input appreachiated. 
will tip very good replies with some bitcoins. 
till although doubt you are going give penny. 
electrum relies using their servers. 
please keep this mind when using electrum because electrum more centralized idea than bitcoin and bitcoind which connects the other nodes. 
the electrum servers down you get screwed. 
also electrum not well supported for multisig right now. 
they use either bitcoin bitcoind just like bitwasp. 
sounds like you are wanting set marketplace using bitwasp but using electrum might bad idea your market relies electrum because their servers down does your market.

here the review thread for bitcoin blender the bitcoin forum. 
compare the review thread for bitcoin fog. 
which service you trust not steal your bitcoin. 
yeah you would have trust the same way you trust the markets not rob your money. 
these people also have real way extort you anyhow. 
what are they gonna say give one meelion dollars ill tell the popo you mailed something that was probably illegalthey have idea what the fuck youre mailing. 
and you could not arrested for buying stamps. 
the only real way this service could harm you other than them being from packages being seized. 
would quite stretch plan extortion based that and they dont keep logs which they arent and arent extorting they have reason then have pretty much nothing they were ever bust these guys for selling stamps. 
the risk low. 
its legit its great idea. 
people who know how secure have idea how not secure the majority. 
people dont even encrypt their addresses when buying guns know this for fact. 
there service that can help the noobs its awesome. 
noobs need this sort thing. 
and myself hate the idea going the post office with box full drugs hand and talking the post office people.

thanksdonation address signature. 
since have not seen the best answer posted above will give. 
the absolute best way use those unsafe plugins like javascript java and flash follows. 
you must use separate machines. 
the first machine has other way connecting the internet other than through the second machine preferrably running whonix gateway. 
you can also run virtual machine machine for added layer which any exploits malware would need break out first before they can access execute any type code your host operating system. 
this point even they are able phone home from your host operating system machine they are not able outside the internet connection from machine running the gateway. 
therefore any attempt phoning home will still have through tor. 
and long you did not something stupid like use your real name machine leave any identifying information there should identifying information transmitted. 
one the possible easier solutions for this called raspberry which runs separate computer gateway through routes all your internet traffic and now there company selling something called onion which has been set specifically route all your traffic through tor and the itself mini computer that acts gateway. 
com products thank you. 
you should really careful using javascript altogether from what understand. 
but you choose use whonix believe the whonix developers recommend using physical gateway and workstation rather than using two virtual machines. 
org wiki main pagehowever would imagine there should another option other than using javascript all. 
javascript flash iframe well some other plugins really arent recommended you are attempting stay anonymous whether you are using virtualization technology not. 
certainly using whonix would your best option has been mentioned but javascript truly should avoided altogether whenever possible even technology itself has its flaws and well. 
perhaps there another option using javascript altogether why you feel absolutely necessary use javascript your situation.

physical isolation great you need maximum protection against unknown adversaries but think buying two computers visit this one web site overkill unless thinks theres good chance the nsa will exploiting. 
from shitstormy march pmbitblender youre little late the game btcfog nearing eol this point with darkcoin and darkwallet two seperate coinjoin projects reaching completion. 
also takes alot participation make mixer work and without peer review its impossible say whether your service works not. 
got two trust based mixers now they will dead the end the year. 
coinjoin mixers like shared coin and the planned dark wallet are not completely anonymous like bitcoin fog. 
they not guarantee zero percent taint. 
info discontinued send shared bitcoin fog seems the most trusted traditional mixing service. 
darkcoin interesting concept but doubt will ever replace bitcoin. 
take snapshot your whonix workstation before you start. 
enable javascript whatever you need. 
when youre done revert the snapshot whonix workstation its previous backup. 
obviously anything you saved the whonix workstation will gone after you restore you need save something use shared folder make other arrangements. 
not perfect because anything that manages break out the whonix workstation and into virtualbox could still persist but thats probably the safest easy way. 
from owockeznan march amemail email. 
you arent going get around the fact that the headers give tons info even you pgp all the things. 
bote the superior solutionyour address simply public key. 
the emails are stored dht over all the nodes. 
the only thing that really not able hidden how many times you check your email and how many emails that you get. 
but since hides damn neary everything else its much better system. 
msg msg for date list recommended email providers. 
bote requires both the sender and recipient have the client and the bote plugin installed cannot email accounts external pretty much makes useless for most. 
very secure and anonymous though. 
from weeble march amjust read the whitepaper over bitmessage. 
uses bitcoin like principles hide the sender receiver and everyone gets all the messages make impossible for anyone watching tell whats going. 
you can send messages specific address those who subscribe mailing list. 
uses the proof work concept like bitcoin help prevent spam. 
anyone here using what you think easier than pgp email bitmessage easy use and provides transparent encryption that touted equivalent bit rsa. 
there has never been independent security audit however which real sticking point. 
seems good way fly under the radar. 
for guide with screenshots how setup and use bitmessage you can visit. 
from tub march pmdo you have any established vendors that can vouch for your service safepostage dont know not. 
would hope there are several. 
thekushlife little complicated get postage anonymously. 
you sound like you know what youre doing and applaid your efforts. 
bet youre not aware the complicated ways the post office and stamps. 
com track your computer from one account the other. 
its not simple clearing cookies and making fresh. 
these guys are almost advanced google when comes tracking people. 
even you are aware this not something most people can handle. 
consider issues some have with decrypting pgp messages using virtual machine. 
being anonymous isnt for everyone. 
are aware there are people who have made successful attempts buy postage anonymously their own for years. 
this quick turnaround service for those who want spend their bitcoin and receive guaranteed anonymous postage either with stamps tracking labels. 
soon will offering priority mail packaging and other shippings well. 
blackmailing for what exactly giving information party always concern but believe repeat business. 
your privacy and anonymity our utmost concern. 
zero records are saved. 
decided investigate are doing nothing wrong and would make sure our customer privacy kept confidential matter what. 
delete every shred. 
this the nature our business. 
otherwise would against our mission statement. 
the same concerns could brought with services like bitfog yet trusted all over the darkweb. 
manual orders can made with through pgp also. 
our business model has concern what youre doing with the stamps and shipping labels. 
perhaps you have business amazon and you want pay for shipping using bitcoin but they wont allow that. 
maybe youre previously suspended ebay seller who needs fresh start and fresh tracking labels for your shipments. 
maybe you dont want closed circuit you walk into post office and buy tons express mail stamps. 
remembered post office employees when asked. 
wish everyone the best luck their endeavors.

you can also run virtual machine machine for added layer which any exploits malware would need break out first before they can access execute any type code your host operating system. 
this point even they are able phone home from your host operating system machine they are not able outside the internet connection from machine running the gateway. 
therefore any attempt phoning home will still have through tor. 
and long you did not something stupid like use your real name machine leave any identifying information there should identifying information transmitted.

you should really careful using javascript altogether from what understand. 
but you choose use whonix believe the whonix developers recommend using physical gateway and workstation rather than using two virtual machines. 
org wiki main pagehowever would imagine there should another option other than using javascript all.

certainly using whonix would your best option has been mentioned but javascript truly should avoided altogether whenever possible even technology itself has its flaws and well. 
perhaps there another option using javascript altogether why you feel absolutely necessary use javascript your situation. 
hello currently have vendors. 
take snapshot your whonix workstation before you start. 
enable javascript whatever you need. 
when youre done revert the snapshot whonix workstation its previous backup. 
obviously anything you saved the whonix workstation will gone after you restore you need save something use shared folder make other arrangements. 
not perfect because anything that manages break out the whonix workstation and into virtualbox could still persist but thats probably the safest easy way.

decided investigate are doing nothing wrong and would make sure our customer privacy kept confidential matter what. 
delete every shred. 
this the nature our business. 
otherwise would against our mission statement. 
the same concerns could brought with services like bitfog yet trusted all over the darkweb. 
manual orders can made with through pgp also. 
our business model has concern what youre doing with the stamps and shipping labels. 
perhaps you have business amazon and you want pay for shipping using bitcoin but they wont allow that. 
maybe youre previously suspended ebay seller who needs fresh start and fresh tracking labels for your shipments. 
maybe you dont want closed circuit you walk into post office and buy tons express mail stamps.

its not worth. 
why draw the extra attention you can keep organized functional low profile staying domestic. 
have the same issue only when try log with liberte. 
the captcha just fails load every time. 
physical isolation great you need maximum protection against unknown adversaries but think buying two computers visit this one web site overkill unless thinks theres good chance the nsa will exploiting. 
from jacobs crackers march amcan someone please point the correct direction. 
best can think running tor and allowing javascript run the browser. 
thats the best solution. 
thats really great market. 
from evilgrin march its legit its great idea. 
people who know how secure have idea how not secure the majority. 
people dont even encrypt their addresses when buying guns know this for fact. 
there service that can help the noobs its awesome. 
noobs need this sort thing. 
and myself hate the idea going the post office with box full drugs hand and talking the post office people. 
must admit though would much rather that than have the shipping labels mailed directly via some onion service. 
stop giving these guys hard time. 
noobs need these services. 
lets say they are legit. 
now all these noob vendors can use these services. 
what happens safepostage decides start blackmailing people and when pops them not just trying asshole. 
trying help the community. 
any vendors future vendors who are having trouble shipping anonymously please just. 
will actually teach you how print labels with tracking. 
wont charge you for the info either. 
but for fucks sake. 
dont pay party and risk your customers privacy. 
safepostage its good idea. 
just not for vendors. 
you are not then you will huge target for. 
your database would hold all the info that everyone has been working hard encrypt. 
currency that would really only used launder other currencies. 
think its only slow paced because the beginning forums trashed saying was scam site. 
bsm not having forum has saved from shills because they have nowhere scare customers off either which great. 
dont think there even reddit sub for. 
lets keep that way. 
hub sub forum fairly new there has not been flood shills here either. 
hub forums seem attract the nicest people. 
its still around and has proven its not scam site. 
there ever often wave buyers. 
from tub march pmdo you have any established vendors that can vouch for your service safepostage dont know not. 
would hope there are several. 
thekushlife little complicated get postage anonymously. 
you sound like you know what youre doing and applaid your efforts. 
bet youre not aware the complicated ways the post office and stamps. 
com track your computer from one account the other. 
its not simple clearing cookies and making fresh. 
these guys are almost advanced google when comes tracking people. 
even you are aware this not something most people can handle. 
consider issues some have with decrypting pgp messages using virtual machine. 
being anonymous isnt for everyone. 
are aware there are people who have made successful attempts buy postage anonymously their own for years. 
this quick turnaround service for those who want spend their bitcoin and receive guaranteed anonymous postage either with stamps tracking labels. 
soon will offering priority mail packaging and other shippings well. 
blackmailing for what exactly giving information party always concern but believe repeat business. 
your privacy and anonymity our utmost concern. 
zero records are saved. 
decided investigate are doing nothing wrong and would make sure our customer privacy kept confidential matter what. 
delete every shred. 
this the nature our business. 
otherwise would against our mission statement. 
the same concerns could brought with services like bitfog yet trusted all over the darkweb. 
manual orders can made with through pgp also. 
our business model has concern what youre doing with the stamps and shipping labels. 
perhaps you have business amazon and you want pay for shipping using bitcoin but they wont allow that. 
maybe youre previously suspended ebay seller who needs fresh start and fresh tracking labels for your shipments. 
maybe you dont want closed circuit you walk into post office and buy tons express mail stamps. 
remembered post office employees when asked. 
wish everyone the best luck their endeavors. 
please give chance earn your trust.

since have not seen the best answer posted above will give. 
the absolute best way use those unsafe plugins like javascript java and flash follows. 
you must use separate machines. 
the first machine has other way connecting the internet other than through the second machine preferrably running whonix gateway. 
you can also run virtual machine machine for added layer which any exploits malware would need break out first before they can access execute any type code your host operating system. 
this point even they are able phone home from your host operating system machine they are not able outside the internet connection from machine running the gateway. 
therefore any attempt phoning home will still have through tor. 
and long you did not something stupid like use your real name machine leave any identifying information there should identifying information transmitted. 
one the possible easier solutions for this called raspberry which runs separate computer gateway through routes all your internet traffic and now there company selling something called onion which has been set specifically route all your traffic through tor and the itself mini computer that acts gateway. 
com products thank you. 
you should really careful using javascript altogether from what understand. 
but you choose use whonix believe the whonix developers recommend using physical gateway and workstation rather than using two virtual machines. 
org wiki main pagehowever would imagine there should another option other than using javascript all. 
javascript flash iframe well some other plugins really arent recommended you are attempting stay anonymous whether you are using virtualization technology not. 
certainly using whonix would your best option has been mentioned but javascript truly should avoided altogether whenever possible even technology itself has its flaws and well. 
perhaps there another option using javascript altogether why you feel absolutely necessary use javascript your situation.

from jolly roger march amthank you. 
please personally wouldnt charge you for the same information. 
this community should both free and opensource. 
always try search for your answers before ever paying for them. 
and never forget there are also some other really great places out there get some really great free and accurate security advice well. 
wilders security forums one such place. 
com well the superuser forums. 
comive also always enjoyed reading bruce schneiners blog well. 
found this page particularly interesting. 
granted article from october last year but its still some pretty amazing technology tor users are against out there how the nsa attacks tor firefox users with quantum and foxacid. 
com blog archives how the nsa att. 
htmlsorry for bringing this slightly off topic but personally feel advice should free the internet. 
from firelight march amphysical isolation great you need maximum protection against unknown adversaries but think buying two computers visit this one web site overkill unless thinks theres good chance the nsa will exploiting. 
never forget you can always just root cheap android smartphone run debian linux. 
just use raspberry physical gateway was mentioned. 
there not always need buy two computers laptops create physical gateway. 
and truly far safer well recommended the whonix developers themselves rather than using two virtual machines. 
all the information you need the whonix website listed above. 
also agree that axas guide secure email providers one the most complete have seen the internet. 
good job axa just sure your research before placing trust any email provider individual rules well data retention laws and other such factors vary between providers and countries well. 
and always use gpg regardless. 
well from what can gather looking more and more like agora has run its race. 
say this with great dissapointment. 
not just because more lost vendor bonds and such. 
but ther fuck all else left. 
thank god deepify has the answer. 
all have got for the last hours this. 
iceweasel cant find the file. 
its not its server. 
well these last months have cetainly felt like years worth drama. 
drugheavenco tai pelkk drugheaven. 
tai uusi nimimerkki officer. 
its interesting the whole group think thing. 
mean you have all these buyers who crowd one market and then they wonder why that market runs away with their funds. 
maybe million bucks just too much temptation. 
think the markets ought work together some way spread the load. 
maybe that stupid idea dont really know. 
know the markets want make all the money but having one place just silly really. 
still think back backopy and bmr and why wanted shutdown. 
without more markets spread load and action then just too risky. 
understand about having check bunch sites everyday and orders whatever. 
only many hours guess. 
great hear your agoria you were reg vendor last year everything allways top notch. 
you are not talking about darkwallet but about new alt coin called darkcoin cause never heard. 
how does work. 
advertise the pirate market somewhere. 
create image and upload anony. 
send private message with your username the pirate market image link and link the advertisment. 
does somewhere mean online not both. 
you start learning today you might good enough make market two four years. 
but you also need learn how secure server more like years you are starting from what essentially nothing. 
its great plan start learning these things but dont read php for dummies and then run out and host market you set windows server over rdp. 
just thought post link avids thread here. 
god damnit this shit making mad. 
all ask for life one god damn site thats open more than months time. 
beyond aggravating when you cant even logged long enough answer messages and customer support. 
ughh loving this market too hope they fix this and soon.

yes email the label you can print can also mail the label postage whatever you want. 
typically just email the pdf jpeg the shipping label upload email you can download then you print out and attach your package. 
subbing for one the best vendors. 
bitcoin could not possibly because runs counter everything the control freakish elites and the nwo stand for. 
neither btc not gold and silver fulfill that role.

seems like agora does not have any support same over here different support tickets over the last weeks with answer. 
have not been able successfully use blockchain from tails can create account but when log the username and password fields never load. 
this issue with javascript something maybe someone could tell how adjust settings allow this. 
dont think realistic solution for secure email. 
not disputing the fact that physical isolation the most secure merely bringing the fact that different people have different threat models. 
you know theres non zero chance that you might get shot any time but you dont wear bullet proof vest all the time. 
think about why. 
whonix probably good enough visit the site that talking about and its free and can deployed under half hour. 
theres not much point debating this any further. 
ill check out. 
anywhere the clearnet too what create pic and upload avatar every post make any forums. 
that would new advertisement everytime and youre willing pay. 
btc for every post make youve got kidding. 
not game the math just doesnt add see sense this but look forward hear from you.

you are not talking about darkwallet but about new alt coin called darkcoin cause never heard. 
definately agree different people have diiferent threat models. 
and therefore buyers and sellers should act accordingly. 
great hear your agoria you were reg vendor last year everything allways top notch. 
thank you for your time owock all working order. 
one question purely out interest public key looks noticeably longer than ops that because using key size and isnt missing something. 
not disputing the fact that physical isolation the most secure merely bringing the fact that different people have different threat models. 
you know theres non zero chance that you might get shot any time but you dont wear bullet proof vest all the time. 
think about why. 
whonix probably good enough visit the site that talking about and its free and can deployed under half hour. 
theres not much point debating this any further.

seems like agora does not have any support same over here different support tickets over the last weeks with answer. 
its interesting the whole group think thing. 
mean you have all these buyers who crowd one market and then they wonder why that market runs away with their funds. 
maybe million bucks just too much temptation. 
think the markets ought work together some way spread the load. 
maybe that stupid idea dont really know. 
know the markets want make all the money but having one place just silly really. 
still think back backopy and bmr and why wanted shutdown. 
without more markets spread load and action then just too risky. 
understand about having check bunch sites everyday and orders whatever.

whether ecc something else replaces remains seen. 
although ecc was seen the and coming technology given that was prompted heavily the nsa now makes suspect. 
know that least some the applications using ecc such random number generator rng had odd constants included part the standard likely the nsas insistence.

please personally wouldnt charge you for the same information. 
this community should both free and opensource. 
always try search for your answers before ever paying for them. 
and never forget there are also some other really great places out there get some really great free and accurate security advice well. 
wilders security forums one such place. 
com well the superuser forums. 
comive also always enjoyed reading bruce schneiners blog well. 
found this page particularly interesting. 
granted article from october last year but its still some pretty amazing technology tor users are against out there how the nsa attacks tor firefox users with quantum and foxacid. 
com blog archives how the nsa att. 
htmlsorry for bringing this slightly off topic but personally feel advice should free the internet. 
from firelight march amphysical isolation great you need maximum protection against unknown adversaries but think buying two computers visit this one web site overkill unless thinks theres good chance the nsa will exploiting. 
never forget you can always just root cheap android smartphone run debian linux.

there not always need buy two computers laptops create physical gateway.

this doesnt seem possible with safepostage. 
sorry sound like the safepostage guy. 
not but like this service and dont see issue with. 
think lot people majorly over think things and that causes them see bunch problems with something that doesnt really have many problems. 
they are just searching for problem. 
when shipping package you are already giving the buyers info the postal service which run the government. 
not mention your the vendors address the case you are buying them online your face video you are buying them the postal office. 
understand your point about few hands possible but think this actually safer for everyone. 
there really isnt anything these people can with the information that would cause issue. 
unless they are and decided would fun track down people buying dime bags off the internet honestly dont see what problem could arise.

from the wallet the market has refresh bluesky page deposit click the button. 
was fine for about mins. 
now pages not loading. 
checked out the site and was not impressed. 
the site requires too much from you slow and now unresponsive. 
too little freedom the site. 
not even sure how people are meant see your listings when you cant see them yourself. 
had been rather slow taking off but guessing thats the case with every new market there are many chose from and then folks are very wary with all new dnms. 
from having been scammed multiple times lately. 
takes time build trust and for folks part with their coins over relatively new marketplace. 
but that said things have picked over the last couple weeks mostly migrants from agora and the registrations have been steadily growing the day. 
that turn has brought about good momentum sales but unfortunately for you its mostly from the drug selections and not ccs. 
though there have been few inquiries the support forum which you could chip. 
also guess theres only much market can after all. 
offer free vendor accounts for couple months along with zero commisions all orders etc. 
payout bonus for referrals besides making sure having secure and bug free site for smooth transactions but guess then the onus lies with the site users get the good word around and refer their clients. 
were gradually getting there and good things take time. 
from thedude march pmquote from march pmhave you considered setting electrum wallet works well with tails and eliminates the need for third party wallets. 
but going try blockchain. 
info wallet mean they seem the main source for all this stuff anyway hopefully more secure than campbx. 
just keep mind blockchain. 
info requires you sometimes allow java just for caphtas believe and obviously the clearnet. 
honestly wouldnt surprise they were working closely with since the shutdown the mixing service that required wallet. 
highly recommend electrum with tails you have any questions setting how works feel free ask. 
from axa march pmcountermail good service and they accept bitcoin now but cost year. 
why pay that much when there are very good free lower cost options lelantos mail tor number recommendation they only charge year for lifetime subscription. 
lelantos kinda scares with their headers. 
quotereceived from lelantos. 
either twisted naming policy maybe some are putting all their eggs one very big basket. 
hello doesnt matter where you advertise. 
you are only once allowed enter the event. 
you not want use bitcoin fog your best alternative right now probably shared coin. 
because you never lose control your bitcoin not possible lose coins. 
coinjoin mixer like shared coin multiple users sign transaction instead just one user. 
now its hard tell which user initiated the transaction hence increased privacy. 
not anonymous bitcoin fog though. 
any legit mixing service will take the time get listing the bitcoin wiki page. 
wiki category mixing servicesbefore sending your coins newer service good idea visit the bitcoin forum and check see there review thread for the service. 
orgthat said you dont know the difference between java and javascript you shouldnt using the darknet. 
they are completely unrelated aside from the name and both being object oriented. 
from firelight march ambest option run tor browser with its many privacy and security patches. 
youre running tor middle box presumably you are running linux the main box whonix developers recommend run hide hardware serial numbers mac address etc. 
use this script start tor browser run tor browser without tor tor over tor. 
bin bashexport tor skip launch tor browser browser firefox profile tor browser data browser profile. 
defaulti agree with firelight. 
thats the easiest simplest method end with decent browser your isolated box without reinventing the wheel. 
and before picked any weird platforms for middlebox android etc make sure understood how their random number generation worked practice. 
some small platforms raspberry have hardware rng built but not clear what its contribution the cprng that feeds dev random and dev urandom. 
good rngs are more than little bit important that scenario. 
from axa march pmdarkcoin interesting concept but doubt will ever replace bitcoin. 
this looks lovely. 
com watch ouo. 
kiinnostaisi kyll tiet ett mit kansainv listyminen. 
miksi pit menn kansainv liseksi miksi edes kiinnostaisi kauppapaikka niill monia muita sit varten. 
itse ainakin toivoisin ett pysyisi vain suomalaisten keskuudessa eik edes tarvitsisi ettei rupea alaik iset lukea sitten lehdist kun ovat tyneet. 
when try log says wrong username password tried days but still doesnt work. 
special problem with account agora still down. 
from damiel march pmseconded fast and smooth from the buyer point view too. 
what was the bluesky fud spread the silk road forums when bluesky first opened dont remember seeing that. 
right around christmas when was hitting rough waters few people posted links for bsm agora and pandora. 
bsm was instantly deemed scam. 
then nobody mentioned anymore. 
for the last months bsm has been anything but scam. 
agora does that referral program where people get paid spam their address was way overhyped and probably going the first fall. 
got too big too fast. 
blue sky has had time mature and from what the staff told they are only like capacity feel like will around longer than the other two. 
forums pretty much dictate what happens dnms and they jumped the gun bsm basically halting growth. 
but perseveres and outlasts market after market will grow. 
the admins are always updating things. 
its really nice see market where the operators really care. 
mean its always fast and smooth. 
almost never hiccup its refreshing. 
just wish the traffic would pick bit. 
the forums bashed bsm the beginning being scam and they halted the growth. 
but think the last months have easily been most flawless vending experience the. 
the guys running always making improvments. 
this makes feel like its not some quick hit run scam like smp they simply spend much time improving and adding security. 
post your experience bsm this thread. 
best option run tor browser with its many privacy and security patches. 
youre running tor middle box presumably you are running linux the main box whonix developers recommend run hide hardware serial numbers mac address etc.

net port most the emails mentioned topics not work. 
always run check with onion sniffer and will give the status any onion url you are trying access. 
cant log for days because captcha problems. 
fairly new the deep web new year and have perused through few different markets but far like blue sky. 
agora was nice until all the traffic hit and silk road was sketchy from the start. 
ive completed about transactions total across the three markets ive tried and have not received package once got seized for domestic order. 
luck has been pretty good. 
like blue sky better far for few reasons. 
first like the feedback system. 
second like the stats bsm shows for each vendor. 
third the speed the marketplace very good. 
once make more transactions bsm ill have better idea how like overall but far like better than agora. 
was also impressed with the deposit time. 
used blockchains tumbling service for the first time deposit had always used bitcoinfog before and btc was bsm wallet within twenty minutes. 
was very happy and impressed. 
have thought partial why dont rename that option down payment. 
from amai march pmi have had captcha issues myself today. 
what happening with tba have seen some people starting push out referral links hoping cream off some buyers that use tba but other than that have heard nothing. 
logged today days before have been there for months and still yet sell thing. 
not complaining here wondering why with going down agora under ddos people saying pandora vendors scam there hasnt been bigger charge towards tba. 
just sit there doesnt bother check every few days see have any questions answer orders fill but never have. 
there not many vendors tba are buyers put off for some reason. 
its the mentality. 
this what goes through peoples heads tor listings. 
fuck that agora ddos lots stuff well they have lots stuff ill there one really cares about security seems. 
just waiting for mst implemented then will push hard the people who value security knows how computer works. 
then should have many tech savvy smart people buying selling.

from having been scammed multiple times lately. 
takes time build trust and for folks part with their coins over relatively new marketplace. 
but that said things have picked over the last couple weeks mostly migrants from agora and the registrations have been steadily growing the day. 
that turn has brought about good momentum sales but unfortunately for you its mostly from the drug selections and not ccs. 
though there have been few inquiries the support forum which you could chip. 
also guess theres only much market can after all. 
offer free vendor accounts for couple months along with zero commisions all orders etc. 
payout bonus for referrals besides making sure having secure and bug free site for smooth transactions but guess then the onus lies with the site users get the good word around and refer their clients.

right around christmas when was hitting rough waters few people posted links for bsm agora and pandora. 
bsm was instantly deemed scam. 
then nobody mentioned anymore. 
for the last months bsm has been anything but scam. 
agora does that referral program where people get paid spam their address was way overhyped and probably going the first fall. 
got too big too fast. 
blue sky has had time mature and from what the staff told they are only like capacity feel like will around longer than the other two. 
forums pretty much dictate what happens dnms and they jumped the gun bsm basically halting growth. 
but perseveres and outlasts market after market will grow. 
the admins are always updating things. 
its really nice see market where the operators really care. 
mean its always fast and smooth. 
almost never hiccup its refreshing. 
just wish the traffic would pick bit. 
the forums bashed bsm the beginning being scam and they halted the growth. 
but think the last months have easily been most flawless vending experience the. 
the guys running always making improvments. 
this makes feel like its not some quick hit run scam like smp they simply spend much time improving and adding security. 
post your experience bsm this thread.

miksi pit menn kansainv liseksi miksi edes kiinnostaisi kauppapaikka niill monia muita sit varten. 
itse ainakin toivoisin ett pysyisi vain suomalaisten keskuudessa eik edes tarvitsisi ettei rupea alaik iset lukea sitten lehdist kun ovat tyneet. 
from axa march pmcountermail good service and they accept bitcoin now but cost year. 
why pay that much when there are very good free lower cost options lelantos mail tor number recommendation they only charge year for lifetime subscription. 
lelantos kinda scares with their headers. 
quotereceived from lelantos. 
either twisted naming policy maybe some are putting all their eggs one very big basket. 
had been rather slow taking off but guessing thats the case with every new market there are many chose from and then folks are very wary with all new dnms. 
from having been scammed multiple times lately. 
takes time build trust and for folks part with their coins over relatively new marketplace. 
but that said things have picked over the last couple weeks mostly migrants from agora and the registrations have been steadily growing the day. 
that turn has brought about good momentum sales but unfortunately for you its mostly from the drug selections and not ccs. 
though there have been few inquiries the support forum which you could chip. 
also guess theres only much market can after all. 
offer free vendor accounts for couple months along with zero commisions all orders etc. 
payout bonus for referrals besides making sure having secure and bug free site for smooth transactions but guess then the onus lies with the site users get the good word around and refer their clients. 
were gradually getting there and good things take time. 
checked out the site and was not impressed. 
the site requires too much from you slow and now unresponsive. 
too little freedom the site. 
not even sure how people are meant see your listings when you cant see them yourself. 
mean its always fast and smooth. 
almost never hiccup its refreshing. 
just wish the traffic would pick bit. 
the forums bashed bsm the beginning being scam and they halted the growth. 
but think the last months have easily been most flawless vending experience the. 
the guys running always making improvments. 
this makes feel like its not some quick hit run scam like smp they simply spend much time improving and adding security. 
post your experience bsm this thread. 
from damiel march pmseconded fast and smooth from the buyer point view too. 
what was the bluesky fud spread the silk road forums when bluesky first opened dont remember seeing that. 
right around christmas when was hitting rough waters few people posted links for bsm agora and pandora. 
bsm was instantly deemed scam. 
then nobody mentioned anymore. 
for the last months bsm has been anything but scam. 
agora does that referral program where people get paid spam their address was way overhyped and probably going the first fall. 
got too big too fast. 
blue sky has had time mature and from what the staff told they are only like capacity feel like will around longer than the other two. 
forums pretty much dictate what happens dnms and they jumped the gun bsm basically halting growth. 
but perseveres and outlasts market after market will grow. 
the admins are always updating things. 
its really nice see market where the operators really care. 
was also impressed with the deposit time. 
used blockchains tumbling service for the first time deposit had always used bitcoinfog before and btc was bsm wallet within twenty minutes. 
was very happy and impressed. 
have thought partial why dont rename that option down payment. 
from firelight march ambest option run tor browser with its many privacy and security patches. 
youre running tor middle box presumably you are running linux the main box whonix developers recommend run hide hardware serial numbers mac address etc. 
use this script start tor browser run tor browser without tor tor over tor. 
bin bashexport tor skip launch tor browser browser firefox profile tor browser data browser profile. 
defaulti agree with firelight. 
thats the easiest simplest method end with decent browser your isolated box without reinventing the wheel. 
and before picked any weird platforms for middlebox android etc make sure understood how their random number generation worked practice. 
some small platforms raspberry have hardware rng built but not clear what its contribution the cprng that feeds dev random and dev urandom. 
good rngs are more than little bit important that scenario. 
orgthat said you dont know the difference between java and javascript you shouldnt using the darknet. 
they are completely unrelated aside from the name and both being object oriented. 
hello doesnt matter where you advertise. 
you are only once allowed enter the event. 
what happening with tba have seen some people starting push out referral links hoping cream off some buyers that use tba but other than that have heard nothing. 
logged today days before have been there for months and still yet sell thing. 
not complaining here wondering why with going down agora under ddos people saying pandora vendors scam there hasnt been bigger charge towards tba. 
just sit there doesnt bother check every few days see have any questions answer orders fill but never have. 
there not many vendors tba are buyers put off for some reason. 
its the mentality. 
this what goes through peoples heads tor listings. 
fuck that agora ddos lots stuff well they have lots stuff ill there one really cares about security seems. 
just waiting for mst implemented then will push hard the people who value security knows how computer works. 
then should have many tech savvy smart people buying selling. 
have you tried blockchains shared btc service has small fee compared bitcoinfog. 
silk road not repeat not established marketplace. 
total turmoil and spiraling downward. 
silk road clusterfuck market with zero support. 
the marker the forum you will make defcon very happy you use his site. 
because will steal from you. 
law enforcement will also very happy because they are monitering the site vigorously looking for you. 
use not pass. 
pay thousands fines and attorney fees directly jail. 
from damiel march amquote from blackstar march ami just wrote long post about this forum. 
the idea never ever was planted buyers heads when silk road was trusted community with morals and escrow hacks were not common place. 
now days almost stupid trust escrow system vendor buyer for that matter because the inherent risks. 
saying never ever you are simply trusting the escrow host more than the vendor. 
when you step back and look the vendor should the one you trust you are ingesting his drugs you better have some sort trust about the person. 
the site hosting the escrow the same shadowy figure you have never met any vendor. 
but the difference that you can build trusting working relationship with vendor and narrow down the risks substantially where with escrow host you simply cannot. 
think this never motto way for buyers and noobs lazy their and not their due diligence far finding vendors. 
almost every buyer have will without having even ask becasue they understand the risk strictly end sans the hours after you fund escrow before ship and the volatility btc makes vending gut wrenching experience. 
this becasue they trust more than they trust any market all which have stolen lost funds them date. 
take this how you will but that old never ever died with the the original silk road and the trust the market place. 
thanks for the convincing post. 
were little off topic here ill just say thanks and that totally hear what youre saying. 
almost wish used heroin could business with you would reccomend never touching the stuff. 
also painkillers thats your thing. 
from raege march pmi was also impressed with the deposit time. 
used blockchains tumbling service for the first time deposit had always used bitcoinfog before and btc was bsm wallet within twenty minutes. 
was very happy and impressed. 
have thought partial why dont rename that option down payment. 
lolreally that what huh. 
its like half front half delivery. 
its great option. 
the deposit withdrawal times are blazing bsm right now agree with one the above posters that good for the whole dnm community there are many options far markets keeps the scrutiny spread thin and lessens the risk site closure when you have multiple markets supporting the load. 
would say all the new sites are running slow for trade. 
there are many choose from now those that left the main ones are spread across dozen sites. 
unless every buyer comes this site the existence many new markets unknown. 
with every business you have out and get the trade. 
its vendors steer any buyers know the direction. 
certainly tba will one the main sites future run well. 
out the ten sites vend only are showing potential currently. 
tba one themalso quite noticeable new sites the absence scammers. 
lets face the main sites are getting flooded with them. 
some are selective scammers. 
they will have trouble getting onto some these sites. 
from owockeznan march amemail email. 
you arent going get around the fact that the headers give tons info even you pgp all the things. 
bote the superior solutionyour address simply public key. 
the emails are stored dht over all the nodes. 
the only thing that really not able hidden how many times you check your email and how many emails that you get. 
but since hides damn neary everything else its much better system. 
many soon are down due ddos serves attack.

from amai march pmi have had captcha issues myself today. 
from axa march pmdarkcoin interesting concept but doubt will ever replace bitcoin. 
this looks lovely. 
com watch ouo. 
you not want use bitcoin fog your best alternative right now probably shared coin. 
because you never lose control your bitcoin not possible lose coins. 
coinjoin mixer like shared coin multiple users sign transaction instead just one user. 
now its hard tell which user initiated the transaction hence increased privacy. 
not anonymous bitcoin fog though. 
any legit mixing service will take the time get listing the bitcoin wiki page. 
wiki category mixing servicesbefore sending your coins newer service good idea visit the bitcoin forum and check see there review thread for the service. 
you were really serious about you could read the jolly roger's reference library the security section the hub. 
phptoo much info for tiny little mind. 
fairly new the deep web new year and have perused through few different markets but far like blue sky. 
agora was nice until all the traffic hit and silk road was sketchy from the start. 
ive completed about transactions total across the three markets ive tried and have not received package once got seized for domestic order. 
luck has been pretty good. 
like blue sky better far for few reasons. 
first like the feedback system. 
second like the stats bsm shows for each vendor. 
third the speed the marketplace very good. 
once make more transactions bsm ill have better idea how like overall but far like better than agora.
