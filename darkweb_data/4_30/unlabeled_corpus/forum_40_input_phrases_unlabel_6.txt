according all his words accentuate about traffic. 
good market requires traffic. 
easy handling problems for deposits problems for withdrawals good system for contact pgp correct communication with admins etc. 
for now fast and safe. 
seconded fast and smooth from the buyer point view too. 
what was the bluesky fud spread the silk road forums when bluesky first opened dont remember seeing that. 
there are many far more knowledgable than but i'll answer bit help you along. 
coinbase probably the most coin for your buck when comes easy places buy bitcoin. 
there are other ways that you can buy cheaper bitcoins btc but its royal pain the ass you live the. 
you can make and have many wallets you want store your bitcoin either your computer online. 
info trusted for online wallets. 
currently looking into running electrum from tails more secure wallet setup and believe that the consensus for good basic opsec operational security. 
would reccomend that you use tails minimize the possibility your computer leaking info about you. 
also makes things like pgp and otr messaging way easier its all included the. 
its really easy set too just download the iso image and mount dvd thumb drive card. 
kiinnostaisi kyll tiet ett mit kansainv listyminen. 
miksi pit menn kansainv liseksi miksi edes kiinnostaisi kauppapaikka niill monia muita sit varten. 
itse ainakin toivoisin ett pysyisi vain suomalaisten keskuudessa eik edes tarvitsisi ettei rupea alaik iset lukea sitten lehdist kun ovat tyneet. 
from axa march pmcountermail good service and they accept bitcoin now but cost year. 
why pay that much when there are very good free lower cost options lelantos mail tor number recommendation they only charge year for lifetime subscription. 
lelantos kinda scares with their headers. 
quotereceived from lelantos. 
either twisted naming policy maybe some are putting all their eggs one very big basket. 
had been rather slow taking off but guessing thats the case with every new market there are many chose from and then folks are very wary with all new dnms. 
from having been scammed multiple times lately. 
takes time build trust and for folks part with their coins over relatively new marketplace. 
but that said things have picked over the last couple weeks mostly migrants from agora and the registrations have been steadily growing the day. 
that turn has brought about good momentum sales but unfortunately for you its mostly from the drug selections and not ccs. 
though there have been few inquiries the support forum which you could chip. 
also guess theres only much market can after all. 
offer free vendor accounts for couple months along with zero commisions all orders etc. 
payout bonus for referrals besides making sure having secure and bug free site for smooth transactions but guess then the onus lies with the site users get the good word around and refer their clients. 
were gradually getting there and good things take time. 
checked out the site and was not impressed. 
the site requires too much from you slow and now unresponsive. 
too little freedom the site. 
not even sure how people are meant see your listings when you cant see them yourself. 
mean its always fast and smooth. 
almost never hiccup its refreshing. 
just wish the traffic would pick bit. 
the forums bashed bsm the beginning being scam and they halted the growth. 
but think the last months have easily been most flawless vending experience the. 
the guys running always making improvments. 
this makes feel like its not some quick hit run scam like smp they simply spend much time improving and adding security. 
post your experience bsm this thread. 
from damiel march pmseconded fast and smooth from the buyer point view too. 
what was the bluesky fud spread the silk road forums when bluesky first opened dont remember seeing that. 
right around christmas when was hitting rough waters few people posted links for bsm agora and pandora. 
bsm was instantly deemed scam. 
then nobody mentioned anymore. 
for the last months bsm has been anything but scam. 
agora does that referral program where people get paid spam their address was way overhyped and probably going the first fall. 
got too big too fast. 
blue sky has had time mature and from what the staff told they are only like capacity feel like will around longer than the other two. 
forums pretty much dictate what happens dnms and they jumped the gun bsm basically halting growth. 
but perseveres and outlasts market after market will grow. 
the admins are always updating things. 
its really nice see market where the operators really care. 
was also impressed with the deposit time. 
used blockchains tumbling service for the first time deposit had always used bitcoinfog before and btc was bsm wallet within twenty minutes. 
was very happy and impressed. 
have thought partial why dont rename that option down payment. 
from firelight march ambest option run tor browser with its many privacy and security patches. 
youre running tor middle box presumably you are running linux the main box whonix developers recommend run hide hardware serial numbers mac address etc. 
use this script start tor browser run tor browser without tor tor over tor. 
bin bashexport tor skip launch tor browser browser firefox profile tor browser data browser profile. 
defaulti agree with firelight. 
thats the easiest simplest method end with decent browser your isolated box without reinventing the wheel. 
and before picked any weird platforms for middlebox android etc make sure understood how their random number generation worked practice. 
some small platforms raspberry have hardware rng built but not clear what its contribution the cprng that feeds dev random and dev urandom. 
good rngs are more than little bit important that scenario. 
orgthat said you dont know the difference between java and javascript you shouldnt using the darknet. 
they are completely unrelated aside from the name and both being object oriented. 
hello doesnt matter where you advertise. 
you are only once allowed enter the event. 
what happening with tba have seen some people starting push out referral links hoping cream off some buyers that use tba but other than that have heard nothing. 
logged today days before have been there for months and still yet sell thing. 
not complaining here wondering why with going down agora under ddos people saying pandora vendors scam there hasnt been bigger charge towards tba. 
just sit there doesnt bother check every few days see have any questions answer orders fill but never have. 
there not many vendors tba are buyers put off for some reason. 
its the mentality. 
this what goes through peoples heads tor listings. 
fuck that agora ddos lots stuff well they have lots stuff ill there one really cares about security seems. 
just waiting for mst implemented then will push hard the people who value security knows how computer works. 
then should have many tech savvy smart people buying selling. 
have you tried blockchains shared btc service has small fee compared bitcoinfog.

and running blockchain much the better means anonymous coins are really safe. 
anyway thanks for the offer maybe ill take you when feel like playing with more darknet stuff.

forming and llc not the worst way. 
depends several factors. 
the type business you say your selling stuffed animals and your company makes several hundred thousand that year will raise red flags. 
you will want pose tech company etc. 
taxes are not bad thing the slightest. 
you structure your llc the right way such abc llc taxed corp. 
you can legally generate yourself payroll and that taxation while your company taxed different rate. 
one advantage you keep your personal salary under the federal poverty line you can capitlize obamacare. 
seriously though you have that much money move your gonna want pay taxes and look like nice law abiding citizen. 
think the long game. 
never fall for the out state llc scam like the nevada corporation. 
forming out state country one the quickest ways get audited etc. 
vary how you take payments and make deposits. 
the you can make cash deposits use prepaid visa mastercards available any drugstore take credit card payments and use the occassional money order. 
once these funds start flowing pay your taxes quarterly and make your business structure look even more sound. 
could continue this list and but with little research and effort you can lower your risk exposure immensly. 
all your interested large btc purchases you will have more creative. 
dont link those purchases you business account. 
depending your location you can find may buyers local btc willing take cash accept bank deposits. 
avoid chase they now require you the account your depositing into and require. 
the evolution forum both funny and dark for credit debit and store cards owners eye opener these fuckers can ruin your life with the right tools they have multiple listings for card numbers pins names and addresses. 
you can purchase paypal account for very little money that place must have all over has some surprising listings too for example mailing services one guy charges electronics for opening bubble mailer and dropping the letter inside into any mail box easy money. 
having the same problem and want ship orders. 
bitcoin fog still. 
info discontinued send shared some time ago and now only offers their coinjoin service shared coin. 
you use shared coin remember may inexpensive but not anonymous bitcoin fog coinjoin mixer the transaction chain never completely broken. 
just made highly ambiguous. 
prefer blockchain shared coin for financial reasons. 
its also generally much faster. 
for some reason have been having trouble with shared coin lately ive just been transferring market and trading the coin for fiat currency then eventually buying back btc for about.

does everyone understand. 
not strictly true. 
depends number factors and huge variance observable different brands ram. 
freeze and many brands hold long enough dump. 
tried modern laptops recently with truecrypt and safeboot both gave the keys without difficulty. 
choose linux kernel with tresor which stores the keys the cpu debug registers instead ram. 
tell them what they have done. 
they should create new key pair.

would have agree here. 
agora and both show their ass shit sites bsm will still standing. 
the security point like magic johnson. 
who the peoples choice for vending cocaine done with. 
their private key compromised need tell them immediately can anyone offer any hindsight this meerkovo. 
long they have password their key think basically all pgp clients enforce this you would have brute force the password get true key. 
however brute force attack against weak passphrase entirely possible. 
the key has been any keyserver revocation certificate should issued and uploaded. 
hasnt getting revocation certificate generated asap would good idea. 
then toss that key and create new one. 
this why before sending pgp encrypted message you always check either listing the packets attempting decrypt yourself make sure that have sent the right things the right individuals. 
get this but pgp has private key public key and password. 
send each public keys. 
sound like noob but have point make the mistake sending private addition the public key gave both keys. 
but the keys his keyring are password protected the very have both how would still able decrypt messages. 
managed get yesterday for little while but can not get today. 
just note customer who may have placed order with can not get logged before will unable get the order shipped out today. 
same yesterday you are desperate for anything are also available. 
one person says this happening and gets attacked the admins the forum. 
then bunch other people chime that they are getting screwed over too and reply. 
watch out vendors pandora taking comission any sale smells like the next sheep coming arround the corner. 
from aquaman march amwell then. 
who the peoples choice for vending cocaine done with. 
there couple people with good reps for blow. 
think and another guy who has been other markets ive seen just cant remember his name the feedback system good and with escrow most vendors its not crap shoot like agora pandora. 
boy how those two sites folded under the added weight downfall. 
bsm has had nice long growing period get all situated and strong. 
mucho gusto senor. 
been bent over times lately. 
not noob either.

good looking site though.

totally agree that market needs built from ground specifically not using any third party modules frameworks especially open source market software. 
does everyone understand. 
think done with agora. 
this access shit for the birds. 
from aquaman march amnever. 
does everyone understand. 
just found this service that seems pretty trustworthy. 
its called bitblender and looks promising. 
this not endorsement dont know the owners this site and not vouch for them. 
use your own risk. 
onion indexhere thread over the forums where the owner the site introduced the service. 
the thread began review another service bitlaunder that appears either really crummy scam. 
allps really digging this forums functionality. 
agora opens now. 
starting get slightly annoying. 
working again now. 
ddos attacks seems. 
comes and goes but seems like agora the most reliable market out there now. 
cant access now either dont know what happening and want access send bitcoins escrow and place order but with this problem send bitcoins its risk because the site sometimes open but much times not and that frustrating really. 
love agora hope that they fix this problem soon. 
tor that effective when comes wallets and anonymity understanding tor only disguises the activity youre doing but anyone whos eavesdropping the exit node can get pretty easily. 
use tor for electrum wallet the electrum servers may not know where the coins came from but can always know watching the exit nodes. 
could really haha guess too paranoid. 
from crepuscular february pmbut for people who may have trouble getting coins that are totally unlinked them. 
maybe some information about different tumbling options advantages disadvantages current status reputation etc. 
btw second this. 
think about new tumbling methods since btcfog least according what read reddit latelz being sketchy fuck.

the original text below the link here. 
first all sorry but didn had much for choice didn wanted close pandora market and hope least some you will understand situation but know going burn and lost all karma but there whole truth with plan. 
what happened last week pandora market got shaved large portions btc vendors used small time scammers they were able steal about btc pandora total holdings basically everything that was not cold storage they found the leak system. 
stopped all withdrawals found leak and fix the bug system and also were checking any signle money operation programming that the reason why everyone withdrawals were stopped for about hours. 
what were options back then when found bitcoin lost could make market disapear and just close down everyone will think then scammed oll you. 
will apply solution cover losses and continue operations. 
choose number why didn told truth before that would probably lead only instant panic and market closure week before that day. 
all money would probably lost all vendors and customers money. 
didn informed and pandora were able make withdrawals more than btc since steal bitcoins discovered vendors all that would not possible would not take this drastic measurements. 
all actions was made safe pandora market and continue operation time will tell that was good move. 
only what sure about didn made this drastic measurements can only close down the market and remembered scammer. 
current situation partly covered loss from profits this probably very stupid move from everybody will probably blame should closed market think now covered about losses from own money hard desicion for. 
market and almost all btc will recovered during this week aplying very high tax all transactions. 
actions made currently only max pandora holdings are held main server possible loss limited total pandora holdings. 
many security updates the system leak fixed. 
pandora will survive that future that ever happen again loss limited btc holdings. 
facts pandora market processing withdrawals for vendors and over btc were sent vendors during last week. 
all transaction must taxed with scheme below complete recovery. 
pandora will start processing withdrawal for all users. 
withdrawal fee for customers will aply from that day until. 
days pandora will recovered less than days from now. 
for those thinking about closing shops pandora. 
really understand that but think about this. 
small market might mean person behind the market might not ready for inflow money and might scam you anyway. 
think again how much you made with pandora market existence and how much you are going make future and without this market you would may not able make money that you did there. 
didn had many ptions safe market and this loss temporary and will repaid back. 
recovery scheme buyback for save pandora market had make very drastic measurements commision operating tax during. 
commision paid from all transaction scheme. 
recovery tax your item have add commision item instead deduct. 
recovery tax your item have add commision item instead deduct. 
you have option add commision item price vendor you are not charged full but customer pay commision and after you are cahrged. 
reason accept that truth that you have choice and you want able withdraw for all send order consider prepaid tax will explain later. 
take necessary evil continue bussiness pandora market understand some you will not. 
all commisions paid are database and know who paid what amount commisions above expected. 
escrow release for vendor name order amount. 
that helf for every single transaction these allow calculate exact commision paid that day easily and from. 
all affected vendors probably all will have overpaid commision calculated. 
overpaid commision ill put special database. 
all vendors will later pay only standard commision and will calculated back repay tax back vendors. 
future commisions will paid back vendors after total amount overpaid money. 
proportion might change pay back vendors quick possible worst case scenario will sell pandora earnings and pay from that debt vendors repay them overtax each will earn portion pandora profits paid daily. 
about what think must completely stupid honest this bussines because for were such easier exit. 
don expect nobody understand even wrote that post think many you will think this beginning scam because does make sence but going scam not going allow withdrawals more than btc right that play for that truth must very stupid put even all money back just for everybody will blaming but that risk taking now. 
somebody think taking that profits now that not true much more easier just close all withdrawals and run away with money which didn. 
big truth now not making any money out pandora every single satoshi now back repay back loss. 
don want sound like almos save your money will blamed course many will think this start scam took money myselft but none that truth. 
facts this going scam which not not going allow withdrawals. 
recovery all loss end month. 
pandora will beck normal end the month. 
now working for free. 
pandora will survive believe that. 
personaly still didn steal single bitcoins from customer vendor. 
understand this anonymous place not easy believe nothing. 
super short version pandora loss btc holdings. 
drastic tax needed recover paid all vendors. 
tax paid vendors will paid back form less commision pay future. 
normal operation will start again approx. 
update all vendor customer balances are not touched any way and after recovery will fully available customers can still order from any vendor and vendors don have anny issues with withdrawals from day because recovered cold storage and used money pay vendors. 
there are enough btc cover all withdrawals calculated balances all vendor accounts and pandora have multiple time balance for withdrawal then available balance vendor accounts vendors don have issues wit withdrawals from day except hour withdrawal stop before few days. 
update inflow btc into pandora market unchanged comparsion last week buyers are still buying stable rate compare the last week others will try make panic and take advantage this issue you can please don try create more panic but protect pandora possible. 
you want vendor limit your loss you can change item add price instead deduct then from. 
commision will aply and will paid you and customer. 
best what vendor can now limit loss probably change all their items add commision price. 
that way commision added total price paid customer. 
tax going vendor paying just splitting with customer. 
that tax should not probably burn most vendors margins items sold here are usually high and every vendor should survive that temporary loss paid back when back normal. 
pandora going survive that and least half people will understand why how now pandora will here for normal operations within. 
now everybody say fuck off and that idiont and scammer. 
for those who will stay calm promise you will repay commisions back time even for those who will not stay calm. 
never thought going happen pandora always think these steal are always made owners. 
thought pandora stronghold that can not beaten but learned from this and believe pandora not going down that don know what say more. 
are great vendor.

the original text below the link here. 
first all sorry but didn had much for choice didn wanted close pandora market and hope least some you will understand situation but know going burn and lost all karma but there whole truth with plan. 
what happened last week pandora market got shaved large portions btc vendors used small time scammers they were able steal about btc pandora total holdings basically everything that was not cold storage they found the leak system. 
stopped all withdrawals found leak and fix the bug system and also were checking any signle money operation programming that the reason why everyone withdrawals were stopped for about hours. 
what were options back then when found bitcoin lost could make market disapear and just close down everyone will think then scammed oll you. 
will apply solution cover losses and continue operations. 
choose number why didn told truth before that would probably lead only instant panic and market closure week before that day. 
all money would probably lost all vendors and customers money. 
didn informed and pandora were able make withdrawals more than btc since steal bitcoins discovered vendors all that would not possible would not take this drastic measurements. 
all actions was made safe pandora market and continue operation time will tell that was good move. 
only what sure about didn made this drastic measurements can only close down the market and remembered scammer. 
current situation partly covered loss from profits this probably very stupid move from everybody will probably blame should closed market think now covered about losses from own money hard desicion for. 
market and almost all btc will recovered during this week aplying very high tax all transactions. 
actions made currently only max pandora holdings are held main server possible loss limited total pandora holdings. 
many security updates the system leak fixed. 
pandora will survive that future that ever happen again loss limited btc holdings. 
facts pandora market processing withdrawals for vendors and over btc were sent vendors during last week. 
all transaction must taxed with scheme below complete recovery. 
pandora will start processing withdrawal for all users. 
withdrawal fee for customers will aply from that day until. 
days pandora will recovered less than days from now. 
for those thinking about closing shops pandora. 
really understand that but think about this. 
small market might mean person behind the market might not ready for inflow money and might scam you anyway. 
think again how much you made with pandora market existence and how much you are going make future and without this market you would may not able make money that you did there. 
didn had many ptions safe market and this loss temporary and will repaid back. 
recovery scheme buyback for save pandora market had make very drastic measurements commision operating tax during. 
commision paid from all transaction scheme. 
recovery tax your item have add commision item instead deduct. 
recovery tax your item have add commision item instead deduct. 
you have option add commision item price vendor you are not charged full but customer pay commision and after you are cahrged. 
reason accept that truth that you have choice and you want able withdraw for all send order consider prepaid tax will explain later. 
take necessary evil continue bussiness pandora market understand some you will not. 
all commisions paid are database and know who paid what amount commisions above expected. 
escrow release for vendor name order amount. 
that helf for every single transaction these allow calculate exact commision paid that day easily and from. 
all affected vendors probably all will have overpaid commision calculated. 
overpaid commision ill put special database. 
all vendors will later pay only standard commision and will calculated back repay tax back vendors. 
future commisions will paid back vendors after total amount overpaid money. 
proportion might change pay back vendors quick possible worst case scenario will sell pandora earnings and pay from that debt vendors repay them overtax each will earn portion pandora profits paid daily. 
about what think must completely stupid honest this bussines because for were such easier exit. 
don expect nobody understand even wrote that post think many you will think this beginning scam because does make sence but going scam not going allow withdrawals more than btc right that play for that truth must very stupid put even all money back just for everybody will blaming but that risk taking now. 
somebody think taking that profits now that not true much more easier just close all withdrawals and run away with money which didn. 
big truth now not making any money out pandora every single satoshi now back repay back loss. 
don want sound like almos save your money will blamed course many will think this start scam took money myselft but none that truth. 
facts this going scam which not not going allow withdrawals. 
recovery all loss end month. 
pandora will beck normal end the month. 
now working for free. 
pandora will survive believe that. 
personaly still didn steal single bitcoins from customer vendor. 
understand this anonymous place not easy believe nothing. 
super short version pandora loss btc holdings. 
drastic tax needed recover paid all vendors. 
tax paid vendors will paid back form less commision pay future. 
normal operation will start again approx. 
update all vendor customer balances are not touched any way and after recovery will fully available customers can still order from any vendor and vendors don have anny issues with withdrawals from day because recovered cold storage and used money pay vendors. 
there are enough btc cover all withdrawals calculated balances all vendor accounts and pandora have multiple time balance for withdrawal then available balance vendor accounts vendors don have issues wit withdrawals from day except hour withdrawal stop before few days. 
update inflow btc into pandora market unchanged comparsion last week buyers are still buying stable rate compare the last week others will try make panic and take advantage this issue you can please don try create more panic but protect pandora possible. 
you want vendor limit your loss you can change item add price instead deduct then from. 
commision will aply and will paid you and customer. 
best what vendor can now limit loss probably change all their items add commision price. 
that way commision added total price paid customer. 
tax going vendor paying just splitting with customer. 
that tax should not probably burn most vendors margins items sold here are usually high and every vendor should survive that temporary loss paid back when back normal. 
pandora going survive that and least half people will understand why how now pandora will here for normal operations within. 
now everybody say fuck off and that idiont and scammer. 
for those who will stay calm promise you will repay commisions back time even for those who will not stay calm. 
never thought going happen pandora always think these steal are always made owners. 
thought pandora stronghold that can not beaten but learned from this and believe pandora not going down that don know what say more.

shall looking the parent forum more have got game with all these young around taking business. 
hello siblings originally made the post below two venues silkroad forumand bitmessage. 
there were responses allon forum far. 
but there were several quality replies onbitmessage both private replies private address and public replies the bitchirp channel. 
would like offerthis same post the denizens thehub only test theall the talent has migrated thehub hypothesis. 
and course benefit from more quality replies like start discussion about namecoin because seems methat this coin might end being dark horse that comes rushingto prominence all sudden. 
and heres why introduction you may remember the whole project begin new system url addresses. 
bit addresses and begin new system domain name registration this scheme uses blockchain store immutable unscammable records domain name registrations. 
the infrastructure fait accompli. 
its already built. 
the new urls might look something like this thehub. 
bit enter meowbitthis site appears hold some promise for enabling this originalvision starting new system bit addresses and domain name registration. 
com that true then perhaps can expectto see the price namecoin escalating the future. 
members both the cypherpunk and libertarian communitiesare taking keen interest this project becausethere are important potential consequences for anonymityand privacy since without central registrar. 
will moredifficult for govt create rules about who can create domain name and whatidentity checks can imposed domain name owners. 
should alsobe more difficult for govt shut down website and prosecute its owners. 
all this interesting many levels. 
not least which the prospectfor future namecoin values. 
the current value name coins. 
dollars price from btc. 
but notice that currently the price namecoin isin delicious decline nov the price namecoins peaked then peaked again over jan. 
two important questions. 
how low will namecoin during its current decline. 
how high will namecoin bit domains take off heres guesses naturally they are biased via own hope ium inebriation. 
the price will sink this year. 
the price will climb the next years. 
lets try factor out bias. 
the price will sink this year. 
the price will climb the next years. 
please feel free comment question any the above material. 
have nice day. 
and happy playground.

you even know how pgp works. 
scam ive been agora for months now dude wouldnt promote someone else was scamming like cmon use your fucking brain. 
any phone period bad idea. 
you have cell signal you can detected within foot square thats the way cellular protocols work. 
each tower has know when pass you onto the next tower called cell hence cellular you pass out its range. 
knows this because measures your signal strength very precisely. 
you have more towers within your cellphones range and you almost always your position can triangulated very precisely just looking the relative signal strength from each the towers. 
said this fundamental cellular phones. 
you cannot work around this. 
basically you are carrying little tracking device you all day every day. 
which can and does neatly map out who you are where you are where youve been who youve been withand then tapping voice text content what you said what you didor using trojans access smartphone content any live audio from using the phones mic live video using the phones camera your contacts pictures numbers emails etc. 
youre stupid enough then back your shit cloud storage like say icloud then all this data including weeks location data all packaged neatly and ready for them sniff just take from the cloud provider. 
the best business not conduct any business via phone period. 
have one anywhere near you when youre doing business. 
remember that even when off most cellphones are simply hibernating and still poll towers occasionally. 
you have physically remove the battery and most smartphones dont let you this without some screwdriver work. 
alternately metal cocktail shaker apparently amazing shield. 
drop your phones there. 
but then they still know where those phones were your location still kinda obvious.

from playground march pmhello siblings until the security audit has been performed perhaps good ideato send any sensitive messages via bitmessage encrypted and signed with your regular gpg pgp keys. 
the same way you might withsenstive emails sensitive messages forum like thehub. 
the security audit will come. 
only because reassures rightfully users. 
and hence lifts barrier adoption. 
given the problems with using regular centralised email servicessome have decided abandon email altogether and stick with bitmessage. 
once security audit has been performed and the recommended changes havebeen implemented expect many other people will follow suit and alsoabandon email. 
time will tell. 
but certainly these are interesting times. 
recent discussions the bitchirp channel suggest that theremight one day web based sending only version bitmessage. 
basically allowing you send messages bitmessage from website. 
recommended that you not use any websitesthat claim offer full web based implementation bitmessage sincethis probably going scam site. 
this becausethere the unavoidable problem that you will trusting the websitewith your private keys. 
thats definite sending msgs only web based implementation bitmessage could relatively more secure. 
this scenario the user only specifies the address the recipient. 
she doesnt not specify his her ownbm address email address and does not need expose any private keys the website. 
the web sites generates random disposable address for the sender one time use only. 
but even the sending only website proposal suffers from the problem thatmessages could spoofed. 
theres way specify that messages from say nightcrawler really came from nightcrawler. 
and thats trueunless nightcrawler signed his message with his gpg private key. 
and you had hispublic key with which you could verify his signature. 
personally however would only trust such sending only website the original bitmessage team set. 
thats not true would probably inclined trust the tor project team the blockchain team the bitcoin and litecoin teams. 
but you get the idea. 
have nice day. 
answer the original question experience with bitmessagehas been very good. 
there seem some very clued people bitmessage. 
thanks for your reasoned comments playground. 
would post get started guide bitmessage here the hub but the forum will not allow images posts. 
for good how guide how set and use bitmeesage have guide with screenshots another onion forum.

from weeble march playground good info. 
the more ive seen about bitmessage the more like. 
seems they are trying the right things provide truly private decentralized and anonymous messaging system. 
any email system that uses the existing infrastructure will always leak meta data and that enough many cases totally avoid take all the standard precautions which many users will not know about tor pgp etc. 
youre very welcome. 
completely agree with you. 
especially like the fact that all the encryption and signing and then later the decryption and verification are all done under the hood. 
dont have think about master keys and subkeys about keyservers anything else. 
any user can take advantage the power encryption without having first gain thorough understand encryption and without having study the openpgp gpg users manual figure out the options. 
grandmother could use. 
and lets not forget that its fully distributed. 
there are central servers. 
theres where for leo serve warrant. 
this offers the tantalising prospect that can completely defeat the surveillance ambitions various evil govt agencies around the world. 
these are definitely interesting times. 
have nice day. 
and feel free send message bitmessage. 
test out the process.

this guy claiming complete scam. 
hello siblings until the security audit has been performed perhaps good ideato send any sensitive messages via bitmessage encrypted and signed with your regular gpg pgp keys. 
the same way you might withsenstive emails sensitive messages forum like thehub. 
the security audit will come. 
only because reassures rightfully users. 
and hence lifts barrier adoption. 
given the problems with using regular centralised email servicessome have decided abandon email altogether and stick with bitmessage. 
once security audit has been performed and the recommended changes havebeen implemented expect many other people will follow suit and alsoabandon email. 
time will tell. 
but certainly these are interesting times. 
recent discussions the bitchirp channel suggest that theremight one day web based sending only version bitmessage. 
basically allowing you send messages bitmessage from website. 
recommended that you not use any websitesthat claim offer full web based implementation bitmessage sincethis probably going scam site. 
this becausethere the unavoidable problem that you will trusting the websitewith your private keys. 
thats definite sending msgs only web based implementation bitmessage could relatively more secure. 
this scenario the user only specifies the address the recipient. 
she doesnt not specify his her ownbm address email address and does not need expose any private keys the website. 
the web sites generates random disposable address for the sender one time use only. 
but even the sending only website proposal suffers from the problem thatmessages could spoofed. 
theres way specify that messages from say nightcrawler really came from nightcrawler. 
and thats trueunless nightcrawler signed his message with his gpg private key. 
and you had hispublic key with which you could verify his signature. 
personally however would only trust such sending only website the original bitmessage team set. 
thats not true would probably inclined trust the tor project team the blockchain team the bitcoin and litecoin teams. 
but you get the idea.

any email system that uses the existing infrastructure will always leak meta data and that enough many cases totally avoid take all the standard precautions which many users will not know about tor pgp etc. 
youre very welcome. 
completely agree with you. 
especially like the fact that all the encryption and signing and then later the decryption and verification are all done under the hood. 
dont have think about master keys and subkeys about keyservers anything else. 
any user can take advantage the power encryption without having first gain thorough understand encryption and without having study the openpgp gpg users manual figure out the options.

dont think anyone has done this million dollar idea. 
make virtual counterfeit btc then break down pennys mutiple wallets. 
the get real btc and break down pennys then put the two together different wallet. 
and youve got. 
heres map the idea fake computer created btc busted down and seperated sent all broken chunks one wallet. 
when they come together will say one btc and not two seperate amounts worth legit btc broken down also seperated sent all chuks one wallet. 
when they come together will say one btc and not two seperate amountsso basically just needa figure out how they make the currency digitally and immitate just like paper currency.

lovely brown colour with plenty rocks mixed throughout and the ainseed smell was almost overpowering. 
paid nic directly for order was disptahced within hours and all envelopes landed shortly after. 
product was tested with mecke simons and marquis testers and tested strongly expected. 
when all contents were removed from the mylar they had sent total. 
without giving away too much packaging their stealth was very clever despite being confined envelope. 
their mdma was acetone washed acen and these were the results washed acenvendor saint niclink.

made fake account and fake order. 
here the btc wallet the imposter expects you send money cghig rhj znhsc money lets hope stays that way and nobody getting sucked this. 
this just note bump our thread people are aware any orders that have been placed with agora are aware any delays. 
why tcp hidden service and not ssl via tor outproxy most the electrum servers dont block tor outproxies there really need use hidden service. 
for that all you need set your network use localhost and the port with socks the protocol. 
there one server running the ssl service port tails will bitch you when connects. 
bothers you you can just comment that server out. 
also with dotfiles persistence enabled there need enable root manually hack the persistence. 
once you create your wallet just copy the. 
electrum directory into the dotfiles directory tailsdata unlocked. 
from willowsmom march pmnot happy right now. 
withdrew all coin yesterday morning and yes now balance. 
however the coin hasnt even been sent yet. 
the transaction listed the correct withdrawal address noted but its labeled pending still not blockchain almost hours later. 
put ticket but jeez need money this the first time ive had problem like this bsm update its now been almost hours support never got back but the pending status was just changed sent and the coin wallet. 
read the faq and stuff. 
says there that sometimes withdrawals are done manually for whatever reason and may take bit longer. 
glad they showed problem. 
agra down again cant seem access was. 
theres some twat the agora forums claiming that the site was seized but course didnt post any proof claims has secret source. 
hope its just. 
hope that not true really like that market. 
any other vendor and have been bricking when agora went down but know would always find way. 
only vendor genuinely trust definitely looking forward midweek package now the pills are finally back. 
dear all more dangerous anonymity visit non onion sites with tor. 
this question can answered many ways. 
traffic analysis easier when visiting clearnet sites yes. 
you rotate exit nodes every minutes while hidden service keeps its entry guards for month longer. 
since your end the connection the same both cases you reach certain probability getting pwned traffic analysis much faster when visiting clearnet sites than when visiting hidden servcies. 
clearnet site more likely malicious try deanonyize you than hidden service probably not. 
clearnet sites may try track you for targeted advertising but tor browser does good job defending against linkability. 
its worth noting that the only targeted attack against tor users that know about came from hidden service freedom hosting. 
are there other factors that can threaten your anonymity yes. 
the connection from the exit node the clearnet site isnt encrypted unless you make encrypted with ssl tls while circuits hidden services are always encrypted end end. 
also tcp streams different clearnet sites may multiplexed the same circuit and leave the same exit node which will know that you rather the same anonymous person visiting those sites while circuits hidden services are always separate. 
you can set option tors configuration file enforce stream isolation although its not recommended for web browsing. 
final factor affects other apps besides tor browser. 
you misconfigure your proxy settings you may accidentally connect clearnet site over clearnet rather than over tor but misconfigured proxy settings will cause connection hidden service simply fail perhaps with dns leak.

only connect vpn and run tor through since rooted can direct all traffic through tor rooted never anything naked well and use that for personal attacks anything else you might want.

also with dotfiles persistence enabled there need enable root manually hack the persistence. 
once you create your wallet just copy the. 
electrum directory into the dotfiles directory tailsdata unlocked. 
yea wit try get some them over here. 
the majority darknet market users never post forums all.

not many stayed active but they came. 
the two guys above glad you guys like bsm. 
think its such good site hope all the best your travels through the daraknet. 
dear all more dangerous anonymity visit non onion sites with tor. 
from willowsmom march pmnot happy right now. 
withdrew all coin yesterday morning and yes now balance. 
however the coin hasnt even been sent yet. 
the transaction listed the correct withdrawal address noted but its labeled pending still not blockchain almost hours later. 
put ticket but jeez need money this the first time ive had problem like this bsm update its now been almost hours support never got back but the pending status was just changed sent and the coin wallet. 
read the faq and stuff. 
says there that sometimes withdrawals are done manually for whatever reason and may take bit longer. 
glad they showed problem. 
you are asking about the pass code for you pgp wouldnt use any spaces. 
minimum should keys recomend keys. 
happy help you although not sure understand your question. 
your pgp key automatically generated when you set. 
you have open the asc file word processor see your public pgp key. 
this question can answered many ways. 
traffic analysis easier when visiting clearnet sites yes. 
you rotate exit nodes every minutes while hidden service keeps its entry guards for month longer. 
since your end the connection the same both cases you reach certain probability getting pwned traffic analysis much faster when visiting clearnet sites than when visiting hidden servcies. 
clearnet site more likely malicious try deanonyize you than hidden service probably not. 
clearnet sites may try track you for targeted advertising but tor browser does good job defending against linkability. 
its worth noting that the only targeted attack against tor users that know about came from hidden service freedom hosting. 
are there other factors that can threaten your anonymity yes. 
the connection from the exit node the clearnet site isnt encrypted unless you make encrypted with ssl tls while circuits hidden services are always encrypted end end. 
also tcp streams different clearnet sites may multiplexed the same circuit and leave the same exit node which will know that you rather the same anonymous person visiting those sites while circuits hidden services are always separate. 
you can set option tors configuration file enforce stream isolation although its not recommended for web browsing. 
final factor affects other apps besides tor browser. 
you misconfigure your proxy settings you may accidentally connect clearnet site over clearnet rather than over tor but misconfigured proxy settings will cause connection hidden service simply fail perhaps with dns leak.

you want two phones opinionyou want burner phone with sim you can conduct buisness granted you have the apps encrypt the texts calls etc. 
with vpn then destroy completely when youre donethen you want smartphone that you can root take the sim out. 
only connect vpn and run tor through since rooted can direct all traffic through tor rooted never anything naked well and use that for personal attacks anything else you might want. 
just dont link your irl credentials youre tying online persona bank irl friends etc use one smartphone like this for each identity you havethats what.

this just note bump our thread people are aware any orders that have been placed with agora are aware any delays. 
why tcp hidden service and not ssl via tor outproxy most the electrum servers dont block tor outproxies there really need use hidden service. 
for that all you need set your network use localhost and the port with socks the protocol. 
there one server running the ssl service port tails will bitch you when connects. 
bothers you you can just comment that server out. 
also with dotfiles persistence enabled there need enable root manually hack the persistence. 
once you create your wallet just copy the. 
electrum directory into the dotfiles directory tailsdata unlocked. 
same problem hopefully the vendor has seen order before the site went down. 
this occurring quite often lately though. 
getting either problem loading page blank orange screen.
