since whitebeard has been riding defcons cock the whole time remaining faithful even immediately after the hiest that suggests may some sort insider. 
course still doubt defcon. 
his story about transaction malleability leading being the cause the theft complete bullshit. 
glad youre not any trouble starting swayed the stories hearing. 
maybe its the years buying the street that has critical the minute something like that happens will wait and see not owed much just few quid change really not enough for usual order when that goes back ill know for sure. 
deliberately not making much noise with buyers account see all goes back automatically. 
that happens will have doubts all but until then wont ordering anything. 
can afford loss will either get some the street shit till then not stuck all but its consistency the street its either good and really small shit and little bigger not like what was getting. 
pays everyone back. 
that opinion this matter. 
the mind boggles. 
why earth dont you just use different market agora see sig for referral pandora blue sky hell even dream market have all been around long and havent been plagued dozens mysterious admin accounts arrests insiders and massive bitcoin thefts. 
from mdparity february amive never heard dream market could you share link just curious. 
oniontbh not even sure its still active their forums only have like registered members lol. 
main site captcha refuses work think might scratch this one off the list. 
from chemcat february amsr not scam there need cyber mark such. 
weve been through alot and will persevere get through this just fine hugs you all chemcat silk road not silk road. 
this silk road has relationship with the original. 
anything violation existing trademark. 
silk road either. 
hopelessly incompetent and unable protect user funds. 
choose one the two. 
quite often there seems some confusion how bitcoin works seems there general belief that the bitcoins are stored the wallet but this not true. 
before explaining the purpose wallet important first explain how bitcoin works. 
the information all the transactions are kept the bitcoin block which computed and kept the miners. 
this why rewards are given miners they are doing all the number crunching. 
the rewards also promote more miners there spread and single miner with less than around the mining power can cheat the numbers. 
now have the first part bitcoin blockchain the ledgerthe next important thing how are funds moved around the bitcoin blockchain bitcoins are not moved and out the wallet simplified manner blockchain actually big list addresses and the funds them. 
when funds are spent into address the blockchain will write that the funds were put into the address moved out address. 
the second part funding addresshow does the blockchain know who owns the address order understand this important first understand what address. 
address consists parts based version bitcoin addresses. 
public key hash the private key. 
address hash the public key with checksum then convert base source. 
wiki technical background bitcoin addresses now that know all are actually related and unique each other can see from there layer security between each. 
you can use private key recreate the public key and address but not the other way around. 
now that know what the keys are look how its used the third part spending. 
address once fund has been spent into the address now have balance the address. 
public key the public key exposed create transaction when preparing send. 
private key now complete the transaction the private key used sign and identify the rights send the transaction created with the public keyas can seen the private key identifies the right spend from address the blockchain the private key used derive the public key and address. 
therefore the private key just shows permission move funds the blockchain for specific address. 
finally have the last part the walletif wallet does not hold bitcoins what does hold wallet more similar analogy account book that holds your account and passwords. 
what the native bitcoin wallet client actually does. 
hold private key public key addresses used for moving funds the blockchain. 
connects and sends the transaction instructions accordingly. 
scan and keeps records your transactions from the blockchainsome wallets dont even they use online sources for information about your account having wallet with the full blockchain can take quite bit space and continue grow since copy all transactions the ledger. 
technically you would not even need wallet access your funds. 
you just need the private key for your address. 
cold storage when funds are sent address where the private keys are not online accessible computer. 
this could simple printing your public and private key onto piece paper saving text file your usb and sticking your drawer. 
without the private key the address can not accessed. 
there are any questions feedback regards how bitcoin blockchain address public private keys and wallets please feel free contact any time. 
howdy you are looking for free vendor account you can come blackbank. 
however with the advent recent questionable vendors that will changing shortly. 
you are interested joining feel free beforehand. 
there will also vendor application fee waiver for vendors with rating from reputable marketplaces upcoming update. 
stated all his bitcoins were stolen well. 
mtgox has never been functional lol. 
fair that article about fud bitcoins are prosecution futures you will caught etc and fact blockchains andreas antonopoulos states clearly that either willing let someone steal the coins stole the coins themself. 
cnn after all. 
think have found that hard evidence the form the testimony expert witness andreas antonopoulos. 
com technology security bitcoin black market silk roads new administrators said hackers exploited bitcoin glitch steal funds. 
but the days since the attack its become painfully clear that the bitcoin system isnt blame. 
only two scenarios exist says andreas antonopoulos engineer bitcoin wallet service blockchain silk roads leaders were fooled into emptying all their accounts willingly they simply swindled their customers themselves. 
member posts karma view profilei have opinion either way but couple weeks before the hack seemed like this place was falling apart and its future uncertain. 
whoever stole the coins would have waited they thought they could get more coins later date. 
from northwest nuggets february amits possible that hack some other type robbery did happen but happened while ago. 
have suspected for some time that didnt have all the bitcoins that were supposedly peoples wallets and were using these bugs borrow money from vendors when deposits were not enough fund the withdrawls. 
now that people are losing faith and leaving the site deposits are much less than withdrawls and vendors are requiring customers finalize early they cant borrow the money anymore. 
posted this another thread this subject but belongs here too. 
have proof that scam now. 
have the testimony bitcoin expert. 
only two scenarios exist says andreas antonopoulos engineer bitcoin wallet service blockchain silk roads leaders were fooled into emptying all their accounts willingly they simply swindled their customers themselves. 
usually just call scam and wait for the market prove otherwise but this time have the testimony expert witness that this scam. 
until can produce more qualified expert contradict. 
antonopoulos then think now for label this latest event scam least until get that contradictory expert testimony. 
know the basics. 
mtgox got hacked had some issue dont give crap about the conspiracy theorys and have now shut down withdrawls. 
what would like know what are the chances they will actually allow withdrawls and when also side question would good idea buy btc with usd right now gox for the hopes they will reopen withdrawls make some easy cash. 
never trusted gox from day. 
they are shifty just like the teenagers than ran bitinstant. 
understand that they have made some soft announcements that they plan giving people their money sometime and the link cwb gave their metric shit ton speculation. 
not trust gox all but putting usd make profit this point would simply gamble like any other. 
and personally think they will give the money back. 
just based how catastrophic would they didnt. 
and the fact they have claimed have all the coins. 
and not giving them back this point would make them look very very bad. 
have account pending verification. 
from pothead february pmstay away even for bitcoin bought there isnt worth.

good stuff you should very weary cruising the darknet what essentially homing device.

this was said and one else. 
why you believe everything cops say. 
from tacit february pmi have made over bitcoins total agora rocks god damn thats alot just creaping btc now. 
from cooked february pmmtgox has never been functional loltrue dat. 
from evilgrin february pmi have account pending verification. 
their track record actually following through and verifying account holders even though theyve had relevant documents pretty poor and suspect that right now their customer service people are probably focussed other things. 
would strongly recommend you nothing till your account verified you youll doubling your risk. 
from evilgrin february pmand personally think they will give the money back. 
just based how catastrophic would they didnt. 
and the fact they have claimed have all the coins. 
and not giving them back this point would make them look very very bad. 
theyve been making themselves look bad regular basis for long ive been into bitcoin you think any that bothers mark karpeles hes got track record for saying fuck you you dont like his customers why should this situation any different. 
from evilgrin february pmwhat would like know what are the chances they will actually allow withdrawls and when also side question would good idea buy btc with usd right now gox for the hopes they will reopen withdrawls make some easy cash the only thing have are goxs statements now and goxs track record the past. 
their track record appalling theyve fucked too many times for many people trust them. 
their statements far this latest crisis reveal nothing other than their incompetence technology and. 
will they open btc withdrawals again your guess good mine this ultimately depends whether business solvent. 
have they been scammed hacked are they turn scamming theres alot speculation that gox management and close friends are buying hundreds cheap btc from gox customers transferring them other exchanges and selling rinse repeat make millions dollars. 
you have usd already gox theres some speculation that holding fiat gox better than holding btc they are indeed insolvent. 
japans laws around insolvency are very strict and gox management are riesking criminal sanctions they fuck around too badly. 
youre thinking transferring usd into gox dont unless youve got account theyve already verified with photo utility bills etc because youll never able get anything back otherwise. 
you already have verified account then all means transfer some cash. 
you could make your money more you are able transfer the btc out another exchange some point the future. 
you could lose all turns out gox insolvent scammed hacked scamming. 
how much you trust gox keep eye.

should avoided like the plague danger danger will robinson. 
there just started using agora. 
havent ordered but have deposited tiny amount btc just test. 
ive been looking agoras forum and there are several complaints about deposits not showing one person even complaining that looked the blockchain and saw his deposit his agora wallet sent another address internal tumbling but never showing his agora wallet. 
addition these people are complaining zero response from agora support. 
anyone had any similar experiences edit not trying diss agora actually looks like very well run marketplace just exercising due diligence before jump and make purchase. 
looks very cool and love the ethos but why when have tor configured for max security you require javascript enabled fully participate please.

here are many details the attack can provide.

transparency this issue key however you deserve granular explanation possible why this happened. 
attack investigation results feb. 
when withdrawal delays were happening last month wrote custom bitcoin implementation using several available libraries reference and built shared infrastructure load balance across accounts and provide risk mitigation ever one server was compromised. 
this implementation was being written behind the scenes dev staff lynch mob was getting exponentially worse the forums. 
our moderator staff became more and more insistent that was crucial fix this problem immediately relaying many concerns and threats from the community. 
cut corner deciding watch transactions. 
many community members were reporting missing withdrawals weeks after sending them. 
implemented liberal check the refresh deposit balances link the account page essence allowed search deeply for any missing coins rescanning and rescanning. 
one our team members was familiar with mtgoxs procedures and source code and vouched for the idea. 
our thoughts were that the largest bitcoin exchange was using this approach find missing coins must commonplace. 
received her his permission publish this. 
the transaction malleability bug was published last week time when was disconnected from the internet for extended period for opsec reasons. 
did not become aware the threat until the attack was already occurring. 
this was failure part trust more staff with critical access stop withdrawals. 
the people who did have access disable withdrawals were terrified doing without permission due how negatively the community reacts when withdrawals are turned off. 
they knew they disabled withdrawals then enabled them there would run the bank and would need online deposit cold storage into hot storage. 
effect this was failure emphasize staff that always okay lean the side caution and hit killswitches they deem necessary. 
was also failure communicate expectations the community that sometimes killswitches will have hit and just means were playing safe. 
this month clear did not play safe. 
killswitches are pointless the only person confident enough hit them the boss. 
the attacker used account first registered early jan try exploiting the vulnerability. 
looking back the accounts history indicates that this account has been used pentest many aspects our system unsuccessfully. 
every previous attempt find attack vector failed due hardening done our penetration testing team. 
had previously seen these attempts the logs something celebrate look our hardening working this hacker would have won but put security over features several people suggested disabling the hackers accounts but that pointless our business anyone can simply register. 
are still unclear the exact approach used cause our servers perception transactions mismatch with reality because have largely been focusing preparing for relaunch and building communication share with you the community over the past day. 
the best our understanding the attacker deposited increasingly larger amounts bitcoins and withdrew them while flooding the blockchain with ddos similar transactions. 
our system reflected his withdrawals and his account showed zero. 
the attacker rapidly clicked refresh deposits link until our code assumed that the transaction failed all indications point malleability the root case. 
our system credited his account with the btc judged unsuccessfully withdrawn. 
this again due the liberal rescanning mechanisms added last month see point. 
reality our servers perceived the transactions inaccurately and the btc were successfully withdrawn. 
result our system inaccurately represented the users balance larger than truly was. 
this allowed the attacker withdraw coins again. 
the attacker began depositing larger amounts such btc time order exploit the vulnerability quickly. 
they then drained our entire hot storage one bitcoin server shard and tried the attack from one their other accounts. 
the other account was different shard and allowed that hot storage drained. 
the attacker continued using different accounts until virtually all our hot storage shards were drained. 
due the type vulnerability our accounting system had inaccurate perception bitcoins hand and therefore did not trigger any alerts until real user withdrawals began failing unexpectedly. 
this was failure our part build new server alert check each shard the new shared bitcoin infrastructure and another symptom how rushed were when implementing the new system during forum lynch mob about slow withdrawals. 
lessons learned far. 
more staff should have access killswitches and should not afraid use them. 
even its just because some news post about clearnet about some transaction malleability thing. 
killswitches should used liberally and regularly. 
community needs comfortable with regular downtime especially during periods when community safety and the safety its money could threatened. 
good staff will responsibly paranoid and hitting killswitches they deem necessary and should not afraid their community panicking each time precaution exercised. 
there more web security than rigorous penetration testing. 
also requires the constant review external services systems and. 
never make assumptions when implementing protocols you did not design. 
had not trusted mtgoxs staff procedures would have reviewed our approaches with much more rigor. 
just because large companys procedures are successful does not make them are safe. 
accept that your community will hate you regardless. 
the darknet you will crucified your community anything ever goes wrong. 
prepare for everyone hate you because you inevitably will fail something and you will need stay determined matter what. 
dont let get your head and dont let affect your rigor with security. 
cut corners with our deposit withdrawal speed optimizations because were afraid the lynch mob. 
were foolish this regard. 
should have taken the entire site offline for long took implement high volume fault tolerant bitcoin server well tested rigorous manner. 
this cost unspeakable amount trust that had slaved build some for years. 
this where were with much transparency this medium allows the worst that could happen did not happen. 
the worst thing that could happen for our communitys finances however did. 
hate that occurred under our watch. 
there nothing can change this. 
all can transparent about where are and move forward. 
those who will respond here for dramatic effect please consider contributing your energy the reconstruction our community. 
you cannot bring yourself this then please take your negativity elsewhere. 
you have lost faith silk road dont blame you the least. 
also not want read about perpetuity. 
trolling during disaster cowardice. 
choosing strengthen rather than troll when trolling the popular move thats noble.

the multitude you who lost faith silk road still glad ive heard your words. 
still devastated that have failed you. 
and even have fallen victim this attack the majority personal earnings are completely gone. 
life not danger though and identity still protected thankful for this. 
now time share with you our plan move forward. 
realize you have way knowing whether telling the truth anything. 
trying communicate the authenticity true character the darknet difficult say the least and not expect any you take word. 
but actions over the next few weeks will speak louder than words ever could and you stick around you realize this. 
silk road not deadwe are here stay and for the most part believe our values are the same yours the community. 
and even though represent the latest idiot make security mistake unlike those who simply give and determined use lessons learned fight for this communitys long term security. 
focusing multi signature transactions our only safe trading mechanism long term. 
additionally ready and willing collaborate with other darknet administrators and utilize our talented penetration testing team help them regularly audit their security.

thats only accurate for one type standarized transaction. 
you can assign outputs all sorts different things that dont just require proof ownership private key whose public keys hash corresponds certain value. 
course good luck getting your wierdo transaction into the blockchain. 
think its hilarious cnn finds important enough make article itjust makes want troll even more knowing cnn watchingthis must what miley cyrus feels like. 
think there could explanations about the stolen bitcoins. 
the staff stole everything. 
but that case why they pay off people and even they dont pay off everybody that would too many efforts for few profits. 
personally dont think they stole the users. 
has been hacked but the staff too proud admit public they told everyone that the market was very secure. 
maybe thats why they invented that story narco and the btc malleability. 
dont say that have the truth. 
have made over bitcoins total agora rocks. 
not bothing with this anymore. 
upon reading android wont enough. 
dont know alot things but read yesterday they are voting the owner off the board bitcoins something only problem this guy founding father the bitcoin orgazation whatver and they cant removed easy kinda like the president lol. 
rumor has mioght step down guy crook hear feel bad for the people losing money there. 
from cuntdowntoban february amwhat does everyone think about temporary shutdown for like week two month something like that. 
market without support bottomless pit for you throw you bitcoins down. 
any other ideas for improvements welcome. 
feb how did know lol spam removed. 
thanks but when can place orders and put bitcoins the account because the bitcoins that had before attack escrow stays pending balance and yesterday sent for make test and pending confirmation too but not pending balances yet. 
when this problem fix then using bitcoinfog for example can put bitcoins account safely and place orders with the same way always and yes when this may possible thanks lot. 
have another question about the reopened and this about account too. 
deposit adresses above the adresses can read this text mix all coins which ever touch silk road. 
without mixing you are completely vulnerable blockchain analysis and the potential disclosure your identity. 
have basic internal mixing implemented but silk road ever compromised you will not safe. 
not rely one single point failure strongly recommend that you use bitcoin mixing service. 
you are unfamiliar with mixing services encourage you browse silk roads community forums for. 
what mean this dont know nothing about that really payment method what somebody can explain this and how works use put secure way bitcoins think that something like that another way but wanna know what and required place orders and pay with bitcoins safely how works like said. 
another thing please tell too. 
its important information know. 
deepdotweb have relegated the scam list. 
respected bitcoin engineers have called scam. 
least darkmarket community agrees its scamwhy does the hub continue infer legitimacy obvious conjob keeping the subforum especially since you claim you are trying shake the stink off yourselves. 
from mycarneedstint february pmare you the payroll didnt just admit this the. 
cant believe anyone actually putting money into the site. 
the net closing and soon the proof gets undenailble for even silk road fanboys the admins will just shut shop and run for the hill with whatever money tied the site the time. 
only two scenarios exist says andreas antonopoulos engineer bitcoin wallet service blockchain silk roads leaders were fooled into emptying all their accounts willingly they simply swindled their customers themselves. 
here the link cnn article clearnet warning. 
com technology security bitcoin black market clearnet warning. 
from evilgrin february pmok know the basics. 
mtgox got hacked had some issue dont give crap about the conspiracy theorys and have now shut down withdrawls. 
what would like know what are the chances they will actually allow withdrawls and when also side question would good idea buy btc with usd right now gox for the hopes they will reopen withdrawls make some easy cash stay away from gox. 
would you deposit money uninsured bank that has stopped allowing withdrawls and wire transfers but still accepts deposits stay away even for bitcoin bought there isnt worth. 
will consider miracle ever see coins mount cocks stole. 
lets not even mention how much they cost investors losses from coins tanking and not being allowed trade. 
mount cocks will down the biggest bitcoin scam date. 
will make the scam pulled look like nothing. 
from floydy february pmquote from evilgrin february pmwhat would like know what are the chances they will actually allow withdrawls and when also side question would good idea buy btc with usd right now gox for the hopes they will reopen withdrawls make some easy cash the only thing have are goxs statements now and goxs track record the past. 
their track record appalling theyve fucked too many times for many people trust them. 
their statements far this latest crisis reveal nothing other than their incompetence technology and. 
will they open btc withdrawals again your guess good mine this ultimately depends whether business solvent. 
have they been scammed hacked are they turn scamming theres alot speculation that gox management and close friends are buying hundreds cheap btc from gox customers transferring them other exchanges and selling rinse repeat make millions dollars. 
you have usd already gox theres some speculation that holding fiat gox better than holding btc they are indeed insolvent. 
japans laws around insolvency are very strict and gox management are riesking criminal sanctions they fuck around too badly. 
youre thinking transferring usd into gox dont unless youve got account theyve already verified with photo utility bills etc because youll never able get anything back otherwise. 
you already have verified account then all means transfer some cash. 
you could make your money more you are able transfer the btc out another exchange some point the future. 
you could lose all turns out gox insolvent scammed hacked scamming. 
how much you trust gox keep eye. 
com this virtual market for goxbux and goxcoin and tells what the market thinks. 
true dirty harry style you feel lucky punk agreed there track record shocking especaily when there trade engine stalled and their price got stuck loop one many examples. 
wont miss them they dissapear. 
read this mate clearnet. 
com bitcoinmarkets comments ygxq mtgox megathread thursday february for one cant really get head around. 
does anyone know these people are legit has anyone bought from them emailed them about product and they gave link their stocklist. 
that was couple days ago. 
now their website down. 
emailing them about buying product and asked them about the website and they said that the server the website was hosted was hacked and wiped. 
should trust them could their email compromised too. 
one the oldest darknet scam sites. 
mean just imagine the consequences for the community market allowed take your money and that isnt called scam even the face evidence that would stand court like the testimony expert witness. 
this means that market can just take our money any time they want and even have evidence will just keep right using. 
says cwb voted for obama. 
from xsposer february pmthis sounds just like what the sheep market admin did for all their vocal forum members before they stole everything. 
just ask jack hoff backed sheep market until the very last day. 
why because unlike everyone else they let him withdraw limited amount funds would publicly called any scam talk. 
does this post sound familiar almost believed that everybody else was making all about not getting withdrawls because trusted jack and would say just withdrew every time somebody would say their withdrawls were not working. 
from tyrone february. 
incompetent fools unable protect user funds. 
ill prefix what about say with hate sounding like defending. 
trying get provoke more than half thought out you people. 
you call them incompetent fools unable protect user funds you are calling lot site owners this. 
ulbricht the people who ran bitmit and even backopy who ran what lot people call the best run marketplace history. 
dont see your market that impenetrable fortress. 
wheres know probably bunch thieving cunts and all the shit talk deserved but little bit wisdom that learned over the years iswhat matters more than being correct the thought process leading the correct conclusion flawed not. 
its flawed then you are wrong even though you accidentally came the correct conclusion. 
dont fight with people the internet thats gay but enjoy honest conversation even have opposing opinions. 
from what see the reason you said they were hacked was because they were too incompetent secure the funds. 
you dont want offer option where they are not assholes. 
and course sound argument shouldnt offer such option. 
there lot marketplaces that have been hacked despite the admins intentions technical knowledge security capabilities. 
the fact the matter its really freakin hard completely secure million dollars worth coins that are sitting one spot the internet. 
either evey market admin date incompetent impossible nearly impossible secure bitcoins the darknet. 
which option sounds more true. 
follow your analogy different doctors preform lobotomys and them kill the patient. 
the doctor incompetent opinion the matter. 
super gay begin with. 
this point they either pay people back dont. 
few months can decide they are scammers not. 
know how angry people get when their money lost but claiming they are lying nothing more than claim right now. 
wouldnt the first time market was hacked. 
all that being said dont like. 
dont think anyone should use. 
its place for children get high. 
you are child and what get high the road. 
there are better places. 
well they deserve chance respond the blockchain guy but they dont come with expert that contradicts him pretty soon then should labelled scam. 
this market were called sheep instead silk road then would have called scam days ago. 
now that have bitcoin expert saying that has some type scam they must contradict this with their own expert labelled scam. 
agree with you nuggets. 
wallet was emptied. 
had nothing escrow and two finalized orders. 
not feel wallet safe all. 
not feel any market wallet safe. 
wish could tell people that safe. 
but lets realistic. 
know all have choice and hopefully understand the risks and right now they seem like pretty fin great risks.

all know was not hacked. 
most know and some just not want believe. 
doesnt matter who took what this point. 
its how much trust someone willing put into what being said admins. 
and fuck that isnt totally personal interpretation but ive learned most the new members are not too good interpreting things.

this completely fault for listening critics instead own sense caution. 
the public has known that auto finalize has been disabled for long time and has known that the escrow balance massive. 
any smart person could deduce that enabling auto finalize requires move vast sum from cold storage the hot storage wallet ensure adequate fund availability which admittedly was too large and one biggest failures this month. 
the attack was surgical and timed perfectly. 
the reason such high quantity coins was stolen was because were preparing implement auto finalization and had therefore moved huge volume from the cold storage the hot storage ensure the coins from all auto finalized orders could withdrawn without hitch. 
here are many details the attack can provide. 
still investigating and not want leak anything which could compromise any other markets. 
transparency this issue key however you deserve granular explanation possible why this happened. 
attack investigation results feb. 
when withdrawal delays were happening last month wrote custom bitcoin implementation using several available libraries reference and built shared infrastructure load balance across accounts and provide risk mitigation ever one server was compromised. 
this implementation was being written behind the scenes dev staff lynch mob was getting exponentially worse the forums. 
our moderator staff became more and more insistent that was crucial fix this problem immediately relaying many concerns and threats from the community. 
cut corner deciding watch transactions. 
many community members were reporting missing withdrawals weeks after sending them. 
implemented liberal check the refresh deposit balances link the account page essence allowed search deeply for any missing coins rescanning and rescanning. 
one our team members was familiar with mtgoxs procedures and source code and vouched for the idea. 
our thoughts were that the largest bitcoin exchange was using this approach find missing coins must commonplace. 
received her his permission publish this. 
the transaction malleability bug was published last week time when was disconnected from the internet for extended period for opsec reasons. 
did not become aware the threat until the attack was already occurring. 
this was failure part trust more staff with critical access stop withdrawals. 
the people who did have access disable withdrawals were terrified doing without permission due how negatively the community reacts when withdrawals are turned off. 
they knew they disabled withdrawals then enabled them there would run the bank and would need online deposit cold storage into hot storage. 
effect this was failure emphasize staff that always okay lean the side caution and hit killswitches they deem necessary. 
was also failure communicate expectations the community that sometimes killswitches will have hit and just means were playing safe. 
this month clear did not play safe. 
killswitches are pointless the only person confident enough hit them the boss. 
the attacker used account first registered early jan try exploiting the vulnerability. 
looking back the accounts history indicates that this account has been used pentest many aspects our system unsuccessfully. 
every previous attempt find attack vector failed due hardening done our penetration testing team. 
had previously seen these attempts the logs something celebrate look our hardening working this hacker would have won but put security over features several people suggested disabling the hackers accounts but that pointless our business anyone can simply register. 
are still unclear the exact approach used cause our servers perception transactions mismatch with reality because have largely been focusing preparing for relaunch and building communication share with you the community over the past day. 
the best our understanding the attacker deposited increasingly larger amounts bitcoins and withdrew them while flooding the blockchain with ddos similar transactions. 
our system reflected his withdrawals and his account showed zero. 
the attacker rapidly clicked refresh deposits link until our code assumed that the transaction failed all indications point malleability the root case. 
our system credited his account with the btc judged unsuccessfully withdrawn. 
this again due the liberal rescanning mechanisms added last month see point. 
reality our servers perceived the transactions inaccurately and the btc were successfully withdrawn. 
result our system inaccurately represented the users balance larger than truly was. 
this allowed the attacker withdraw coins again. 
the attacker began depositing larger amounts such btc time order exploit the vulnerability quickly. 
they then drained our entire hot storage one bitcoin server shard and tried the attack from one their other accounts. 
the other account was different shard and allowed that hot storage drained. 
the attacker continued using different accounts until virtually all our hot storage shards were drained. 
due the type vulnerability our accounting system had inaccurate perception bitcoins hand and therefore did not trigger any alerts until real user withdrawals began failing unexpectedly. 
this was failure our part build new server alert check each shard the new shared bitcoin infrastructure and another symptom how rushed were when implementing the new system during forum lynch mob about slow withdrawals. 
lessons learned far. 
more staff should have access killswitches and should not afraid use them. 
even its just because some news post about clearnet about some transaction malleability thing. 
killswitches should used liberally and regularly. 
community needs comfortable with regular downtime especially during periods when community safety and the safety its money could threatened. 
good staff will responsibly paranoid and hitting killswitches they deem necessary and should not afraid their community panicking each time precaution exercised. 
there more web security than rigorous penetration testing. 
also requires the constant review external services systems and. 
never make assumptions when implementing protocols you did not design. 
had not trusted mtgoxs staff procedures would have reviewed our approaches with much more rigor. 
just because large companys procedures are successful does not make them are safe. 
accept that your community will hate you regardless. 
the darknet you will crucified your community anything ever goes wrong. 
prepare for everyone hate you because you inevitably will fail something and you will need stay determined matter what. 
dont let get your head and dont let affect your rigor with security. 
cut corners with our deposit withdrawal speed optimizations because were afraid the lynch mob. 
were foolish this regard. 
should have taken the entire site offline for long took implement high volume fault tolerant bitcoin server well tested rigorous manner. 
this cost unspeakable amount trust that had slaved build some for years. 
this where were with much transparency this medium allows the worst that could happen did not happen. 
the worst thing that could happen for our communitys finances however did. 
hate that occurred under our watch. 
there nothing can change this. 
all can transparent about where are and move forward. 
those who will respond here for dramatic effect please consider contributing your energy the reconstruction our community. 
you cannot bring yourself this then please take your negativity elsewhere. 
you have lost faith silk road dont blame you the least. 
also not want read about perpetuity. 
trolling during disaster cowardice. 
choosing strengthen rather than troll when trolling the popular move thats noble. 
know that speak for all silk road staff seen and unseen when speak these words are going nowhere.

silk road will always rise again.

consistently blown away how the core this community come together times strife. 
the multitude you who lost faith silk road still glad ive heard your words. 
still devastated that have failed you. 
and even have fallen victim this attack the majority personal earnings are completely gone. 
life not danger though and identity still protected thankful for this. 
now time share with you our plan move forward. 
realize you have way knowing whether telling the truth anything. 
trying communicate the authenticity true character the darknet difficult say the least and not expect any you take word. 
but actions over the next few weeks will speak louder than words ever could and you stick around you realize this. 
silk road not deadwe are here stay and for the most part believe our values are the same yours the community. 
and even though represent the latest idiot make security mistake unlike those who simply give and determined use lessons learned fight for this communitys long term security. 
focusing multi signature transactions our only safe trading mechanism long term. 
additionally ready and willing collaborate with other darknet administrators and utilize our talented penetration testing team help them regularly audit their security.

howdy you are looking for free vendor account you can come blackbank. 
however with the advent recent questionable vendors that will changing shortly. 
you are interested joining feel free beforehand. 
there will also vendor application fee waiver for vendors with rating from reputable marketplaces upcoming update. 
thanks but when can place orders and put bitcoins the account because the bitcoins that had before attack escrow stays pending balance and yesterday sent for make test and pending confirmation too but not pending balances yet. 
when this problem fix then using bitcoinfog for example can put bitcoins account safely and place orders with the same way always and yes when this may possible thanks lot. 
have another question about the reopened and this about account too. 
deposit adresses above the adresses can read this text mix all coins which ever touch silk road. 
without mixing you are completely vulnerable blockchain analysis and the potential disclosure your identity. 
have basic internal mixing implemented but silk road ever compromised you will not safe. 
not rely one single point failure strongly recommend that you use bitcoin mixing service. 
you are unfamiliar with mixing services encourage you browse silk roads community forums for. 
what mean this dont know nothing about that really payment method what somebody can explain this and how works use put secure way bitcoins think that something like that another way but wanna know what and required place orders and pay with bitcoins safely how works like said. 
another thing please tell too. 
its important information know.

posted this another thread this subject but belongs here too. 
have proof that scam now. 
have the testimony bitcoin expert. 
only two scenarios exist says andreas antonopoulos engineer bitcoin wallet service blockchain silk roads leaders were fooled into emptying all their accounts willingly they simply swindled their customers themselves. 
usually just call scam and wait for the market prove otherwise but this time have the testimony expert witness that this scam. 
until can produce more qualified expert contradict. 
antonopoulos then think now for label this latest event scam least until get that contradictory expert testimony. 
member posts karma view profilei have opinion either way but couple weeks before the hack seemed like this place was falling apart and its future uncertain. 
whoever stole the coins would have waited they thought they could get more coins later date. 
from northwest nuggets february amits possible that hack some other type robbery did happen but happened while ago. 
have suspected for some time that didnt have all the bitcoins that were supposedly peoples wallets and were using these bugs borrow money from vendors when deposits were not enough fund the withdrawls. 
now that people are losing faith and leaving the site deposits are much less than withdrawls and vendors are requiring customers finalize early they cant borrow the money anymore. 
fair that article about fud bitcoins are prosecution futures you will caught etc and fact blockchains andreas antonopoulos states clearly that either willing let someone steal the coins stole the coins themself. 
cnn after all. 
think have found that hard evidence the form the testimony expert witness andreas antonopoulos. 
com technology security bitcoin black market silk roads new administrators said hackers exploited bitcoin glitch steal funds. 
but the days since the attack its become painfully clear that the bitcoin system isnt blame. 
only two scenarios exist says andreas antonopoulos engineer bitcoin wallet service blockchain silk roads leaders were fooled into emptying all their accounts willingly they simply swindled their customers themselves.

have made over bitcoins total agora rocks. 
from tacit february pmi have made over bitcoins total agora rocks god damn thats alot just creaping btc now. 
from cuntdowntoban february amwhat does everyone think about temporary shutdown for like week two month something like that. 
market without support bottomless pit for you throw you bitcoins down. 
any other ideas for improvements welcome. 
feb how did know lol spam removed. 
from mycarneedstint february pmare you the payroll didnt just admit this the. 
stated all his bitcoins were stolen well. 
mtgox has never been functional lol. 
dont know alot things but read yesterday they are voting the owner off the board bitcoins something only problem this guy founding father the bitcoin orgazation whatver and they cant removed easy kinda like the president lol. 
rumor has mioght step down guy crook hear feel bad for the people losing money there. 
from jolly roger january pmquote from flaxceed january pmi was finally able get. 
agree now that they have fixed lot the issues retract the massive fail comment. 
when could not log for days end and could not get any help was looking bleak. 
things are definitely changing for the better yeah have spoken defcon about the site and aware the problems. 
mainly though just they not want become like all the other hacked markets. 
sheep bmr tor market flomarket and more come. 
even pandora was slightly compromised but the attacker only stole. 
all these markets are constantly under attempted attack and when you are silk road. 
you not want lose anyones coins. 
there are likely lot bitcoins flowing through silk road. 
and any hack that could exploit their escrow wallets would likely huge. 
therefore making absolute certain that the system near impossible compromise priority and trumps all fancy features like resolutions centers and forth. 
unfortunately most people see through this and think that these security features should have been implemented upon being developed. 
you see though with the other hacked markets easy make mistakes and all takes one little exploit and somebody will find and steal the bitcoins. 
one day people will look back this and laugh. 
agora the other hand was written former bitcoin fog developer and since bitcoin fog extremely solid quite confident that agora will solid well. 
have viewed the website and the coding looks solid. 
would interested your views the hack that allegedly got them. 
thanks but when can place orders and put bitcoins the account because the bitcoins that had before attack escrow stays pending balance and yesterday sent for make test and pending confirmation too but not pending balances yet. 
when this problem fix then using bitcoinfog for example can put bitcoins account safely and place orders with the same way always and yes when this may possible thanks lot. 
have another question about the reopened and this about account too. 
deposit adresses above the adresses can read this text mix all coins which ever touch silk road. 
without mixing you are completely vulnerable blockchain analysis and the potential disclosure your identity. 
have basic internal mixing implemented but silk road ever compromised you will not safe. 
not rely one single point failure strongly recommend that you use bitcoin mixing service. 
you are unfamiliar with mixing services encourage you browse silk roads community forums for. 
what mean this dont know nothing about that really payment method what somebody can explain this and how works use put secure way bitcoins think that something like that another way but wanna know what and required place orders and pay with bitcoins safely how works like said. 
another thing please tell too. 
its important information know. 
wow thanks that was great post would never thought that ever have amount coin that would worth stealing ill this lol. 
good stuff you should very weary cruising the darknet what essentially homing device. 
new all this encryption business and need tips learn bit. 
managed create pgp key alright but when using safe mail cant find option encrypt decrypt with that. 
also tried set thunderbird with safe mail but just tells there problem with eithermy password username both are correct. 
are there any other options for use pgp encryption want things get rolling but safe way purchace some lucy. 
its been long time and really miss her. 
thanks for any help. 
roh and use ubuntu linux that makes easier help. 
and how does one encrypt here tmg. 
cant believe anyone actually putting money into the site. 
the net closing and soon the proof gets undenailble for even silk road fanboys the admins will just shut shop and run for the hill with whatever money tied the site the time. 
deepdotweb have relegated the scam list. 
respected bitcoin engineers have called scam. 
least darkmarket community agrees its scamwhy does the hub continue infer legitimacy obvious conjob keeping the subforum especially since you claim you are trying shake the stink off yourselves.

here are many details the attack can provide. 
still investigating and not want leak anything which could compromise any other markets. 
transparency this issue key however you deserve granular explanation possible why this happened. 
attack investigation results feb. 
when withdrawal delays were happening last month wrote custom bitcoin implementation using several available libraries reference and built shared infrastructure load balance across accounts and provide risk mitigation ever one server was compromised. 
this implementation was being written behind the scenes dev staff lynch mob was getting exponentially worse the forums. 
our moderator staff became more and more insistent that was crucial fix this problem immediately relaying many concerns and threats from the community. 
cut corner deciding watch transactions. 
many community members were reporting missing withdrawals weeks after sending them. 
implemented liberal check the refresh deposit balances link the account page essence allowed search deeply for any missing coins rescanning and rescanning. 
one our team members was familiar with mtgoxs procedures and source code and vouched for the idea. 
our thoughts were that the largest bitcoin exchange was using this approach find missing coins must commonplace. 
received her his permission publish this. 
the transaction malleability bug was published last week time when was disconnected from the internet for extended period for opsec reasons. 
did not become aware the threat until the attack was already occurring. 
this was failure part trust more staff with critical access stop withdrawals. 
the people who did have access disable withdrawals were terrified doing without permission due how negatively the community reacts when withdrawals are turned off. 
they knew they disabled withdrawals then enabled them there would run the bank and would need online deposit cold storage into hot storage. 
effect this was failure emphasize staff that always okay lean the side caution and hit killswitches they deem necessary. 
was also failure communicate expectations the community that sometimes killswitches will have hit and just means were playing safe. 
this month clear did not play safe. 
killswitches are pointless the only person confident enough hit them the boss. 
the attacker used account first registered early jan try exploiting the vulnerability. 
looking back the accounts history indicates that this account has been used pentest many aspects our system unsuccessfully. 
every previous attempt find attack vector failed due hardening done our penetration testing team. 
had previously seen these attempts the logs something celebrate look our hardening working this hacker would have won but put security over features several people suggested disabling the hackers accounts but that pointless our business anyone can simply register. 
are still unclear the exact approach used cause our servers perception transactions mismatch with reality because have largely been focusing preparing for relaunch and building communication share with you the community over the past day. 
the best our understanding the attacker deposited increasingly larger amounts bitcoins and withdrew them while flooding the blockchain with ddos similar transactions. 
our system reflected his withdrawals and his account showed zero. 
the attacker rapidly clicked refresh deposits link until our code assumed that the transaction failed all indications point malleability the root case. 
our system credited his account with the btc judged unsuccessfully withdrawn. 
this again due the liberal rescanning mechanisms added last month see point. 
reality our servers perceived the transactions inaccurately and the btc were successfully withdrawn. 
result our system inaccurately represented the users balance larger than truly was. 
this allowed the attacker withdraw coins again. 
the attacker began depositing larger amounts such btc time order exploit the vulnerability quickly. 
they then drained our entire hot storage one bitcoin server shard and tried the attack from one their other accounts. 
the other account was different shard and allowed that hot storage drained. 
the attacker continued using different accounts until virtually all our hot storage shards were drained. 
due the type vulnerability our accounting system had inaccurate perception bitcoins hand and therefore did not trigger any alerts until real user withdrawals began failing unexpectedly. 
this was failure our part build new server alert check each shard the new shared bitcoin infrastructure and another symptom how rushed were when implementing the new system during forum lynch mob about slow withdrawals. 
lessons learned far. 
more staff should have access killswitches and should not afraid use them. 
even its just because some news post about clearnet about some transaction malleability thing. 
killswitches should used liberally and regularly. 
community needs comfortable with regular downtime especially during periods when community safety and the safety its money could threatened. 
good staff will responsibly paranoid and hitting killswitches they deem necessary and should not afraid their community panicking each time precaution exercised. 
there more web security than rigorous penetration testing. 
also requires the constant review external services systems and. 
never make assumptions when implementing protocols you did not design. 
had not trusted mtgoxs staff procedures would have reviewed our approaches with much more rigor. 
just because large companys procedures are successful does not make them are safe. 
accept that your community will hate you regardless. 
the darknet you will crucified your community anything ever goes wrong. 
prepare for everyone hate you because you inevitably will fail something and you will need stay determined matter what. 
dont let get your head and dont let affect your rigor with security. 
cut corners with our deposit withdrawal speed optimizations because were afraid the lynch mob. 
were foolish this regard. 
should have taken the entire site offline for long took implement high volume fault tolerant bitcoin server well tested rigorous manner. 
this cost unspeakable amount trust that had slaved build some for years. 
this where were with much transparency this medium allows the worst that could happen did not happen. 
the worst thing that could happen for our communitys finances however did. 
hate that occurred under our watch. 
there nothing can change this. 
all can transparent about where are and move forward. 
those who will respond here for dramatic effect please consider contributing your energy the reconstruction our community. 
you cannot bring yourself this then please take your negativity elsewhere. 
you have lost faith silk road dont blame you the least. 
also not want read about perpetuity. 
trolling during disaster cowardice. 
choosing strengthen rather than troll when trolling the popular move thats noble.

life not danger though and identity still protected thankful for this. 
now time share with you our plan move forward. 
realize you have way knowing whether telling the truth anything. 
trying communicate the authenticity true character the darknet difficult say the least and not expect any you take word.

silk road not deadwe are here stay and for the most part believe our values are the same yours the community. 
and even though represent the latest idiot make security mistake unlike those who simply give and determined use lessons learned fight for this communitys long term security. 
focusing multi signature transactions our only safe trading mechanism long term. 
additionally ready and willing collaborate with other darknet administrators and utilize our talented penetration testing team help them regularly audit their security.

put that way isnt nonsensical. 
from chemcat february amsr not scam there need cyber mark such. 
weve been through alot and will persevere get through this just fine hugs you all chemcat until proof provided that all the coins have been repaid and plausable explanation given why support was available for months and how the coins actually disappeared.

the net closing and soon the proof gets undenailble for even silk road fanboys the admins will just shut shop and run for the hill with whatever money tied the site the time. 
after reading that cnn article remembered people reporting odd withdrawals before the site went down. 
what was odd the coins were being withdrawn before there were any confirmations blockchain. 
order for this happen the attacker would need the users private keys. 
remember has static deposit addresses. 
expert with bitcoins but wouldnt this suggest its inside job the very least the hacker has everyones private keys. 
centralized marketplaces are dead. 
this point the evolution deepweb marketplaces the only logical next step. 
many kudos sites such this that are beginning move this direction applaud you. 
there better example proving why multisig important than the recent events silk road. 
our community would million whatever the new number people are tossing about richer wouldve adopted this technology earlier. 
one the most important elements decentralized market way make safe simple trustless transactions. 
previously this technology was rather difficult for your average user wrap their head around requiring using command line create and handle these transactions. 
fortunately for the demand there and simplified web uis are now popping make this process significantly easier. 
what multisig long story short its way eliminate having one centralized wallet holding all the coins while still maintaining the benefits third party arbitrating. 
the huge advantage comparison the escrow were all used that the arbitrator cannot single handedly decide the fate the coins making situations like what happened not only the hackers but also shutdown impossible. 
multiple parties hold the keys the transaction and without coming agreement the coins cant moved read seized stolen. 
heres simplified example how transaction which would the most suitable for our purposes would work site like bitrated. 
this would differ slightly other sites but the basic premise remains the same. 
seller creates transaction and sends the link buyer the stipulations what occur should there dispute. 
buyer accepts transaction and then both parties are presented the multisignature transaction page. 
buyer deposits bitcoins the address generated where the coins are held until two the three involved buyer seller and arbitrator sign their private key. 
basically the arbitrator just tie breaker should the buyer seller not able come agreement who gets the money. 
this point you can also deifne what portion goes what addresses its agreement that isnt refund the arbitrator has fees for disputes feature only available bitrated. 
buyer satisfied they sign the transaction. 
their sig alongside the sellers releases the funds the seller. 
buyer unsatisfied dispute made and sent the arbitrator who makes the final decision based evidence provided and the agreed upon terms linked the transaction. 
where start there are currently two websites ive found which offer simplified service which doesnt require using console command line. 
unfortunately neither them are ideal for our purposes yet but undoubtedly the very near future there will more advances the technology namely multisig being built into the gui popular wallet services. 
ill compare contrast the two below and you know others please let know bitrated. 
com the most full featured multisig site clear easy follow instructions and fairly comprehensive documentation. 
there clear text field for seller list the terms before sending buyer. 
arbitrator not needed any way should transaction not into dispute. 
buyer seller are given url containing their public key which all that needs held onto complete the transaction. 
supports client side key generation. 
arbitrators have username which they can easily link buyers sellers and either can begin the transaction. 
the future this username will have trust ratings similar lbtc. 
both buyer and seller must online simultaneously initiate the transaction. 
this far the biggest issue and werent for this there would reason use the other services. 
using this arbitrator who has set account using client side public key instead private key generated the website big security issue when conducting the transaction over tor. 
lacks end end encryption during the initiation step when data must sent between users. 
see bug report. 
com shesek bitrated issues coinb. 
multisig supports client side key generation. 
allows types multisig other than cant see many situations this would helpful for though. 
buyer seller not need online simultaneously. 
any the parties involved can create the transaction. 
barebones need for arbitrator users start account. 
not very user friendly and very little support documentation. 
support for sending percentages transactions without creating multiple receiving addresses and complicating the matter the process. 
what propose multisig club similar fashion pines legendary pgp club. 
due the numerous options available and need for coordination will have work out separate system for doing test transactions each site. 
currently going over the possible methods for organizing this. 
for the time being just looking see who would interested tossing few bitcents back and fourth well get some discussion going about the current future options for multisig. 
would prefer arbitrate transactions myself but can also act the buyer seller simultanously get better feel for how both sides these systems work. 
welcome the club. 
services like bitcoinfog mix your coins with other coins. 
you see btc has trail speak the blockchain. 
and you want fog this trail much possible just case. 
you dont want buy btc with your bank account and end linking you too. 
used have mixing service when your coins were deposited but longer does.

only two scenarios exist says andreas antonopoulos engineer bitcoin wallet service blockchain silk roads leaders were fooled into emptying all their accounts willingly they simply swindled their customers themselves. 
member posts karma view profilei have opinion either way but couple weeks before the hack seemed like this place was falling apart and its future uncertain. 
whoever stole the coins would have waited they thought they could get more coins later date. 
from northwest nuggets february amits possible that hack some other type robbery did happen but happened while ago. 
have suspected for some time that didnt have all the bitcoins that were supposedly peoples wallets and were using these bugs borrow money from vendors when deposits were not enough fund the withdrawls. 
now that people are losing faith and leaving the site deposits are much less than withdrawls and vendors are requiring customers finalize early they cant borrow the money anymore. 
posted this another thread this subject but belongs here too. 
have proof that scam now. 
have the testimony bitcoin expert. 
only two scenarios exist says andreas antonopoulos engineer bitcoin wallet service blockchain silk roads leaders were fooled into emptying all their accounts willingly they simply swindled their customers themselves. 
usually just call scam and wait for the market prove otherwise but this time have the testimony expert witness that this scam. 
until can produce more qualified expert contradict. 
antonopoulos then think now for label this latest event scam least until get that contradictory expert testimony. 
know the basics. 
mtgox got hacked had some issue dont give crap about the conspiracy theorys and have now shut down withdrawls. 
what would like know what are the chances they will actually allow withdrawls and when also side question would good idea buy btc with usd right now gox for the hopes they will reopen withdrawls make some easy cash. 
never trusted gox from day. 
they are shifty just like the teenagers than ran bitinstant. 
understand that they have made some soft announcements that they plan giving people their money sometime and the link cwb gave their metric shit ton speculation. 
not trust gox all but putting usd make profit this point would simply gamble like any other. 
and personally think they will give the money back. 
just based how catastrophic would they didnt. 
and the fact they have claimed have all the coins. 
and not giving them back this point would make them look very very bad. 
have account pending verification. 
from pothead february pmstay away even for bitcoin bought there isnt worth. 
gox offers bitcoin and pants. 
good stuff you should very weary cruising the darknet what essentially homing device. 
does anyone know these people are legit has anyone bought from them emailed them about product and they gave link their stocklist. 
that was couple days ago. 
now their website down. 
emailing them about buying product and asked them about the website and they said that the server the website was hosted was hacked and wiped. 
should trust them could their email compromised too. 
says cwb voted for obama. 
from xsposer february pmthis sounds just like what the sheep market admin did for all their vocal forum members before they stole everything. 
just ask jack hoff backed sheep market until the very last day. 
why because unlike everyone else they let him withdraw limited amount funds would publicly called any scam talk. 
does this post sound familiar almost believed that everybody else was making all about not getting withdrawls because trusted jack and would say just withdrew every time somebody would say their withdrawls were not working. 
mean just imagine the consequences for the community market allowed take your money and that isnt called scam even the face evidence that would stand court like the testimony expert witness. 
this means that market can just take our money any time they want and even have evidence will just keep right using. 
from tyrone february. 
incompetent fools unable protect user funds. 
ill prefix what about say with hate sounding like defending. 
trying get provoke more than half thought out you people. 
you call them incompetent fools unable protect user funds you are calling lot site owners this. 
ulbricht the people who ran bitmit and even backopy who ran what lot people call the best run marketplace history. 
dont see your market that impenetrable fortress. 
wheres know probably bunch thieving cunts and all the shit talk deserved but little bit wisdom that learned over the years iswhat matters more than being correct the thought process leading the correct conclusion flawed not. 
its flawed then you are wrong even though you accidentally came the correct conclusion. 
dont fight with people the internet thats gay but enjoy honest conversation even have opposing opinions. 
from what see the reason you said they were hacked was because they were too incompetent secure the funds. 
you dont want offer option where they are not assholes. 
and course sound argument shouldnt offer such option. 
there lot marketplaces that have been hacked despite the admins intentions technical knowledge security capabilities. 
the fact the matter its really freakin hard completely secure million dollars worth coins that are sitting one spot the internet. 
either evey market admin date incompetent impossible nearly impossible secure bitcoins the darknet. 
which option sounds more true. 
follow your analogy different doctors preform lobotomys and them kill the patient. 
the doctor incompetent opinion the matter. 
super gay begin with. 
this point they either pay people back dont. 
few months can decide they are scammers not. 
know how angry people get when their money lost but claiming they are lying nothing more than claim right now. 
wouldnt the first time market was hacked. 
all that being said dont like. 
dont think anyone should use. 
its place for children get high. 
you are child and what get high the road. 
there are better places. 
well they deserve chance respond the blockchain guy but they dont come with expert that contradicts him pretty soon then should labelled scam. 
this market were called sheep instead silk road then would have called scam days ago. 
now that have bitcoin expert saying that has some type scam they must contradict this with their own expert labelled scam. 
agree with you nuggets. 
wallet was emptied. 
had nothing escrow and two finalized orders. 
not feel wallet safe all. 
not feel any market wallet safe. 
wish could tell people that safe. 
but lets realistic. 
know all have choice and hopefully understand the risks and right now they seem like pretty fin great risks. 
from evilgrin february pmi have account pending verification. 
their track record actually following through and verifying account holders even though theyve had relevant documents pretty poor and suspect that right now their customer service people are probably focussed other things. 
would strongly recommend you nothing till your account verified you youll doubling your risk. 
from evilgrin february pmand personally think they will give the money back. 
just based how catastrophic would they didnt. 
and the fact they have claimed have all the coins. 
and not giving them back this point would make them look very very bad. 
theyve been making themselves look bad regular basis for long ive been into bitcoin you think any that bothers mark karpeles hes got track record for saying fuck you you dont like his customers why should this situation any different. 
from evilgrin february pmwhat would like know what are the chances they will actually allow withdrawls and when also side question would good idea buy btc with usd right now gox for the hopes they will reopen withdrawls make some easy cash the only thing have are goxs statements now and goxs track record the past. 
their track record appalling theyve fucked too many times for many people trust them. 
their statements far this latest crisis reveal nothing other than their incompetence technology and. 
will they open btc withdrawals again your guess good mine this ultimately depends whether business solvent. 
have they been scammed hacked are they turn scamming theres alot speculation that gox management and close friends are buying hundreds cheap btc from gox customers transferring them other exchanges and selling rinse repeat make millions dollars. 
you have usd already gox theres some speculation that holding fiat gox better than holding btc they are indeed insolvent. 
japans laws around insolvency are very strict and gox management are riesking criminal sanctions they fuck around too badly. 
youre thinking transferring usd into gox dont unless youve got account theyve already verified with photo utility bills etc because youll never able get anything back otherwise. 
you already have verified account then all means transfer some cash. 
you could make your money more you are able transfer the btc out another exchange some point the future. 
you could lose all turns out gox insolvent scammed hacked scamming. 
how much you trust gox keep eye. 
com this virtual market for goxbux and goxcoin and tells what the market thinks. 
true dirty harry style you feel lucky punk. 
there just started using agora. 
havent ordered but have deposited tiny amount btc just test. 
ive been looking agoras forum and there are several complaints about deposits not showing one person even complaining that looked the blockchain and saw his deposit his agora wallet sent another address internal tumbling but never showing his agora wallet. 
addition these people are complaining zero response from agora support. 
anyone had any similar experiences edit not trying diss agora actually looks like very well run marketplace just exercising due diligence before jump and make purchase. 
from chemcat february amsr not scam there need cyber mark such. 
weve been through alot and will persevere get through this just fine hugs you all chemcat until proof provided that all the coins have been repaid and plausable explanation given why support was available for months and how the coins actually disappeared. 
will forever known scam honeypot site. 
should avoided like the plague danger danger will robinson. 
from trolltergeist february amsr will consistently rape there customer base. 
all know was not hacked. 
most know and some just not want believe. 
doesnt matter who took what this point. 
its how much trust someone willing put into what being said admins. 
and fuck that isnt totally personal interpretation but ive learned most the new members are not too good interpreting things. 
thats only accurate for one type standarized transaction. 
you can assign outputs all sorts different things that dont just require proof ownership private key whose public keys hash corresponds certain value. 
course good luck getting your wierdo transaction into the blockchain. 
from pothead february pmsite should closed until coins are repaidhahah yeah right. 
basically the site should closed forever. 
the coins will never repaid. 
all know that. 
not and never will safe. 
not ever again and never really was. 
stay away from the forums.

dont deny that cannot code site. 
but let put different way. 
let say there doctor let call him doctor death there have been many these many countries and criticize this fellow for the high body count his patients. 
you retort that havent performed any brain surgery. 
then you tell come back when perform successful lobotomy. 
put that way isnt nonsensical. 
not calling scam scam not neutrality. 
look folks there are only options when comes whether you think that stole money from users not. 
incompetent fools unable protect user funds. 
the right thing would encourage buyers and sellers utilize other more deserving markets. 
has the least credibility out any market currently business. 
new all this encryption business and need tips learn bit. 
managed create pgp key alright but when using safe mail can't find option encrypt decrypt with that. 
also tried set thunderbird with safe mail but just tells there problem with eithermy password username both are correct. 
are there any other options for use pgp encryption want things get rolling but safe way purchace some lucy. 
it's been long time and really miss her. 
thanks for any help. 
roh and use ubuntu linux that makes easier help. 
and how does one encrypt here tmg. 
thanks for posting this. 
hello all glad here. 
interested genuine lsd have done only once and wasn't too strong dose enough though enable talk telepathically friends who took with got plenty cev and felt great also bit cheated because felt that something wonderful had been hidden from due legislation. 
had this weird red light trail following fingers next day. 
also once tried mushrooms similar experience not too strong. 
haven't been doing psychedelics too often and was decades ago what dosage you recommend might have trip alone massive doses are out question. 
all dope friends are grown ups with families and businesses etc. 
just alone exploring. 
general psychological health good and strong i'm not scared strong doses either. 
how accurate are the dosage descriptions when someone sells micrograms really that much less know this place has reviewed sellers how strongly could trust i'm not getting some order lucy for purity and genuiness uttermost importance might introduce lsd friend later and definitely want her first real lsd experience. 
she can then decide herself she wants. 
also does safe mail work with pgp i'm bit clueless with pgp but understand the basic principle. 
also have access bitcoin automat where just put cash and scan the code paperwallet. 
after that not know how pay for example need online wallet too sorry for daft questions please just point thread these have been covered already. 
cand customs dogs sniff lsd only asking saw cops style program where the dog marked letter and they tested lab was some blotter. 
plan use thunderbird with pgp and safe mail address this also i'm interested mushrooms and would like get hint dosage guidelines for both shrooms and lsd chill out dosage for both and real ego death dosage. 
can these used after each other let's say week apart once month what thanks. 
very glad see some like minded folks around here. 
i'm currently organizing multisig club similar pine's legendary pgp club and urge anyone who'd like toss few bitcents back and forth swing the security section and chime. 
centralized marketplaces are dead. 
this point the evolution deepweb marketplaces the only logical next step. 
many kudos sites such this that are beginning move this direction applaud you. 
there better example proving why multisig important than the recent events silk road. 
our community would million whatever the new number people are tossing about richer would've adopted this technology earlier. 
one the most important elements decentralized market way make safe simple trustless transactions. 
previously this technology was rather difficult for your average user wrap their head around requiring using command line create and handle these transactions. 
fortunately for the demand there and simplified web uis are now popping make this process significantly easier. 
what multisig long story short it's way eliminate having one centralized wallet holding all the coins while still maintaining the benefits third party arbitrating. 
the huge advantage comparison the escrow we're all used that the arbitrator cannot single handedly decide the fate the coins making situations like what happened not only the hackers but also shutdown impossible. 
multiple parties hold the keys the transaction and without coming agreement the coins can't moved read seized stolen. 
here's simplified example how transaction which would the most suitable for our purposes would work site like bitrated. 
this would differ slightly other sites but the basic premise remains the same. 
seller creates transaction and sends the link buyer the stipulations what occur should there dispute. 
buyer accepts transaction and then both parties are presented the multisignature transaction page. 
buyer deposits bitcoins the address generated where the coins are held until two the three involved buyer seller and arbitrator sign their private key. 
basically the arbitrator just tie breaker should the buyer seller not able come agreement who gets the money. 
this point you can also deifne what portion goes what addresses it's agreement that isn't refund the arbitrator has fees for disputes feature only available bitrated. 
buyer satisfied they sign the transaction. 
their sig alongside the seller's releases the funds the seller. 
buyer unsatisfied dispute made and sent the arbitrator who makes the final decision based evidence provided and the agreed upon terms linked the transaction. 
where start there are currently two websites i've found which offer simplified service which doesn't require using console command line. 
unfortunately neither them are ideal for our purposes yet but undoubtedly the very near future there will more advances the technology namely multisig being built into the gui popular wallet services. 
i'll compare contrast the two below and you know others please let know bitrated. 
com the most full featured multisig site clear easy follow instructions and fairly comprehensive documentation. 
there clear text field for seller list the terms before sending buyer. 
arbitrator not needed any way should transaction not into dispute. 
buyer seller are given url containing their public key which all that needs held onto complete the transaction. 
supports client side key generation. 
arbitrators have username which they can easily link buyers sellers and either can begin the transaction. 
the future this username will have trust ratings similar lbtc. 
both buyer and seller must online simultaneously initiate the transaction. 
this far the biggest issue and weren't for this there would reason use the other services. 
using this arbitrator who has set account using client side public key instead private key generated the website big security issue when conducting the transaction over tor. 
lacks end end encryption during the initiation step when data must sent between users. 
see bug report. 
com shesek bitrated issues coinb. 
multisig supports client side key generation. 
allows types multisig other than can't see many situations this would helpful for though. 
buyer seller not need online simultaneously. 
any the parties involved can create the transaction. 
barebones need for arbitrator users start account. 
not very user friendly and very little support documentation. 
support for sending percentages transactions without creating multiple receiving addresses and complicating the matter the process. 
what propose multisig club similar fashion pine's legendary pgp club. 
due the numerous options available and need for coordination will have work out separate system for doing test transactions each site. 
i'm currently going over the possible methods for organizing this. 
for the time being i'm just looking see who would interested tossing few bitcents back and fourth well get some discussion going about the current future options for multisig. 
would prefer arbitrate transactions myself but can also act the buyer seller simultanously get better feel for how both sides these systems work. 
welcome the club. 
not bothing with this anymore. 
upon reading android wont enough. 
good stuff you should very weary cruising the darknet what essentially homing device. 
you can put coins into and make order but theres esrcow only use vendors you really trust. 
think there could explanations about the stolen bitcoins. 
the staff stole everything. 
but that case why they pay off people and even they dont pay off everybody that would too many efforts for few profits. 
personally dont think they stole the users. 
has been hacked but the staff too proud admit public they told everyone that the market was very secure. 
maybe thats why they invented that story narco and the btc malleability. 
dont say that have the truth. 
think its hilarious cnn finds important enough make article itjust makes want troll even more knowing cnn watchingthis must what miley cyrus feels like. 
you can put coins into and make order but theres esrcow only use vendors you really trust. 
from cuntdowntoban february amwhat does everyone think about temporary shutdown for like week two month something like that. 
market without support bottomless pit for you throw you bitcoins down. 
any other ideas for improvements welcome. 
feb how did know lol spam removed. 
from defcon february. 
live very busy and complicated life. 
take opsec extreme levels which consume many hours per day. 
any time you see here means have completed checklist which requires over hour preparation for reposition and reconfigure many things ensure leave the most minimal trail possible and can safely connect this place. 
this job will never safe and impossible perfectly covert. 
know what facing both from and from vendors who not share opinions non violence. 
all released announcements were true plans and all delays were due unanticipated external factors upon which cannot elaborate. 
staff has been very frustrated lack ability keep the dev team time. 
again this completely fault and something for which take complete responsibility. 
not trust any developers meticulously review anything the dev team sends. 
many have criticized for this and listened them. 
had reviewed the code even more meticulously and delayed the fix speed slow withdrawals last month transaction malleability would not have affected all. 
this completely fault for listening critics instead own sense caution. 
the public has known that auto finalize has been disabled for long time and has known that the escrow balance massive. 
any smart person could deduce that enabling auto finalize requires move vast sum from cold storage the hot storage wallet ensure adequate fund availability which admittedly was too large and one biggest failures this month. 
the attack was surgical and timed perfectly. 
the reason such high quantity coins was stolen was because were preparing implement auto finalization and had therefore moved huge volume from the cold storage the hot storage ensure the coins from all auto finalized orders could withdrawn without hitch. 
here are many details the attack can provide. 
still investigating and not want leak anything which could compromise any other markets. 
transparency this issue key however you deserve granular explanation possible why this happened. 
attack investigation results feb. 
when withdrawal delays were happening last month wrote custom bitcoin implementation using several available libraries reference and built shared infrastructure load balance across accounts and provide risk mitigation ever one server was compromised. 
this implementation was being written behind the scenes dev staff lynch mob was getting exponentially worse the forums. 
our moderator staff became more and more insistent that was crucial fix this problem immediately relaying many concerns and threats from the community. 
cut corner deciding watch transactions. 
many community members were reporting missing withdrawals weeks after sending them. 
implemented liberal check the refresh deposit balances link the account page essence allowed search deeply for any missing coins rescanning and rescanning. 
one our team members was familiar with mtgoxs procedures and source code and vouched for the idea. 
our thoughts were that the largest bitcoin exchange was using this approach find missing coins must commonplace. 
received her his permission publish this. 
the transaction malleability bug was published last week time when was disconnected from the internet for extended period for opsec reasons. 
did not become aware the threat until the attack was already occurring. 
this was failure part trust more staff with critical access stop withdrawals. 
the people who did have access disable withdrawals were terrified doing without permission due how negatively the community reacts when withdrawals are turned off. 
they knew they disabled withdrawals then enabled them there would run the bank and would need online deposit cold storage into hot storage. 
effect this was failure emphasize staff that always okay lean the side caution and hit killswitches they deem necessary. 
was also failure communicate expectations the community that sometimes killswitches will have hit and just means were playing safe. 
this month clear did not play safe. 
killswitches are pointless the only person confident enough hit them the boss. 
the attacker used account first registered early jan try exploiting the vulnerability. 
looking back the accounts history indicates that this account has been used pentest many aspects our system unsuccessfully. 
every previous attempt find attack vector failed due hardening done our penetration testing team. 
had previously seen these attempts the logs something celebrate look our hardening working this hacker would have won but put security over features several people suggested disabling the hackers accounts but that pointless our business anyone can simply register. 
are still unclear the exact approach used cause our servers perception transactions mismatch with reality because have largely been focusing preparing for relaunch and building communication share with you the community over the past day. 
the best our understanding the attacker deposited increasingly larger amounts bitcoins and withdrew them while flooding the blockchain with ddos similar transactions. 
our system reflected his withdrawals and his account showed zero. 
the attacker rapidly clicked refresh deposits link until our code assumed that the transaction failed all indications point malleability the root case. 
our system credited his account with the btc judged unsuccessfully withdrawn. 
this again due the liberal rescanning mechanisms added last month see point. 
reality our servers perceived the transactions inaccurately and the btc were successfully withdrawn. 
result our system inaccurately represented the users balance larger than truly was. 
this allowed the attacker withdraw coins again. 
the attacker began depositing larger amounts such btc time order exploit the vulnerability quickly. 
they then drained our entire hot storage one bitcoin server shard and tried the attack from one their other accounts. 
the other account was different shard and allowed that hot storage drained. 
the attacker continued using different accounts until virtually all our hot storage shards were drained. 
due the type vulnerability our accounting system had inaccurate perception bitcoins hand and therefore did not trigger any alerts until real user withdrawals began failing unexpectedly. 
this was failure our part build new server alert check each shard the new shared bitcoin infrastructure and another symptom how rushed were when implementing the new system during forum lynch mob about slow withdrawals. 
lessons learned far. 
more staff should have access killswitches and should not afraid use them. 
even its just because some news post about clearnet about some transaction malleability thing. 
killswitches should used liberally and regularly. 
community needs comfortable with regular downtime especially during periods when community safety and the safety its money could threatened. 
good staff will responsibly paranoid and hitting killswitches they deem necessary and should not afraid their community panicking each time precaution exercised. 
there more web security than rigorous penetration testing. 
also requires the constant review external services systems and. 
never make assumptions when implementing protocols you did not design. 
had not trusted mtgoxs staff procedures would have reviewed our approaches with much more rigor. 
just because large companys procedures are successful does not make them are safe. 
accept that your community will hate you regardless. 
the darknet you will crucified your community anything ever goes wrong. 
prepare for everyone hate you because you inevitably will fail something and you will need stay determined matter what. 
dont let get your head and dont let affect your rigor with security. 
cut corners with our deposit withdrawal speed optimizations because were afraid the lynch mob. 
were foolish this regard. 
should have taken the entire site offline for long took implement high volume fault tolerant bitcoin server well tested rigorous manner. 
this cost unspeakable amount trust that had slaved build some for years. 
this where were with much transparency this medium allows the worst that could happen did not happen. 
the worst thing that could happen for our communitys finances however did. 
hate that occurred under our watch. 
there nothing can change this. 
all can transparent about where are and move forward. 
those who will respond here for dramatic effect please consider contributing your energy the reconstruction our community. 
you cannot bring yourself this then please take your negativity elsewhere. 
you have lost faith silk road dont blame you the least. 
also not want read about perpetuity. 
trolling during disaster cowardice. 
choosing strengthen rather than troll when trolling the popular move thats noble. 
know that speak for all silk road staff seen and unseen when speak these words are going nowhere. 
will remain rebuild and move forward toward the greater goal for which strive our running this marketplace personal freedom and foundational human rights. 
silk road will always rise again. 
code select begin pgp signed message hash sha deeply thankful for the hundreds supportive messages ive received. 
consistently blown away how the core this community come together times strife. 
the multitude you who lost faith silk road still glad ive heard your words. 
still devastated that have failed you. 
and even have fallen victim this attack the majority personal earnings are completely gone. 
life not danger though and identity still protected thankful for this. 
now time share with you our plan move forward. 
realize you have way knowing whether telling the truth anything. 
trying communicate the authenticity true character the darknet difficult say the least and not expect any you take word. 
but actions over the next few weeks will speak louder than words ever could and you stick around you realize this. 
silk road not deadwe are here stay and for the most part believe our values are the same yours the community. 
and even though represent the latest idiot make security mistake unlike those who simply give and determined use lessons learned fight for this communitys long term security. 
focusing multi signature transactions our only safe trading mechanism long term. 
additionally ready and willing collaborate with other darknet administrators and utilize our talented penetration testing team help them regularly audit their security. 
and although the tinfoil club will probably hate this and continue tear shreds without regard for actions december and whether you choose believe them not here are the facts.

from evilgrin february pmwhat would like know what are the chances they will actually allow withdrawls and when also side question would good idea buy btc with usd right now gox for the hopes they will reopen withdrawls make some easy cash the only thing have are goxs statements now and goxs track record the past. 
their track record appalling theyve fucked too many times for many people trust them. 
their statements far this latest crisis reveal nothing other than their incompetence technology and. 
will they open btc withdrawals again your guess good mine this ultimately depends whether business solvent. 
have they been scammed hacked are they turn scamming theres alot speculation that gox management and close friends are buying hundreds cheap btc from gox customers transferring them other exchanges and selling rinse repeat make millions dollars. 
you have usd already gox theres some speculation that holding fiat gox better than holding btc they are indeed insolvent. 
japans laws around insolvency are very strict and gox management are riesking criminal sanctions they fuck around too badly. 
youre thinking transferring usd into gox dont unless youve got account theyve already verified with photo utility bills etc because youll never able get anything back otherwise. 
you already have verified account then all means transfer some cash. 
you could make your money more you are able transfer the btc out another exchange some point the future. 
you could lose all turns out gox insolvent scammed hacked scamming. 
how much you trust gox keep eye. 
com this virtual market for goxbux and goxcoin and tells what the market thinks. 
true dirty harry style you feel lucky punk. 
there just started using agora. 
havent ordered but have deposited tiny amount btc just test. 
ive been looking agoras forum and there are several complaints about deposits not showing one person even complaining that looked the blockchain and saw his deposit his agora wallet sent another address internal tumbling but never showing his agora wallet. 
addition these people are complaining zero response from agora support. 
anyone had any similar experiences edit not trying diss agora actually looks like very well run marketplace just exercising due diligence before jump and make purchase.

from evilgrin february amquote from morgan geist february amquote from evilgrin february amwell pretty sure bmr was the longest lasting marketplace. 
bmr older and ran longer than srwell there you. 
well dont know. 
that why asked the question. 
what they call when you answer question with question. 
what are the things the post office and dea look for decide what packages inspect closely billions packages and letters are sent every year they obviously cant inspect each one. 
they not have dogs sitting the conveyor belt which has mail. 
just doesnt work that way dogs get bored quickly when they dont detect what they are trained sniff for. 
plus the length time not enough for careful sniff. 
they look for certain things one those false return name and address. 
they have high speed scanners which can scan the and from address each piece mail. 
they have computers that will check against known addresses and can match the name associated with that address. 
this helps them avoid sending out mail and having send back when its misaddressed. 
but they can also spot false return. 
they wont investigate solely because that but red flag. 
other things they look for are strong odors coming from the package like coffee perfume etc. 
that usually used mask the odor drugs. 
they also look for hand written labels. 
one those things are enough but suspicious odor will usually make them look further and has false return they will then usually bring the dog and present the package along with some other packages see the dog alerts. 
does that probable cause get warrant. 
when send package always use real name and address from the phone book. 
print out the label hand written typed labels which they look for. 
the goods have carefully packaged and they have odor must put into mylar and well sealed. 
also dont handle the package when have handled product. 
dont ask anyone sign for the package they can use that against you though its not solid proof. 
they just drop your mailbox wait while before bringing. 
take walk and check out whats going the area before bringing. 
its not supposed signed for and they ask you sign refuse the package. 
its not supposed signed for but they knock the door and present you with the package that very very suspicious. 
obviously they knock and talk say nothing except deny you ordered anything. 
anyone have other tips. 
very good point mirage. 
would give you but dont have enough posts yet. 
change return addresses regularly and never back old ones. 
other tips make your letter package not stand out are not overly tape the outside the package. 
this another thing they look for. 
you can tape the inside and will not show. 
make sure the contents dont rattle shift around. 
sending powders put them inside multiple packaging resist penetration. 
postal employees have been known puncture package better sniff the contents. 
instead using dryer sheets other scented things mask the odor invest mylar packaging stop odor. 
another good thing use aluminum foil bags sealed with aluminum tape. 
there are many other things havent mentioned. 
for example use gloves when handling goods when packing and when mailing. 
alternative for using gloves when dropping your mail off put plastic bag wearing gloves and then they can slid from the bag directly into the blue box gloves needed that point. 
try not use the same box every time mix little. 
that particularly true you send out lot mail every day. 
tips for receiving mail. 
not order anything you have sign for. 
that makes too easy set controlled delivery. 
when you get your package let sit the mailbox for while before you take. 
dont such rush fact its good take little walk eyeball the neighborhood spot suspicious vehicles people loitering for obvious reason etc. 
after you get your mail let sit the door while unopened. 
they bang your door asking you got anything you didnt expect get say yes and hand over. 
its unopened makes you look innocent and adds support your statement that you didnt order. 
layout just horrible but seems legit far.

from mirage february amto cross post from post made couple months back the shipping forum attn vendors please read recycling return addys. 
php topic nearly years ago the old forums former vendor using different nym ranted times about the potential snail mail itself being tracked and the impact that could potentially have business model such ours and rants seemed times fall deaf ears. 
what first led consider this possibility were confirmations that alphabet soup had for over years been hiding from the public that they were tracking all license plates and the movements locations all cars washington. 
and other cities all times using network cameras positioned throughout the city. 
for example study government tracking movement every vehicle with license plate. 
com government tracking movement every vehicle with license plate and more importantly that the technology they were using was based tech the usps had developed and been using for many many years prior track mail. 
whether for surveillance purposes simply for proper delivery purposes irrelevant. 
they were using technology based what the usps had been using for years track unknowing citizens. 
and recent articles have since proven this theory correct that the nsa surveillance program includes tracking not only cell phone internet location and electronic communications metadata but usps snailmail well. 
postal service logging all mail for law enforcement. 
com monitoring snail mail. 
html pagewanted all report postal service uses spying programs similar nsa. 
com news report postal service uses spying programs similar nsa snail mail spy. 
postal service active partner with feds for surveillance. 
com news jul snail mail spy postal service active partner picture each side each and every envelope package sent thru usps taken the process its delivery the intended recipient. 
now have always said that all vendors should just assume that least one more their products was purchased the dea posing buyer. 
for obvious reasons hopefully collect fingerprint handwriting samples ect and the very least know which city county state said vendor shipping and most likely operating from. 
and now the dea has record least one return address said vendor used the process. 
common understanding that return addys should either besides being printed and not least always handwritten that use fake name fake home business type name with real address preferably from local apartment complex with the apartment unit omitted not get someone else who might friend ally trouble. 
use the name addy small local retail store which one could safely assume not likely involved illegal activities and using their name addy shouldnt unwittingly compromise anyones freedom. 
although the feds are well aware the majority vendors use fake return addy this has not always been the case the recent busts those vendors doctors the boston area believe prove. 
they used box registered using their real world credentials return address really regardless mistake truly hope never see repeated again. 
what getting opinion feel until long term trust has been built with specific customer vendor should always use brand new return address for each and every letter package they send out. 
yes this extra tedious time consuming process. 
but its nothing phone book the internet and osx program like snailmail wont make much easier accomplish. 
because remember assume least one your packages was indeed ordered the feds. 
and contained return address. 
return address that now flagged the usps system and the future could used track your packages used again identify your customers and even compromise your own safety allowing them narrow down the hopefully various multiple drops you use. 
and many articles referenced that the feds did indeed pose buyers collect such data before the fall. 
this now fact and beyond theory this point. 
and feel personally your responsibility vendor take this extra precaution until certain level trust has been built with individual customers which point you are free consider recycling return addresses were little bird told. 
the clich this site almost makes feel nausea. 
like the concept and feel the site.

from mirage february amto cross post from post made couple months back the shipping forum attn vendors please read recycling return addys. 
php topic nearly years ago the old forums former vendor using different nym ranted times about the potential snail mail itself being tracked and the impact that could potentially have business model such ours and rants seemed times fall deaf ears. 
what first led consider this possibility were confirmations that alphabet soup had for over years been hiding from the public that they were tracking all license plates and the movements locations all cars washington. 
and other cities all times using network cameras positioned throughout the city. 
for example study government tracking movement every vehicle with license plate. 
com government tracking movement every vehicle with license plate and more importantly that the technology they were using was based tech the usps had developed and been using for many many years prior track mail. 
whether for surveillance purposes simply for proper delivery purposes irrelevant. 
they were using technology based what the usps had been using for years track unknowing citizens. 
and recent articles have since proven this theory correct that the nsa surveillance program includes tracking not only cell phone internet location and electronic communications metadata but usps snailmail well. 
postal service logging all mail for law enforcement. 
com monitoring snail mail. 
html pagewanted all report postal service uses spying programs similar nsa. 
com news report postal service uses spying programs similar nsa snail mail spy. 
postal service active partner with feds for surveillance. 
com news jul snail mail spy postal service active partner picture each side each and every envelope package sent thru usps taken the process its delivery the intended recipient. 
now have always said that all vendors should just assume that least one more their products was purchased the dea posing buyer. 
for obvious reasons hopefully collect fingerprint handwriting samples ect and the very least know which city county state said vendor shipping and most likely operating from. 
and now the dea has record least one return address said vendor used the process. 
common understanding that return addys should either besides being printed and not least always handwritten that use fake name fake home business type name with real address preferably from local apartment complex with the apartment unit omitted not get someone else who might friend ally trouble. 
use the name addy small local retail store which one could safely assume not likely involved illegal activities and using their name addy shouldnt unwittingly compromise anyones freedom. 
although the feds are well aware the majority vendors use fake return addy this has not always been the case the recent busts those vendors doctors the boston area believe prove. 
they used box registered using their real world credentials return address really regardless mistake truly hope never see repeated again. 
what getting opinion feel until long term trust has been built with specific customer vendor should always use brand new return address for each and every letter package they send out. 
yes this extra tedious time consuming process. 
but its nothing phone book the internet and osx program like snailmail wont make much easier accomplish. 
because remember assume least one your packages was indeed ordered the feds. 
and contained return address. 
return address that now flagged the usps system and the future could used track your packages used again identify your customers and even compromise your own safety allowing them narrow down the hopefully various multiple drops you use. 
and many articles referenced that the feds did indeed pose buyers collect such data before the fall. 
this now fact and beyond theory this point. 
and feel personally your responsibility vendor take this extra precaution until certain level trust has been built with individual customers which point you are free consider recycling return addresses were little bird told.

and now the dea has record least one return address said vendor used the process. 
common understanding that return addys should either besides being printed and not least always handwritten that use fake name fake home business type name with real address preferably from local apartment complex with the apartment unit omitted not get someone else who might friend ally trouble. 
use the name addy small local retail store which one could safely assume not likely involved illegal activities and using their name addy shouldnt unwittingly compromise anyones freedom. 
although the feds are well aware the majority vendors use fake return addy this has not always been the case the recent busts those vendors doctors the boston area believe prove. 
they used box registered using their real world credentials return address really regardless mistake truly hope never see repeated again. 
what getting opinion feel until long term trust has been built with specific customer vendor should always use brand new return address for each and every letter package they send out. 
yes this extra tedious time consuming process. 
but its nothing phone book the internet and osx program like snailmail wont make much easier accomplish. 
because remember assume least one your packages was indeed ordered the feds. 
and contained return address. 
return address that now flagged the usps system and the future could used track your packages used again identify your customers and even compromise your own safety allowing them narrow down the hopefully various multiple drops you use.

please dont defend this not being scam unless you have better proof than the testimony the blockchain guy because then people will take their frustrations out you even more than they now. 
agreed couldi think large question mark until all funds have been returned. 
well dont know. 
that why asked the question. 
what they call when you answer question with question. 
layout just horrible but seems legit far. 
mostly because there escrow and you deal directly with the vendors depositing money onto their btc address. 
the past registered drugsnbets. 
you know have register new could login with old data. 
spam everyday and tried ass off its just not worth. 
ysas drg rlwv. 
onioni have idea how long will. 
been days since ive checked sure its like lord the flies now maybe deliverance. 
from verto february pmi wont surprised you end getting banned there also. 
over agora and theres like complaints. 
deposits always show within minutes. 
some problems take forever deal with cuz theyve grown exponentially the past few weeks. 
ive only had use customer service once and was dealt with few hours. 
but thats some people dont trust agora single market can support everybody agora pandora blue sky tba. 
theres room for all. 
havent been there because lost the url post again. 
have you seen the layout blackbank market very professional look and the marketplace offers multi sig escrow. 
havent had chance test the escrow system yet but looking forward. 
there are many other things havent mentioned. 
for example use gloves when handling goods when packing and when mailing. 
alternative for using gloves when dropping your mail off put plastic bag wearing gloves and then they can slid from the bag directly into the blue box gloves needed that point. 
try not use the same box every time mix little. 
that particularly true you send out lot mail every day. 
tips for receiving mail. 
not order anything you have sign for. 
that makes too easy set controlled delivery. 
when you get your package let sit the mailbox for while before you take. 
dont such rush fact its good take little walk eyeball the neighborhood spot suspicious vehicles people loitering for obvious reason etc. 
after you get your mail let sit the door while unopened. 
they bang your door asking you got anything you didnt expect get say yes and hand over. 
its unopened makes you look innocent and adds support your statement that you didnt order. 
very good point mirage. 
would give you but dont have enough posts yet. 
change return addresses regularly and never back old ones. 
other tips make your letter package not stand out are not overly tape the outside the package. 
this another thing they look for. 
you can tape the inside and will not show. 
make sure the contents dont rattle shift around. 
sending powders put them inside multiple packaging resist penetration. 
postal employees have been known puncture package better sniff the contents. 
instead using dryer sheets other scented things mask the odor invest mylar packaging stop odor. 
another good thing use aluminum foil bags sealed with aluminum tape. 
what are the things the post office and dea look for decide what packages inspect closely billions packages and letters are sent every year they obviously cant inspect each one. 
they not have dogs sitting the conveyor belt which has mail. 
just doesnt work that way dogs get bored quickly when they dont detect what they are trained sniff for. 
plus the length time not enough for careful sniff. 
they look for certain things one those false return name and address. 
they have high speed scanners which can scan the and from address each piece mail. 
they have computers that will check against known addresses and can match the name associated with that address. 
this helps them avoid sending out mail and having send back when its misaddressed. 
but they can also spot false return. 
they wont investigate solely because that but red flag. 
other things they look for are strong odors coming from the package like coffee perfume etc. 
that usually used mask the odor drugs. 
they also look for hand written labels. 
one those things are enough but suspicious odor will usually make them look further and has false return they will then usually bring the dog and present the package along with some other packages see the dog alerts. 
does that probable cause get warrant. 
when send package always use real name and address from the phone book. 
print out the label hand written typed labels which they look for. 
the goods have carefully packaged and they have odor must put into mylar and well sealed. 
also dont handle the package when have handled product. 
dont ask anyone sign for the package they can use that against you though its not solid proof. 
they just drop your mailbox wait while before bringing. 
take walk and check out whats going the area before bringing. 
its not supposed signed for and they ask you sign refuse the package. 
its not supposed signed for but they knock the door and present you with the package that very very suspicious. 
obviously they knock and talk say nothing except deny you ordered anything. 
anyone have other tips.

there are three huge problems with vps hosting for hidden services. 
its impossible completely isolate the server from the tor instance providing the hidden service. 
this means that the best youre going uid based iptables rule keep non tor traffic from exiting the box. 
quite few people arent even bright enough get this much right. 
when someone gets root the vps they can pull down the iptables rules and deanonymize the box second. 
hell ifconfig pretty much deanonymizes the box that point. 
the vps provider has complete level visibility into your box. 
they choose theres really nothing they cant see your environment. 
they can strace processes view memory take snapshots while your vps live etc. 
their ability directly read memory the worst part. 
they can scrape for crypto keys capture passwords etc. 
method amount encryption the vps can save you from this btw. 
when someone exploits the vps provider console management interface they have root your vps instance this one happens fairly often. 
someone exploits bug solusvm another vps provider management console and gets control over every vps box their environment. 
better solution rented dedicated server running xen another hypervisor and using the hypervisor isolate the server actually providing the http other service from the tor instance that advertises the. 
onion address servervm private virtual network torvm internet that scenario when someone pwns the servervm they cant deanonymize sending arbitrary traffic out. 
theyre stuck behind the torvm and can only send traffic via tor. 
deanonymize the servervm effectively they need exploit the hypervisor first. 
that architecture the torvm should only allowed send out the tor traffic. 
the hypervisor probably shouldnt even really public network except bridge traffic the torvm and damned sure shouldnt accept arbitrary traffic from the internet itself. 
the best solution physical isolation. 
the server would separate physical box from the tor instance connected only crossover cable. 
however that architecture difficult find rented anonymous environment. 
youre doing something that seriously annoys first world governments you probably have worry about hardware that scenario too once someone has access they can pull serial numbers mac addresses etc that may able identify the box via tracing the supply chain. 
few handy tips you have use vps. 
your http server should not answer requests clearnet its handling tor based requests from hidden. 
nothing good going come from that and million bad things will come from. 
your http service vps should only bound localhost never real. 
actually your vps shouldnt accepting any clearnet traffic aside from the tor traffic needs open function and your management traffic. 
you cant manage set iptables only allow traffic from the tor process via uid hosting hidden service not for you. 
dont give shit what benefit you think youre providing the world youre just putting yourself and everyone that connects your box risk. 
bandwidth consumption cpu memory and storage utilization are the three most visible pieces information that vps provider monitors. 
youre using enough cpu affect other vps users the provider stuck the overloaded and oversold vps hosting box someone will eventually come looking whats going. 
remember the provider can see your individual process details theyre going see that usr bin strange shit consuming all the cpu. 
and theyll wonder what that doing. 
safe depends what sort service. 
just how private are virtual private servers they are private everyone other than you and the vps provider who has full access. 
would the hosting company ever discover youre hosting tor hidden service and take down many providers allow tor hiddem services. 
would trivial matter find servers hosting hidden services. 
what are your opinions this you are depending the vps provider. 
you plan use vps. 
pay with bitcoin. 
connect only via tor. 
assume you mean contact the vps over clearnet for management purposes. 
hidden onion service for management ssh onioncat etc alternate connectivity method probably better idea than clearnet for management. 
personally wouldnt run private exit node because its going have directly touch clearnet and tor and identifiable the clearnet side. 
but you raise good point that should reiterated anyone reading this thread and deciding set hosted hidden service every interaction you have with the vps hosting provider has the possibility generating paths back the real you. 
payment obvious one but logging into the vps console from your real vpn managing your vps etc from real etc. 
youre using ssh public key auth for management make sure you use the option ssh keygen when you make the keys you dont leave frosty frosty there accident. 
once youre sshd make sure you set grep ssh make sure your ssh client isnt helpfully passing your real address along etc. 
its good get that cleared.

from the old days when this muppet started ranting about opening new market could smell scam coming. 
hope gets his. 
safe depends what sort service. 
just how private are virtual private servers they are private everyone other than you and the vps provider who has full access. 
would the hosting company ever discover youre hosting tor hidden service and take down many providers allow tor hiddem services. 
would trivial matter find servers hosting hidden services. 
what are your opinions this you are depending the vps provider. 
you plan use vps. 
pay with bitcoin. 
connect only via tor. 
assume you mean contact the vps over clearnet for management purposes. 
hidden onion service for management ssh onioncat etc alternate connectivity method probably better idea than clearnet for management. 
personally wouldnt run private exit node because its going have directly touch clearnet and tor and identifiable the clearnet side. 
but you raise good point that should reiterated anyone reading this thread and deciding set hosted hidden service every interaction you have with the vps hosting provider has the possibility generating paths back the real you. 
payment obvious one but logging into the vps console from your real vpn managing your vps etc from real etc. 
youre using ssh public key auth for management make sure you use the option ssh keygen when you make the keys you dont leave frosty frosty there accident. 
once youre sshd make sure you set grep ssh make sure your ssh client isnt helpfully passing your real address along etc. 
its not particularly safe. 
but everybody does anyway. 
there are three huge problems with vps hosting for hidden services. 
its impossible completely isolate the server from the tor instance providing the hidden service. 
this means that the best youre going uid based iptables rule keep non tor traffic from exiting the box. 
quite few people arent even bright enough get this much right. 
when someone gets root the vps they can pull down the iptables rules and deanonymize the box second. 
hell ifconfig pretty much deanonymizes the box that point. 
the vps provider has complete level visibility into your box. 
they choose theres really nothing they cant see your environment. 
they can strace processes view memory take snapshots while your vps live etc. 
their ability directly read memory the worst part. 
they can scrape for crypto keys capture passwords etc. 
method amount encryption the vps can save you from this btw. 
when someone exploits the vps provider console management interface they have root your vps instance this one happens fairly often. 
someone exploits bug solusvm another vps provider management console and gets control over every vps box their environment. 
better solution rented dedicated server running xen another hypervisor and using the hypervisor isolate the server actually providing the http other service from the tor instance that advertises the. 
onion address servervm private virtual network torvm internet that scenario when someone pwns the servervm they cant deanonymize sending arbitrary traffic out. 
theyre stuck behind the torvm and can only send traffic via tor. 
deanonymize the servervm effectively they need exploit the hypervisor first. 
that architecture the torvm should only allowed send out the tor traffic. 
the hypervisor probably shouldnt even really public network except bridge traffic the torvm and damned sure shouldnt accept arbitrary traffic from the internet itself. 
the best solution physical isolation. 
the server would separate physical box from the tor instance connected only crossover cable. 
however that architecture difficult find rented anonymous environment. 
youre doing something that seriously annoys first world governments you probably have worry about hardware that scenario too once someone has access they can pull serial numbers mac addresses etc that may able identify the box via tracing the supply chain. 
few handy tips you have use vps. 
your http server should not answer requests clearnet its handling tor based requests from hidden. 
nothing good going come from that and million bad things will come from. 
your http service vps should only bound localhost never real. 
actually your vps shouldnt accepting any clearnet traffic aside from the tor traffic needs open function and your management traffic. 
you cant manage set iptables only allow traffic from the tor process via uid hosting hidden service not for you. 
dont give shit what benefit you think youre providing the world youre just putting yourself and everyone that connects your box risk. 
bandwidth consumption cpu memory and storage utilization are the three most visible pieces information that vps provider monitors. 
youre using enough cpu affect other vps users the provider stuck the overloaded and oversold vps hosting box someone will eventually come looking whats going. 
remember the provider can see your individual process details theyre going see that usr bin strange shit consuming all the cpu. 
and theyll wonder what that doing. 
from jackspay february pmi having the same problem with safe mail. 
net and thunderbird. 
using thunderbird and gpg win and can't seem get work. 
need find safe email address that anomymous. 
any help appericated. 
thanks ditched the safe mail for pgp purposes instead created gmail account while tor. 
use only for this purpose and only for week two. 
actually only use send pgp keys myself into that same address this seems the only way can atm add public keys keychain. 
i'm sure others will give better answer. 
now have made first purchase and emails needed only pm's. 
hello users are advised create new bits pgp key. 
great more security the drawback that can hard trust someone who just created new pgp key for one obvious reason they could someone else. 
there have been multiple cases where scammers have pretended well known vendors gain money information. 
this very real risk with new marketplace like tmg. 
quotefor example bob top vendor. 
sandra scammer police officer sandra creates new account tmg claiming bob using the same writing style and new pgp key sandra collects much addresses btc private information. 
there simple solution this problem using pgp you can verify your identity signing messages. 
someone signs message with old pgp key that you for example saved your computer before the wole fiasco you can more less sure it's the same person. 
put paranoid mind rest created this tread. 
for all know this site could very elaborate honey pot. 
i'd very happy some 'oldtimers' can prove wrong signing message with their old pgp key i've got about pgp keys that saved. 
which include great number lsd vendors and avengers shouldn't hard.

good luck man you're for good time. 
glad still have some toc for rainy day let know who you decide ragnarr.

anyone welcome test run some transactions. 
woohoo due helpful member now ready and set contact vendor jor's toc hmm wonder what this might saw listed pure xtal the chepest would. 
guess might look for cheaper deal. 
thanks for the tips. 
i'm not big fan this new post mostly trend signing messages forums. 
removes all plausible deniability regarding was actually you posting. 
someone really needs know you're you they could just send you pgp message using the old key better yet double encrypted wrapping one the other. 
and thanks for the help have put posts three seperate foruma and you were the only respond thanks buddy.

ive got all mine far think ive done about total deposits recently was just saying heard others say theres were missing.

wanted give shot but noticed what was obvious many others removed funds from agora. 
dumpster just dont know for sure. 
ive learned just take day day this business. 
its clear that these are the same things that started seeing before they took the whole cake its smart cautious. 
date havent lost penny transfers and support has responded promptly cant personally say that ive had problem. 
unfortunately seems that these thiefs target certain users venders and leave others alone. 
active vender the forums dont think site would target btc definitely speak about. 
that being said because dont lick defcons nuts course wasnt offered any btc when lost few grand when pulled their heist. 
try stand own two feet and think independently. 
really hope the agora phantom btcs are just mistake but time will tell suggest just taking day day and never let funds sit any market account for over two hours. 
follow that protocol and youll less risk. 
stay safe everyone. 
now dont know going crazy what. 
but made couple withdrawals the other day and noticed later that didnt have all the btc that was expecting. 
went agora try and figure out but theres transaction history with anything. 
messaged support and asked them about the missing btc and they kept brushing off ignoring the question. 
finally they more less had convinced that was crazy and that had less than expected. 
but now not sure. 
the more think about the more believe that only about withdrawals hit account. 
have not had this issue but not ruling out those who did. 
could experiment divert cold storage external wallet the funds will returned time agora staff knowing opsec importance would not want advertise this. 
just tin hat theory but why would they bits bobs when they could wait until the site more trusted escrow more widely accepted implemented there then drop the bomb. 
theory there security bug some member has found way skim thus staying inside.

but expect that there will still resounding silence from gox and the week goes the market will realise that gox customers are still closer being able extract btc dollars yen euros anything else and all that trading gox people exchanging imaginary money for imaginary bitcoins. 
normal world this means drop price but then this bitcoin and everythings gamble. 
from february amive seen those threads and its definitely radar. 
that report the diverted btc the btc wallet bit alarming. 
ive had the same experience organix far withdrawals this point. 
had one small issue and messaged support and they got back three days. 
how you feel rearding its stability and security had deposited there. 
wanted give shot but noticed what was obvious many others removed funds from agora. 
from the old days when this muppet started ranting about opening new market could smell scam coming. 
hope gets his. 
safe depends what sort service. 
just how private are virtual private servers they are private everyone other than you and the vps provider who has full access. 
would the hosting company ever discover youre hosting tor hidden service and take down many providers allow tor hiddem services. 
would trivial matter find servers hosting hidden services. 
what are your opinions this you are depending the vps provider. 
you plan use vps. 
pay with bitcoin. 
connect only via tor. 
assume you mean contact the vps over clearnet for management purposes. 
hidden onion service for management ssh onioncat etc alternate connectivity method probably better idea than clearnet for management. 
personally wouldnt run private exit node because its going have directly touch clearnet and tor and identifiable the clearnet side. 
but you raise good point that should reiterated anyone reading this thread and deciding set hosted hidden service every interaction you have with the vps hosting provider has the possibility generating paths back the real you. 
payment obvious one but logging into the vps console from your real vpn managing your vps etc from real etc. 
youre using ssh public key auth for management make sure you use the option ssh keygen when you make the keys you dont leave frosty frosty there accident. 
once youre sshd make sure you set grep ssh make sure your ssh client isnt helpfully passing your real address along etc. 
alright thx want order something from tmp any other market that has multsig have ask both the vendor and the marketplace for their public key every time. 
from floydy february pmquote from evilgrin february pmimaginary bitcoin for imaginary dollars. 
lolthere this site found bitcoinbuilder. 
com where you can buy gox btc with real your wallet btc the hopes they resume withdraws. 
quite frankly dont know why bothered. 
two days ago posted this response your questionsquote from floydy february pmkeep eye. 
com this virtual market for goxbux and goxcoin and tells what the market thinks. 
did you skip what wrote did you actually read when you were fucked drugs cant remember thanks for your contribution the community. 
guess missed that. 
sorry dude must have been reading fast. 
legit didnt see please feel free neg karma. 
tonight gox owner resigned from his position the bitcoin foundations board directors. 
whale put bitcoins bitstamp mil usd worth about btc and like them got bought then the price fell some. 
theory gox insiders who are able withdraw coins from gox are buying gox and then selling other exchanges and depressing the prices. 
not new theory course. 
since btc has rules not even sure illegal. 
true hope gox profiteering rebuild its funds gox can reopen solvent. 
hope not just going rogue and ripping everyone off and hurting coin values well. 
wonder the whale bitstamp tonight gox insiders buying coins from themselves move the coins new wallets and break the evidence trail where the coins came from not sure that would work really but. 
trying wrap head around this whole multisig thing and think got down mostly but not sure about parts hopefully someone here can help out. 
the main concern have mostly about the security because for what know relies party create multisig address right now what guarantee have that this party uses the public key provided. 
and what guarantee have that this address indeed multisig and not something else there any way verifying this and how. 
well its all about trust the end there any point multisig addresses. 
thx that explains lot. 
ive been pestering people for week now.

should all join under referral link from our favorite vendor that agora and silkroad those who are helping this community who has suffered the most from the theft. 
why not use this disaster small positive try fix our marketplace rather than line the pockets people who will use our paranoid natures darknet dwellers way profit our misfortune. 
everyone has probably got account already but not for referral but would much rather people change accounts account that gives commission the good members the darkweb community.

can you explain why people should sacrifice such huge chunk security for whatever bells whistles your site require please please dont get wrong here your intentions are honorable then wish you every success possible its just that its anathema tor users enable think some kind transparency required regarding the function your site.

from flaxceed february amfortunately now can just use agora pandora and forget about the nightmare that was. 
yes there werent other options available guess guess would undertand the wrenching hair and dressing whole cloth wailing away the loss their market place but there are vendors the other markets and running and doing fines. 
ive been using agora for the past month and problems yet. 
ever becomes problem off use pandora any other ones around. 
when gets its shit together then folks want they can back the. 
until that happens for the most part will continue check and see movement being made fix things then will decide bring business back. 
doesnt have like. 
high school girls getting the vapors over the whole damn thing. 
move another market for now. 
have placed few orders agora and everything seems work just fine. 
problems have been seeing havent had effect. 
right now this marketplace. 
ask the next man provide the other public keys then generate the address will begin with and see matches the payment address gave you. 
doesnt trying scam you. 
make sure tells you what order passed the addresses try all permutations yourself. 
you can generate the addresses electrum bitcoind. 
from fromage february pmalright thx want order something from tmp any other market that has multsig have ask both the vendor and the marketplace for their public key every time yes technically you could. 
but really would not make much sense. 
using the old system escrow you are putting trust that the server going pay out the money the seller refund you there dispute. 
this case you are just placing trust that the server creating multisignature address that releasable either you the seller. 
you intend paying for your item then what concerns you have requesting the public keys the seller and server seems pointless since the seller who would end getting the funds. 
and this why you choose trustworthy markets and vendors. 
from fromage february pmwell its all about trust the end there any point multisig addresses yes stop the market from getting robbed because each transaction needs unlocked separately with unique keys. 
suppose you could get the public keys from the seller and server but this effectively would give the buyer and seller the ability close the deal without the server and therefore you could cut out their market fees. 
this bad idea for the server this. 
let just say that there more risk doing multisig than regular escrow and fact less risk because party hacker cannot steal everyones money. 
trusting the market choice you need make your own and you want deal directly with the vendor then outside the market. 
the market going give its customers the ability close deals while cutting out their market fees would not worth for the market. 
have unique problem someone stole password and tried pass themselves off and have had help resolving this issue created both pdxblack accounts the same time and worked very hard build name that solid agora with almost sales first month. 
the accounts had different keys but they are both mine.

router that routes all communication through the vpn channel and separates this machines segment from all other internal communication. 
would this some kind safe solution because still needs connect the vpn from your home connection. 
the address the vpn hosting the hidden service ever discovered would not hard trace you. 
this exact thing happened dpr but did not host from home. 
even connected from computer cafe. 
they still found him.

from gumby february pmfh wasnt hosted home. 
the server was france. 
the hosting provider believed ovh. 
none the servers were hosted home either but they were all discovered. 
the problem with hosting home that its undeniable you are the owner whereas you rent server anonymously then even your hidden service found they wont necessarily able find you. 
the point stupid host from home. 
another point should mention not use plastic bags plastic wrap etc stop odor. 
that and vac sealing not stop odor for more than few minutes. 
even triple sealing does very little and can smelled human let alone dog after hours. 
use mylar the minimum aluminum foil bags are even better. 
seal them with aluminum tape found home improvement centers world wide. 
also suggest using layers gloves. 
one cloth then external par nitrile gloves not latexthat will certainly work but need for pair gloves. 
one pair cotton will the job prints will get through that. 
latex nitrile will get hot hell you wear them for long same with other rubber substitutes. 
bandcamp those are good points. 
mirage you just repeated what said about plastic mylar foil. 
you can find gloves that fit closely there nothing wrong with wearing them just dont see the need. 
wearing gloves like having robot fingers that are super clumsy. 
nothing they can trace will through cotton glove you are only wearing long enough the packing. 
what are other ways stop odor from coming through. 
put the goods glass jar. 
put them tin some sort and tape carefully. 
pack them pvc. 
pack them abs other odor proof plastic. 
any other tips.

from fromage february pmalright thx want order something from tmp any other market that has multsig have ask both the vendor and the marketplace for their public key every time yes technically you could. 
but really would not make much sense. 
using the old system escrow you are putting trust that the server going pay out the money the seller refund you there dispute. 
this case you are just placing trust that the server creating multisignature address that releasable either you the seller. 
you intend paying for your item then what concerns you have requesting the public keys the seller and server seems pointless since the seller who would end getting the funds. 
and this why you choose trustworthy markets and vendors. 
from fromage february pmwell its all about trust the end there any point multisig addresses yes stop the market from getting robbed because each transaction needs unlocked separately with unique keys. 
suppose you could get the public keys from the seller and server but this effectively would give the buyer and seller the ability close the deal without the server and therefore you could cut out their market fees. 
this bad idea for the server this. 
let just say that there more risk doing multisig than regular escrow and fact less risk because party hacker cannot steal everyones money. 
trusting the market choice you need make your own and you want deal directly with the vendor then outside the market. 
the market going give its customers the ability close deals while cutting out their market fees would not worth for the market.

own case ship firearms. 
ship pieces and ironically the receiver the only piece thats actually illegal ship. 
any handling the gun with pairs gloves. 
thoroughly wipe each piece down with gun oil then lint free cloth before putting bubble mailer possible trace prints. 
use different types labels different fonts with business label shipping templates. 
yeah kind anal about. 
the more professional you make your packages look the less likely they are arouse suspicion. 
live larger metropolitan city what have list all the apartment complexes mile radius. 
keep track how often use each one. 
use fake name and simply dont put apartment number the return address. 
take each package different post office each time. 
keeping track which ones. 
before walking into the post office wipe the mailer down then bring holding between index and thumb. 
swing back and forth people don wonder why carrying like that. 
handing the clerk slide fingers opposite each hard which gets rid any print that might have been there. 
yeah again anal. 
lol with the receiver wrap sticky lead tape make look like anything except receiver gun case gets rayed. 
normally throw other stuff the packages too that are made metal. 
never had one not make. 
from pothead february pmuntil decon repays users shouldnt considered scam marketplace they get pass because they help fund this forum didnt realize first you have different market. 
wont get pass from the community and are the ones that count. 
the problem with making prove scam that these admins hide their activities from impossible for prove anything. 
with this requirement proof nothing scam. 
imagine market takes all our money and the admin says his dog ate the bitcoin. 
that impossible just like theft transacion maleability but still can not prove that scam happened. 
can only prove that the bitcoins were not eaten maleable. 
think makes valid point. 
have unique problem someone stole password and tried pass themselves off and have had help resolving this issue created both pdxblack accounts the same time and worked very hard build name that solid agora with almost sales first month. 
the accounts had different keys but they are both mine. 
just dont want any the shit this guy pulled affect name also have tha name couple other markets. 
bandcamp those are good points. 
mirage you just repeated what said about plastic mylar foil. 
you can find gloves that fit closely there nothing wrong with wearing them just dont see the need. 
wearing gloves like having robot fingers that are super clumsy. 
nothing they can trace will through cotton glove you are only wearing long enough the packing. 
what are other ways stop odor from coming through. 
put the goods glass jar. 
put them tin some sort and tape carefully. 
pack them pvc. 
pack them abs other odor proof plastic. 
any other tips. 
another point should mention not use plastic bags plastic wrap etc stop odor. 
that and vac sealing not stop odor for more than few minutes. 
even triple sealing does very little and can smelled human let alone dog after hours. 
use mylar the minimum aluminum foil bags are even better. 
seal them with aluminum tape found home improvement centers world wide. 
also suggest using layers gloves. 
one cloth then external par nitrile gloves not latexthat will certainly work but need for pair gloves. 
one pair cotton will the job prints will get through that. 
latex nitrile will get hot hell you wear them for long same with other rubber substitutes.
