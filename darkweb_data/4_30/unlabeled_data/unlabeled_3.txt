just frim having fun.
if u open tails up on your main os and go into the bootloader files (sorry cant point to it right now) you can add the bridge word to the startup options so it will automatically boot into bridge mode, im not sure how to get it to remember the bridge settings though.
i havent been to sr2 or its forums in quite a long time but one thing i noticed and really didnt like was their shady little practice of moving important/relevant topics to sections no one will ever see them. one of the last posts i had there was asking for a mod to answer why the scammer, therealmarlostanfield, was still vending there. it got moved to customer support where no one would see it. a mod could move my thread.. but not answer it.. as far as i know he is still vending there.
yeah shes a limping horse, but not quite dead....lol it would be hilarious if they did pay everyone back again, and end up stronger than ever, but i am just an optimist, or trying to be because i have a pending balanace like many others....
hope it gets sorted out, i like this market, lot of good vendors
i am vendor of pharmaceuticals,imported hash and mdma and others and i am on that list. dont know what to think about it

ahhh, bmr, my favorite marketplace of all time. even in the glory days of the original silkroad, i favored this market! i will support back0py in anything he does if he ever returns to the community. just thinking about bmr seems to warrant the phrase, "the good ol days" though it was operating only a few months ago. i think it will always be my favorite marketplace altogether.
very good security with backopy, the site was just painfully slow. when is the new one up and running, any inside info?

dont worry guys the smalldick virgin "whyusheep" has no idea what hes talking about, hes some pimply virgin that paid someone to dos a site in a vain effort to get attention (seeing as his penis will never get any attention other than his hand).  i got faith in agora team they are the most legit site of them all so far.
business accounts not personal. you can use business accounts in 4k increments several times daily deposits from different locals with little problem. stretch out those deposit cities. 2 deposits in this city. 2 more in this city. skip a county over. 2 deposits in this city, ect. businesses make money! lol. youd look successful.
as versace, keep it in cash if you can since it doesnt sound like you need to move much.  just take a bucket of franklins to a ups store and have em pack it up and ship em.if youre committed, enmesh yourself with a legitamate operation and run things through that.  literally just google "how to launder money."  no one here is going to give you better advice.
hi all, does anyone have any other contact details for trava other than the usual, as i placed an order over a week ago and got a mail confirming he got my coin, but no mail confirming anything sent. have sent a couple of mails with no reply. have used them in the past on the markets with no probs but the direct site has no worked for me so far !wildey@safe-mail.net
how am i le? because i put up a link to a thread?i am not le haha. use pgp and your common sense, there is nothing much to concern yourself over using sr.

i use torchat sometimes, but anything i send pertaining to stuff on the darknet is encrypted with pgp no matter what service im using. i believe anything thats sent eletronically can be stored even in chat programs like bitmessage and torchat. the new article out that sr1 was busted because the fbi got to the backup servers just make me feel uneasy about sending anything without it being pgp encrypted.
just read the whitepaper over at bitmessage.org. it looks interesting.  it uses bitcoin-like principles to hide the sender/receiver and everyone gets all the messages to make it impossible for anyone watching to tell whats going on.  you can send messages to a specific address or to those who subscribe to a mailing list.  it uses the proof-of-work concept (like bitcoin) to help prevent spam.is anyone on here using it? if so what do you think?  easier than pgp/email?

business accounts not personal. you can use business accounts in 4k increments several times daily deposits from different locals with little problem. stretch out those deposit cities. 2 deposits in this city. 2 more in this city. skip a county over. 2 deposits in this city, ect. businesses make money! lol. youd look successful.
as versace, keep it in cash if you can since it doesnt sound like you need to move much.  just take a bucket of franklins to a ups store and have em pack it up and ship em.if youre committed, enmesh yourself with a legitamate operation and run things through that.  literally just google "how to launder money."  no one here is going to give you better advice.
hello hub,many of you may be interested in hiding the use of tor from your isp. some isps are already under federal orders to maintain databases of ip addresses connecting to tor nodes, and at this point you should expect the n s a to be collecting that data. there is a nice solution other than vpn services (which can prove to not be helpful depending on how you configure your pathway into tor or if you choose a bad vpn service) called pluggable transports that give you a bridge to connect to tor. bridge - ip address that connects you to tor, possibly unknown as a tor bridge. using these will hide that you are using a known tor node. obfs2 bridge - bridge that has data packets disguised as normal data, hides on the surface that you are using tor. vulnerable to dpi, (deep packet inspection) a capability of the fbi or nsa.  roughly 200-300 exist so understand using them can pool you into a smaller group. solution: host your own on a vps or the tor cloud serviceobfs3 - resistent to dpi, ultimately the safest bridge as it completely masks your data packets. the only problem is that they are few in number thus pooling you into yet a smaller group. the more people host, the infinitely stronger tor becomes!!so, go to torproject and look up some bridges, obfs2 and obfs3 bridges, the more you have the better.so now boot tails in bridge mode. wait til the menu for live or live(failsafe) comes up. hit tab, and then hit spacebar and enter the word bridge, which will launch tails in bridge mode.from here, set the system clock to sync with utc (uk) time. the menu for adding bridges will open automatically, with an attached 127:0.0.1: 7777 or some other number, do not delete this as it is necessary for bridge mode to run. add your bridges one at a time and hit the + button,connect to tor a bit more safely! tails is working on implenting support for flashproxy, the next huge tool in tor anynomity. once that is deployed for tails i would heavily consider implementing that technology. there is a special pluggable transports tor browser bundle that is configured to run bridges automatically; which supports flashproxy so it is a matter of time. the tor cloud service is a great way to host a free private obfs2/3 bridge. if you want to strengthen tor think about hosting a public bridge or obfs bridge!be safe lovies. <3spaceh0rse
hi all, does anyone have any other contact details for trava other than the usual, as i placed an order over a week ago and got a mail confirming he got my coin, but no mail confirming anything sent. have sent a couple of mails with no reply. have used them in the past on the markets with no probs but the direct site has no worked for me so far !wildey@safe-mail.net
i havent been to sr2 or its forums in quite a long time but one thing i noticed and really didnt like was their shady little practice of moving important/relevant topics to sections no one will ever see them. one of the last posts i had there was asking for a mod to answer why the scammer, therealmarlostanfield, was still vending there. it got moved to customer support where no one would see it. a mod could move my thread.. but not answer it.. as far as i know he is still vending there.

if u open tails up on your main os and go into the bootloader files (sorry cant point to it right now) you can add the bridge word to the startup options so it will automatically boot into bridge mode, im not sure how to get it to remember the bridge settings though.

http://i4rx33ibdndtqayh.onion/index.php/topic,3635.0.htmlquotethank you, investigating the issue right now. if this bug has indeed existed, it was due to the server not handling the dos attack properly and must have been a random occurrence with no possibility to exploit purposefully. at this time we have made a general asset check and we can confirm that no large sums of money are missing. if anything at all was missing due to this we shall account the lost to ourselves, since in that case the server should have been more ddos-proof. at this time we dont see a reason to shutdown access to the service, but we shall update if this changes.

it is on the top of forum page ! i have used it a number of times . full list a-z.... just click on member icon at top of forum page and you get a dropdown box that gives you an option to type in and search for a member name only or other option is to view the full list of members a-z
what a dick
problem fixed, just had to set my system clock to utc which tails uses. awesome!!
not in bridge mode; it only allows you to connect via bridges. but if i boot tails normally i can connect without issue. it says something about the system clock not in sync in the messages.

just read the whitepaper over at bitmessage.org. it looks interesting.  it uses bitcoin-like principles to hide the sender/receiver and everyone gets all the messages to make it impossible for anyone watching to tell whats going on.  you can send messages to a specific address or to those who subscribe to a mailing list.  it uses the proof-of-work concept (like bitcoin) to help prevent spam.is anyone on here using it? if so what do you think?  easier than pgp/email?

there was a great site as well. i too loved bmr, & backopy, it was well run, and well staffed.. the road was also very good i did not get on until like 1.0. right before ross went down... it was amazing the first time i went trolling the site. i was in fucking awwwwwwwwwweeeeeeeeeee. i must have stayed 12 hours surfing the listings over and over picking every delectable i was gonna try, when i figured out how to get sum duckketts. it was so sad to see his downfall, the money hurt, but it was the loss of a visionary that hurts more. he has inspired many others, but few will carry the torch as high as he did & for as long, exxcept backopy, which is also a legend. these two sites have given so much to so many... thanks gentleman for giving us true freemarket access.....
yeah shes a limping horse, but not quite dead....lol it would be hilarious if they did pay everyone back again, and end up stronger than ever, but i am just an optimist, or trying to be because i have a pending balanace like many others....
i havent been to sr2 or its forums in quite a long time but one thing i noticed and really didnt like was their shady little practice of moving important/relevant topics to sections no one will ever see them. one of the last posts i had there was asking for a mod to answer why the scammer, therealmarlostanfield, was still vending there. it got moved to customer support where no one would see it. a mod could move my thread.. but not answer it.. as far as i know he is still vending there.

i had some funds that took over a day to show up on fog in the past three days.  and agora isnt loading well for me now.  i dont think these things are related frankly.  i think agora is just having tor bandwidth issues as its the new premier market.  i think fog has been having issues and they are aware of it.  perhaps they are both under ddos attacks from the gubmint, but thats pure speculation.
wouldnt you think that if he really hacked agora thered be a little more buzz about it though?  other than people reporting the site is down?  its been down for more than just 1 day, at least thats what ive seen.  but who knows, after all that these dark net sites have been through nothing surprises me anymore.  i wish there was a way we could really be assured of a sites security.  there are so many marketplaces on the dark web now, some of them could be ran by clowns.  i miss stexo!!!

hello hub,many of you may be interested in hiding the use of tor from your isp. some isps are already under federal orders to maintain databases of ip addresses connecting to tor nodes, and at this point you should expect the n s a to be collecting that data. there is a nice solution other than vpn services (which can prove to not be helpful depending on how you configure your pathway into tor or if you choose a bad vpn service) called pluggable transports that give you a bridge to connect to tor. bridge - ip address that connects you to tor, possibly unknown as a tor bridge. using these will hide that you are using a known tor node. obfs2 bridge - bridge that has data packets disguised as normal data, hides on the surface that you are using tor. vulnerable to dpi, (deep packet inspection) a capability of the fbi or nsa.  roughly 200-300 exist so understand using them can pool you into a smaller group. solution: host your own on a vps or the tor cloud serviceobfs3 - resistent to dpi, ultimately the safest bridge as it completely masks your data packets. the only problem is that they are few in number thus pooling you into yet a smaller group. the more people host, the infinitely stronger tor becomes!!so, go to torproject and look up some bridges, obfs2 and obfs3 bridges, the more you have the better.so now boot tails in bridge mode. wait til the menu for live or live(failsafe) comes up. hit tab, and then hit spacebar and enter the word bridge, which will launch tails in bridge mode.from here, set the system clock to sync with utc (uk) time. the menu for adding bridges will open automatically, with an attached 127:0.0.1: 7777 or some other number, do not delete this as it is necessary for bridge mode to run. add your bridges one at a time and hit the + button,connect to tor a bit more safely! tails is working on implenting support for flashproxy, the next huge tool in tor anynomity. once that is deployed for tails i would heavily consider implementing that technology. there is a special pluggable transports tor browser bundle that is configured to run bridges automatically; which supports flashproxy so it is a matter of time. the tor cloud service is a great way to host a free private obfs2/3 bridge. if you want to strengthen tor think about hosting a public bridge or obfs bridge!be safe lovies. <3spaceh0rse
business accounts not personal. you can use business accounts in 4k increments several times daily deposits from different locals with little problem. stretch out those deposit cities. 2 deposits in this city. 2 more in this city. skip a county over. 2 deposits in this city, ect. businesses make money! lol. youd look successful.
as versace, keep it in cash if you can since it doesnt sound like you need to move much.  just take a bucket of franklins to a ups store and have em pack it up and ship em.if youre committed, enmesh yourself with a legitamate operation and run things through that.  literally just google "how to launder money."  no one here is going to give you better advice.
ahhh, bmr, my favorite marketplace of all time. even in the glory days of the original silkroad, i favored this market! i will support back0py in anything he does if he ever returns to the community. just thinking about bmr seems to warrant the phrase, "the good ol days" though it was operating only a few months ago. i think it will always be my favorite marketplace altogether.
very good security with backopy, the site was just painfully slow. when is the new one up and running, any inside info?
just call eash maket "jesus market "allah maret" "vishnuu market" buddah market" "mormon mrket" stc..., all lead to agora, eveyone is happy

http://i4rx33ibdndtqayh.onion/index.php/topic,3635.0.htmlquotethank you, investigating the issue right now. if this bug has indeed existed, it was due to the server not handling the dos attack properly and must have been a random occurrence with no possibility to exploit purposefully. at this time we have made a general asset check and we can confirm that no large sums of money are missing. if anything at all was missing due to this we shall account the lost to ourselves, since in that case the server should have been more ddos-proof. at this time we dont see a reason to shutdown access to the service, but we shall update if this changes.
quotewe have taken into consideration the current events and decided to take the servers offline for investigation of the effects of the ongoing dos attack.we estimate that we need maximum 8-10 hours for this and everything should be online again at 2014-03-07 07:00 utc.agora team.signature: http://pastebin.com/yqbzfmej

hello matesis agora down or just under maintenance ?
its all ok now....   very slownearely 2 days for the deposite to show...  normal withdraw complete.
i use torchat sometimes, but anything i send pertaining to stuff on the darknet is encrypted with pgp no matter what service im using. i believe anything thats sent eletronically can be stored even in chat programs like bitmessage and torchat. the new article out that sr1 was busted because the fbi got to the backup servers just make me feel uneasy about sending anything without it being pgp encrypted.
yeah i told you that.  awful curious huh?  have at it:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/comparison_of_shopping_cart_softwarehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/comparison_of_web_application_frameworksthatll give you an idea.  everything has php on the front and mysql in the back.if youre planning on setting up a marketplace, let me know.  ill avoid it.

read the post above yours, someone on reddit also said something along the lines of requesting for usernames instead, as vendors are publicly available on any marketplace as sellers advertising their products.

if he did indeed get the info hes stating he did, i would love to see how many assholes didnt encrypt their addresses. that would be a good day, a day of culling for the fuckoffs. edit: also, agora is up for me and asks for a captcha now.
im pretty sure real hackers dont use reddit for serious business.most likely hes just some troll, or maybe its a government setup to use various javascript attacks on anyone who messages him, who knows?

it is on the top of forum page ! i have used it a number of times . full list a-z.... just click on member icon at top of forum page and you get a dropdown box that gives you an option to type in and search for a member name only or other option is to view the full list of members a-z
what a dick
problem fixed, just had to set my system clock to utc which tails uses. awesome!!
not in bridge mode; it only allows you to connect via bridges. but if i boot tails normally i can connect without issue. it says something about the system clock not in sync in the messages.

i had a feeling that might be the case
agora has pretty much top notch --- hope it comes bk
was hoping this was about gox
has anyone else noticed this?  i know that bitcoinfog has been very slow releasing peoples deposits this last week, in fact many people myself included still have not received their withdrawals from days ago.  but now both agora and bitcoinfogs websites appear to be down.  please let me know if anyone else has had any luck getting on either site in the last hour or if youve heard any news on this issue.  thank you everyone!

just read the whitepaper over at bitmessage.org. it looks interesting.  it uses bitcoin-like principles to hide the sender/receiver and everyone gets all the messages to make it impossible for anyone watching to tell whats going on.  you can send messages to a specific address or to those who subscribe to a mailing list.  it uses the proof-of-work concept (like bitcoin) to help prevent spam.is anyone on here using it? if so what do you think?  easier than pgp/email?

there was a great site as well. i too loved bmr, & backopy, it was well run, and well staffed.. the road was also very good i did not get on until like 1.0. right before ross went down... it was amazing the first time i went trolling the site. i was in fucking awwwwwwwwwweeeeeeeeeee. i must have stayed 12 hours surfing the listings over and over picking every delectable i was gonna try, when i figured out how to get sum duckketts. it was so sad to see his downfall, the money hurt, but it was the loss of a visionary that hurts more. he has inspired many others, but few will carry the torch as high as he did & for as long, exxcept backopy, which is also a legend. these two sites have given so much to so many... thanks gentleman for giving us true freemarket access.....
yeah shes a limping horse, but not quite dead....lol it would be hilarious if they did pay everyone back again, and end up stronger than ever, but i am just an optimist, or trying to be because i have a pending balanace like many others....
i havent been to sr2 or its forums in quite a long time but one thing i noticed and really didnt like was their shady little practice of moving important/relevant topics to sections no one will ever see them. one of the last posts i had there was asking for a mod to answer why the scammer, therealmarlostanfield, was still vending there. it got moved to customer support where no one would see it. a mod could move my thread.. but not answer it.. as far as i know he is still vending there.

hi all, does anyone have any other contact details for trava other than the usual, as i placed an order over a week ago and got a mail confirming he got my coin, but no mail confirming anything sent. have sent a couple of mails with no reply. have used them in the past on the markets with no probs but the direct site has no worked for me so far !wildey@safe-mail.net
earn now 0.01 bitcoins in 3 easy steps.how does it work?1. advertise the pirate market somewhere.2. create an image and upload it to anony.ws3. send us a private message with: your username on the pirate market, image link and link to the advertisment.greetings
i had some funds that took over a day to show up on fog in the past three days.  and agora isnt loading well for me now.  i dont think these things are related frankly.  i think agora is just having tor bandwidth issues as its the new premier market.  i think fog has been having issues and they are aware of it.  perhaps they are both under ddos attacks from the gubmint, but thats pure speculation.
wouldnt you think that if he really hacked agora thered be a little more buzz about it though?  other than people reporting the site is down?  its been down for more than just 1 day, at least thats what ive seen.  but who knows, after all that these dark net sites have been through nothing surprises me anymore.  i wish there was a way we could really be assured of a sites security.  there are so many marketplaces on the dark web now, some of them could be ran by clowns.  i miss stexo!!!

hello hub,many of you may be interested in hiding the use of tor from your isp. some isps are already under federal orders to maintain databases of ip addresses connecting to tor nodes, and at this point you should expect the n s a to be collecting that data. there is a nice solution other than vpn services (which can prove to not be helpful depending on how you configure your pathway into tor or if you choose a bad vpn service) called pluggable transports that give you a bridge to connect to tor. bridge - ip address that connects you to tor, possibly unknown as a tor bridge. using these will hide that you are using a known tor node. obfs2 bridge - bridge that has data packets disguised as normal data, hides on the surface that you are using tor. vulnerable to dpi, (deep packet inspection) a capability of the fbi or nsa.  roughly 200-300 exist so understand using them can pool you into a smaller group. solution: host your own on a vps or the tor cloud serviceobfs3 - resistent to dpi, ultimately the safest bridge as it completely masks your data packets. the only problem is that they are few in number thus pooling you into yet a smaller group. the more people host, the infinitely stronger tor becomes!!so, go to torproject and look up some bridges, obfs2 and obfs3 bridges, the more you have the better.so now boot tails in bridge mode. wait til the menu for live or live(failsafe) comes up. hit tab, and then hit spacebar and enter the word bridge, which will launch tails in bridge mode.from here, set the system clock to sync with utc (uk) time. the menu for adding bridges will open automatically, with an attached 127:0.0.1: 7777 or some other number, do not delete this as it is necessary for bridge mode to run. add your bridges one at a time and hit the + button,connect to tor a bit more safely! tails is working on implenting support for flashproxy, the next huge tool in tor anynomity. once that is deployed for tails i would heavily consider implementing that technology. there is a special pluggable transports tor browser bundle that is configured to run bridges automatically; which supports flashproxy so it is a matter of time. the tor cloud service is a great way to host a free private obfs2/3 bridge. if you want to strengthen tor think about hosting a public bridge or obfs bridge!be safe lovies. <3spaceh0rse
business accounts not personal. you can use business accounts in 4k increments several times daily deposits from different locals with little problem. stretch out those deposit cities. 2 deposits in this city. 2 more in this city. skip a county over. 2 deposits in this city, ect. businesses make money! lol. youd look successful.
as versace, keep it in cash if you can since it doesnt sound like you need to move much.  just take a bucket of franklins to a ups store and have em pack it up and ship em.if youre committed, enmesh yourself with a legitamate operation and run things through that.  literally just google "how to launder money."  no one here is going to give you better advice.
ahhh, bmr, my favorite marketplace of all time. even in the glory days of the original silkroad, i favored this market! i will support back0py in anything he does if he ever returns to the community. just thinking about bmr seems to warrant the phrase, "the good ol days" though it was operating only a few months ago. i think it will always be my favorite marketplace altogether.
very good security with backopy, the site was just painfully slow. when is the new one up and running, any inside info?
just call eash maket "jesus market "allah maret" "vishnuu market" buddah market" "mormon mrket" stc..., all lead to agora, eveyone is happy

http://i4rx33ibdndtqayh.onion/index.php/topic,3635.0.htmlquotethank you, investigating the issue right now. if this bug has indeed existed, it was due to the server not handling the dos attack properly and must have been a random occurrence with no possibility to exploit purposefully. at this time we have made a general asset check and we can confirm that no large sums of money are missing. if anything at all was missing due to this we shall account the lost to ourselves, since in that case the server should have been more ddos-proof. at this time we dont see a reason to shutdown access to the service, but we shall update if this changes.
quotewe have taken into consideration the current events and decided to take the servers offline for investigation of the effects of the ongoing dos attack.we estimate that we need maximum 8-10 hours for this and everything should be online again at 2014-03-07 07:00 utc.agora team.signature: http://pastebin.com/yqbzfmej

hello matesis agora down or just under maintenance ?
its all ok now....   very slownearely 2 days for the deposite to show...  normal withdraw complete.
i use torchat sometimes, but anything i send pertaining to stuff on the darknet is encrypted with pgp no matter what service im using. i believe anything thats sent eletronically can be stored even in chat programs like bitmessage and torchat. the new article out that sr1 was busted because the fbi got to the backup servers just make me feel uneasy about sending anything without it being pgp encrypted.
yeah i told you that.  awful curious huh?  have at it:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/comparison_of_shopping_cart_softwarehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/comparison_of_web_application_frameworksthatll give you an idea.  everything has php on the front and mysql in the back.if youre planning on setting up a marketplace, let me know.  ill avoid it.
forums and market are up now
so it seems like i successfully managed to burn the iso file !!! i have no freakin clue what my next step is
so!  i finally got my external dvd drive and an empty dvd ^^ im in the process of burning the .iso file, ill let you know how it goes ^^

what is agora going to do about all of the finalized orders that people couldnt extend because they werent able to? now the vendor has your coin and you may not get shit!!! what then?, just what we needed.
agora is back online folks!quote from: nevil on march 06, 2014, 11:58:53 pmit is on the top of forum page ! i have used it a number of times . full list a-z.... just click on member icon at top of forum page and you get a dropdown box that gives you an option to type in and search for a member name only or other option is to view the full list of members a-zthe forums are up and yes, i see the "member list" link.
yeah i saw that post. theres a thread on agora forums too about it. i have no idea if "sales1993" is telling the truth or not (re: amount in his account and amount withdrawn).  just have to wait and see what comes out in the next day or so.
bah, ive been trying to get in and take down all of my import listings since tuesday evening. it is back up now, but i imagine the influx of rabid buyers is causing a bigtime slowdown. guess im just gona walk away and pretend i dont need to do this. maybe at some bizarre hour tonight/tomorrow morning i can actually get this done.
sub
it seems like agora is picking up the slack from bmr.  pandora is always so incredibly slow, and they might list a lot of users but i get tons more orders from agora than i do from pandora.  the fact that pandora allows vendors to withdraw bitcoins without entering a pin is scary as fuck.  they will be hacked and a lot of people will lose coins.  it is inevitable.  business is booming on agora right now!

i think you have to configure a persistent volume on your tails bootable sd card or usb (very easy to do). i personally always boot from dvd and just import my pgp keys and manually configure bridges just because i appreciate the amnesic feautures of tails. tails live dvds are read only and are amnesic ny default.*also* upon login of tails, you must hit the more options button, set an admin password so you may have admin permission to reset the system clock, export pgp keys, or do anything in the command terminal that requires admin permisson!
on using coin mixers: whats the alternative?  manually trying to run things through numerous online wallets through different tor identities?bitcoinfog is reliable for mixing, as are numerous other services.  i cant speak to safepostage.com.  the only way to know is to try.  never spend more than you can lose.

yeeha ! thanks sorrymario.......check out the post i just made in the sticky re the btc withdrawal yesterday from agora to sr2
all is well now... just delays i guess. was able to withdraw and funds are showing.
is it showing up in the fog atleast?
ive been looking at alternatives aswell. ive succesfully used bitcoinblender a few times now it is very quick, just not sure how good their mixer is (im no expert).
i also suspect at least some of them have sent their money to a phishing site.  ive sent, withdrawn, ordered etc... and had zero problems with anything on agora.  in fact, compared to sr2 and pandora, the money shows up faster and withdraws to my personal account faster.
damn shame. sorry to hear that. when will owner/operators learn that a secure site that is honest makes more $$$ in the long run? hell even in the short run.

bitblender youre a little late to the game, btcfog is nearing eol at this point with darkcoin and darkwallet (two seperate coinjoin projects) reaching completion. also it takes alot of participation to make a mixer work and without peer review its impossible to say whether your service works or not. we got two trust based mixers now, they will be dead by the end of the year.

on using coin mixers: whats the alternative?  manually trying to run things through numerous online wallets through different tor identities?bitcoinfog is reliable for mixing, as are numerous other services.  i cant speak to safepostage.com.  the only way to know is to try.  never spend more than you can lose.
i think you have to configure a persistent volume on your tails bootable sd card or usb (very easy to do). i personally always boot from dvd and just import my pgp keys and manually configure bridges just because i appreciate the amnesic feautures of tails. tails live dvds are read only and are amnesic ny default.*also* upon login of tails, you must hit the more options button, set an admin password so you may have admin permission to reset the system clock, export pgp keys, or do anything in the command terminal that requires admin permisson!
damn shame. sorry to hear that. when will owner/operators learn that a secure site that is honest makes more $$$ in the long run? hell even in the short run.

after years of speculation, the true identity of "satoshi nakamoto," the mysterious person or group behind the bitcoin revolution, appeared to have been revealed by newsweek on thursday.it turns out it is a japanese-american model train enthusiast whose name is, indeed, satoshi nakamoto.a reporter tracked down the 64-year-old, a physicist, living under the name dorian s. nakamoto in a modest two-story house in suburban los angeles.nakamoto did not admit to being behind the phenomenon that, since its 2009 launch, has been hailed as a financial revolution despite scandals over its use in the drugs trade and money-laundering.and he called the police when the magazines reporter knocked on his door.but newsweek said the man, whose quiet career involved classified work as a systems engineer for the us government and government contractors, initially tacitly acknowledged his role in creating the crypto-currency that has rocked the banking world."i am no longer involved in that, and i cannot discuss it," he said. "its been turned over to other people."later thursday, nakamoto told reporters camped outside his house: "im not involved in bitcoin."the bitcoin foundation, which supports the development of the currency, would not confirm newsweeks story.the obsessively secretive founder of bitcoin has been unmasked"we have seen zero conclusive evidence that the identified person is the designer of bitcoin. those closest to the bitcoin project, the informal team of core developers, have always been unaware of nakamoto?s true identity, as nakamoto communicated purely through electronic means," it said.newsweek however laid out a strong story, in a scoop meant to relaunch its first print issue after publishing online for two years.it said nakamoto was born in japan in 1949 and immigrated to the united states 10 years later.he studied physics at california state polytechnic university and worked for a number of companies, but has apparently not held a steady job since 2002.he spends much of his time on his model train hobby and has apparently not tapped the millions of dollars of bitcoin wealth newsweek says comes from authoring the computer code behind it.- a libertarian streak -his family, including two younger brothers who are also scientists, did not know of his link to bitcoin."hes a brilliant man," his brother arthur nakamoto told newsweek. "hes very focused and eclectic in his way of thinking. smart, intelligent, mathematics, engineering, computers. you name it, he can do it."but they described a man with a deep libertarian streak, intensely private and distrustful of the government and banks.ilene mitchell, one of nakamotos six children from two marriages, said he taught her while growing up to "not be under the governments thumb."nakamotos 2008 bitcoin manifesto stressed the need for an online, electronic cash system that did not go through a financial institution, which requires both trust in the institution and payment for its role as an intermediary.analysts have called his structure brilliant in the way it issues bitcoin without a central bank authority, and keeps a cryptographic record of transactions via distributed computing that also protects users anonymity .gavin andresen, chief scientist of the bitcoin foundation, said he had corresponded online with a man called satoshi nakamoto over one year as they refined the bitcoin code.but they never spoke on the telephone and andresen did not learn anything about his personal life."he went to great lengths to protect his anonymity," andresen told the magazine. "all we talked about was code."the currencys success has made many wealthy.after trading for cents per bitcoin for the first two years of its existence, in 2011 it began a frenzied climb that took it to $40 a coin in late 2012 and $1,100 last year, before falling off to the current $650 level.with the writers of the original code all having been paid in bitcoin, newsweek said nakamoto is now likely worth $400 million.newsweek published a picture of nakamoto and his home and car, a toyota corolla, in temple city, california, east of downtown los angeles.readers fiercely blasted the author, leah mcgrath goodman, for revealing the identity and whereabouts of someone who wanted to remain private.

yeah i saw that post. theres a thread on agora forums too about it. i have no idea if "sales1993" is telling the truth or not (re: amount in his account and amount withdrawn).  just have to wait and see what comes out in the next day or so.
bah, ive been trying to get in and take down all of my import listings since tuesday evening. it is back up now, but i imagine the influx of rabid buyers is causing a bigtime slowdown. guess im just gona walk away and pretend i dont need to do this. maybe at some bizarre hour tonight/tomorrow morning i can actually get this done.

all is well now... just delays i guess. was able to withdraw and funds are showing.
is it showing up in the fog atleast?
it seems like agora is picking up the slack from bmr.  pandora is always so incredibly slow, and they might list a lot of users but i get tons more orders from agora than i do from pandora.  the fact that pandora allows vendors to withdraw bitcoins without entering a pin is scary as fuck.  they will be hacked and a lot of people will lose coins.  it is inevitable.  business is booming on agora right now!

bitblender youre a little late to the game, btcfog is nearing eol at this point with darkcoin and darkwallet (two seperate coinjoin projects) reaching completion. also it takes alot of participation to make a mixer work and without peer review its impossible to say whether your service works or not. we got two trust based mixers now, they will be dead by the end of the year.

after years of speculation, the true identity of "satoshi nakamoto," the mysterious person or group behind the bitcoin revolution, appeared to have been revealed by newsweek on thursday.it turns out it is a japanese-american model train enthusiast whose name is, indeed, satoshi nakamoto.a reporter tracked down the 64-year-old, a physicist, living under the name dorian s. nakamoto in a modest two-story house in suburban los angeles.nakamoto did not admit to being behind the phenomenon that, since its 2009 launch, has been hailed as a financial revolution despite scandals over its use in the drugs trade and money-laundering.and he called the police when the magazines reporter knocked on his door.but newsweek said the man, whose quiet career involved classified work as a systems engineer for the us government and government contractors, initially tacitly acknowledged his role in creating the crypto-currency that has rocked the banking world."i am no longer involved in that, and i cannot discuss it," he said. "its been turned over to other people."later thursday, nakamoto told reporters camped outside his house: "im not involved in bitcoin."the bitcoin foundation, which supports the development of the currency, would not confirm newsweeks story.the obsessively secretive founder of bitcoin has been unmasked"we have seen zero conclusive evidence that the identified person is the designer of bitcoin. those closest to the bitcoin project, the informal team of core developers, have always been unaware of nakamoto?s true identity, as nakamoto communicated purely through electronic means," it said.newsweek however laid out a strong story, in a scoop meant to relaunch its first print issue after publishing online for two years.it said nakamoto was born in japan in 1949 and immigrated to the united states 10 years later.he studied physics at california state polytechnic university and worked for a number of companies, but has apparently not held a steady job since 2002.he spends much of his time on his model train hobby and has apparently not tapped the millions of dollars of bitcoin wealth newsweek says comes from authoring the computer code behind it.- a libertarian streak -his family, including two younger brothers who are also scientists, did not know of his link to bitcoin."hes a brilliant man," his brother arthur nakamoto told newsweek. "hes very focused and eclectic in his way of thinking. smart, intelligent, mathematics, engineering, computers. you name it, he can do it."but they described a man with a deep libertarian streak, intensely private and distrustful of the government and banks.ilene mitchell, one of nakamotos six children from two marriages, said he taught her while growing up to "not be under the governments thumb."nakamotos 2008 bitcoin manifesto stressed the need for an online, electronic cash system that did not go through a financial institution, which requires both trust in the institution and payment for its role as an intermediary.analysts have called his structure brilliant in the way it issues bitcoin without a central bank authority, and keeps a cryptographic record of transactions via distributed computing that also protects users anonymity .gavin andresen, chief scientist of the bitcoin foundation, said he had corresponded online with a man called satoshi nakamoto over one year as they refined the bitcoin code.but they never spoke on the telephone and andresen did not learn anything about his personal life."he went to great lengths to protect his anonymity," andresen told the magazine.

i think you have to configure a persistent volume on your tails bootable sd card or usb (very easy to do). i personally always boot from dvd and just import my pgp keys and manually configure bridges just because i appreciate the amnesic feautures of tails. tails live dvds are read only and are amnesic ny default.*also* upon login of tails, you must hit the more options button, set an admin password so you may have admin permission to reset the system clock, export pgp keys, or do anything in the command terminal that requires admin permisson!
it seems like agora is picking up the slack from bmr.  pandora is always so incredibly slow, and they might list a lot of users but i get tons more orders from agora than i do from pandora.  the fact that pandora allows vendors to withdraw bitcoins without entering a pin is scary as fuck.  they will be hacked and a lot of people will lose coins.  it is inevitable.  business is booming on agora right now!
i also suspect at least some of them have sent their money to a phishing site.  ive sent, withdrawn, ordered etc... and had zero problems with anything on agora.  in fact, compared to sr2 and pandora, the money shows up faster and withdraws to my personal account faster.
what is agora going to do about all of the finalized orders that people couldnt extend because they werent able to? now the vendor has your coin and you may not get shit!!! what then?, just what we needed.

as far as i understand they are still experiencing a dos attack. they have been taking steps to counter it, but the server load is still very high. just be patient and try to spread your attempts out. when you do log in get whatever you need done finished asap.
quote from: blackstar on march 04, 2014, 01:41:21 ami just wrote a long post about this on sr2forum. the idea of never ever fe was planted in buyers heads when silk road was a trusted community with morals and escrow hacks were not common place. now a days it is almost stupid to trust an escrow system as a vendor (or a buyer for that matter) because of the inherent risks. by saying "never ever fe" you are simply trusting the escrow host more than the vendor. when you step back and look at it, the vendor should be the one you trust, you are ingesting his drugs so you better have some sort of trust about the person. the site hosting the escrow is the same "shadowy figure you have never met" as any vendor is. but the difference is that you can build a trusting/working relationship with a vendor and narrow down the risks substantially, where as with an escrow host you simply cannot. i think this "never fe" motto is a way for buyers and noobs to be lazy in their reseaarch and not do their due diligence as far as finding vendors. almost every buyer i have will fe me without having to even ask becasue they understand the risk is strictly on my end (sans the 12 hours after you fund escrow aand before i ship) and the volatility of btc makes vending a gut wrenching experience. this is becasue they trust me more than they trust any market(all of which have stolen/lost funds, 100% of them to date). take this how you will, but that old "never ever fe" died with the the original silk road and the trust in the market place.thanks for the convincing post.  were a little off topic here, so ill just say thanks and that i totally hear what youre saying.   i almost wish i used heroin so i could do business with you ;p)
i like that they auto-implemented coinjoin basically, and im thinking of getting some.  anybody hear anything about it, good or bad?  i just want to know what the word on the street is.  are people saying its a scamcoin, do people like it?... whatever your thoughts on it are, please post them!

i too, just realized this.
i see post stating that agora was gonna be down for a few hours, but that was yesterday.anyone else still having problems getting into agora.a few times i logged in and looked at my orders and went to finialize an order then it timed out. also, i need the agora forum link.

my wallet was jacked for about $35. i havent seen one satoshi repaid in my direction. i have ~ $60 in pending escrow, havent seen fuck all from that either. the orders were cancelled, and ta da, you get nothing. you being me. i get nothing. sr gets no more of my money until or unless i get mine back. the thing that fucks me off the most is that if i purchase goods from sr, there is the possibility that my money is going to pay off a child molestering, perving scum sucking fuckwit like m0rph. i will not.

as far as i can tell auto withdraw for vendors still works as expected. soon as the order clears escrow it goes into the wd queue. takes an hour or two usually but then the coins are on their way.

quote from: blackstar on march 04, 2014, 01:41:21 ami just wrote a long post about this on sr2forum. the idea of never ever fe was planted in buyers heads when silk road was a trusted community with morals and escrow hacks were not common place. now a days it is almost stupid to trust an escrow system as a vendor (or a buyer for that matter) because of the inherent risks. by saying "never ever fe" you are simply trusting the escrow host more than the vendor. when you step back and look at it, the vendor should be the one you trust, you are ingesting his drugs so you better have some sort of trust about the person. the site hosting the escrow is the same "shadowy figure you have never met" as any vendor is. but the difference is that you can build a trusting/working relationship with a vendor and narrow down the risks substantially, where as with an escrow host you simply cannot. i think this "never fe" motto is a way for buyers and noobs to be lazy in their reseaarch and not do their due diligence as far as finding vendors. almost every buyer i have will fe me without having to even ask becasue they understand the risk is strictly on my end (sans the 12 hours after you fund escrow aand before i ship) and the volatility of btc makes vending a gut wrenching experience. this is becasue they trust me more than they trust any market(all of which have stolen/lost funds, 100% of them to date). take this how you will, but that old "never ever fe" died with the the original silk road and the trust in the market place.thanks for the convincing post.  were a little off topic here, so ill just say thanks and that i totally hear what youre saying.   i almost wish i used heroin so i could do business with you ;p)

this is an very very interesting discussion with an level of professionalism seldom encountered.we thank you all for sharing these subjects.  we will properly indulge in this thread at least 3 more times before even thinking about joining the conversion with questions that run not into danger of wasting precious time & patience we only want to ask what opinions pertain in regards to keeping hidden services purely in ram.e.g  http://opensource.dyc.edu/tor-ramdiskand what the general opinion is regarding http://opensource.dyc.edu/tinhat  on the client side.note: for anyone attempting to try out  tin hat be very patient ..it takes ages until it is loaded..this is not an error.           also make sure you run the correct commands to size up the use of ram to the maximum you can allow...otherwise it will break soon and you have to start anew.regards,bungee54 team op

its probably just very busy. its best to pick a time of day that some section of the world is sleeping to access the page when the servers are overloaded. when the west and east coast of america as well as the euro union is awake are the worst times to get in. but as it stands i have not been able to sign in
i was paid back in full.  the amount was only ~$10, which was left over from a purchase.  i immediately withdrew it.  no problems.
has anyone compared cevs between hoffman's gdf fluff and house of spirits gdf fluff?
i was thinking about this marketplace a bit, and it occured to me that we don't need to worry about mixing coins here. as long as vendor recieving addresses are never made public, there is no way to connect our coins moving between each other with the substances they are intedned to purchase.thoughts?
i doubt that theirs are going to be identical.  i mean, it could be possible, but i don't think so.  they also vary differently in dosage, both on their paper and their liquid.  so you'd have to properly measure equal dosages and figure the math on all that.  albert does provide an amazing product.  all my hippie buddies really liked his stuff a little while ago.
i think you're right, as long as you maintain a fresh address for every transaction you should be good.
this is a joke right? the coin isnt event out of beta yet.

quote from: blackstar on march 04, 2014, 01:41:21 ami just wrote a long post about this on sr2forum. the idea of never ever fe was planted in buyers heads when silk road was a trusted community with morals and escrow hacks were not common place. now a days it is almost stupid to trust an escrow system as a vendor (or a buyer for that matter) because of the inherent risks. by saying "never ever fe" you are simply trusting the escrow host more than the vendor. when you step back and look at it, the vendor should be the one you trust, you are ingesting his drugs so you better have some sort of trust about the person. the site hosting the escrow is the same "shadowy figure you have never met" as any vendor is. but the difference is that you can build a trusting/working relationship with a vendor and narrow down the risks substantially, where as with an escrow host you simply cannot. i think this "never fe" motto is a way for buyers and noobs to be lazy in their reseaarch and not do their due diligence as far as finding vendors. almost every buyer i have will fe me without having to even ask becasue they understand the risk is strictly on my end (sans the 12 hours after you fund escrow aand before i ship) and the volatility of btc makes vending a gut wrenching experience. this is becasue they trust me more than they trust any market(all of which have stolen/lost funds, 100% of them to date). take this how you will, but that old "never ever fe" died with the the original silk road and the trust in the market place.thanks for the convincing post.  were a little off topic here, so ill just say thanks and that i totally hear what youre saying.   i almost wish i used heroin so i could do business with you ;p)

quote from: blackstar on march 04, 2014, 01:41:21 ami just wrote a long post about this on sr2forum. the idea of never ever fe was planted in buyers heads when silk road was a trusted community with morals and escrow hacks were not common place. now a days it is almost stupid to trust an escrow system as a vendor (or a buyer for that matter) because of the inherent risks. by saying "never ever fe" you are simply trusting the escrow host more than the vendor. when you step back and look at it, the vendor should be the one you trust, you are ingesting his drugs so you better have some sort of trust about the person. the site hosting the escrow is the same "shadowy figure you have never met" as any vendor is. but the difference is that you can build a trusting/working relationship with a vendor and narrow down the risks substantially, where as with an escrow host you simply cannot. i think this "never fe" motto is a way for buyers and noobs to be lazy in their reseaarch and not do their due diligence as far as finding vendors. almost every buyer i have will fe me without having to even ask becasue they understand the risk is strictly on my end (sans the 12 hours after you fund escrow aand before i ship) and the volatility of btc makes vending a gut wrenching experience. this is becasue they trust me more than they trust any market(all of which have stolen/lost funds, 100% of them to date). take this how you will, but that old "never ever fe" died with the the original silk road and the trust in the market place.thanks for the convincing post.  were a little off topic here, so ill just say thanks and that i totally hear what youre saying.   i almost wish i used heroin so i could do business with you ;p)

as far as i understand they are still experiencing a dos attack. they have been taking steps to counter it, but the server load is still very high. just be patient and try to spread your attempts out. when you do log in get whatever you need done finished asap.

i also find evo to be a great emerging market. they not only have a lot of fraud related products and tuts but a large and ever growing drug section as well. this market takes security very seriously. the layout is clean and extremely fast. just an all around excellent market a++++
its so slow its just about down. i finally logged in but after 10 tries still could not upload a listing.
its a mixed experience. most of yesterday i couldnt log in at all, but since last night i have been able to get in every other attempt and get some work done. right now its being very obstinate, but this is a high traffic period. earlier this morning it was smooth as could be. i suggest you find something else to do for a while and casually(10ish mins apart) try to log in. do not keep spamming the refresh button it only makes it worse.so far i have been able to get in within 2 trys, but i wont even bother trying to log in again until later tonight.
there were a few topics on the subject of not being able to log in or not being able to do anything once logged in. all those have been deleted. lets hope they are not going in the direction of sr.
we have only just been registered today as vendors. i will say that once i got in we were stuck and could not navigate the site for long. has this been an ongoing issue? how is the general atmosphere there at the moment? even pandora also seems to be having some difficulties with many support requests becoming unanswered. these are really tough times. lets hope things improve for a whileregardsth

welcome to the agora family!sad as it is to say, i saw the downfall of sr2 coming a long time ago. i felt like i would never be able to recoup my investment if i paid a bond there. agora is a very nice place to be. given the layout is somewhat primitive looking, and they have been under ddos attack recently, id still say proudly that right now agora is the new #1 market. pandora has been around longer, and they have had higher volume of traffic until about a month ago. i suspect that it has hit its plateau and will likely stand in the #2 position moving forward as it has since the fall of sr, smp, and bmr. sad to see sr die, but they have been riddled with issues since day one. im so glad we have reliable, honest alternate options these days.
cheers guys, moving and settling in have always proven stressful since we started, with what we do we find ourselves in a position where we put allot of trust in strangers. though it may be a different marketplace, we, like a friendly open air town market, stand together to sell our wares. some of us have gone from one adversity to another so its our responsibility to protect our customers and our fellow vendors. lets hope this next move will be a long and fruitful one. also ty bisto i will monitor the situation.
thank you for your words rc4 it is good to know that we may come under attack, be robbed, scammed and driven from our homes but as long as we stand together and stand united we can hopefully stay strong and persevereregardsth
for a community to be strong it needs to be held together by strong bonds. we are honored that you also share our beliefs but they are not just our belief, it is because of ross u that our movement was born. we owe it to him to stay true and keep the community together. as long as more people come together and share these beliefs then hopefully we will persevere as brothers, sisters rather than as enemies.

i just got done looking over the info. looks like a wad of fud to me. its not that hard to generate fake details like the ones posted. looks to be formatted in the similar fashion to that of the viewable order page and not as it would be inside of a traditional db system. i could be mistaken, but i call bs on this. also it is known that last weeks attack was a brute force password attack which is why they added the captcha. its entirely possible that a few vendors names and passwords have been compromised and its their own fault for 1) not using a sufficiently strong password, and 2) not changing their passwords the day that this was announced.ie. even though i know for a fact my password was not compromised i changed it anyway. none of us should be using the same password twice either. i have this un registered on ~15 services, and every one of those has its own individual unique password.

hello guys, im from a country of non-english talking so, i hope you can understand me.im planning a personal onion html-based and very simple "market" only for offer my products in my country, begining with our city, here are a huge market. the problem is that here no exists that kind of "postal blue boxes" (usa) where you can send letters or things just using postage and without interacting with any postal office, the most near thing is buying postage in the office and use it, but i will have to go inside the postal office and let the "package" or "letters" there (without any signing) and when i purchase the postage, ill have to go inside the postal too, so i dont like it because there are cams, etc.i was thinking in "rotatory aleatory in-site drops" inside the city, like this:1. the customer see a product, read the sec instructions and make the purchase, sending his exactly amount bt to our bt adress and the pgp message with the info, that will be the "neighborwood" or some relative geoposition in the city for what we concern.2. we recieve the bt and message, so we go near to the site he send us (without telling anybody, only me for now and never in exactly the site) and simply locate a site for drop the package, maybe in a trash container, in a wall like an marketing object (i dont know how traslate) or whatever, there just be a lot of possibilitys for make this with a liitle of creativity. if i have been intercepted or contacted by le, they will never know where i am exactly, only a relative location that will be a lot of surface for cover. nobody know where is this place, because i "improvise" the place "in site".3. we left the place and when have a good and secure distance, send the last message (encrypted) with the exactly location of the package.so, there always be a distance between me and the customers, in case of le or something, and always  using correct opsec and all required security online and offline (surveillance, etc, etc).let me know what you think!!pd: if you have any other idea for my case, i will appreciate a lot that!!!!! we have learned a lot of experience in sr1, sr2, tcf and all that good forums and good people!!! love your work!!!!
have you considered setting up an electrum wallet? works well with tails and eliminates the need for third party wallets.pb.
i second the notion of contributing a portion of the funds to charity. also, it cant hurt to have many small markets to help diffuse the traffic overload that the bigger markets will most certainly experience.
mate its ok on agora sr2 buyers moved herebut you will have to keep watch on btc as your pricing dont seem to move with btc price.

vendors should all be mixing coins. i would still recommend a customer to mix coins, just because you can do it for basically free, but i know i will be mixing my coins anyways, so if you choose not it is fine.

26/03/2014 - we are unable to get logged on to agora again and we are unable to get any orders shipped out today. we will get them out asap when we manage to get logged on.*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************24/03/2014 - we are unable to gain access to agora at the moment, we endeavor to get logged on asap and process orders. if we can not gain access by 3pm today no orders will be shipped today. sorry for any inconvenience. we will update our agora page when we get logged on.***************************************************************************************************************************************************************10/03/2014 - edit: just an update we now have vendor status over on agora. i am hoping to get listings up today after we are done on sr. we will be doing some sort of promotion like we attempted to do when starting on utopia. lets hope we last long enough for me fulfill it :well guys we stayed as long as we could, we tried to move once before and soon as we left our life boat was sunk. now we are trying again this time with 2 life boats one to pandora and the other here to agora.its a shame to have the legacy of sr end on such a low point. lets hope we once again rebuild and strengthen our community to its former glory. anyhow i would like to say hi to my fellow vendors and customers. we hope to settle in and look forward to the futureregardsth
welcome to the agora family!sad as it is to say, i saw the downfall of sr2 coming a long time ago. i felt like i would never be able to recoup my investment if i paid a bond there. agora is a very nice place to be. given the layout is somewhat primitive looking, and they have been under ddos attack recently, id still say proudly that right now agora is the new #1 market. pandora has been around longer, and they have had higher volume of traffic until about a month ago. i suspect that it has hit its plateau and will likely stand in the #2 position moving forward as it has since the fall of sr, smp, and bmr. sad to see sr die, but they have been riddled with issues since day one. im so glad we have reliable, honest alternate options these days.
cheers guys, moving and settling in have always proven stressful since we started, with what we do we find ourselves in a position where we put allot of trust in strangers. though it may be a different marketplace, we, like a friendly open air town market, stand together to sell our wares. some of us have gone from one adversity to another so its our responsibility to protect our customers and our fellow vendors. lets hope this next move will be a long and fruitful one. also ty bisto i will monitor the situation.
thank you for your words rc4 it is good to know that we may come under attack, be robbed, scammed and driven from our homes but as long as we stand together and stand united we can hopefully stay strong and persevereregardsth
for a community to be strong it needs to be held together by strong bonds. we are honored that you also share our beliefs but they are not just our belief, it is because of ross u that our movement was born. we owe it to him to stay true and keep the community together. as long as more people come together and share these beliefs then hopefully we will persevere as brothers, sisters rather than as enemies.

thanks, much appreciation
i also find evo to be a great emerging market. they not only have a lot of fraud related products and tuts but a large and ever growing drug section as well. this market takes security very seriously. the layout is clean and extremely fast. just an all around excellent market a++++
its so slow its just about down. i finally logged in but after 10 tries still could not upload a listing.
its a mixed experience. most of yesterday i couldnt log in at all, but since last night i have been able to get in every other attempt and get some work done. right now its being very obstinate, but this is a high traffic period. earlier this morning it was smooth as could be. i suggest you find something else to do for a while and casually(10ish mins apart) try to log in. do not keep spamming the refresh button it only makes it worse.so far i have been able to get in within 2 trys, but i wont even bother trying to log in again until later tonight.
there were a few topics on the subject of not being able to log in or not being able to do anything once logged in. all those have been deleted. lets hope they are not going in the direction of sr.
we have only just been registered today as vendors. i will say that once i got in we were stuck and could not navigate the site for long. has this been an ongoing issue? how is the general atmosphere there at the moment? even pandora also seems to be having some difficulties with many support requests becoming unanswered. these are really tough times. lets hope things improve for a whileregardsth

i just got done looking over the info. looks like a wad of fud to me. its not that hard to generate fake details like the ones posted. looks to be formatted in the similar fashion to that of the viewable order page and not as it would be inside of a traditional db system. i could be mistaken, but i call bs on this. also it is known that last weeks attack was a brute force password attack which is why they added the captcha. its entirely possible that a few vendors names and passwords have been compromised and its their own fault for 1) not using a sufficiently strong password, and 2) not changing their passwords the day that this was announced.ie. even though i know for a fact my password was not compromised i changed it anyway. none of us should be using the same password twice either. i have this un registered on ~15 services, and every one of those has its own individual unique password.

have you considered setting up an electrum wallet? works well with tails and eliminates the need for third party wallets.pb.
i second the notion of contributing a portion of the funds to charity. also, it cant hurt to have many small markets to help diffuse the traffic overload that the bigger markets will most certainly experience.

welcome to the agora family!sad as it is to say, i saw the downfall of sr2 coming a long time ago. i felt like i would never be able to recoup my investment if i paid a bond there. agora is a very nice place to be. given the layout is somewhat primitive looking, and they have been under ddos attack recently, id still say proudly that right now agora is the new #1 market. pandora has been around longer, and they have had higher volume of traffic until about a month ago. i suspect that it has hit its plateau and will likely stand in the #2 position moving forward as it has since the fall of sr, smp, and bmr. sad to see sr die, but they have been riddled with issues since day one. im so glad we have reliable, honest alternate options these days.
cheers guys, moving and settling in have always proven stressful since we started, with what we do we find ourselves in a position where we put allot of trust in strangers. though it may be a different marketplace, we, like a friendly open air town market, stand together to sell our wares. some of us have gone from one adversity to another so its our responsibility to protect our customers and our fellow vendors. lets hope this next move will be a long and fruitful one. also ty bisto i will monitor the situation.
thank you for your words rc4 it is good to know that we may come under attack, be robbed, scammed and driven from our homes but as long as we stand together and stand united we can hopefully stay strong and persevereregardsth
for a community to be strong it needs to be held together by strong bonds. we are honored that you also share our beliefs but they are not just our belief, it is because of ross u that our movement was born. we owe it to him to stay true and keep the community together. as long as more people come together and share these beliefs then hopefully we will persevere as brothers, sisters rather than as enemies.

hello guys, im from a country of non-english talking so, i hope you can understand me.im planning a personal onion html-based and very simple "market" only for offer my products in my country, begining with our city, here are a huge market. the problem is that here no exists that kind of "postal blue boxes" (usa) where you can send letters or things just using postage and without interacting with any postal office, the most near thing is buying postage in the office and use it, but i will have to go inside the postal office and let the "package" or "letters" there (without any signing) and when i purchase the postage, ill have to go inside the postal too, so i dont like it because there are cams, etc.i was thinking in "rotatory aleatory in-site drops" inside the city, like this:1. the customer see a product, read the sec instructions and make the purchase, sending his exactly amount bt to our bt adress and the pgp message with the info, that will be the "neighborwood" or some relative geoposition in the city for what we concern.2. we recieve the bt and message, so we go near to the site he send us (without telling anybody, only me for now and never in exactly the site) and simply locate a site for drop the package, maybe in a trash container, in a wall like an marketing object (i dont know how traslate) or whatever, there just be a lot of possibilitys for make this with a liitle of creativity. if i have been intercepted or contacted by le, they will never know where i am exactly, only a relative location that will be a lot of surface for cover. nobody know where is this place, because i "improvise" the place "in site".3. we left the place and when have a good and secure distance, send the last message (encrypted) with the exactly location of the package.so, there always be a distance between me and the customers, in case of le or something, and always  using correct opsec and all required security online and offline (surveillance, etc, etc).let me know what you think!!pd: if you have any other idea for my case, i will appreciate a lot that!!!!! we have learned a lot of experience in sr1, sr2, tcf and all that good forums and good people!!! love your work!!!!
thanks, much appreciation
i also find evo to be a great emerging market. they not only have a lot of fraud related products and tuts but a large and ever growing drug section as well. this market takes security very seriously. the layout is clean and extremely fast. just an all around excellent market a++++
yesterday it was very slow, today i cant log in at all.
its so slow its just about down. i finally logged in but after 10 tries still could not upload a listing.
its a mixed experience. most of yesterday i couldnt log in at all, but since last night i have been able to get in every other attempt and get some work done. right now its being very obstinate, but this is a high traffic period. earlier this morning it was smooth as could be. i suggest you find something else to do for a while and casually(10ish mins apart) try to log in. do not keep spamming the refresh button it only makes it worse.so far i have been able to get in within 2 trys, but i wont even bother trying to log in again until later tonight.
i just got done looking over the info. looks like a wad of fud to me. its not that hard to generate fake details like the ones posted. looks to be formatted in the similar fashion to that of the viewable order page and not as it would be inside of a traditional db system. i could be mistaken, but i call bs on this. also it is known that last weeks attack was a brute force password attack which is why they added the captcha. its entirely possible that a few vendors names and passwords have been compromised and its their own fault for 1) not using a sufficiently strong password, and 2) not changing their passwords the day that this was announced.ie. even though i know for a fact my password was not compromised i changed it anyway. none of us should be using the same password twice either. i have this un registered on ~15 services, and every one of those has its own individual unique password.
there were a few topics on the subject of not being able to log in or not being able to do anything once logged in. all those have been deleted. lets hope they are not going in the direction of sr.
we have only just been registered today as vendors. i will say that once i got in we were stuck and could not navigate the site for long. has this been an ongoing issue? how is the general atmosphere there at the moment? even pandora also seems to be having some difficulties with many support requests becoming unanswered. these are really tough times. lets hope things improve for a whileregardsth
have you considered setting up an electrum wallet? works well with tails and eliminates the need for third party wallets.pb.
i second the notion of contributing a portion of the funds to charity. also, it cant hurt to have many small markets to help diffuse the traffic overload that the bigger markets will most certainly experience.

yeah i was having great difficulty with one of the strings. i think it was the sudo command i needed to add.. it may have been a different one. but all the instructions i found both on the tails website and other places didnt specify the command or say you might need to add it. took a lot of reading to realize it but once it was added it worked smoothly.but when i restarted and hit alt, or used refind, the usb would show up but upon choosing it id get a black screen forever on my old imac.

if you are going to go to that extreme why not just deliver?
bsm seems to be run by one or two people total, so its understandable that something could be overlooked. they have seemed to be pretty proactive about fixing their mistakes.
i just opened up a shop at blueskyi will also be on cannabis road when that market opens as wellhit me up for some of the best weed on the darknet
i cant even get the forum to load today. its definitely down and we will see if they are able to correct the problem or not. i would think that switching the url around like bmr did might help.
its still experiencing a dos attack  patience is the key during situations like this. i remember when sr 1 experienced a dos attack that took down the server for a week. just sit tight and everything will be alright.
i hope this will not be the end for agora, prolonged ddos are always a bad omen
i still cant login at all at the moment, whats the best/quietest time to login?i would have thought in a few hrs from now would be a good time?any thoughts?
quote from: psychosis on march 10, 2014, 07:09:09 ami still cant login at all at the moment, whats the best/quietest time to login?i would have thought in a few hrs from now would be a good time?any thoughts?its fairly random. i have had decent luck very early in the am usa time, and the early evening. the best suggestion is to simply keep trying at it, and eventually you will get lucky and slip past the attacks. just make sure your ready to get whatever you need done immediately. sad as it is who knows if your going to get 2-3 successful page loads for a full hour. treat it like you could get kicked any second and you should be able to make it happen.
they have deleted the threads because people would post multiple nonsense threads in all caps about server downtime when agora has already addressed the issue in a stickied forum post.it has nothing to do with censorship.
what do you think about this crypto???they claims to be the "hidden services" cryptocurrency. i copy/paste from his web:quoteabout the coinanoncoin is mainly targeting to be used through the invisible internet i2p and tor.introducing another layer of security within the cryptocurrency markets by providing new coin features and services to build on top of these. lets get on with the facts.1. the coin cannot be stopped by central banks, or governments.this is is achieved by decentralization, combining the use of clearnet, invisible web, and services. if the coin is being used on i2p or tor there is no way to identify who is operating the nodes and clients. this will in turn enable the production of new, better anonymous services.2. what if the coins are being traced in the blockchain?coin mixer services operating through i2p are in development to put a stop to coins being traced back to any one wallet or person. these will make it possible to mix up coins you have received, or mined by sending them to the mixer service. coins sent there will be mixed with all other coins within the service before being sent to any address of your choosing.3. what are the basic features of anoncoin?there can be 4.2 million coins in existence. the first 42.000 blocks are worth 4.2 anc. the blocks up to 77.777 are worth 7 anc. the blocks from 77.778 are worth 5 anc, then subsidy halves 306600 blocks, every ~2 years. along with the exclusive features this should provide a long and healthy lifespan.4. strength in numbers. crypto, services, and users.anoncoin will keep gaining its strength by the services offered, and the numbers of users utilizing these services. the coin is growing stronger every day, and this gives us an excellent chance to further expand the invisible web services. to all the users and anons already supporting the coin, thank you!--- clearnet alarm ---here are the bitcointalk official post: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=227287.0what do you know or think about this crypto??? any technical or any type advice, issue or something?good vibes!

quote from: rc4every0ne on march 10, 2014, 04:01:56 pmyour right i did get a bit off topic. in no way do i consider agoras security to be without flaws.am glad were past our differences on the issue id meant to highlight.quote from: rc4every0ne on march 10, 2014, 04:01:56 pmthe details posted are copy pasted, or generated by some script. if any vendor had their password compromised then their opsec is even worse than any failing of the market. vendors especially need to use ultra secure passwords as our login names are visible on our profile pages, so all an attacker needs to do is figure out our passwords. were responsible for maintaining not only our safety but that of our clients as well.spot on. likely weak passwords hacked into or possibly some accounts even created by them. besides the captchas, an addtional two factor login is important, so that market users can login by decrypting a snippet with their private key. an essential and additional layer of security to help along with weak or strong passwords. beyond that it all boils down the market users to be on top their own opsec, both physically while sending or receiving goods as well as while communicating online and always encrypted.
bump
im planning this too!!!!! better to get some books and practice a lot before you make "the deal" if you know what i mean... any links or info about this would be so useful here!!!!!
this is a very good marketing plan! im impressed  i hope it really drives up your traffic!
can someone post some of the basics of php? i already do alot of css, html, and a bit of java. php seems to be the way to go on the darknet and would love to learn it
quote from: gumby on march 10, 2014, 10:16:09 pmonline tutorials can be helpful, but if youre a novice to coding (which i cant tell if op is based on "some css, html and java"), in my experience theres no substitute for a good book. i read lots of online tutorials about python but only felt that i really understood it after reading learning python.pro tip: you can find pirated e-copies of most programming books online.yeah, ill prolly go after some of those pirated books. im not a real programmer man in the least man  sorry if i made it sound like i was! i will program arduino chips to put make lights flash and make basic calculators and shit. i hope to get up to the status were i can assemble and program my own rasp-pi  but right now, i wana learn php so i broaden my horizons here in the darknet  html and css im good at though. java, i know what it does and how to costomize it but never make it from the ground up. i am a self taught student  as you can tell by my lingo and wat not
problem has been party resolved and seems like it will be 100% solved shortly. bsm = good people

the past week weve had a huge and unprecedented surge in new users at the bazaar, a lil shy of two thousand users the past week alone and therefore the servers are tad overwhelmed with all this traffic. so we are disabling all new signups temporarily such to accommodate the browsing needs of existing users.as much as wed like to, but were not ready to grow at such breakneck pace, only to fuck up.. like some marketplaces have shown us recently. support for our existing users is a priority, as well as implementing some even more awesome features unseen at marketplaces. we would soon be hiring as well to help us.. as we grow, so stay tuned for our upcoming post on it.again wed also like to thank all our users for showing their trust in our market security which has helped us reach many a milestones. our unique and one of a kind - features speak for themselves. and thanks again for spreading the good word around! cheers to all.
quote from: spaceshit on march 10, 2014, 03:09:39 ammy guess as to why theyre being deleted is because theres already about a million other threads saying the same thing. no need to spam the shit out of the forums with something that everyone already knows about. they are being ddosd as we speak and claim to be working on a solution so that is why the site has been so slow lately. be patient, friend.excactly. if theyre experiencing a heavy dos attack a server full of worthless bullshit threads full of people complaining only worsens the attack. the more "room" they have to work the better.
i cant get in .  kinda giving me the creaps how a few vendors accounts have been comprised.im getting a bad feeling about this market.most of the time the login page wont load.  i have been unable to login for the last 12 hours or so.im praying for a fix.
ive been trying to get in all morning and i get the firefox cant find the page error. definitely a server overload. im trying to get all my orders out before noon but the way its looking that might not happen. the agora account on the forums mentioned a heavy dos attack on 2/25 so apparantly someone is jelous agora is actually making a little money
quote from: honeyray on march 06, 2014, 03:34:24 pmquote from: tyrone on march 06, 2014, 01:50:40 pmwell... there is a reason for that.sr admin is in the second phase of the scam. the scam is using fake feedback on vendor accounts that admin/mods control. they collect the money and send no product.any depth to this whatsoever?i also cannot provide evidence, but i also recognized some vendors (for ex. cokecartel -  send from bolivia) with a lot pages of fb, but nearly nobody of the known c-buyers ever ordered and nobody post a review until today.  i only know of one other guy who told us he ordered. i also ordered last week because of good fb and im very exited if we will receive it.if not im 100 percent sure, that this is not a real vendor-account. then ill post here (and in sr2 for sure)!and in my search for solid vendors i saw a few more which make me speculate in this way. lets see what will come....greets,pathfinder13

does it really matter if we find this guy or not? i feel like this is a pointless search lol

i literally just came from the agora fourms but i cant seem to log in. keeps telling me "an error occured" but i know im typing in correct credentials. to test this i created a new account then logged out and immeditely tried to log back in and couldnt. i dont know whats goin on, but i hope they get it fixed. id just recently got a referral link and im enjoying myself on agora. id hate to see it go.
just wanted to know if any vendors accept ultracoins here as its supposed to be the fastest cryptocurency out right now.  i bought myself a few coins and in transferring between wallets and exchanges it only takes the coins about 20 seconds to arrive to my wallet fully confirmed.  thought that might be a good reason for vendors to start accepting that.  if anyone does please let me know.thank you
you could open a few llcs (shell corporations) that will act as they were actual companies trading and doing business.  you should be able to open bank accounts with these corporations and thus be able to transfer large sums of cash in between different accounts.
i cant even login to the forums. it keeps telling me "an error has occured" "try again in 2 seconds". it doesnt matter how long i wait i still get the same message.

use terminal to mount the iso to the drive. heres the proccess i use  ...howto: burn an iso to a usb drive on your macinsert your thumbdrive. you should see it pop up on your desktop, all nice and mounted, ready for you to use. only it isn’t. if you can see it on your desktop, you can’t use it the way we need to.$ diskutil listyou should see something like this:/dev/disk0   #:      type name                    size       identifier   0:      guid_partition_scheme       *251.0 gb   disk0   1:      efi                          209.7 mb   disk0s1   2:      apple_corestorage            249.8 gb   disk0s2   3:      apple_boot recovery hd       814.4 mb   disk0s3/dev/disk1   #:      type name                    size       identifier   0:      apple_hfs macintosh hd      *249.5 gb   disk1/dev/disk2   #:      type name                    size       identifier   0:      guid_partition_scheme       *1.0 tb     disk2   1:      efi                          209.7 mb   disk2s1   2:      apple_hfs my passport        999.8 gb   disk2s2/dev/disk3   #:      type name                    size       identifier   0:      fdisk_partition_scheme      *1.0 gb     disk3   1:      dos_fat_32 untitled          1.0 gb     disk3s1in the instance above, i’ve noted my thumbdrive – /dev/disk3. it happened to be “untitled”, but it could be whatever name you may have given it. anyhow, we essentially need to unmount everything on that disk, but not remove it completely from the system.$ diskutil unmountdisk /dev/disk3unmount of all volumes on disk3 was successfulthat solves that. now, where is that iso image you have? you need to know where it is so you can copy it to that thumbdrive. by the way – do this on a thumbdrive that is either backed up, or in other ways not useful (like old, and small, whatever). you’ll note the one i’m using is 1g. lol! i got it with a cisco router that i bought. it came with “management” software on it that sucks. but i digress. that thumbdrive, when it’s all over, will have nothing on it but the iso you’re “burning” to it. on to the destructive part…$ sudo dd if=~/desktop/crunchbang-11-20130506-i486.iso of=/dev/rdisk3 bs=128k6168+0 records in6168+0 records out808452096 bytes transferred in 186.954879 secs (4324317 bytes/sec)i should note – you won’t see any activity (more on that in a second). you hit [return] and the computer goes to work, not telling if it’s working or not. dd is one of those classic commands – it ain’t fancy, or pretty, or all high-falutin’. it does one thing, and it does exactly what you told it to do, or it errors. i should also note – if you screw up an point that to something important, like, in my disk list above, disk0? well, you’ll have the joy of reinstalling the os on your mac, most likely.breakdown:?sudo – most of you know what this is. i hope. it allows you to do things as the “superuser” on your mac (i.e., superuser do).?dd – command to convert and copy a file (i don’t know why it’s named that).?if=<filename> – input file?of=<filename> – output file?bs=n – block size… you can use 1m, 1k, 128k – you get the idea. i like 128k, there’s not much speed gained by anything bigger.some of you are looking at that output file location and thinking “where in the heck did he get rdisk3 from??” well… it’s the same location as disk3, only it’s a “raw” device connection. we’re stepping outside the rules a little bit – taking a little known shortcut that doesn’t have any stoplights, if you will. or speed limits. you’ll essentially move the same data in about 1/6th of the time if you /dev/rdisk[n]the last thing that you should do is eject it – but how do you do that, since you can’t drag it to the trash? diskutil still has you covered.$ diskutil eject disk3disk disk3 ejectedif you really need to “see” something, you’ll need to have (or install) pipe viewer. unless you already have some system like macports or homebrew, have it working, and know how to use it, just suck it up and deal with not seeing something. really. i mean it. anyhow, maybe you’re a dork like me, and you have pipe viewer. instead of the dd command we used initially, we’re going to modify it.$ pv -petr ~/desktop/crunchbang-11-20130506-i486.iso | sudo dd of=/dev/rdisk3 bs=128k0:00:33 [4.11mib/s] [========>                                      ] 17% eta 0:02:40there you go. a nice little visual guide for elapsed time, how fast, and an estimate for how long it’s going to take. if you want to know more about pipe viewer, there’s a great article on it here.well. this turned out longer than i expected. anyhow, i hope it helps one of you out there. someday. maybe.pm me if you need qs answered what mac do you have? an older macbookpro?
i think its better to place the item somewhere before you tell the person the general location. if it is le they will watch what everyone does in the area and will likely see you do it. place it somewhere with gps coordinates and a general description like "in the gray trash barrel by the lamp post" or "under the big bush under some leaves with a soda can on top"better still to just buy the stamps somewhere and bring in your package to the post office. they may have a cam but will not be able to connect you to the exact package unless you have to stand in line and give it to the person.
quotei think its better to place the item somewhere before you tell the person the general location. if it is le they will watch what everyone does in the area and will likely see you do it. place it somewhere with gps coordinates and a general description like "in the gray trash barrel by the lamp post" or "under the big bush under some leaves with a soda can on top"i think that will be imposible, because the customer tell me the general location, for example, the neighborhood he lives or near, something like that. that could be a weak point, so ill keep your advice in mind. maybe the solution is a more general location, more surface so the leas cant made a exagerate ring, in the worst case (yep, im that paranoid jaja). the gps coordinate its a great idea, is there any way that i could be identified by have a "gps navigator" or  that kind of signals?.quotebetter still to just buy the stamps somewhere and bring in your package to the post office. they may have a cam but will not be able to connect you to the exact package unless you have to stand in line and give it to the person.well, if they have 10 different videos of "me" in the places where the "letters" or "boxes" were send from, i think that will be very "obvious" or "strange" so, that will be a risk. maybe if theres a way for "distortionate" the cam or something like that??? any idea about this??thanks for your helpful advice and answer organix!!quoteits called a deaddrop and its been done since forever, the buyer has to trust that you arent leo but if you build rep and use pgp in case they are watching your email account then all will be well, just msg them the loc of it and they can pick it up themselveswow deaddrop!! i didnt know that, thanks for that!! thats exactly the idea, make very good reputation, ill be the first here making that kind of bussiness (tor, onion, pgp, you know what i mean), that can be a risk but an advantage too, so i have to do it very secure and well. thanks for your answer!!!any experience about this kind of deliverys?? any other options??sorry if im too intense about this, but i think that this maybe could help another people in countrys like mine!!! thanks!!!
quote from: organix on march 10, 2014, 08:27:25 pmif you have to go to the persons neighborhood that may be a problem. if you hide something in public, many people might see you do it and go dig it up after you leave so it has to be someplace where people will not see you leave it and that can be difficult. you use gps to locate the coordinates of the spot after you leave it and then shut off the gps. no, they cant trace you that way, im sure.dont you have several post offices in your area? you could go to a different one each time and rotate them. it must be easier to do it that way than to drive 100 miles to someone elses neighborhood. perhaps you can do the drop for customers near by and mail it to those farther away?for the first thing, im planning a lot of "hide places" that can be leave there without suspect, i have good ideas but no comment here for security. thanks for gps advice!!!here are less than 30 offices of "public postal enterprise", but a lot more of "private couriers" that require sign and more information, so maybe could be dangerous but i really dont know if that its "a lot" or "a few" offices. many of that offices are in malls so, ill be caught in more cams, more risk!!!!!for shipping all the country (and maybe, just maybe international or continental), postal mail its the better option and i have to think how to send using any service (public/private) without leaving any trace... any idea about this?i really have to resolve this trouble, because in my city i can do with deaddrops, but im planning to expand the bussiness, so yes or yes i have to use mail shipping... if anyone have any idea, ill appreciatte a lot!!!!!!! maybe another options??remember, the problem is that here doesnt exist the "postal boxes" (that blue ones in usa) for send letters or boxes without register anywhere, only using postage. postage can be used here, but i have to buy it in a postal office and send the items in postal offices, without sign any paper but leaving "cam traces" and all stuff that comes with this risk.any idea about how to send items here?thanks guys!!!!!!!
quote from: trc on march 10, 2014, 04:51:20 amif you are going to go to that extreme why not just deliver?well, that will be so dangerous because the person who contact me can be a le of. or a person interested in caught me, so that is not a good idea, the thing is that the customer never know who i am and never know where is the drop until i has gone from there. thanks for your answer anyway. quotei have delivered product via remote controller toy plane beforewow!! that may be a good idea in some cases, but its a "main city", its so big and that will be so rare.i was thinking how to "camouflage" my visits to the postal office, maybe with sunglasses or makeup, something like that. like i said, i have 2 problems: i have to go personally to the office for buy the "postage" and again for ship the package, with "postage" i dont have to give my real name or something, only leave the letters over there but maybe that can be rare.the other option is using a private service like fedex, but again i have to go personally so, that its a risk.do anyone have other options than "postal shipping" that can be commented here???thanks for your attention!!!!!!

same here cant log in to the forums and site doesnt load but after a billion tries.fuck now im wondering if it really got hacked?
i dont think this is fud.  refreshyourself has opened a topic on sr2 saying his account was comprimsed on there as well because he had a simular password.  dumb fuck prob had the same password but any how.  hes a weed dealer here in australia.  i think this is for real.  just my 2 cents.
that guy is full of shit. all he did was look through vendor listings and write down their names. i say we let him turn over all his information to the feds, which they wony be able to do a god damn thing with then someone pays 49 btc to dox this motherfucker so people quit playing these games with this community. i understand dpr1s move of violence was the wrong choice, but i guarantee the word gets out people are paying for hackers to be doxxd they will think a lot harder about it. once he is doxxd he is labeled a rat for the rest of his life and will have a lot more problems on his hand.

this is about the ip address i see next to my post. why the fuck is it my real ip???!?!??!?!?!torbrowser says my ip is different from my real one and i went to "whatismyip.com" said the same ip as the torbrowser, but the the hub forums somehow knows my real one........

my guess as to why theyre being deleted is because theres already about a million other threads saying the same thing. no need to spam the shit out of the forums with something that everyone already knows about. they are being ddosd as we speak and claim to be working on a solution so that is why the site has been so slow lately. be patient, friend.

i noticed its not disabled, there is just a new option where you can have multiple auto withdraw wallets in order to circumvent tracing bitcoin movement in and out of site.
you could open a few llcs (shell corporations) that will act as they were actual companies trading and doing business.  you should be able to open bank accounts with these corporations and thus be able to transfer large sums of cash in between different accounts.
the ip i see is just from my internal ip range, not my external ip address.
scary!

yeah i was having great difficulty with one of the strings. i think it was the sudo command i needed to add.. it may have been a different one. but all the instructions i found both on the tails website and other places didnt specify the command or say you might need to add it. took a lot of reading to realize it but once it was added it worked smoothly.but when i restarted and hit alt, or used refind, the usb would show up but upon choosing it id get a black screen forever on my old imac.

the past week weve had a huge and unprecedented surge in new users at the bazaar, a lil shy of two thousand users the past week alone and therefore the servers are tad overwhelmed with all this traffic. so we are disabling all new signups temporarily such to accommodate the browsing needs of existing users.as much as wed like to, but were not ready to grow at such breakneck pace, only to fuck up.. like some marketplaces have shown us recently. support for our existing users is a priority, as well as implementing some even more awesome features unseen at marketplaces. we would soon be hiring as well to help us.. as we grow, so stay tuned for our upcoming post on it.again wed also like to thank all our users for showing their trust in our market security which has helped us reach many a milestones. our unique and one of a kind - features speak for themselves. and thanks again for spreading the good word around! cheers to all.

bsm seems to be run by one or two people total, so its understandable that something could be overlooked. they have seemed to be pretty proactive about fixing their mistakes.
i was using them as a clean wallet:  buycoinaccount -> bitcoinfog -> campbx never had any trouble with them, but, then they lost one of my transactions, and now i dont like them anymore. i cant imagine that theyre actually a scam site (seem pretty legitimate and ive never seen any bad press about them), but they seem totally lost on tracking down the transaction, and posting to my account. ive sent them the blockchain.info links proving that the coins hit the right deposit address, and all they do is keep sending stupid questions, over and over. if they are a scam site, i guess theyre waiting for me to get tired and just give up on the fairly small amount of coins? maybe, its working...

there is no mention of the dangers of mixing lsd and lithium.  theres alot of varying information out there but it seems as though this could be a very harmful combination. i recently discovered that when helping a freind intersted in lsd see if he was prepared for it.  thankfully we found information from a few reliabel sources then led us to the conclusion that taking lsd while taking lithium isnt a good idea. is this aleady common knowledge?

i posted this at the outlaw_market subreddit yet thought it was worthwhile posting here as well...ive been ordering recreational meds through the dark web for a couple of years now and ive probably tried most of the major markets during that time -- silk road, silk road 2, sheep, bmr, agora, and most recently, outlaw. my experiences have varied wildly. overall, my experience with silk road was good and feel dpr operated a bone fide market, but we all know how that ended up. bmr, sheep, sr2 all ended up being scams. ive been using agora a lot recently but lately have had difficulty with getting a response and cant even log in today (deja-vu). the net result is that i lost my escrow funds on my last and final order for each of these markets.i kinda figured that this was just a cost of doing business on the dark web and resigned myself to the fact that while a market may appear legit, in the end i was always going to lose some btc either through le action or more likely scammer ops. (i recently got stung by the whole mt. gox fiasco, which imo was the largest scam of all perpetrated by that fat little frenchman in cahoots with some big crime sydicates, but i digress....)i think outlaw is different, although it is a little early to tell for sure. theyve been around for a few months and have built a pretty impressive platform (im a software engineer in my day job). sure the web site design could use some work, but the security and functionality of the backend is impressive. this took some investment to build and wasnt some quick bitwasp site quickly thrown together for the purposes of running off with users escrow funds. its custom software and a solid marketplace platform.the other thing that is giving me some good vibes is great customer support. i placed my first order with a vendor (turtletime) i used on another site and got my goods in a few days. im based in the us, so doing business with a us-based vendor cuts out the risk and delays of customs from international vendors. there is a dedicated us admin who seems pretty focused on serving this area.im going to keep using outlaw and post more about my experiences as a sample size of 1 doesnt really count statistically.craig
email is email. you arent going to get around the fact that the headers give up tons of info even if you pgp all the things.i2p-bote is the superior solutionyour address is simply a public key. the emails are stored in a dht over all the nodes. the only thing that really is not able to be hidden is how many times you check your email and how many emails that you get. but since it hides damn neary everything else, its a much better system.
i am getting the same error.
hey guys, is anyone else experiencing this problem? all of my credentials are correct but it keeps saying "an error has occured" "you will have to wait about 2 seconds to login again, sorry." i can wait 5 minutes and it still tells me the same thing. any input would be greatly appreciated. thanks.

yeah i was having great difficulty with one of the strings. i think it was the sudo command i needed to add.. it may have been a different one. but all the instructions i found both on the tails website and other places didnt specify the command or say you might need to add it. took a lot of reading to realize it but once it was added it worked smoothly.but when i restarted and hit alt, or used refind, the usb would show up but upon choosing it id get a black screen forever on my old imac.

i just opened up a shop at blueskyi will also be on cannabis road when that market opens as wellhit me up for some of the best weed on the darknet
ive been trying to get in all morning and i get the firefox cant find the page error. definitely a server overload. im trying to get all my orders out before noon but the way its looking that might not happen. the agora account on the forums mentioned a heavy dos attack on 2/25 so apparantly someone is jelous agora is actually making a little money
i cant get in .  kinda giving me the creaps how a few vendors accounts have been comprised.im getting a bad feeling about this market.most of the time the login page wont load.  i have been unable to login for the last 12 hours or so.im praying for a fix.
i dont think this is fud.  refreshyourself has opened a topic on sr2 saying his account was comprimsed on there as well because he had a simular password.  dumb fuck prob had the same password but any how.  hes a weed dealer here in australia.  i think this is for real.  just my 2 cents.
that guy is full of shit. all he did was look through vendor listings and write down their names. i say we let him turn over all his information to the feds, which they wony be able to do a god damn thing with then someone pays 49 btc to dox this motherfucker so people quit playing these games with this community. i understand dpr1s move of violence was the wrong choice, but i guarantee the word gets out people are paying for hackers to be doxxd they will think a lot harder about it. once he is doxxd he is labeled a rat for the rest of his life and will have a lot more problems on his hand.
sorry to beat a dead horse but how many times has this happened? dpr2 "himself" did it to tormarket. guess what, no one got in trouble. i say let this cocksucker squeal like a pig. any documents he gives to cops will have their personal name on it and will be public knowledge in no time. that would be a sad life on the run after giving up a few passwords that are easibly changeable in 2 minutes. oh and  hasnt evenyone figured out to use pgp by now? this guys a joker. especially posting it on reddit: the place where high school hackers go to die.
quote from: spaceshit on march 10, 2014, 03:09:39 ammy guess as to why theyre being deleted is because theres already about a million other threads saying the same thing. no need to spam the shit out of the forums with something that everyone already knows about. they are being ddosd as we speak and claim to be working on a solution so that is why the site has been so slow lately. be patient, friend.excactly. if theyre experiencing a heavy dos attack a server full of worthless bullshit threads full of people complaining only worsens the attack. the more "room" they have to work the better.
i posted this at the outlaw_market subreddit yet thought it was worthwhile posting here as well...ive been ordering recreational meds through the dark web for a couple of years now and ive probably tried most of the major markets during that time -- silk road, silk road 2, sheep, bmr, agora, and most recently, outlaw. my experiences have varied wildly. overall, my experience with silk road was good and feel dpr operated a bone fide market, but we all know how that ended up. bmr, sheep, sr2 all ended up being scams. ive been using agora a lot recently but lately have had difficulty with getting a response and cant even log in today (deja-vu). the net result is that i lost my escrow funds on my last and final order for each of these markets.i kinda figured that this was just a cost of doing business on the dark web and resigned myself to the fact that while a market may appear legit, in the end i was always going to lose some btc either through le action or more likely scammer ops. (i recently got stung by the whole mt. gox fiasco, which imo was the largest scam of all perpetrated by that fat little frenchman in cahoots with some big crime sydicates, but i digress....)i think outlaw is different, although it is a little early to tell for sure. theyve been around for a few months and have built a pretty impressive platform (im a software engineer in my day job). sure the web site design could use some work, but the security and functionality of the backend is impressive. this took some investment to build and wasnt some quick bitwasp site quickly thrown together for the purposes of running off with users escrow funds. its custom software and a solid marketplace platform.the other thing that is giving me some good vibes is great customer support. i placed my first order with a vendor (turtletime) i used on another site and got my goods in a few days. im based in the us, so doing business with a us-based vendor cuts out the risk and delays of customs from international vendors. there is a dedicated us admin who seems pretty focused on serving this area.im going to keep using outlaw and post more about my experiences as a sample size of 1 doesnt really count statistically.craig
hey guys thought it would be cool to give recognition to those who donate to the site, and help us move forward. i personally feel this is the only community i would donate to. myself i will be sending 30-40$ worth of coins later today . lets give some recognition to those helping! post below with how much you've donated so far!also mods if you'd like to chime in with what these donations will go to that would be sweet. future updates or projects planned ect ect..
there is no mention of the dangers of mixing lsd and lithium.  theres alot of varying information out there but it seems as though this could be a very harmful combination. i recently discovered that when helping a freind intersted in lsd see if he was prepared for it.  thankfully we found information from a few reliabel sources then led us to the conclusion that taking lsd while taking lithium isnt a good idea. is this aleady common knowledge?

quote from: rc4every0ne on march 10, 2014, 04:01:56 pmyour right i did get a bit off topic. in no way do i consider agoras security to be without flaws.am glad were past our differences on the issue id meant to highlight.quote from: rc4every0ne on march 10, 2014, 04:01:56 pmthe details posted are copy pasted, or generated by some script. if any vendor had their password compromised then their opsec is even worse than any failing of the market. vendors especially need to use ultra secure passwords as our login names are visible on our profile pages, so all an attacker needs to do is figure out our passwords. were responsible for maintaining not only our safety but that of our clients as well.spot on. likely weak passwords hacked into or possibly some accounts even created by them. besides the captchas, an addtional two factor login is important, so that market users can login by decrypting a snippet with their private key. an essential and additional layer of security to help along with weak or strong passwords. beyond that it all boils down the market users to be on top their own opsec, both physically while sending or receiving goods as well as while communicating online and always encrypted.
just wanted to know if any vendors accept ultracoins here as its supposed to be the fastest cryptocurency out right now.  i bought myself a few coins and in transferring between wallets and exchanges it only takes the coins about 20 seconds to arrive to my wallet fully confirmed.  thought that might be a good reason for vendors to start accepting that.  if anyone does please let me know.thank you

i cant even login to the forums. it keeps telling me "an error has occured" "try again in 2 seconds". it doesnt matter how long i wait i still get the same message.
i noticed its not disabled, there is just a new option where you can have multiple auto withdraw wallets in order to circumvent tracing bitcoin movement in and out of site.
you could open a few llcs (shell corporations) that will act as they were actual companies trading and doing business.  you should be able to open bank accounts with these corporations and thus be able to transfer large sums of cash in between different accounts.
the ip i see is just from my internal ip range, not my external ip address.
scary!
its amazing in this day and age people still do not take the time to learn pgp..

yeah i was having great difficulty with one of the strings. i think it was the sudo command i needed to add.. it may have been a different one. but all the instructions i found both on the tails website and other places didnt specify the command or say you might need to add it. took a lot of reading to realize it but once it was added it worked smoothly.but when i restarted and hit alt, or used refind, the usb would show up but upon choosing it id get a black screen forever on my old imac.

the past week weve had a huge and unprecedented surge in new users at the bazaar, a lil shy of two thousand users the past week alone and therefore the servers are tad overwhelmed with all this traffic. so we are disabling all new signups temporarily such to accommodate the browsing needs of existing users.as much as wed like to, but were not ready to grow at such breakneck pace, only to fuck up.. like some marketplaces have shown us recently. support for our existing users is a priority, as well as implementing some even more awesome features unseen at marketplaces. we would soon be hiring as well to help us.. as we grow, so stay tuned for our upcoming post on it.again wed also like to thank all our users for showing their trust in our market security which has helped us reach many a milestones. our unique and one of a kind - features speak for themselves. and thanks again for spreading the good word around! cheers to all.
its called a deaddrop and its been done since forever, the buyer has to trust that you arent leo but if you build rep and use pgp in case they are watching your email account then all will be well, just msg them the loc of it and they can pick it up themselves

bsm seems to be run by one or two people total, so its understandable that something could be overlooked. they have seemed to be pretty proactive about fixing their mistakes.
i was using them as a clean wallet:  buycoinaccount -> bitcoinfog -> campbx never had any trouble with them, but, then they lost one of my transactions, and now i dont like them anymore. i cant imagine that theyre actually a scam site (seem pretty legitimate and ive never seen any bad press about them), but they seem totally lost on tracking down the transaction, and posting to my account. ive sent them the blockchain.info links proving that the coins hit the right deposit address, and all they do is keep sending stupid questions, over and over. if they are a scam site, i guess theyre waiting for me to get tired and just give up on the fairly small amount of coins? maybe, its working...
campbx is reputable although they dont send fiat to bank accounts lately. they are trying to find a new bank to work with.i have had no trouble with them in the past
hey guys, is anyone else experiencing this problem? all of my credentials are correct but it keeps saying "an error has occured" "you will have to wait about 2 seconds to login again, sorry." i can wait 5 minutes and it still tells me the same thing. any input would be greatly appreciated. thanks.

so i have just begun the process of putting up some listings. let me say that it may take some time with the attacks going on. lets hope im done by the morning.
same here cant log in to the forums and site doesnt load but after a billion tries.fuck now im wondering if it really got hacked?
worhts a try for surewas impressed also with some of its services
this is a very good marketing plan! im impressed  i hope it really drives up your traffic!
if you are going to go to that extreme why not just deliver?
email is email. you arent going to get around the fact that the headers give up tons of info even if you pgp all the things.i2p-bote is the superior solutionyour address is simply a public key. the emails are stored in a dht over all the nodes. the only thing that really is not able to be hidden is how many times you check your email and how many emails that you get. but since it hides damn neary everything else, its a much better system.
does it really matter if we find this guy or not? i feel like this is a pointless search lol

i think its better to place the item somewhere before you tell the person the general location. if it is le they will watch what everyone does in the area and will likely see you do it. place it somewhere with gps coordinates and a general description like "in the gray trash barrel by the lamp post" or "under the big bush under some leaves with a soda can on top"better still to just buy the stamps somewhere and bring in your package to the post office. they may have a cam but will not be able to connect you to the exact package unless you have to stand in line and give it to the person.

quote from: organix on march 10, 2014, 08:27:25 pmif you have to go to the persons neighborhood that may be a problem. if you hide something in public, many people might see you do it and go dig it up after you leave so it has to be someplace where people will not see you leave it and that can be difficult. you use gps to locate the coordinates of the spot after you leave it and then shut off the gps. no, they cant trace you that way, im sure.dont you have several post offices in your area? you could go to a different one each time and rotate them. it must be easier to do it that way than to drive 100 miles to someone elses neighborhood. perhaps you can do the drop for customers near by and mail it to those farther away?for the first thing, im planning a lot of "hide places" that can be leave there without suspect, i have good ideas but no comment here for security. thanks for gps advice!!!here are less than 30 offices of "public postal enterprise", but a lot more of "private couriers" that require sign and more information, so maybe could be dangerous but i really dont know if that its "a lot" or "a few" offices. many of that offices are in malls so, ill be caught in more cams, more risk!!!!!for shipping all the country (and maybe, just maybe international or continental), postal mail its the better option and i have to think how to send using any service (public/private) without leaving any trace... any idea about this?i really have to resolve this trouble, because in my city i can do with deaddrops, but im planning to expand the bussiness, so yes or yes i have to use mail shipping... if anyone have any idea, ill appreciatte a lot!!!!!!! maybe another options??remember, the problem is that here doesnt exist the "postal boxes" (that blue ones in usa) for send letters or boxes without register anywhere, only using postage. postage can be used here, but i have to buy it in a postal office and send the items in postal offices, without sign any paper but leaving "cam traces" and all stuff that comes with this risk.any idea about how to send items here?thanks guys!!!!!!!
quote from: trc on march 10, 2014, 04:51:20 amif you are going to go to that extreme why not just deliver?well, that will be so dangerous because the person who contact me can be a le of. or a person interested in caught me, so that is not a good idea, the thing is that the customer never know who i am and never know where is the drop until i has gone from there. thanks for your answer anyway. quotei have delivered product via remote controller toy plane beforewow!! that may be a good idea in some cases, but its a "main city", its so big and that will be so rare.i was thinking how to "camouflage" my visits to the postal office, maybe with sunglasses or makeup, something like that. like i said, i have 2 problems: i have to go personally to the office for buy the "postage" and again for ship the package, with "postage" i dont have to give my real name or something, only leave the letters over there but maybe that can be rare.the other option is using a private service like fedex, but again i have to go personally so, that its a risk.do anyone have other options than "postal shipping" that can be commented here???thanks for your attention!!!!!!

i feel i should add.... my intentions are not to spread fud. couldnt be further from it. i just want to know wtf is going on and why the hell my .51 btc and my account disappeared into the ether. i will delete or update this post as soon as this issue is resolved.
just wanted to know if any vendors accept ultracoins here as its supposed to be the fastest cryptocurency out right now.  i bought myself a few coins and in transferring between wallets and exchanges it only takes the coins about 20 seconds to arrive to my wallet fully confirmed.  thought that might be a good reason for vendors to start accepting that.  if anyone does please let me know.thank you

i cant even get the forum to load today. its definitely down and we will see if they are able to correct the problem or not. i would think that switching the url around like bmr did might help.

they have deleted the threads because people would post multiple nonsense threads in all caps about server downtime when agora has already addressed the issue in a stickied forum post.it has nothing to do with censorship.
what do you think about this crypto???they claims to be the "hidden services" cryptocurrency. i copy/paste from his web:quoteabout the coinanoncoin is mainly targeting to be used through the invisible internet i2p and tor.introducing another layer of security within the cryptocurrency markets by providing new coin features and services to build on top of these. lets get on with the facts.1. the coin cannot be stopped by central banks, or governments.this is is achieved by decentralization, combining the use of clearnet, invisible web, and services. if the coin is being used on i2p or tor there is no way to identify who is operating the nodes and clients. this will in turn enable the production of new, better anonymous services.2. what if the coins are being traced in the blockchain?coin mixer services operating through i2p are in development to put a stop to coins being traced back to any one wallet or person. these will make it possible to mix up coins you have received, or mined by sending them to the mixer service. coins sent there will be mixed with all other coins within the service before being sent to any address of your choosing.3. what are the basic features of anoncoin?there can be 4.2 million coins in existence. the first 42.000 blocks are worth 4.2 anc. the blocks up to 77.777 are worth 7 anc. the blocks from 77.778 are worth 5 anc, then subsidy halves 306600 blocks, every ~2 years. along with the exclusive features this should provide a long and healthy lifespan.4. strength in numbers. crypto, services, and users.anoncoin will keep gaining its strength by the services offered, and the numbers of users utilizing these services. the coin is growing stronger every day, and this gives us an excellent chance to further expand the invisible web services. to all the users and anons already supporting the coin, thank you!--- clearnet alarm ---here are the bitcointalk official post: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=227287.0what do you know or think about this crypto??? any technical or any type advice, issue or something?good vibes!
could be that the support were disorganized and made a mistake, i have heard only good things about bsm.hope you get refunded.
problem has been party resolved and seems like it will be 100% solved shortly. bsm = good people
recanting my previous statement for those who saw it

im planning this too!!!!! better to get some books and practice a lot before you make "the deal" if you know what i mean... any links or info about this would be so useful here!!!!!
yeah i was having great difficulty with one of the strings. i think it was the sudo command i needed to add.. it may have been a different one. but all the instructions i found both on the tails website and other places didnt specify the command or say you might need to add it. took a lot of reading to realize it but once it was added it worked smoothly.but when i restarted and hit alt, or used refind, the usb would show up but upon choosing it id get a black screen forever on my old imac.

i just got online to get horny. not have to use my brain!
the past week weve had a huge and unprecedented surge in new users at the bazaar, a lil shy of two thousand users the past week alone and therefore the servers are tad overwhelmed with all this traffic. so we are disabling all new signups temporarily such to accommodate the browsing needs of existing users.as much as wed like to, but were not ready to grow at such breakneck pace, only to fuck up.. like some marketplaces have shown us recently. support for our existing users is a priority, as well as implementing some even more awesome features unseen at marketplaces. we would soon be hiring as well to help us.. as we grow, so stay tuned for our upcoming post on it.again wed also like to thank all our users for showing their trust in our market security which has helped us reach many a milestones. our unique and one of a kind - features speak for themselves. and thanks again for spreading the good word around! cheers to all.
its called a deaddrop and its been done since forever, the buyer has to trust that you arent leo but if you build rep and use pgp in case they are watching your email account then all will be well, just msg them the loc of it and they can pick it up themselves
ive had some great luck with: http://bitblendervrfkzr.onionworks very fast, and charges a straight 2% per tumble.  id feel better about using it when it gets more users, which would make it more anonymous  as it would have a larger pool of btc to mix with.

bsm seems to be run by one or two people total, so its understandable that something could be overlooked. they have seemed to be pretty proactive about fixing their mistakes.
i was using them as a clean wallet:  buycoinaccount -> bitcoinfog -> campbx never had any trouble with them, but, then they lost one of my transactions, and now i dont like them anymore. i cant imagine that theyre actually a scam site (seem pretty legitimate and ive never seen any bad press about them), but they seem totally lost on tracking down the transaction, and posting to my account. ive sent them the blockchain.info links proving that the coins hit the right deposit address, and all they do is keep sending stupid questions, over and over. if they are a scam site, i guess theyre waiting for me to get tired and just give up on the fairly small amount of coins? maybe, its working...
campbx is reputable although they dont send fiat to bank accounts lately. they are trying to find a new bank to work with.i have had no trouble with them in the past
hey guys, is anyone else experiencing this problem? all of my credentials are correct but it keeps saying "an error has occured" "you will have to wait about 2 seconds to login again, sorry." i can wait 5 minutes and it still tells me the same thing. any input would be greatly appreciated. thanks.
