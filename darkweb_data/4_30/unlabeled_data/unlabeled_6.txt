according to all his words accentuate about traffic... a good market requires traffic.easy handling, no problems for deposits, no problems for withdrawals, good system for contact pgp, correct communication with admins ,  etc.for now it is fast and safe. cheers !!
seconded, fast and smooth from the buyer point of view too.what was the bluesky fud spread on the silk road forums when bluesky first opened?  i dont remember seeing that.
there are many far more knowledgable than me, but i'll answer a bit to help you along.coinbase is probably the most coin for your buck when it comes to easy places to buy bitcoin. there are other ways that you can buy cheaper bitcoins (btc-e), but its a royal pain in the ass if you live in the us.you can make and have as many wallets as you want to store your bitcoin in, either on your computer, or online. blockchain.info is trusted for online wallets. i am currently looking into running electrum from tails as a more secure wallet setup, and i believe that is the consensus for good basic opsec (operational security).i would reccomend that you use tails to minimize the possibility of your computer leaking info about you. it also makes things like pgp and otr messaging way easier as its all included in the os.its really easy to set up too, just download the iso image, and mount it to a dvd, thumb drive, or sd card. https://tails.boum.org/
kiinnostaisi kyllä tietää, että mitä tämä kansainvälistyminen käytännössä tarkoittaa.
miksi pitää mennä kansainväliseksi? miksi edes ulkomaalaisia kiinnostaisi tämä kauppapaikka, niillähän on monia muita sitä varten. itse ainakin toivoisin että tämä pysyisi vain suomalaisten keskuudessa, eikä edes tarvitsisi mainostaa liikaa ettei täältä rupea alaikäiset tilaamaan tavaraa ja saa lukea sitten lehdistä kun ovat päätyneet sairaalaan.

it had been rather slow taking off, but am guessing thats the case with every new market as there are so many to chose from, and then folks are very wary with all new dnms.. from having been scammed multiple times lately. it takes time to build trust and for folks to part with their coins over a relatively new marketplace. but that said things have picked up over the last couple of weeks, mostly migrants from agora and the registrations have been steadily growing by the day.that in turn has brought about a good momentum in sales, but unfortunately for you its mostly from the drug selections and not ccs. though there have been a few cc inquiries on the support forum to which you could chip in. also i guess theres only so much a market can do after all. offer free vendor accounts for a couple of months along with zero commisions on all orders etc. payout bonus for referrals besides making sure by having a secure and bug free site for smooth transactions, but guess then the onus lies with the site users to get the good word around and refer their clients. were gradually getting there and good things take time!
i checked out the site, and was not impressed. the site requires too much from you, slow, and now unresponsive.too little freedom on the site. not even sure how people are meant to see your listings, when you cant see them yourself.
i mean its always so fast and smooth. almost never a hiccup, its refreshing. i just wish the traffic would pick up a bit. the sr forums bashed bsm in the beginning as being a "scam" and they halted the growth. but i think the last 4 months have easily been my most flawless vending experience on the dn. the guys running it aare always making improvments. this makes me feel like its not some quick hit & run scam like smp, they simply spend so much time improving and adding security. post your experience at bsm in this thread!
quote from: damiel on march 16, 2014, 08:51:46 pmseconded, fast and smooth from the buyer point of view too.what was the bluesky fud spread on the silk road forums when bluesky first opened?  i dont remember seeing that.right around christmas when sr was hitting rough waters a few people posted links for bsm, agora, and pandora. bsm was instantly deemed "a scam". then nobody mentioned it anymore. for the last 3-4 months bsm has been anything but a scam. agora does that "referral" program where people get paid to spam their address so it was way overhyped and is probably going to be the first to fall. it got too big too fast. blue sky has had time to mature and from what the staff told me they are only at like 2% capacity so i feel like it will be around longer than the other two. sr forums pretty much dictate what happens w/ dnms and they jumped the gun on bsm basically halting growth. but as it perseveres and outlasts market after market, it will grow. the admins are always updating things. its really nice to see a market where the operators really care.
i was also impressed with the deposit time. i used blockchains tumbling service for the first time to do my deposit (i had always used bitcoinfog before) and my btc was in my bsm wallet within twenty minutes. i was very happy and impressed.i have a thought on "partial-fe": why dont we rename that option to "down payment".. lol
quote from: firelight on march 16, 2014, 02:48:37 ambest option is to run tor browser with its many privacy and security patches. if youre running a tor middle box, presumably you are running linux on the main box? whonix developers recommend to run it in a vm to hide hardware serial numbers, mac address, etc.i use this script as start-tor-browser to run tor browser without tor (so no tor over tor).#!/bin/bashexport tor_skip_launch=1    cd ~~/tor-browser_en-us/browser/firefox --profile ~/tor-browser_en-us/data/browser/profile.defaulti agree with firelight.  thats the easiest, simplest method to end up with a decent browser on your isolated box without reinventing the wheel.and before i picked any weird platforms for my middlebox (android, etc), id make sure i understood how their random number generation worked in practice.   some small platforms (raspberry pi) have hardware rng built in, but im not clear on what its contribution is to the cprng that feeds /dev/random and /dev/urandom.   good rngs are more than a little bit important in that scenario.

hello,it doesnt matter where you advertise.you are only once allowed to enter the event.greetings
what is happening with tba? i have seen some people starting to push out referral links hoping to cream off some buyers that use tba but other than that i have heard nothing. nothing at all. i logged on today, 4 days before i have been there for 2 months and i am still yet to sell a thing. im not complaining, i am here wondering why with sr2 going down, agora under ddos, people saying pandora vendors scam, there hasnt been a bigger charge towards tba.to just sit there doesnt bother me, i check in every few days to see if i have any questions to answer or orders to fill but i never have. is there not many vendors on tba or are buyers put off for some reason?
its the mentality. this is what goes through peoples heads tor bazzar? no listings. fuck that! agora? ddos? lots of stuff? well if they have lots of stuff ill go there! no one really cares about security it seems. im just waiting for mst to be implemented then i will push it hard to the people who value security + knows how a computer works. then we should have many tech savvy smart people buying + selling.
have you tried blockchains shared btc service? it has a small fee compared to bitcoinfog
silk road is not, i repeat, not an established marketplace. sr is in total turmoil and spiraling downward. silk road is a clusterfuck market with zero support. on the marker or the forum! you will make defcon very happy if you use his site. because he will steal from you. le (law enforcement) will also be very happy because they are monitering the site vigorously looking for you.use sr = do not pass go. pay thousands in fines and attorney fees! go directly to jail!
agora was started by some bitcoin fog staff, and agora is currently suffering a ddos attack, plus a huge influx of customers.its possible that theyre on the same servers or hosted by the same data center, so the attack could also be affecting the fog as well as agora.just a theory, as im certainly no expert in dark web matters, or anything like that.peace.
one of the nicer security features of tails is that if the usb drive or dvd its being run from gets removed from the computer, it immediately tries to shut down and wipe ram to prevent a cold boot attack. sure, yanking your usb out while mounted may corrupt it but thats what backups are for.
not les style. thieving postie?
i assume you mean luks/dm-crypt? i think that rubber hose cryptanalysis, keylogging, or other coersive methods of recovery are more feasable than them breaking the encryption my a mathmatical route. modern crypto tends to be extremely secure at the math level. even 3des which is based on a broken cypher, is infeasable to brute force. id be far more worried about picking a good passphrase that cannot be guessed and backing up my encrypted data.

im new to the market so im not sure how long a withdrawal from here should take. is it normal for it to take more than a few hours for the withdrawal queue to process the withdrawals?
ive read many reports of slow deposits or slow withdrawals from btc fog over the past couple of months. (had a withdrawal myself that showed as complete on fog, but no trace on blockchain, which completed perfectly, if a little later than i had hoped)what i havent seen is someone complaining that their transaction never completed.personally, i trust bitcoin fog (had a few blips where i doubted, i must admit), but dont use them if theres any kind of urgency with your transaction, is my advice.peace.
thanks everyone for the great advice!  luv this place!

the only negative experience ive had with bsm is while browsing the market, every so often ill randomly get signed out and have to sign back in. i figure its probably just a bug somewhere and dont think its a big issue. once in a while ive had to sign in 2-3 times within a 30-45 minute session.
ive had a little play around on there. it feels nice.
wanted to ask people been looking around seems kind of complicated. can anyone tell me what they think is better a dump phone or a encrypted phone??and how to make or acquire an encrypted phone?? thought it might be a good idea considering the line of work im in.
it seems they havent been paying customers for the past few days.seen this problem posted everywhere.
thnaks for informing usseems we need all stop orering from there..so eventually their only business left will be support our requeststoo bad.. and pandora seemed so good
hypothetically, if you receive a letter from india that was torn at the top but taped closed.  and then there was nothing in it but about 1 cm of lined blank paper.  in such a sitation, would one be afraid to even message vendor admitting receipt of the item or if not that, would one be afriad that the vendor who has lots of positive transactions did in fact put something else in it which is now in the hands of god knows who.  thx

so... 2 months and a half...a little recap :- late december, i ordered a gram of #4 heroin from thatoneguy and stayed in escrow cause he allowed it.- a few days later, he openly told on his profile that he was a scammer, he took down all of his listings and never came back on his account since then.quote    you should never fe, under any circumstances.    for all who did not fe, your coin will be returned.    for all who fed. let this be a lesson that you can not let yourself trust someone with a sly tongue, that is not verified.    i could have been le. im not. but you handed your addresses to me like you couldnt care less.    i have refunded those who have messaged me with genuine talks about their money and how they will not fe.    i feel this is the only way people will ever learn.    youre coin is being donated to a random charity, helping bitcoin grow.    -thatoneguy-- naturally, i entered a dispute, asking 100% refund.- i thought it was going to be fast, i was active on bmr (god i miss it) and disputes were solved quickly, but nothing in the following days and weeks.- i began to write to support. supportde is the only one who responded. very nice. said he was going to transmit to alice.- still nothing. then i created a few threads and talked about it on the forums.- i contacted supportde again a week ago, he was surprised that i still havent had my coins back. promised to tell it to alice.now im still waiting. im gonna keep everyone informed. this money is not that important to me, but i think everyone should be aware of the flaws of the escrow system on pandora.cheers !

one of the things ive always wondered is how we know we can trust these site operators. it would be so easy for a malicious entity to set up an "annonamous" email service, then monitor everything in it. i know best practice is to assume all comms are monitored, and to use pgp. if that is the case, why use a hidden email at all? why not gmail, or yahoo? in worst case scenario theory, they are no better than a darknet email service.
all seems to be absolutely fine now, even the sticky has disappeared from the forum. wonder if they paid whoever was doing it to go away?
thanks!

hello everybody, i am attempting to start a new marketplace called aurora marketplace. it is hosted on i2p. as it is in its extreme developmental period, i was wondering how i might start off. my torchat is "4ihtrfpb52xdqjhq" is you have any ideas. once again, i thank this wonderful community. here is the link: http://k3wqso2b6ptqw6g5xfefnnxfcd6hra7lshqrcmuiyljffdg4ptda.b32.i2p/ or aurora.i2pupdate 1: ok, i have mainly found weed, so the place will be called aurora weed. it is no longer in its extreme developmental period, more like the finishing up period. i will update when aurora weed is finished. thanks again!

ive read many reports of slow deposits or slow withdrawals from btc fog over the past couple of months. (had a withdrawal myself that showed as complete on fog, but no trace on blockchain, which completed perfectly, if a little later than i had hoped)what i havent seen is someone complaining that their transaction never completed.personally, i trust bitcoin fog (had a few blips where i doubted, i must admit), but dont use them if theres any kind of urgency with your transaction, is my advice.peace.

hello everybody, i am attempting to start a new marketplace called aurora marketplace. it is hosted on i2p. as it is in its extreme developmental period, i was wondering how i might start off. my torchat is "4ihtrfpb52xdqjhq" is you have any ideas. once again, i thank this wonderful community. here is the link: http://k3wqso2b6ptqw6g5xfefnnxfcd6hra7lshqrcmuiyljffdg4ptda.b32.i2p/ or aurora.i2pupdate 1: ok, i have mainly found weed, so the place will be called aurora weed. it is no longer in its extreme developmental period, more like the finishing up period. i will update when aurora weed is finished. thanks again!
one of the nicer security features of tails is that if the usb drive or dvd its being run from gets removed from the computer, it immediately tries to shut down and wipe ram to prevent a cold boot attack. sure, yanking your usb out while mounted may corrupt it but thats what backups are for.
ive read many reports of slow deposits or slow withdrawals from btc fog over the past couple of months. (had a withdrawal myself that showed as complete on fog, but no trace on blockchain, which completed perfectly, if a little later than i had hoped)what i havent seen is someone complaining that their transaction never completed.personally, i trust bitcoin fog (had a few blips where i doubted, i must admit), but dont use them if theres any kind of urgency with your transaction, is my advice.peace.
not les style. thieving postie?
thanks everyone for the great advice!  luv this place!

a hong kong based financial start up is currently building a data base of potential customers prior to launching a global multi crypto currency trading platform. (their words not mine!)registrations are still open and require no more than a user name, email address and password.your account will receive small amounts daily of bitcoin litecoin infinitecoin fedoracoin and more.theres no catch as far as i can see ... their spam and privacy policies look good ... but i should warn you some of their applications require java script.http://qoinpro.com/d131c5e6eb5597926536e0cb352ab2fdthe way i see it is this ... in 2009 btc were worth .0001$ ... (oh how i wish i had been clever enough to buy some then) ... now if any of the new ccs start to rival btc in value i will have entered the market at base level ... and at no cost!

i cant access to agora, this happened to me many times before, but not so many times so much time, i cant access since 3 hours more or less, and i tryed access one time, another and another. somebody have the same issue? and one question, why agora have so much problems many times to can connect? somebody know this?i hope that after sleep when i wake up in 12 hours works fine, because i waiting for place a order. i use the same link as always, i dont think that the problem its for that, no way, surely the servers are overload, or many new users on the market and they need more servers.
god damn i miss ssbd. i want to get a bunch of people to sign a card somehow. how this can be done, i havent gotten around to yet.
at the moment we also cant get on, we have been trying all morning. our shop on sr2 is still up and running if anybody is desperate for anything. we havent got round to putting any listings on pandora as yet, but hope to asap.anyway, fingers crossed for agora, lets hope things get sorted soon th
i managed to get in about 90 mins back, and still have access. access is getting a bit spotty now though. i really hope they get this sorted out soon.
tba is a nice little site, but sr2 is far from going down, im getting more orders than ever there.

bitcoin fog is still no. 1. blockchain.info discontinued send shared some time ago and now only offers their coinjoin service shared coin. if you use shared coin remember it may be inexpensive but is not as anonymous as bitcoin fog, in a coinjoin mixer the transaction chain is never completely broken. just made highly ambiguous.
i prefer blockchain shared coin for financial reasons. its also generally much faster.for some reason i have been having trouble with shared coin lately so ive just been transferring to a market and trading the coin for a fiat currency then eventually buying back btc for about .5%

in my previous post i was mostly playing devils advocate. in reality, im sure that the majority of darknet email services log less information, share less information, and thus are more secure in that way. if youre using pgp, then all theyll be able to see is the pgp garbled text. but the big commercial email providers definitley do scan every email, and do all kinds of meta-analysis. if its for nothing other than advertising, and that analysis never gets shared outside the company, it seems harmless. more than likely thats not the case though. but isnt an email that doesnt do any of that stuff prefferable?i wonder if deep dot web or some other realted blog or website has done a comparison?
one advantage i see about using a .onion email service, is you cant accidentally retrieve or send an email without tor.

theres no point in using some "secret" or "darknet" mail service.you cant trust any service with your personal information, always use encryption (pgp!).i use safe-mail.net.because they have an easy signup (no sms etc) and have a very fast, non-javascript interface at safe-mail.net/fastbut srsly, dont trust any of them.

i prefer blockchain shared coin for financial reasons. its also generally much faster.for some reason i have been having trouble with shared coin lately so ive just been transferring to a market and trading the coin for a fiat currency then eventually buying back btc for about .5%

bsm ftw. this site could use some good r/darkmarkets promoting. my shop has been increasing in traffic, we started out with some sample type packs and almost every order was from a customer with 0 deals. in time this site could be super strong, esp if agora keeps getting attacked or whatever the situation is.
there is ways calledindian system ? cash to cash and other option too.us isn t interesiting .... but australia, europe kind of country are.but the point is trust.... i don t know if they would work with unnone person from the webphrpvn
from experience and seeing others do it. forming and llc is not the worst way to go. it depends on several factors.1. the type of business, if you say your selling stuffed animals and your company makes several hundred thousand that year it will raise red flags. you will want to pose as a tech company, etc. 2. taxes are not a bad thing in the slightest. if you structure your llc in the right way such as abc llc taxed as a s-corp. you can legally generate yourself payroll and that taxation while your company is taxed at a different rate. one advantage is if you keep your personal salary under the federal poverty line you can capitlize on obamacare. lol. seriously though if you have that much money to move your gonna want to pay taxes and look like a nice law abiding citizen.

not strictly true. depends on a number of factors and huge variance is observable in different brands of ram. freeze it and many brands hold up long enough to dump. tried 2 modern laptops recently with truecrypt and safeboot - both gave up the keys without difficulty.choose a linux kernel with tresor which stores the keys in the cpu debug registers instead of ram.
tell them what they have done. they should create a new key pair.
i cant access now either, i dont know what happening and i want access to send bitcoins to my escrow and to place a order, but with this problem, send bitcoins its a risk, because the site sometimes open, but so much times not, and that is frustrating really. i love agora, i hope that they fix this problem soon..
it is working again now.  ddos attacks it seems.  it comes and goes, but seems like agora is the most reliable market out there now.
agora opens now:)
i took a look at blue sky, not very busy yet and they want .5 btc to open a vendor account. good looking site though.
all good advise  thank you! currently i am only doing the html/css aspect of websites bc i know im not qualifed for security  !!

well then.... who is the peoples choice for vending cocaine? done with sr2.
is their private key compromised? if so, i need to tell them immediately, can anyone offer any hindsight to this?meerkovo
yes, and no.as long as they have a password on their key (i think basically all pgp clients enforce this), you would have to brute force the password to get to true key. however, a brute force attack against a weak passphrase is entirely possible. if the key has been in any keyserver, a revocation certificate should be issued and uploaded. if if it hasnt getting a revocation certificate generated asap would be a good idea. then toss that key and create a new one.this is why before sending a pgp encrypted message, you always check it either by listing the packets or attempting to decrypt it yourself to make sure that have sent the right things to the right individuals.
ok i get this, but pgp has private key, public key, and password.we send each public keys. (sound like a noob but i have a point to make!)ok so the mistake of sending private in addition to the public key, gave me both of keys. but the keys in his keyring are password protected at the very no? so if i have both, how would i still be able to decrypt messages?
we managed to get on yesterday for a little while but can not get on today.just a note to customer who may have placed an order with us, if we can not get logged before 2pm we will be unable to get the order shipped out today. same as yesterday, if you are desperate for anything, we are also available on sr2.th
this is worrisome.  one person says this is happening and gets attacked by the admins on the forum.  then a bunch of other people chime in that they are getting screwed over too, and no reply!
watch out vendors, pandora is taking 24% comission on any sale!smells like the next sheep is coming arround the corner!
plus one. if i could.
quote from: aquaman on march 19, 2014, 02:36:32 amwell then.... who is the peoples choice for vending cocaine? done with sr2.there is a couple of people with good reps for blow. heizenbergmontana, toocoolforschool (i think), and another guy who has been on other markets ive seen just cant remember his name, the feedback system is good on bs and with escrow, 50/50 (most vendors) its not a crap shoot like sr, agora, pandora. boy how those two sites folded under the added weight of sr downfall. bsm has had a nice long growing period to get all situated and strong.
mucho gusto senor.  been bent over 3 of 4 times lately on sr2. not a noob either.  multiple orders are cool , thne bam, they fold tent and haul ass.
i deleted your post. might be a good idea to create a new key and only post the public key next time

is tor that effective when it comes to wallets and anonymity? to my understanding, tor only disguises the activity youre doing but anyone whos eavesdropping at the exit node can get my ip pretty easily. so, if i use tor for my electrum wallet, the electrum servers may not know where the coins came from but le can always know it by watching the exit nodes. could it really be? haha, i guess im too paranoid.quote from: crepuscular on february 17, 2014, 01:59:30 pmbut for people who may have trouble getting coins that are totally unlinked to them... maybe some information about different tumbling options (advantages/disadvantages/current status/reputation etc.) would be helpful.btw, i second this. i think about new tumbling methods since btcfog, at least according to what i read on reddit, is latelz being sketchy as fuck.
accidentally posted my private key while trying to figure everything out with pgp, and i cannot edit my post. did i just fuck my security up horribly?

anonymous operating system    tails    tails releasestails, the amnesic incognito live system, version 0.23, is out.all users must upgrade as soon as possible: this release fixes numerous security issues.changesnotable user-visible changes include:    security fixes        upgrade the web browser to 24.4.0esr-0+tails1~bpo60+1 (firefox        24.4.0esr + iceweasel patches + torbrowser patches).    major new features        spoof the network interfaces mac address        by default. it can be disabled in tails greeter.        rework the way to        configure how tor connects to the network        by using bridges, proxies and restrictive firewalls. this option        can be set from tails greeter, and replaces the old        experimental "bridge mode" feature.    bugfixes        additional software: do not crash when persistence is disabled.        upgrade pidgin to 2.10.9, that fixes some regressions introduced in the 2.10.8 security update.        wait for tor to have fully bootstrapped, plus a bit more time, before checking for upgrades and unfixed known security issues.        disable the intel management engine interface driver. we dont need it in tails, it might be dangerous, and it causes bugs on various hardware such as systems that reboot when asked to shut down.        add a launcher for the tails documentation. this makes it available in windows camouflage mode.        remove the obsolete wikileaks.de account from pidgin.    minor improvements        upgrade tor to 0.2.4.21-1~d60.squeeze+1.        upgrade obfsproxy to 0.2.6-2~~squeeze+1.        upgrade i2p to 0.9.11-1deb6u1.        install 64-bit kernel instead of the 686-pae one. this is a necessary first step towards uefi boot support.        install monkeysign (in a not-so-functional shape yet).        disable the autologin text consoles. this was one of the blockers before a screen saver can be installed in a meaningful way.        dont localize the text consoles anymore: it is broken on wheezy, the intended users can as well use loadkeys, and we now do not have to trust setupcon to be safe for being run as root by the desktop user.        make it possible to manually start ibus.        reintroduce the possibility to switch identities in the tor browser, using a filtering proxy in front of the tor controlport to avoid giving full control over tor to the desktop user.        incremental upgrades improvements:            drop the tails upgrader launcher, to limit users confusion.            lock down sudo credentials a bit.            hide debugging information.            include ~/.xsession-errors in whisperback bug reports. this captures the tails upgrader errors and debugging information.            report more precisely why an incremental upgrade cannot be done.            various user interface and phrasing improvements.        dont install the cookie monster browser extension.        add a browser bookmark pointing to tors stack exchange.        remove the preconfigured #tor channel from the pidgin: apparently, too many tails users go ask tails questions there, without making it clear that they are running tails, hence creating a user-support nightmare.        use (most of) tor browsers mozconfig.        rebase the browser on top of iceweasel 24.3.0esr-1, to get the certificate authorities added by debian back.        give access to the relevant documentation pages from tails greeter.        hide tails greeters password mismatch warning when entry is changed.        persistent volume assistant:            take into account our installer is now called tails installer.            optimize window height.            display device paths in a more user-friendly way.see the online changelog for technical details.known issues

looks like hes on his way to the us.http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/19/australian-waives-extradition-rights-over-silk-road-charges-in-usquotean australian man accused of helping run the online drug bazaar silk road has waived his extradition rights, paving the way for him to face charges in the us of conspiracy to launder money.former queensland prison employee peter phillip nash, 41, appeared in the brisbane magistrates court on wednesday.extradition can go ahead once the commonwealth attorney general approves it.nash, who worked for a brisbane prison’s forensic disability service, was arrested by australian federal police in december.us prosecutors allege he was the primary moderator for discussion forums on the silk road website.the site was used by drug dealers to distribute hundreds of kilograms of illicit drugs to more than 100,000 buyers worldwide.nash was allegedly employed by silk road’s san francisco-based owner ross william ulbricht since january 2013.prosecutors say he went by the aliases “batman73” and “anonymousasshit”.he and two other alleged silk road employees have been charged with one count of conspiracy to launder money, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in the us.the trio is also charged with narcotics and computer hacking offences.a queensland government gazette published in october 2011 shows that nash had been employed at the wacol prison’s forensic disability service for intellectually disabled inmates.

hey all, have not been on the hub for a while, im more active on reddit..  thanks for the comments, good and bad are all positive to me.ive taken a bunch of comments on board and have implemented a lot of ideas.  all changes are in the homepage change log.keep us in mind on your next order, or if you are looking somewhere to sell, feel free to contact us via the support link in your cloud-nine account.
x post from reddit r/darknetmarketshi! i just finished an update where vendors can have their own urls and stores, e.g:* http://canadianexpress.bviaqyj6obc54vhn.onion/* http://ozpharmer.bviaqyj6obc54vhn.onion/to create a store, vendors just need to choose a name from their profile, and the store is made.customers wont see any other products in search when visiting your store.im also thinking of letting vendors only have items only shown on their store and not on search (specials etc.), as well as branding the store page to some extent.let me know what you guys think

preconfigured #tor channel from the pidgin: apparently, too many tails users go ask tails questions there, without making it clear that they are running tails, hence creating a user-support nightmare.        use (most of) tor browsers mozconfig.        rebase the browser on top of iceweasel 24.3.0esr-1, to get the certificate authorities added by debian back.        give access to the

i took a look at blue sky, not very busy yet and they want .5 btc to open a vendor account. good looking site though.
is their private key compromised? if so, i need to tell them immediately, can anyone offer any hindsight to this?meerkovo
i totally agree that a market needs to be built from ground-up, specifically not using any third party modules, frameworks, or especially open-source market software.
never....never.... sign.  does everyone understand?
i think im done with agora.  this access shit is for the birds.

i just found this service that seems pretty trustworthy. its called bitblender and it looks promising. this is not an endorsement, i dont know the owners of this site, and i do not vouch for them.use at your own riskhttp://bitblendervrfkzr.onion/?p=indexhere is a thread over at the sr forums where the owner of the site introduced the service. the thread began as a review of another service (bitlaunder) that appears to be either really crummy, or a scam. http://silkroad5v7dywlc.onion/index.php?topic=28455.0;allps- im really digging this forums functionality
agora opens now:)
it is starting to get slightly annoying.
it is working again now.  ddos attacks it seems.  it comes and goes, but seems like agora is the most reliable market out there now.
i cant access now either, i dont know what happening and i want access to send bitcoins to my escrow and to place a order, but with this problem, send bitcoins its a risk, because the site sometimes open, but so much times not, and that is frustrating really. i love agora, i hope that they fix this problem soon..
is tor that effective when it comes to wallets and anonymity? to my understanding, tor only disguises the activity youre doing but anyone whos eavesdropping at the exit node can get my ip pretty easily. so, if i use tor for my electrum wallet, the electrum servers may not know where the coins came from but le can always know it by watching the exit nodes. could it really be? haha, i guess im too paranoid.quote from: crepuscular on february 17, 2014, 01:59:30 pmbut for people who may have trouble getting coins that are totally unlinked to them... maybe some information about different tumbling options (advantages/disadvantages/current status/reputation etc.) would be helpful.btw, i second this. i think about new tumbling methods since btcfog, at least according to what i read on reddit, is latelz being sketchy as fuck.

looks like hes on his way to the us.http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/19/australian-waives-extradition-rights-over-silk-road-charges-in-usquotean australian man accused of helping run the online drug bazaar silk road has waived his extradition rights, paving the way for him to face charges in the us of conspiracy to launder money.former queensland prison employee peter phillip nash, 41, appeared in the brisbane magistrates court on wednesday.extradition can go ahead once the commonwealth attorney general approves it.nash, who worked for a brisbane prison’s forensic disability service, was arrested by australian federal police in december.us prosecutors allege he was the primary moderator for discussion forums on the silk road website.the site was used by drug dealers to distribute hundreds of kilograms of illicit drugs to more than 100,000 buyers worldwide.nash was allegedly employed by silk road’s san francisco-based owner ross william ulbricht since january 2013.prosecutors say he went by the aliases “batman73” and “anonymousasshit”.he and two other alleged silk road employees have been charged with one count of conspiracy to launder money, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in the us.the trio is also charged with narcotics and computer hacking offences.a queensland government gazette published in october 2011 shows that nash had been employed at the wacol prison’s forensic disability service for intellectually disabled inmates.
we managed to get on yesterday for a little while but can not get on today.just a note to customer who may have placed an order with us, if we can not get logged before 2pm we will be unable to get the order shipped out today. same as yesterday, if you are desperate for anything, we are also available on sr2.th

i took a look at blue sky, not very busy yet and they want .5 btc to open a vendor account. good looking site though.
is their private key compromised? if so, i need to tell them immediately, can anyone offer any hindsight to this?meerkovo
yes, and no.as long as they have a password on their key (i think basically all pgp clients enforce this), you would have to brute force the password to get to true key. however, a brute force attack against a weak passphrase is entirely possible. if the key has been in any keyserver, a revocation certificate should be issued and uploaded. if if it hasnt getting a revocation certificate generated asap would be a good idea. then toss that key and create a new one.this is why before sending a pgp encrypted message, you always check it either by listing the packets or attempting to decrypt it yourself to make sure that have sent the right things to the right individuals.
ok i get this, but pgp has private key, public key, and password.we send each public keys. (sound like a noob but i have a point to make!)ok so the mistake of sending private in addition to the public key, gave me both of keys. but the keys in his keyring are password protected at the very no? so if i have both, how would i still be able to decrypt messages?
plus one. if i could.

looks like hes on his way to the us.http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/19/australian-waives-extradition-rights-over-silk-road-charges-in-usquotean australian man accused of helping run the online drug bazaar silk road has waived his extradition rights, paving the way for him to face charges in the us of conspiracy to launder money.former queensland prison employee peter phillip nash, 41, appeared in the brisbane magistrates court on wednesday.extradition can go ahead once the commonwealth attorney general approves it.nash, who worked for a brisbane prison’s forensic disability service, was arrested by australian federal police in december.us prosecutors allege he was the primary moderator for discussion forums on the silk road website.the site was used by drug dealers to distribute hundreds of kilograms of illicit drugs to more than 100,000 buyers worldwide.nash was allegedly employed by silk road’s san francisco-based owner ross william ulbricht since january 2013.prosecutors say he went by the aliases “batman73” and “anonymousasshit”.he and two other alleged silk road employees have been charged with one count of conspiracy to launder money, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in the us.the trio is also charged with narcotics and computer hacking offences.a queensland government gazette published in october 2011 shows that nash had been employed at the wacol prison’s forensic disability service for intellectually disabled inmates.
we managed to get on yesterday for a little while but can not get on today.just a note to customer who may have placed an order with us, if we can not get logged before 2pm we will be unable to get the order shipped out today. same as yesterday, if you are desperate for anything, we are also available on sr2.th
so it says they are over 6700 items in drugs and when i hit the button it displays me around 20 items and i cant click next site or something like this. i just get this 20 items and nothing more. is this the badest search engine i have ever seen or am i finally to stupid for living in this world? (if i am to stupid pls help me)
x post from reddit r/darknetmarketshi! i just finished an update where vendors can have their own urls and stores, e.g:* http://canadianexpress.bviaqyj6obc54vhn.onion/* http://ozpharmer.bviaqyj6obc54vhn.onion/to create a store, vendors just need to choose a name from their profile, and the store is made.customers wont see any other products in search when visiting your store.im also thinking of letting vendors only have items only shown on their store and not on search (specials etc.), as well as branding the store page to some extent.let me know what you guys think
hey all, have not been on the hub for a while, im more active on reddit..  thanks for the comments, good and bad are all positive to me.ive taken a bunch of comments on board and have implemented a lot of ideas.  all changes are in the homepage change log.keep us in mind on your next order, or if you are looking somewhere to sell, feel free to contact us via the support link in your cloud-nine account.
not strictly true. depends on a number of factors and huge variance is observable in different brands of ram. freeze it and many brands hold up long enough to dump. tried 2 modern laptops recently with truecrypt and safeboot - both gave up the keys without difficulty.choose a linux kernel with tresor which stores the keys in the cpu debug registers instead of ram.

anonymous operating system    tails    tails releasestails, the amnesic incognito live system, version 0.23, is out.all users must upgrade as soon as possible: this release fixes numerous security issues.changesnotable user-visible changes include:    security fixes        upgrade the web browser to 24.4.0esr-0+tails1~bpo60+1 (firefox        24.4.0esr + iceweasel patches + torbrowser patches).    major new features        spoof the network interfaces mac address        by default. it can be disabled in tails greeter.        rework the way to        configure how tor connects to the network        by using bridges, proxies and restrictive firewalls. this option        can be set from tails greeter, and replaces the old        experimental "bridge mode" feature.    bugfixes        additional software: do not crash when persistence is disabled.        upgrade pidgin to 2.10.9, that fixes some regressions introduced in the 2.10.8 security update.        wait for tor to have fully bootstrapped, plus a bit more time, before checking for upgrades and unfixed known security issues.        disable the intel management engine interface driver. we dont need it in tails, it might be dangerous, and it causes bugs on various hardware such as systems that reboot when asked to shut down.        add a launcher for the tails documentation. this makes it available in windows camouflage mode.        remove the obsolete wikileaks.de account from pidgin.    minor improvements        upgrade tor to 0.2.4.21-1~d60.squeeze+1.        upgrade obfsproxy to 0.2.6-2~~squeeze+1.        upgrade i2p to 0.9.11-1deb6u1.        install 64-bit kernel instead of the 686-pae one. this is a necessary first step towards uefi boot support.        install monkeysign (in a not-so-functional shape yet).        disable the autologin text consoles. this was one of the blockers before a screen saver can be installed in a meaningful way.        dont localize the text consoles anymore: it is broken on wheezy, the intended users can as well use loadkeys, and we now do not have to trust setupcon to be safe for being run as root by the desktop user.        make it possible to manually start ibus.        reintroduce the possibility to switch identities in the tor browser, using a filtering proxy in front of the tor controlport to avoid giving full control over tor to the desktop user.        incremental upgrades improvements:            drop the tails upgrader launcher, to limit users confusion.            lock down sudo credentials a bit.            hide debugging information.            include ~/.xsession-errors in whisperback bug reports. this captures the tails upgrader errors and debugging information.            report more precisely why an incremental upgrade cannot be done.

the original text is below the link is here: http://bl3j73taluhwidx5.onion/index.php?topic=6629.0first of all sorry, but i didn`t had to much for choice if i didn`t wanted to close pandora market and hope at least some of you will understand situation, but i know i am going to burn and lost all of my karma, but there is whole truth with my plan.what happened:1) last week pandora market got shaved of large portions of btc by 2 vendors used to be small-time scammers, they were able to steal about 1/2 of btc pandora total holdings (basically everything, that was not on cold storage), they found the leak in system.2) i stopped all withdrawals, found leak and fix the bug in system and also were checking any signle money operation programming, that is the reason why everyone withdrawals were stopped for about 12 hours.what were my options back then, when i found bitcoin lost:1) i could make market to disapear and just close it down, everyone will think then, i scammed oll of you.2) i will apply solution to cover losses and continue operations.3) i choose number 2)why i didn`t told truth before:1) that would probably lead only to instant panic and market closure week before that day. all money would be probably lost - all vendors and customers money.2) i didn`t informed and pandora were able to make withdrawals of more than 1000btc since steal of bitcoins discovered to vendors -  all of that would not be possible if i would not take this drastic measurements.3) all my actions was made to safe pandora market and continue operation, time will tell if that was good move.4) only what i am sure about is if i didn`t made this drastic measurements, i can only close down the market and be remembered as scammer.current situation:1) i partly covered loss from my profits (this is probably very stupid move from me as everybody will probably blame me, i should closed market i think now) - i covered about 1/3 of losses from my own money (hard desicion for me).2) market and almost all btc will be recovered during this week by aplying very high tax on all transactions.actions made:1) currently only max 2/10 pandora holdings are held on main server so possible loss is limited to 2/10 of total pandora holdings.2) many security updates to the system, leak fixed.3) if pandora will survive that, in future if that ever happen again, loss is limited to 2/10 of btc holdings.facts:1) pandora market processing withdrawals for vendors and over 1000btc were sent to vendors during last week.2) all transaction must be taxed with scheme below to complete recovery.3) pandora will start processing withdrawal for all users by 23.3. (withdrawal fee for customers will aply from that day until 23. + 14 days)4) pandora will be recovered in less than 10 days from now.5) for those thinking about closing shops at pandora:5.1.) i really do understand that, but think about this:5.2.) small market might (i mean person behind the market) might not be ready for inflow of money and he might scam you anyway.5.3.) think again, how much you made with pandora market existence and how much you are going to make in future and without this market, you would may not be able to make money that you did there.5.4.) i didn`t had many ptions to safe market and this loss is temporary and will be repaid back.recovery scheme & buyback:1) for save pandora market i had to make very drastic measurements - commision (operating tax) of 24% during 23.3.1.2) commision paid from all transaction scheme:1.3) 24% by 23.3. (16% recovery tax if your item have add commision to item instead of deduct)1.4) 16% 23.3. - 31.3. (8% recovery tax if your item have add commision to item instead of deduct)1.5) 8% from 31.3. until 1.4.1.6) if you have option to add commision to item price as vendor, you are not charged full 24% but customer pay commision of 8% and after you are cahrged 16%.reason to accept that:1) truth is that you have no choice and if you want be able to withdraw for all send order, consider it as prepaid tax (will explain later).2) take it as necessary evil to continue bussiness on pandora market (i understand some of you will not).3) all commisions paid are in database and i know, who paid what amount of commisions above expected.4) example:4.1) escrow release for vendor_name(31118) on order 56086 amount 0.13266796 comm 0.03741917 (that is helf for every single transaction)5) these allow me to calculate exact commision paid by that day easily and:6) from 31.3. all affected vendors (probably all) will have overpaid commision calculated.7) overpaid commision ill be put to special database. all vendors will later pay only 40% of standard commision and 60% will be calculated back to repay tax back to vendors. 60% of future commisions will be paid back to vendors after total amount of overpaid money is 0. (proportion might change to pay back vendors quick as possible)9) worst case scenario is i will sell 30% of pandora earnings and pay from that debt to vendors to repay them overtax (each 1% will earn portion of pandora profits, paid daily).about me & what i think:1) i must be completely stupid to be honest in this bussines, because for me were such easier to exit.2) i don`t expect nobody to understand, even if i wrote that post, i think, many of you will think, this is beginning of scam, because it does make sence (but if i am going to scam i am not going to allow withdrawals of more than 1000btc right ? - so that play for that is truth)3) i must be very stupid, as i put even my all money back just for everybody will blaming me, but that is risk i am taking now.4) if somebody think, i am taking that 24% profits now, that is not true, it is much more easier just to close all withdrawals and run away with money - which i didn`t do.5) big truth is: now i am not making any money out of pandora, every single satoshi now go back to repay back loss.6) i don`t want to sound like i almos save your money, i will be blamed, of course, many will think, this is start of scam, or i took money by myselft, but none on that is truth.facts 2:1) if this is going to be scam, which is not, i am not going to allow withdrawals.2) recovery of all loss is by end of month.3) pandora will be beck in normal by end ot the month.4) 75% recovered. (30% from me).5) i am now working for free.6) pandora will survive (i believe that).7) personaly i still didn`t steal single bitcoins from customer or vendor. understand in this anonymous place it is not easy to believe nothing.super short version:1) pandora loss 1/2 of btc holdings.2) drastic tax is needed to recover (paid by all vendors).3) tax paid by vendors will be paid back in form of 40% or less commision pay in future.4) normal operation will start again approx 31.3.2014.update 1:1) all vendor & customer balances are not touched in any way and after recovery will be fully available (customers can still order from any vendor and vendors don`t have anny issues with withdrawals, from day 1 because i recovered cold storage and used my money to pay vendors).2) there are enough btc to cover all withdrawals (i calculated balances on all vendor accounts and pandora have multiple time balance for withdrawal then is available balance on vendor accounts) - vendors don`t have issues wit withdrawals from day 1 (except 12 hour withdrawal stop before few days).update 2:1) inflow of btc into pandora market is unchanged in comparsion to last week2) buyers are still buying in stable rate in compare to the last week3) others will try to make panic and take advantage of this issue, so if you can, please don`t try to create more panic but protect pandora if possible.4) if you want as vendor limit your loss, you can change item to add price instead of deduct, then from 23.3. commision 16% will aply and 8% will be paid by you and 8% by customer.best what vendor can do now to limit loss is probably change all their items to add commision to price.that way 8% commision is added to total price to be paid by customer. and from 23.3. "tax" is going to be 16% so, vendor is paying "just" 8% splitting it with customer. that 8% "tax" should not probably burn most of vendors as margins on items sold here are usually high and every vendor should survive that temporary loss to be paid back when back in normal.so if pandora is going to survive that, and at least half of people will understand why it is how it is now, pandora will be here for normal operations within 31.3.2014.now everybody say me fuck off and that i am idiont and scammer.for those who will stay calm, i promise you, i will repay commisions back in time (even for those who will not stay calm).never thought it is going happen to pandora, i always think these steal are always made by owners. i thought pandora is stronghold that can not be beaten, but i learned from this and i believe pandora is not going down !that`s it don`t know what to say more.
you sir...... are a great vendor.  others take notice please. some  " buyers" are smart people struggling with technology.

the original text is below the link is here: http://bl3j73taluhwidx5.onion/index.php?topic=6629.0first of all sorry, but i didn`t had to much for choice if i didn`t wanted to close pandora market and hope at least some of you will understand situation, but i know i am going to burn and lost all of my karma, but there is whole truth with my plan.what happened:1) last week pandora market got shaved of large portions of btc by 2 vendors used to be small-time scammers, they were able to steal about 1/2 of btc pandora total holdings (basically everything, that was not on cold storage), they found the leak in system.2) i stopped all withdrawals, found leak and fix the bug in system and also were checking any signle money operation programming, that is the reason why everyone withdrawals were stopped for about 12 hours.what were my options back then, when i found bitcoin lost:1) i could make market to disapear and just close it down, everyone will think then, i scammed oll of you.2) i will apply solution to cover losses and continue operations.3) i choose number 2)why i didn`t told truth before:1) that would probably lead only to instant panic and market closure week before that day. all money would be probably lost - all vendors and customers money.2) i didn`t informed and pandora were able to make withdrawals of more than 1000btc since steal of bitcoins discovered to vendors -  all of that would not be possible if i would not take this drastic measurements.3) all my actions was made to safe pandora market and continue operation, time will tell if that was good move.4) only what i am sure about is if i didn`t made this drastic measurements, i can only close down the market and be remembered as scammer.current situation:1) i partly covered loss from my profits (this is probably very stupid move from me as everybody will probably blame me, i should closed market i think now) - i covered about 1/3 of losses from my own money (hard desicion for me).2) market and almost all btc will be recovered during this week by aplying very high tax on all transactions.actions made:1) currently only max 2/10 pandora holdings are held on main server so possible loss is limited to 2/10 of total pandora holdings.2) many security updates to the system, leak fixed.3) if pandora will survive that, in future if that ever happen again, loss is limited to 2/10 of btc holdings.facts:1) pandora market processing withdrawals for vendors and over 1000btc were sent to vendors during last week.2) all transaction must be taxed with scheme below to complete recovery.3) pandora will start processing withdrawal for all users by 23.3. (withdrawal fee for customers will aply from that day until 23. + 14 days)4) pandora will be recovered in less than 10 days from now.5) for those thinking about closing shops at pandora:5.1.) i really do understand that, but think about this:5.2.) small market might (i mean person behind the market) might not be ready for inflow of money and he might scam you anyway.5.3.) think again, how much you made with pandora market existence and how much you are going to make in future and without this market, you would may not be able to make money that you did there.5.4.) i didn`t had many ptions to safe market and this loss is temporary and will be repaid back.recovery scheme & buyback:1) for save pandora market i had to make very drastic measurements - commision (operating tax) of 24% during 23.3.1.2) commision paid from all transaction scheme:1.3) 24% by 23.3. (16% recovery tax if your item have add commision to item instead of deduct)1.4) 16% 23.3. - 31.3. (8% recovery tax if your item have add commision to item instead of deduct)1.5) 8% from 31.3. until 1.4.1.6) if you have option to add commision to item price as vendor, you are not charged full 24% but customer pay commision of 8% and after you are cahrged 16%.reason to accept that:1) truth is that you have no choice and if you want be able to withdraw for all send order, consider it as prepaid tax (will explain later).2) take it as necessary evil to continue bussiness on pandora market (i understand some of you will not).3) all commisions paid are in database and i know, who paid what amount of commisions above expected.4) example:4.1) escrow release for vendor_name(31118) on order 56086 amount 0.13266796 comm 0.03741917 (that is helf for every single transaction)5) these allow me to calculate exact commision paid by that day easily and:6) from 31.3. all affected vendors (probably all) will have overpaid commision calculated.7) overpaid commision ill be put to special database. all vendors will later pay only 40% of standard commision and 60% will be calculated back to repay tax back to vendors. 60% of future commisions will be paid back to vendors after total amount of overpaid money is 0. (proportion might change to pay back vendors quick as possible)9) worst case scenario is i will sell 30% of pandora earnings and pay from that debt to vendors to repay them overtax (each 1% will earn portion of pandora profits, paid daily).about me & what i think:1) i must be completely stupid to be honest in this bussines, because for me were such easier to exit.2) i don`t expect nobody to understand, even if i wrote that post, i think, many of you will think, this is beginning of scam, because it does make sence (but if i am going to scam i am not going to allow withdrawals of more than 1000btc right ? - so that play for that is truth)3) i must be very stupid, as i put even my all money back just for everybody will blaming me, but that is risk i am taking now.4) if somebody think, i am taking that 24% profits now, that is not true, it is much more easier just to close all withdrawals and run away with money - which i didn`t do.5) big truth is: now i am not making any money out of pandora, every single satoshi now go back to repay back loss.6) i don`t want to sound like i almos save your money, i will be blamed, of course, many will think, this is start of scam, or i took money by myselft, but none on that is truth.facts 2:1) if this is going to be scam, which is not, i am not going to allow withdrawals.2) recovery of all loss is by end of month.3) pandora will be beck in normal by end ot the month.4) 75% recovered. (30% from me).5) i am now working for free.6) pandora will survive (i believe that).7) personaly i still didn`t steal single bitcoins from customer or vendor. understand in this anonymous place it is not easy to believe nothing.super short version:1) pandora loss 1/2 of btc holdings.2) drastic tax is needed to recover (paid by all vendors).3) tax paid by vendors will be paid back in form of 40% or less commision pay in future.4) normal operation will start again approx 31.3.2014.update 1:1) all vendor & customer balances are not touched in any way and after recovery will be fully available (customers can still order from any vendor and vendors don`t have anny issues with withdrawals, from day 1 because i recovered cold storage and used my money to pay vendors).2) there are enough btc to cover all withdrawals (i calculated balances on all vendor accounts and pandora have multiple time balance for withdrawal then is available balance on vendor accounts) - vendors don`t have issues wit withdrawals from day 1 (except 12 hour withdrawal stop before few days).update 2:1) inflow of btc into pandora market is unchanged in comparsion to last week2) buyers are still buying in stable rate in compare to the last week3) others will try to make panic and take advantage of this issue, so if you can, please don`t try to create more panic but protect pandora if possible.4) if you want as vendor limit your loss, you can change item to add price instead of deduct, then from 23.3. commision 16% will aply and 8% will be paid by you and 8% by customer.best what vendor can do now to limit loss is probably change all their items to add commision to price.that way 8% commision is added to total price to be paid by customer. and from 23.3. "tax" is going to be 16% so, vendor is paying "just" 8% splitting it with customer. that 8% "tax" should not probably burn most of vendors as margins on items sold here are usually high and every vendor should survive that temporary loss to be paid back when back in normal.so if pandora is going to survive that, and at least half of people will understand why it is how it is now, pandora will be here for normal operations within 31.3.2014.now everybody say me fuck off and that i am idiont and scammer.for those who will stay calm, i promise you, i will repay commisions back in time (even for those who will not stay calm).never thought it is going happen to pandora, i always think these steal are always made by owners. i thought pandora is stronghold that can not be beaten, but i learned from this and i believe pandora is not going down !that`s it don`t know what to say more.

ok fuck me, i dont get it.
the original text is below the link is here: http://bl3j73taluhwidx5.onion/index.php?topic=6629.0first of all sorry, but i didn`t had to much for choice if i didn`t wanted to close pandora market and hope at least some of you will understand situation, but i know i am going to burn and lost all of my karma, but there is whole truth with my plan.what happened:1) last week pandora market got shaved of large portions of btc by 2 vendors used to be small-time scammers, they were able to steal about 1/2 of btc pandora total holdings (basically everything, that was not on cold storage), they found the leak in system.2) i stopped all withdrawals, found leak and fix the bug in system and also were checking any signle money operation programming, that is the reason why everyone withdrawals were stopped for about 12 hours.what were my options back then, when i found bitcoin lost:1) i could make market to disapear and just close it down, everyone will think then, i scammed oll of you.2) i will apply solution to cover losses and continue operations.3) i choose number 2)why i didn`t told truth before:1) that would probably lead only to instant panic and market closure week before that day. all money would be probably lost - all vendors and customers money.2) i didn`t informed and pandora were able to make withdrawals of more than 1000btc since steal of bitcoins discovered to vendors -  all of that would not be possible if i would not take this drastic measurements.3) all my actions was made to safe pandora market and continue operation, time will tell if that was good move.4) only what i am sure about is if i didn`t made this drastic measurements, i can only close down the market and be remembered as scammer.current situation:1) i partly covered loss from my profits (this is probably very stupid move from me as everybody will probably blame me, i should closed market i think now) - i covered about 1/3 of losses from my own money (hard desicion for me).2) market and almost all btc will be recovered during this week by aplying very high tax on all transactions.actions made:1) currently only max 2/10 pandora holdings are held on main server so possible loss is limited to 2/10 of total pandora holdings.2) many security updates to the system, leak fixed.3) if pandora will survive that, in future if that ever happen again, loss is limited to 2/10 of btc holdings.facts:1) pandora market processing withdrawals for vendors and over 1000btc were sent to vendors during last week.2) all transaction must be taxed with scheme below to complete recovery.3) pandora will start processing withdrawal for all users by 23.3. (withdrawal fee for customers will aply from that day until 23. + 14 days)4) pandora will be recovered in less than 10 days from now.5) for those thinking about closing shops at pandora:5.1.) i really do understand that, but think about this:5.2.) small market might (i mean person behind the market) might not be ready for inflow of money and he might scam you anyway.5.3.) think again, how much you made with pandora market existence and how much you are going to make in future and without this market, you would may not be able to make money that you did there.5.4.) i didn`t had many ptions to safe market and this loss is temporary and will be repaid back.recovery scheme & buyback:1) for save pandora market i had to make very drastic measurements - commision (operating tax) of 24% during 23.3.1.2) commision paid from all transaction scheme:1.3) 24% by 23.3. (16% recovery tax if your item have add commision to item instead of deduct)1.4) 16% 23.3. - 31.3. (8% recovery tax if your item have add commision to item instead of deduct)1.5) 8% from 31.3. until 1.4.1.6) if you have option to add commision to item price as vendor, you are not charged full 24% but customer pay commision of 8% and after you are cahrged 16%.reason to accept that:1) truth is that you have no choice and if you want be able to withdraw for all send order, consider it as prepaid tax (will explain later).2) take it as necessary evil to continue bussiness on pandora market (i understand some of you will not).3) all commisions paid are in database and i know, who paid what amount of commisions above expected.4) example:4.1) escrow release for vendor_name(31118) on order 56086 amount 0.13266796 comm 0.03741917 (that is helf for every single transaction)5) these allow me to calculate exact commision paid by that day easily and:6) from 31.3. all affected vendors (probably all) will have overpaid commision calculated.7) overpaid commision ill be put to special database. all vendors will later pay only 40% of standard commision and 60% will be calculated back to repay tax back to vendors. 60% of future commisions will be paid back to vendors after total amount of overpaid money is 0. (proportion might change to pay back vendors quick as possible)9) worst case scenario is i will sell 30% of pandora earnings and pay from that debt to vendors to repay them overtax (each 1% will earn portion of pandora profits, paid daily).about me & what i think:1) i must be completely stupid to be honest in this bussines, because for me were such easier to exit.2) i don`t expect nobody to understand, even if i wrote that post, i think, many of you will think, this is beginning of scam, because it does make sence (but if i am going to scam i am not going to allow withdrawals of more than 1000btc right ? - so that play for that is truth)3) i must be very stupid, as i put even my all money back just for everybody will blaming me, but that is risk i am taking now.4) if somebody think, i am taking that 24% profits now, that is not true, it is much more easier just to close all withdrawals and run away with money - which i didn`t do.5) big truth is: now i am not making any money out of pandora, every single satoshi now go back to repay back loss.6) i don`t want to sound like i almos save your money, i will be blamed, of course, many will think, this is start of scam, or i took money by myselft, but none on that is truth.facts 2:1) if this is going to be scam, which is not, i am not going to allow withdrawals.2) recovery of all loss is by end of month.3) pandora will be beck in normal by end ot the month.4) 75% recovered.

ok fuck me, i dont get it.
wait, is bluesky a new market (e.g. sr2, agora) or is it like a vendor (e.g. angeleyes, ava)?
the original text is below the link is here: http://bl3j73taluhwidx5.onion/index.php?topic=6629.0first of all sorry, but i didn`t had to much for choice if i didn`t wanted to close pandora market and hope at least some of you will understand situation, but i know i am going to burn and lost all of my karma, but there is whole truth with my plan.what happened:1) last week pandora market got shaved of large portions of btc by 2 vendors used to be small-time scammers, they were able to steal about 1/2 of btc pandora total holdings (basically everything, that was not on cold storage), they found the leak in system.2) i stopped all withdrawals, found leak and fix the bug in system and also were checking any signle money operation programming, that is the reason why everyone withdrawals were stopped for about 12 hours.what were my options back then, when i found bitcoin lost:1) i could make market to disapear and just close it down, everyone will think then, i scammed oll of you.2) i will apply solution to cover losses and continue operations.3) i choose number 2)why i didn`t told truth before:1) that would probably lead only to instant panic and market closure week before that day. all money would be probably lost - all vendors and customers money.2) i didn`t informed and pandora were able to make withdrawals of more than 1000btc since steal of bitcoins discovered to vendors -  all of that would not be possible if i would not take this drastic measurements.3) all my actions was made to safe pandora market and continue operation, time will tell if that was good move.4) only what i am sure about is if i didn`t made this drastic measurements, i can only close down the market and be remembered as scammer.current situation:1) i partly covered loss from my profits (this is probably very stupid move from me as everybody will probably blame me, i should closed market i think now) - i covered about 1/3 of losses from my own money (hard desicion for me).2) market and almost all btc will be recovered during this week by aplying very high tax on all transactions.actions made:1) currently only max 2/10 pandora holdings are held on main server so possible loss is limited to 2/10 of total pandora holdings.2) many security updates to the system, leak fixed.3) if pandora will survive that, in future if that ever happen again, loss is limited to 2/10 of btc holdings.facts:1) pandora market processing withdrawals for vendors and over 1000btc were sent to vendors during last week.2) all transaction must be taxed with scheme below to complete recovery.3) pandora will start processing withdrawal for all users by 23.3. (withdrawal fee for customers will aply from that day until 23. + 14 days)4) pandora will be recovered in less than 10 days from now.5) for those thinking about closing shops at pandora:5.1.) i really do understand that, but think about this:5.2.) small market might (i mean person behind the market) might not be ready for inflow of money and he might scam you anyway.5.3.) think again, how much you made with pandora market existence and how much you are going to make in future and without this market, you would may not be able to make money that you did there.5.4.) i didn`t had many ptions to safe market and this loss is temporary and will be repaid back.recovery scheme & buyback:1) for save pandora market i had to make very drastic measurements - commision (operating tax) of 24% during 23.3.1.2) commision paid from all transaction scheme:1.3) 24% by 23.3. (16% recovery tax if your item have add commision to item instead of deduct)1.4) 16% 23.3. - 31.3. (8% recovery tax if your item have add commision to item instead of deduct)1.5) 8% from 31.3. until 1.4.1.6) if you have option to add commision to item price as vendor, you are not charged full 24% but customer pay commision of 8% and after you are cahrged 16%.reason to accept that:1) truth is that you have no choice and if you want be able to withdraw for all send order, consider it as prepaid tax (will explain later).2) take it as necessary evil to continue bussiness on pandora market (i understand some of you will not).3) all commisions paid are in database and i know, who paid what amount of commisions above expected.4) example:4.1) escrow release for vendor_name(31118) on order 56086 amount 0.13266796 comm 0.03741917 (that is helf for every single transaction)5) these allow me to calculate exact commision paid by that day easily and:6) from 31.3. all affected vendors (probably all) will have overpaid commision calculated.7) overpaid commision ill be put to special database. all vendors will later pay only 40% of standard commision and 60% will be calculated back to repay tax back to vendors. 60% of future commisions will be paid back to vendors after total amount of overpaid money is 0. (proportion might change to pay back vendors quick as possible)9) worst case scenario is i will sell 30% of pandora earnings and pay from that debt to vendors to repay them overtax (each 1% will earn portion of pandora profits, paid daily).about me & what i think:1) i must be completely stupid to be honest in this bussines, because for me were such easier to exit.2) i don`t expect nobody to understand, even if i wrote that post, i think, many of you will think, this is beginning of scam, because it does make sence (but if i am going to scam i am not going to allow withdrawals of more than 1000btc right ? - so that play for that is truth)3) i must be very stupid, as i put even my all money back just for everybody will blaming me, but that is risk i am taking now.4) if somebody think, i am taking that 24% profits now, that is not true, it is much more easier just to close all withdrawals and run away with money - which i didn`t do.5) big truth is: now i am not making any money out of pandora, every single satoshi now go back to repay back loss.6) i don`t want to sound like i almos save your money, i will be blamed, of course, many will think, this is start of scam, or i took money by myselft, but none on that is truth.facts 2:1) if this is going to be scam, which is not, i am not going to allow withdrawals.2) recovery of all loss is by end of month.3) pandora will be beck in normal by end ot the month.4) 75% recovered. (30% from me).5) i am now working for free.6) pandora will survive (i believe that).7) personaly i still didn`t steal single bitcoins from customer or vendor. understand in this anonymous place it is not easy to believe nothing.super short version:1) pandora loss 1/2 of btc holdings.2) drastic tax is needed to recover (paid by all vendors).3) tax paid by vendors will be paid back in form of 40% or less commision pay in future.4) normal operation will start again approx 31.3.2014.update 1:1) all vendor & customer balances are not touched in any way and after recovery will be fully available (customers can still order from any vendor and vendors don`t have anny issues with withdrawals, from day 1 because i recovered cold storage and used my money to pay vendors).2) there are enough btc to cover all withdrawals (i calculated balances on all vendor accounts and pandora have multiple time balance for withdrawal then is available balance on vendor accounts) - vendors don`t have issues wit withdrawals from day 1 (except 12 hour withdrawal stop before few days).update 2:1) inflow of btc into pandora market is unchanged in comparsion to last week2) buyers are still buying in stable rate in compare to the last week3) others will try to make panic and take advantage of this issue, so if you can, please don`t try to create more panic but protect pandora if possible.4) if you want as vendor limit your loss, you can change item to add price instead of deduct, then from 23.3. commision 16% will aply and 8% will be paid by you and 8% by customer.best what vendor can do now to limit loss is probably change all their items to add commision to price.that way 8% commision is added to total price to be paid by customer. and from 23.3. "tax" is going to be 16% so, vendor is paying "just" 8% splitting it with customer. that 8% "tax" should not probably burn most of vendors as margins on items sold here are usually high and every vendor should survive that temporary loss to be paid back when back in normal.so if pandora is going to survive that, and at least half of people will understand why it is how it is now, pandora will be here for normal operations within 31.3.2014.now everybody say me fuck off and that i am idiont and scammer.for those who will stay calm, i promise you, i will repay commisions back in time (even for those who will not stay calm).never thought it is going happen to pandora, i always think these steal are always made by owners. i thought pandora is stronghold that can not be beaten, but i learned from this and i believe pandora is not going down !that`s it don`t know what to say more.

this whole thread is about blueskies traders not blu sky market. the market bsm is not a scam in any way shape or form. i cant speak for bluskiestraders. but seriusly fuck all you guys who say bsm is a scam. i vend their everyday and i havnt even had them be down for an hour or two ever.you are the same people spamming agora and pandora links cuz you get a kickback,. we all see how shitty those markets are turning out to be. and with sr2.0 anything but functional, i would say bsm is aat the moment the premier market for buyers no question. fastest and safest. partial escrow and auto-withdrawal with a functioning dispute center.

you sir...... are a great vendor.  others take notice please. some  " buyers" are smart people struggling with technology.
quote from: evilgrin on march 16, 2014, 10:42:34 pmits the mentality. this is what goes through peoples heads tor bazzar? no listings. fuck that! agora? ddos? lots of stuff? well if they have lots of stuff ill go there! no one really cares about security it seems. im just waiting for mst to be implemented then i will push it hard to the people who value security + knows how a computer works. then we should have many tech savvy smart people buying + selling.that part made me laugh the most. like i said, i am not bashing the market, in fact i want it to flourish as i like the ideals of it. i shall be looking on the parent forum more as i have got to up my game with all these young whippersnappers around taking my business!
ok fuck me, i dont get it.
wait, is bluesky a new market (e.g. sr2, agora) or is it like a vendor (e.g. angeleyes, ava)?
the original text is below the link is here: http://bl3j73taluhwidx5.onion/index.php?topic=6629.0first of all sorry, but i didn`t had to much for choice if i didn`t wanted to close pandora market and hope at least some of you will understand situation, but i know i am going to burn and lost all of my karma, but there is whole truth with my plan.what happened:1) last week pandora market got shaved of large portions of btc by 2 vendors used to be small-time scammers, they were able to steal about 1/2 of btc pandora total holdings (basically everything, that was not on cold storage), they found the leak in system.2) i stopped all withdrawals, found leak and fix the bug in system and also were checking any signle money operation programming, that is the reason why everyone withdrawals were stopped for about 12 hours.what were my options back then, when i found bitcoin lost:1) i could make market to disapear and just close it down, everyone will think then, i scammed oll of you.2) i will apply solution to cover losses and continue operations.3) i choose number 2)why i didn`t told truth before:1) that would probably lead only to instant panic and market closure week before that day. all money would be probably lost - all vendors and customers money.2) i didn`t informed and pandora were able to make withdrawals of more than 1000btc since steal of bitcoins discovered to vendors -  all of that would not be possible if i would not take this drastic measurements.3) all my actions was made to safe pandora market and continue operation, time will tell if that was good move.4) only what i am sure about is if i didn`t made this drastic measurements, i can only close down the market and be remembered as scammer.current situation:1) i partly covered loss from my profits (this is probably very stupid move from me as everybody will probably blame me, i should closed market i think now) - i covered about 1/3 of losses from my own money (hard desicion for me).2) market and almost all btc will be recovered during this week by aplying very high tax on all transactions.actions made:1) currently only max 2/10 pandora holdings are held on main server so possible loss is limited to 2/10 of total pandora holdings.2) many security updates to the system, leak fixed.3) if pandora will survive that, in future if that ever happen again, loss is limited to 2/10 of btc holdings.facts:1) pandora market processing withdrawals for vendors and over 1000btc were sent to vendors during last week.2) all transaction must be taxed with scheme below to complete recovery.3) pandora will start processing withdrawal for all users by 23.3. (withdrawal fee for customers will aply from that day until 23. + 14 days)4) pandora will be recovered in less than 10 days from now.5) for those thinking about closing shops at pandora:5.1.) i really do understand that, but think about this:5.2.) small market might (i mean person behind the market) might not be ready for inflow of money and he might scam you anyway.5.3.) think again, how much you made with pandora market existence and how much you are going to make in future and without this market, you would may not be able to make money that you did there.5.4.) i didn`t had many ptions to safe market and this loss is temporary and will be repaid back.recovery scheme & buyback:1) for save pandora market i had to make very drastic measurements - commision (operating tax) of 24% during 23.3.1.2) commision paid from all transaction scheme:1.3) 24% by 23.3. (16% recovery tax if your item have add commision to item instead of deduct)1.4) 16% 23.3. - 31.3. (8% recovery tax if your item have add commision to item instead of deduct)1.5) 8% from 31.3. until 1.4.1.6) if you have option to add commision to item price as vendor, you are not charged full 24% but customer pay commision of 8% and after you are cahrged 16%.reason to accept that:1) truth is that you have no choice and if you want be able to withdraw for all send order, consider it as prepaid tax (will explain later).2) take it as necessary evil to continue bussiness on pandora market (i understand some of you will not).3) all commisions paid are in database and i know, who paid what amount of commisions above expected.4) example:4.1) escrow release for vendor_name(31118) on order 56086 amount 0.13266796 comm 0.03741917 (that is helf for every single transaction)5) these allow me to calculate exact commision paid by that day easily and:6) from 31.3. all affected vendors (probably all) will have overpaid commision calculated.7) overpaid commision ill be put to special database. all vendors will later pay only 40% of standard commision and 60% will be calculated back to repay tax back to vendors. 60% of future commisions will be paid back to vendors after total amount of overpaid money is 0. (proportion might change to pay back vendors quick as possible)9) worst case scenario is i will sell 30% of pandora earnings and pay from that debt to vendors to repay them overtax (each 1% will earn portion of pandora profits, paid daily).about me & what i think:1) i must be completely stupid to be honest in this bussines, because for me were such easier to exit.2) i don`t expect nobody to understand, even if i wrote that post, i think, many of you will think, this is beginning of scam, because it does make sence (but if i am going to scam i am not going to allow withdrawals of more than 1000btc right ? - so that play for that is truth)3) i must be very stupid, as i put even my all money back just for everybody will blaming me, but that is risk i am taking now.4) if somebody think, i am taking that 24% profits now, that is not true, it is much more easier just to close all withdrawals and run away with money - which i didn`t do.5) big truth is: now i am not making any money out of pandora, every single satoshi now go back to repay back loss.6) i don`t want to sound like i almos save your money, i will be blamed, of course, many will think, this is start of scam, or i took money by myselft, but none on that is truth.facts 2:1) if this is going to be scam, which is not, i am not going to allow withdrawals.2) recovery of all loss is by end of month.3) pandora will be beck in normal by end ot the month.4) 75% recovered. (30% from me).5) i am now working for free.6) pandora will survive (i believe that).7) personaly i still didn`t steal single bitcoins from customer or vendor. understand in this anonymous place it is not easy to believe nothing.super short version:1) pandora loss 1/2 of btc holdings.2) drastic tax is needed to recover (paid by all vendors).3) tax paid by vendors will be paid back in form of 40% or less commision pay in future.4) normal operation will start again approx 31.3.2014.update 1:1) all vendor & customer balances are not touched in any way and after recovery will be fully available (customers can still order from any vendor and vendors don`t have anny issues with withdrawals, from day 1 because i recovered cold storage and used my money to pay vendors).2) there are enough btc to cover all withdrawals (i calculated balances on all vendor accounts and pandora have multiple time balance for withdrawal then is available balance on vendor accounts) - vendors don`t have issues wit withdrawals from day 1 (except 12 hour withdrawal stop before few days).update 2:1) inflow of btc into pandora market is unchanged in comparsion to last week2) buyers are still buying in stable rate in compare to the last week3) others will try to make panic and take advantage of this issue, so if you can, please don`t try to create more panic but protect pandora if possible.4) if you want as vendor limit your loss, you can change item to add price instead of deduct, then from 23.3. commision 16% will aply and 8% will be paid by you and 8% by customer.best what vendor can do now to limit loss is probably change all their items to add commision to price.that way 8% commision is added to total price to be paid by customer. and from 23.3. "tax" is going to be 16% so, vendor is paying "just" 8% splitting it with customer. that 8% "tax" should not probably burn most of vendors as margins on items sold here are usually high and every vendor should survive that temporary loss to be paid back when back in normal.so if pandora is going to survive that, and at least half of people will understand why it is how it is now, pandora will be here for normal operations within 31.3.2014.now everybody say me fuck off and that i am idiont and scammer.for those who will stay calm, i promise you, i will repay commisions back in time (even for those who will not stay calm).never thought it is going happen to pandora, i always think these steal are always made by owners. i thought pandora is stronghold that can not be beaten, but i learned from this and i believe pandora is not going down !that`s it don`t know what to say more.

this whole thread is about blueskies traders not blu sky market. the market bsm is not a scam in any way shape or form. i cant speak for bluskiestraders. but seriusly fuck all you guys who say bsm is a scam. i vend their everyday and i havnt even had them be down for an hour or two ever.you are the same people spamming agora and pandora links cuz you get a kickback,. we all see how shitty those markets are turning out to be. and with sr2.0 anything but functional, i would say bsm is aat the moment the premier market for buyers no question. fastest and safest. partial escrow and auto-withdrawal with a functioning dispute center.

hello siblings,i originally made the post below at two venues: silkroad2 forumand on bitmessage.   there were no responses at allon sr2 forum (so far).. but there were several quality replies onbitmessage, both private replies to my private bm-address and public replies to the #bitchirp channel.   i would like to offerthis same post to the denizens of thehub (if only to test theall the talent at sr2 has migrated to thehub hypothesis. (and of-course, to benefit from more quality replies) :-)id like to start a discussion about namecoin, because it seems to methat this coin might end up being a dark horse that comes rushingto prominence all of a sudden... and heres why:introduction:you may remember the whole project to begin a new system of url addresses.ie. bit addresses (and begin a new system of domain name registration)this scheme uses a blockchain to store immutable,unscammable records of domain name registrations. the infrastructure is fait accompli .... its already built.the new urls might look something like this:  thehub.bit enter meowbitthis site appears to hold some promise for enabling this originalvision of starting up a new system of bit addresses and domain name registration.see here:   http://www.meowbit.com/if that is true, then perhaps we can expectto see the price of namecoin escalating in the future.members of both the cypherpunk and libertarian communitiesare taking a keen interest in this project becausethere are important potential consequences for anonymityand privacy since, without a central registrar .. it will be moredifficult for govt to create rules about who can create a domain name and whatidentity checks can be imposed on domain name owners.  it should alsobe more difficult for govt to shut down a website and/or prosecute its owners.all this is interesting on many levels.. not least of which is the prospectfor future namecoin values.  the current value of name coins is $2.81 dollars(price from btc-e.com).  but notice that currently the price of namecoin isin "delicious" decline :  in nov 2013 the price of namecoins peaked to $14it then peaked again to over $8 in jan 2014.two important questions:1.  how low will namecoin go during its current decline ?2.  how high will namecoin go if bit domains take off ?heres my guesses (naturally, they are biased via my own "hope-ium" inebriation)1.  the price will sink to $1 this year.2.  the price will climb to $100 in the next 5 years.okay.. lets try to factor out my bias1.  the price will sink to $2 this year.2.  the price will climb to $20 in the next 5 years.please feel free to comment or question any of the above material.have a nice day.. and be happy :-)playground

any phone period is a bad idea.if you have a cell signal, you can be detected to within a 20x20 foot square - thats the way cellular protocols work. each tower has to know when to "pass" you onto the next tower (called a "cell" - hence "cellular") as you pass out of its range. it knows this because it measures your signal strength very precisely.if you have 3 or more towers within your cellphones range (and you almost always do) your position can be triangulated very precisely just by looking at the relative signal strength from each of the towers. as i said this is fundamental to cellular phones... you cannot work around this.so basically you are carrying a little tracking device on you all day, every day... which can and does neatly map out:- who you are- where you are- where youve been- who youve been withand then by tapping voice/text/ip content:- what you said- what you didor by using trojans to access smartphone content, any of:- live audio from using the phones mic- live video using the phones camera- your contacts, pictures, numbers, emails, etc.if youre stupid enough to then back up your shit to cloud storage like (say) icloud then all this data (including 3 weeks of location data) is all packaged neatly and ready for them to sniff or just take from the cloud provider.the best business is not to conduct any business via a phone period. or have one anywhere near you when youre doing business. remember that even when off, most cellphones are simply "hibernating" and still poll towers occasionally. you have  to physically remove the battery and most smartphones dont let you do this without some screwdriver work.alternately, a metal cocktail shaker is apparently amazing as a shield. drop your phones in there. but then they still know where those phones were, so your location is still kinda obvious.

hi, im just posting here because im looking around for a chemist who will talk to me about synthesizing mdma, lsd, dmt and mescaline. im a chemistry student and i have some questions about how the black market works. what im most curious about is how to obtain lab equipment, and precursors for lsd (i cant find ergotamine tartrate on any market, and its not really something i can make myself) i have found safrole but where could i go to do something like this without causing some sort of disturbance because of fumes? i am seriously considering moving to another country because my personal opinion is that producing these psychedelics is genuinely a sort of holy work. i read that william leonard pickard was thinking of moving to holland at one point... i wonder how he was able to get kilos of et... thanks for reading and if youd like to talk please message me or at least leave a post. ive been looking for a long time for someone to talk to about these things.
yeah, the "view image" trick has not worked for me.  its just not working sometimes.  i try to keep a vender link around, sometimes that makes the captcha work for me.
i used costcos services in the past, he is legit.

any phone period is a bad idea.if you have a cell signal, you can be detected to within a 20x20 foot square - thats the way cellular protocols work. each tower has to know when to "pass" you onto the next tower (called a "cell" - hence "cellular") as you pass out of its range. it knows this because it measures your signal strength very precisely.if you have 3 or more towers within your cellphones range (and you almost always do) your position can be triangulated very precisely just by looking at the relative signal strength from each of the towers. as i said this is fundamental to cellular phones... you cannot work around this.so basically you are carrying a little tracking device on you all day, every day... which can and does neatly map out:- who you are- where you are- where youve been- who youve been withand then by tapping voice/text/ip content:- what you said- what you didor by using trojans to access smartphone content, any of:- live audio from using the phones mic- live video using the phones camera- your contacts, pictures, numbers, emails, etc.if youre stupid enough to then back up your shit to cloud storage like (say) icloud then all this data (including 3 weeks of location data) is all packaged neatly and ready for them to sniff or just take from the cloud provider.the best business is not to conduct any business via a phone period. or have one anywhere near you when youre doing business. remember that even when off, most cellphones are simply "hibernating" and still poll towers occasionally. you have  to physically remove the battery and most smartphones dont let you do this without some screwdriver work.alternately, a metal cocktail shaker is apparently amazing as a shield. drop your phones in there. but then they still know where those phones were, so your location is still kinda obvious.

(and of-course, to benefit from more quality replies) :-)id like to start a discussion about namecoin, because it seems to methat this coin might end up being a dark horse that comes rushingto prominence all of a sudden... and heres why:introduction:you may remember the whole project to begin a new system of url addresses.ie. bit addresses (and begin a new system of domain name registration)this scheme uses a blockchain to store immutable,unscammable records of domain name registrations. the infrastructure is fait accompli .... its already built.the new urls might look something like this:  thehub.bit enter meowbitthis site appears to hold some promise for enabling this originalvision of starting up a new system of bit addresses and domain name registration.see here:   http://www.meowbit.com/if that is true, then perhaps we can expectto see the price of namecoin escalating in the future.members of both the cypherpunk and libertarian communitiesare taking a keen interest in this project becausethere are important potential consequences for anonymityand privacy since, without a central registrar .. it will be moredifficult for govt to create rules about who can create a domain name and whatidentity checks can be imposed on domain name owners.  it should alsobe more difficult for govt to shut down a website and/or prosecute its owners.all this is interesting on many levels.. not least of which is the prospectfor future namecoin values.  the current value of name coins is $2.81 dollars(price from btc-e.com).  but notice that currently the price of namecoin isin "delicious" decline :  in nov 2013 the price of namecoins peaked to $14it then peaked again to over $8 in jan 2014.two important questions:1.  how low will namecoin go during its current decline ?2.  how high will namecoin go if bit domains take off ?heres my guesses (naturally, they are biased via my own "hope-ium" inebriation)1.  the price will sink to $1 this year.2.  the price will climb to $100 in the next 5 years.okay.. lets try to factor out my bias1.  the price will sink to $2 this year.2.  the price will climb to $20 in the next 5 years.please feel free to comment or question any of the above material.have a nice day.. and be happy :-)playground

i dont think anyone has done this million dollar idea. make a virtual counterfeit btc then break it down to pennys in mutiple wallets. the get 1$ in real btc and break it down to pennys then put the two together in a  different wallet. and youve got it. heres a map of the idea:fake computer created btc-> busted down and seperated->sent all broken chunks to one wallet.-> when they come together  it will say one btc and not two seperate amounts1$ worth of legit btc-> broken down also /seperated-> sent all chuks to one wallet.-> when they come together  it will say one btc and not two seperate amountsso basically we just needa figure out how they make the currency digitally and immitate it just like paper currency.
in fact, fuck the edit i made to the op - you can come to me.pm me anything signed with goingpostals key (the one found on agora, not on your new site). if it checks out, ill leave ya alone.if it doesnt, you can piss off. *hic*(tehe. i used a naughty word. piss)

good to see u back bro!
i dont think anyone has done this million dollar idea. make a virtual counterfeit btc then break it down to pennys in mutiple wallets. the get 1$ in real btc and break it down to pennys then put the two together in a  different wallet. and youve got it. heres a map of the idea:fake computer created btc-> busted down and seperated->sent all broken chunks to one wallet.-> when they come together  it will say one btc and not two seperate amounts1$ worth of legit btc-> broken down also /seperated-> sent all chuks to one wallet.-> when they come together  it will say one btc and not two seperate amountsso basically we just needa figure out how they make the currency digitally and immitate it just like paper currency.

its a breakdown of which crypto currencies are worth backing and some speculation for the future 10 years.which at the moment as far as cryptos go is a little too far sighted for me.
works! but is there no need for socks5 setting in the network connection?

in the listing above... but that includes the hypher-inflating fiat currencies:  usd, eur, rur, etc.   but maybe theres hidden information in this listing.youll notice that some currencies appear more often in these pairs, like usd for example.question:  which of the non-fiat currencies appear most in the pairings ?answer:  btc appears in 271 of the pairings, ltc appears in 112 of the pairings,doge (amazingly, given it started life as a joke) appears in 31 of the pairings,xrp (ripple is a centralised, and vastly pre-mined, bankster owned, sabotage-coin that shouldnt be trusted and doesnt offer any anonymity -- buyer beware!) appears in 14 of the pairings.  nmc (which im tipping for a glorious future) appears (alas) in only 7 of the pairings.what drops out of this brief analysis for me:1.  it re-affirms that litecoin is the no.2 coin       (but not by market capitalisation:  https://coinmarketcap.com )2.  the incredible rise of doggie coin (doge)     (perhaps this coin deserves further research scrutiny to answer the big questions:      - does it have a future ?         - will its price rise substantially ?how many of these coins will survive the next 10 years ?i strongly suspect less than 10 will survive to see mass mainstream use.probably litecoin and bitcoin are guaranteed entrants to that list.. but who are the others ?  namecoin ?  quarkcoin ?   max keisers maxcoin ?  luckycoin ?any reasoned arguments on which coins will survive to see mainstreamadoption ... are very welcome.  :-)those of you who keep up with the financial news on bloomberg, reuters, rt.com or zero hedge will be well aware of the start of the collapse of the petrodollar and hence the start of the end of the us dollar as the worlds reserve currency.see here:  http://rt.com/op-edge/russia-switches-to-brics-sanctions-357/this is likely to shake up investment decisions the world over.  money willflow into new avenues... bitcoin and litecoin will be obvious new homes for some % of this cash. this is a probable catalyst to further btc and ltc price rises this year... one notable tipster on btc-e.com is predicting bitcoin at $2000 and litecoin at $50before the year is out  (litecoin keeping its current 2.5% valuation against bitcoin)have a nice day .. and be happyplayground :-)

hey guys and dollsi noticed that so far the roll call is only showing vendors. how many of you mention the blue sky sub on the hub to your customers?thing is, as blue sky has no forum, and because the hub is not affiliated anywhere, its very unlikely that bsm owners will actively divert users to here from their market site, so i doubt many users even know it exists. but forums are a great place for keeping in contact with your customers (as im sure you already know!) so it might be worth encouraging *hic* your customers from bsm to come on in and say hi to us all here - comment on your review threads, etc., etc.just thinking aloud.
but when look at it, its not a very well conceived thought was it?youd be best off hacking some financial institution and robbing th fuck out of that.much much less jail time.
i hate stating the obvious.. but bitcoins cannot be counterfeited. you cannot make fake bitcoins.it is one of the fundamental principles of crypto-currencies.
lol. you can fake a bitcoin transaction. but its not something lila and his ipad can accomplish.to my understanding, you need to have a good % of the overall hash rate and be able to process whole blocks on your own. you proccess a block and *somehow* edit it into saying you have (or have not) sent btc to a certain address. it can be confirmed multiple times but the more confirmations it needs the more processing power you need.sorry for the incredibly non-technical explanation. i havent read too far into it. i only have like 3mh/s of processing power.
it is possible though to create a fake transaction, is it not?they dont really let you do anything because the blockchain wont confirm them.the blockchain is like that really angry cashier who checks your note against the light, all the while glaring at you as if to say "yeah boy. i know what youss tryin a pull on me an it aint workin"then she hands you your note back and says "go fuck yourself". then honks your nose.*hic*maybe it was just a dream.
bsm consumer here. keep up the great work guys. ive only got a couple feedback at the moment but i hope to become a trusted buyer.

hey guys,in the last few weeks have organised a few transactions with saint nic, with payment being made directly to a bc address, and away from the mainstream marketplaces. firstly, their communication is always quick and thorough, they tend to steer clear of one or two word responses. the mdma i recieved was some of the best i have ever got my hands on. a lovely brown colour with plenty of rocks mixed throughout, and the ainseed smell was almost overpowering.i paid nic directly for a 60g order, was disptahced within 24 hours and all envelopes landed shortly after. product was tested with mecke/simons and marquis testers and tested strongly as expected. when all contents were removed from the mylar, they had sent a total of 3.3g's extra.without giving away too much on packaging, their stealth was very clever despite being confined to an envelope.p.s their mdma was acetone washed by acen and these were the results:washed by:    acenvendor:         saint niclink:              http://silkroad6ownowfk.onion/users/saint-nicbought:         agreementdate:              25.01.2014 (25th of january)amount of g washed :         1,089 gamount of g after wash :     0,982 gpurity-percentage :            90.17 %link (acetone wash): http://silkroad5v7dywlc.onion/index.php?topic=286.msg396602#msg396602santa operates in a very professional and curtious manner. their products are of a very high quality and their prices are competitve. cheerscapz

i hate stating the obvious.. but bitcoins cannot be counterfeited. you cannot make fake bitcoins.it is one of the fundamental principles of crypto-currencies.
lol. you can fake a bitcoin transaction. but its not something lila and his ipad can accomplish.to my understanding, you need to have a good % of the overall hash rate and be able to process whole blocks on your own. you proccess a block and *somehow* edit it into saying you have (or have not) sent btc to a certain address. it can be confirmed multiple times but the more confirmations it needs the more processing power you need.sorry for the incredibly non-technical explanation. i havent read too far into it. i only have like 3mh/s of processing power.
it is possible though to create a fake transaction, is it not?they dont really let you do anything because the blockchain wont confirm them.the blockchain is like that really angry cashier who checks your note against the light, all the while glaring at you as if to say "yeah boy. i know what youss tryin a pull on me an it aint workin"then she hands you your note back and says "go fuck yourself". then honks your nose.*hic*maybe it was just a dream.
theres a post on reddit, or otherwise you can go into every market and check it out, its not that difficult.
congratulations santa, a title well earned
hey guys,in the last few weeks have organised a few transactions with saint nic, with payment being made directly to a bc address, and away from the mainstream marketplaces. firstly, their communication is always quick and thorough, they tend to steer clear of one or two word responses. the mdma i recieved was some of the best i have ever got my hands on. a lovely brown colour with plenty of rocks mixed throughout, and the ainseed smell was almost overpowering.i paid nic directly for a 60g order, was disptahced within 24 hours and all envelopes landed shortly after. product was tested with mecke/simons and marquis testers and tested strongly as expected. when all contents were removed from the mylar, they had sent a total of 3.3g's extra.without giving away too much on packaging, their stealth was very clever despite being confined to an envelope.p.s their mdma was acetone washed by acen and these were the results:washed by:    acenvendor:         saint niclink:              http://silkroad6ownowfk.onion/users/saint-nicbought:         agreementdate:              25.01.2014 (25th of january)amount of g washed :         1,089 gamount of g after wash :     0,982 gpurity-percentage :            90.17 %link (acetone wash): http://silkroad5v7dywlc.onion/index.php?topic=286.msg396602#msg396602santa operates in a very professional and curtious manner. their products are of a very high quality and their prices are competitve. cheerscapz

yang/btc ybc/btc yin/btc zcc/btc zcc/cny zed/btc zed/usd zeit/btc zeit/ltc zet/btc zet/cny zet/doge zet/ltcthe question is..  how many different currencies are there ?theres 287 different currencies in the listing above... but that includes the hypher-inflating fiat currencies:  usd, eur, rur, etc.   but maybe theres hidden information in this listing.youll notice that some currencies appear more often in these pairs, like usd for example.question:  which of the non-fiat currencies appear most in the pairings ?answer:  btc appears in 271 of the pairings, ltc appears in 112 of the pairings,doge (amazingly, given it started life as a joke) appears in 31 of the pairings,xrp (ripple is a centralised, and vastly pre-mined, bankster owned, sabotage-coin that shouldnt be trusted and doesnt offer any anonymity -- buyer beware!) appears in 14 of the pairings.  nmc (which im tipping for a glorious future) appears (alas) in only 7 of the pairings.what drops out of this brief analysis for me:1.  it re-affirms that litecoin is the no.2 coin       (but not by market capitalisation:  https://coinmarketcap.com )2.  the incredible rise of doggie coin (doge)     (perhaps this coin deserves further research scrutiny to answer the big questions:      - does it have a future ?         - will its price rise substantially ?how many of these coins will survive the next 10 years ?i strongly suspect less than 10 will survive to see mass mainstream use.probably litecoin and bitcoin are guaranteed entrants to that list.. but who are the others ?  namecoin ?  quarkcoin ?   max keisers maxcoin ?  luckycoin ?any reasoned arguments on which coins will survive to see mainstreamadoption ... are very welcome.  :-)those of you who keep up with the financial news on bloomberg, reuters, rt.com or zero hedge will be well aware of the start of the collapse of the petrodollar and hence the start of the end of the us dollar as the worlds reserve currency.see here:  http://rt.com/op-edge/russia-switches-to-brics-sanctions-357/this is likely to shake up investment decisions the world over.  money willflow into new avenues... bitcoin and litecoin will be obvious new homes for some % of this cash. this is a probable catalyst to further btc and ltc price rises this year... one notable tipster on btc-e.com is predicting bitcoin at $2000 and litecoin at $50before the year is out  (litecoin keeping its current 2.5% valuation against bitcoin)have a nice day .. and be happyplayground :-)
deemz, brotha good move. never liked anything about that site. stay up my friend
i'd like to congratulate saint nic on getting verified. he is now a star vendor in the eyes of the avengers.buy from santa with confidence.bowie
bsm consumer here. keep up the great work guys. ive only got a couple feedback at the moment but i hope to become a trusted buyer.
hey guys and dollsi noticed that so far the roll call is only showing vendors. how many of you mention the blue sky sub on the hub to your customers?thing is, as blue sky has no forum, and because the hub is not affiliated anywhere, its very unlikely that bsm owners will actively divert users to here from their market site, so i doubt many users even know it exists. but forums are a great place for keeping in contact with your customers (as im sure you already know!) so it might be worth encouraging *hic* your customers from bsm to come on in and say hi to us all here - comment on your review threads, etc., etc.just thinking aloud.
rc4e may or may not be in right now, please leave an encrypted message after the beep and kindly deposit your btcs. one of our shipping experts will assist you shortly..
quote from: blackstar on march 23, 2014, 08:21:20 amnice to see you gentlemen/ladies. be careful of btcfog. they ate a g of btc like an expensive vending machine. just never showed up as a deposit.if you can follow the blockchain to your deposit and show it to support, they will fix it. sometimes their system squirrels up a bit. ive never had a problem that was not fixed though. if you show the the txid of the deposit and have the keys to the dpad it leads to, they will fix your account and get your coin straightened out.
recently completed my first purchase from bsm and its safe to say that i love it. its now one of my go to markets.
we here @ rc4e actively try to direct our customers from all markets to come here.
i cant speak for anyone else that has dealt with pandora, but ive bought on there from the begining. have only been scammed once which is good, and never had any issues retrieving my leftover btc.
update:we are almost done with coding there are some delays but nothing that will hold us up for much longer. we are setting up some servers right as we speak and we should have a forum back up soon. once coding is done we start on graphics design/html/css. we are committed to proving the best most pleasant most secure user experience possible.also we made the decision to add anoncoin to our accepted payment options.
its a breakdown of which crypto currencies are worth backing and some speculation for the future 10 years.which at the moment as far as cryptos go is a little too far sighted for me.
being as bsm has no forum, this is our meeting place. it would be nice to see whos around and get a community feel.blackstallion checkin in.
nice to see you gentlemen/ladies. be careful of btcfog. they ate a g of btc like an expensive vending machine. just never showed up as a deposit.

yang/btc ybc/btc yin/btc zcc/btc zcc/cny zed/btc zed/usd zeit/btc zeit/ltc zet/btc zet/cny zet/doge zet/ltcthe question is..  how many different currencies are there ?theres 287 different currencies in the listing above... but that includes the hypher-inflating fiat currencies:  usd, eur, rur, etc.   but maybe theres hidden information in this listing.youll notice that some currencies appear more often in these pairs, like usd for example.question:  which of the non-fiat currencies appear most in the pairings ?answer:  btc appears in 271 of the pairings, ltc appears in 112 of the pairings,doge (amazingly, given it started life as a joke) appears in 31 of the pairings,xrp (ripple is a centralised, and vastly pre-mined, bankster owned, sabotage-coin that shouldnt be trusted and doesnt offer any anonymity -- buyer beware!) appears in 14 of the pairings.  nmc (which im tipping for a glorious future) appears (alas) in only 7 of the pairings.what drops out of this brief analysis for me:1.  it re-affirms that litecoin is the no.2 coin       (but not by market capitalisation:  https://coinmarketcap.com )2.  the incredible rise of doggie coin (doge)     (perhaps this coin deserves further research scrutiny to answer the big questions:      - does it have a future ?         - will its price rise substantially ?how many of these coins will survive the next 10 years ?i strongly suspect less than 10 will survive to see mass mainstream use.probably litecoin and bitcoin are guaranteed entrants to that list.. but who are the others ?  namecoin ?  quarkcoin ?   max keisers maxcoin ?  luckycoin ?any reasoned arguments on which coins will survive to see mainstreamadoption ... are very welcome.  :-)those of you who keep up with the financial news on bloomberg, reuters, rt.com or zero hedge will be well aware of the start of the collapse of the petrodollar and hence the start of the end of the us dollar as the worlds reserve currency.see here:  http://rt.com/op-edge/russia-switches-to-brics-sanctions-357/this is likely to shake up investment decisions the world over.  money willflow into new avenues... bitcoin and litecoin will be obvious new homes for some % of this cash. this is a probable catalyst to further btc and ltc price rises this year... one notable tipster on btc-e.com is predicting bitcoin at $2000 and litecoin at $50before the year is out  (litecoin keeping its current 2.5% valuation against bitcoin)have a nice day .. and be happyplayground :-)
deemz, brotha good move. never liked anything about that site. stay up my friend
i'd like to congratulate saint nic on getting verified. he is now a star vendor in the eyes of the avengers.buy from santa with confidence.bowie
bsm consumer here. keep up the great work guys. ive only got a couple feedback at the moment but i hope to become a trusted buyer.
hey guys and dollsi noticed that so far the roll call is only showing vendors. how many of you mention the blue sky sub on the hub to your customers?thing is, as blue sky has no forum, and because the hub is not affiliated anywhere, its very unlikely that bsm owners will actively divert users to here from their market site, so i doubt many users even know it exists. but forums are a great place for keeping in contact with your customers (as im sure you already know!) so it might be worth encouraging *hic* your customers from bsm to come on in and say hi to us all here - comment on your review threads, etc., etc.just thinking aloud.
rc4e may or may not be in right now, please leave an encrypted message after the beep and kindly deposit your btcs. one of our shipping experts will assist you shortly..
quote from: blackstar on march 23, 2014, 08:21:20 amnice to see you gentlemen/ladies. be careful of btcfog. they ate a g of btc like an expensive vending machine. just never showed up as a deposit.if you can follow the blockchain to your deposit and show it to support, they will fix it. sometimes their system squirrels up a bit. ive never had a problem that was not fixed though. if you show the the txid of the deposit and have the keys to the dpad it leads to, they will fix your account and get your coin straightened out.
recently completed my first purchase from bsm and its safe to say that i love it. its now one of my go to markets.
we here @ rc4e actively try to direct our customers from all markets to come here.
i cant speak for anyone else that has dealt with pandora, but ive bought on there from the begining. have only been scammed once which is good, and never had any issues retrieving my leftover btc.
update:we are almost done with coding there are some delays but nothing that will hold us up for much longer. we are setting up some servers right as we speak and we should have a forum back up soon. once coding is done we start on graphics design/html/css. we are committed to proving the best most pleasant most secure user experience possible.also we made the decision to add anoncoin to our accepted payment options.
its a breakdown of which crypto currencies are worth backing and some speculation for the future 10 years.which at the moment as far as cryptos go is a little too far sighted for me.
being as bsm has no forum, this is our meeting place. it would be nice to see whos around and get a community feel.blackstallion checkin in.
nice to see you gentlemen/ladies. be careful of btcfog. they ate a g of btc like an expensive vending machine. just never showed up as a deposit.
works! but is there no need for socks5 setting in the network connection?
what the hell is this
yea! congrats santa, have fun dropping all the goodies down the chimneys of the world.
scamscamscamscamscamscamscamscamscamscamscamscamscamscamscamscamscamscamscamscamscamscamscamscamscamscamscamscamscamscamscammotherfucker has been exposed already in vendors.http://thehubaoydxrommh.onion/index.php?topic=2229.0
but when look at it, its not a very well conceived thought was it?youd be best off hacking some financial institution and robbing th fuck out of that.much much less jail time.
i hate stating the obvious.. but bitcoins cannot be counterfeited. you cannot make fake bitcoins.it is one of the fundamental principles of crypto-currencies.
lol. you can fake a bitcoin transaction. but its not something lila and his ipad can accomplish.to my understanding, you need to have a good % of the overall hash rate and be able to process whole blocks on your own. you proccess a block and *somehow* edit it into saying you have (or have not) sent btc to a certain address. it can be confirmed multiple times but the more confirmations it needs the more processing power you need.sorry for the incredibly non-technical explanation. i havent read too far into it. i only have like 3mh/s of processing power.
it is possible though to create a fake transaction, is it not?they dont really let you do anything because the blockchain wont confirm them.the blockchain is like that really angry cashier who checks your note against the light, all the while glaring at you as if to say "yeah boy. i know what youss tryin a pull on me an it aint workin"then she hands you your note back and says "go fuck yourself". then honks your nose.*hic*maybe it was just a dream.
any update from admim/mods ?
this "realgoingpostal" guy is a complete scam. goingpostal is on agora. we are not on evolution.
same problem, hopefully the vendor has seen my order before the site went down. this is occurring quite often lately though.
im getting either problem loading page or blank orange screen... not sure what to make of it.
back up.problem is, theres only 1 admin with a day-time job and no mods so when it goes down in the day (as it often does on monday) were stuck in limbo.but i suppose thats the price we pay.

why tcp to a hidden service and not ssl via a tor outproxy? most of the electrum servers dont block tor outproxies, there is really no need to use a hidden service. for that all you need is to set up your network to use localhost and 9050 as the port with socks4 as the protocol. there is one server running the ssl service on port 110, tails will bitch at you when it connects to it. if it bothers you you can just comment that server out. also, with dotfiles persistence enabled, there is no need to enable root or manually hack at the persistence.conf. once you create your wallet, just copy the .electrum directory into the dotfiles directory in tailsdata_unlocked.
quote from: willowsmom on march 24, 2014, 06:21:14 pmnot happy right now. i withdrew all my coin yesterday morning and yes, now my balance is 0. however, the coin hasnt even been sent yet. the transaction is listed, the correct withdrawal address is noted, but its labeled "pending," still, not on blockchain, almost 20 hours later. i put in a ticket but jeez i need my money! this is the first time ive had a problem like this on bsm------------------------update: its now been almost 24 hours, support never got back to me, but the "pending" status was just changed to "sent," and the coin is in my wallet. so im thinking glitch.read the faq and stuff. it says in there that sometimes withdrawals are done manually (for whatever reason) and may take a bit longer. glad they showed up no problem.
is agra down again cant seem to access it it was ok at 2.am this morning.
theres some twat on the agora forums claiming that the site was seized, but of course he didnt post any proof, claims he has a "secret source". hope its just bs!http://i4rx33ibdndtqayh.onion/index.php/topic,5821.0.html

back up.any other vendor and id have been bricking it when agora went down but i know th would always find a way. only vendor i genuinely trust, definitely looking forward to my midweek package now the pills are finally back ^.^
dear all:is it more dangerous to my anonymity to visit non-onion sites with tor?
this question can be answered many ways.is traffic analysis easier when visiting clearnet sites?yes. you rotate exit nodes every 10 minutes while a hidden service keeps its entry guards for a month or longer. since your end of the connection is the same in both cases, you reach a certain probability of getting pwned by traffic analysis much faster when visiting clearnet sites than when visiting hidden servcies.is a clearnet site more likely to be malicious or try to deanonyize you than a hidden service?probably not. clearnet sites may try to track you for targeted advertising, but tor browser does a good job of defending against linkability. its worth noting that the only targeted deanonymization attack against tor users that we know about came from a hidden service (freedom hosting).are there other factors that can threaten your anonymity?yes. the connection from the exit node to the clearnet site isnt encrypted unless you make it encrypted with ssl/tls while circuits to hidden services are always encrypted end to end.also tcp streams to different clearnet sites may be multiplexed in the same circuit and leave the same exit node, which will know that you (or rather the same anonymous person) is visiting those sites, while circuits to hidden services are always separate. you can set an option in tors configuration file to enforce stream isolation although its not recommended for web browsing.a final factor affects other apps besides tor browser. if you misconfigure your proxy settings you may accidentally connect to a clearnet site over clearnet rather than over tor, but misconfigured proxy settings will cause a connection to a hidden service to simply fail (perhaps with a dns leak).

you want two phones in my opinionyou want a burner phone with a sim so you can conduct buisness granted you have the apps to encrypt the texts/calls etc. with a vpn then destroy it completely when youre donethen you want a smartphone that you can root, take the sim out of it. only connect to a vpn and run tor through it since rooted (it can direct all traffic through tor if rooted) never do anything naked on it as well and use that for personal or attacks or anything else you might want. just dont link your irl credentials on it if youre tying it to an online persona (bank #, irl friends, etc) use one smartphone like this for each identity you havethats what i do

if you are asking about the pass code for you pgp i wouldnt use any spaces. at minimum should be 12+ keys, i recomend 30+ keys.

this question can be answered many ways.is traffic analysis easier when visiting clearnet sites?yes. you rotate exit nodes every 10 minutes while a hidden service keeps its entry guards for a month or longer. since your end of the connection is the same in both cases, you reach a certain probability of getting pwned by traffic analysis much faster when visiting clearnet sites than when visiting hidden servcies.is a clearnet site more likely to be malicious or try to deanonyize you than a hidden service?probably not. clearnet sites may try to track you for targeted advertising, but tor browser does a good job of defending against linkability. its worth noting that the only targeted deanonymization attack against tor users that we know about came from a hidden service (freedom hosting).are there other factors that can threaten your anonymity?yes. the connection from the exit node to the clearnet site isnt encrypted unless you make it encrypted with ssl/tls while circuits to hidden services are always encrypted end to end.also tcp streams to different clearnet sites may be multiplexed in the same circuit and leave the same exit node, which will know that you (or rather the same anonymous person) is visiting those sites, while circuits to hidden services are always separate. you can set an option in tors configuration file to enforce stream isolation although its not recommended for web browsing.a final factor affects other apps besides tor browser. if you misconfigure your proxy settings you may accidentally connect to a clearnet site over clearnet rather than over tor, but misconfigured proxy settings will cause a connection to a hidden service to simply fail (perhaps with a dns leak).

another bsm consumer here. hi folks!
this is just a note bump our thread so people are aware of any orders that have been placed with us on agora are aware of any delays.th
why tcp to a hidden service and not ssl via a tor outproxy? most of the electrum servers dont block tor outproxies, there is really no need to use a hidden service. for that all you need is to set up your network to use localhost and 9050 as the port with socks4 as the protocol. there is one server running the ssl service on port 110, tails will bitch at you when it connects to it. if it bothers you you can just comment that server out. also, with dotfiles persistence enabled, there is no need to enable root or manually hack at the persistence.conf. once you create your wallet, just copy the .electrum directory into the dotfiles directory in tailsdata_unlocked.
