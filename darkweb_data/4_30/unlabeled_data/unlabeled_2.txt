go to a place like localbitcoins.com.  they put coins in escrow until deal is finished.  i just did a wu deal with a dude in china and got my coins in minutes.  you can see there feedback and everything.
that update was very interesting. the person who wrote that message knows what they are talking about. what is really interesting is the author believes the "hacker" wouldnt have gotten away with much. this suggests it was an inside job. his assessment of gox itself is very interesting. it sounds like goxs accounting was terrible because they couldnt handle bitcoin transactions correctly. if this is correct this certainly explains why gox is stalling (there database is a mess). if the blockchain transactions are similar to a linked list adt then they are going to have one hell of mess to clean up.  heres my theory based on that evidence. i think sr was indeed hacked and some funds were stolen. i think defcunt saw the coins vanishing and shutdown bitcoind. after this i think he realized his database was a total mess and he could not fix it so he decided to steal all the coins and blamed the hacker for everything. if you havent noticed peoples balances are fucked up and there are people who have no pending balance.

important: silk road has removed escrow. customer support is non existent.due to recent events, silk road has removed the security of escrow from its market. orders are now set to auto-finalize, leaving buyers at the mercy of vendors. to make matters worse; there is currently no customer support from site staff, as staff continue to direct full attention to the market itself. disputes can still be opened but responses are so far, not forthcoming.what does this mean? this means that buyers are completely in the hands of vendors. vendors are free to claim packages have been dispatched, and without staff intervention there can be no way of settling the dispute. its advisable to avoid the market in the current state but if you must use silk road - please only deal with vendors you recognise, or that can be researched thoroughly.
delete this if it seems pointless but growing numbers of users, especially new users are ignorant to the state of silk road at the moment and only become aware once theyve placed an order. if this stops one user being scammed then its worked.

i have pending balance and pendin escrow...both orders from before the shutdown, neither marked shipped before...one marked shipped after...the one marked shipped hasnt auto-finalized and the one with the cancel option hasnt been automatically cancelled so for now im sticking to the old escrow system until the goods arrive (and the vendor isnt receiving funds even in pending when people finalize so i want to be sure they have that worked out before i do)otherwise, my balance is now zero, just the pending balance and pending escrow balance

quote from: ep1cxm457 on february 28, 2014, 05:51:51 ami would expect this post to have advice on buying your coins in an anonymous fashion. that is, in order for leo to convict you they need all the pieces of the following puzzle: (1) person x purchased btc with y method, (2) same person x then transfered said purchased btc and transferred it for illegal purposes, (3) person x was taken into custody with evidence of the illegal activities. steps 2 and 3 are the ones most thought about and are dealt with by coin washing and pgp encryption of address, among other things ensuring safe delivery. i think this post should emphasize point 1 and the options for buying btc on here are mostly ones that can trace the purchase directly back to an individual (i.e., to a credit card or bank account). i endorse finding ways to purchase the btc using cash transfer in the most anonymous fashion possible. for instance, i have seen listings on localbitcoin.com for cash in the mail transfers; however one must have a high level of trust in said vendor for this to be a viable option. another localbitcoin trick is the "other online payment optioin" where you purchase something like a greendot card in cash at a grocery store or convenience store and then upload images of said card and reciept showing it was purchased in cash. if you choose this option it is vital that you know the metadata of the images you will be sending do not send images taken on a cell phone, be sure there is no accurate time or location data retrievable from the image. this can be accomplished through a function in tails or you could upload the images to imgur and then use those images for the transfer. since most vendors who work this way request an image of the receipt as well, i highly suggest using a pen or marker to remove all location/time identification from the receirpt (e.g., fold it to hide the label of the store you purchased it from, write over the letters and numbers that could be used as identifiable information). finally, when you purchase the cash to coin intermediary (e.g., vanilla reload card) i suggest you wear heavy clothing such that no images of your face can be taken while you purchase the card (i.e., hoddie and sun glasses and something to cover your chin, gloves dont hurt either). i also suggest you purchase cards from more than one location as this makes it more difficult to isolate where the purchases are taking place. remember, always act as if you are already compromised by leo. as an extra step of precautions, i would suggest parking your car a little ways aways from the purchase location so that no cameras could get a picture of you entering your car and getting your license plate number. the only better way to buy coin is to buy it in cash from a friend of yours with a decent stock pile, then there are no traces whatsoever. this way if leo ever does hit you with scenario (3), being caught with evidence of illegal activity, they will not be able to add on extra charges that would be possible if they can trace the purchase all the way back to the purchase of the btc. washing your coins is important, do it early and do it alot, but there is another step before washing the coins that can be just as important as washing the coins and that is anonymous purchase of the coins. please, anyone give feedback on this post to identify ways to improve the anonymity of purchasing coins anonymously. also, if you have some spare coin, donate it to alfred. this site is awesome and i want it to stick around just as much as erowid.orgmost folks already realize that using a bitcoin mixing service is essential, and recommended for security even if you purchase bitcoin locally with cash.it is becoming more difficult to purchase bitcoin without providing identity information which will taint your coins and make it possible to track the use back to you, so keep a separate bitcoin wallet for clean coins. send all your newly purchased bitcoin through bitcoin fog with delivery to your clean wallet and you are good to go.

i voted no. i have a buyer account.on my account it says balance 0 but under pending it has what my balance was (like 0.0001). so im assuming that is what im owed but i havent received it yet.
i have some empathy but please do not forget the fact you are a reporter.id not have exposed your common information - poor protocol is immature just my opinion
our experience was the few initial orders there were fine - we then required support on a transaction and it was a 2 or 3 day reply from support and our issue was not resolved. we agreed to a 2/3 percent refund to the buyer and dl kept the bitcoins - buyer was out 240.00usd because of this action. we lost a small portion too.we will not vend on dls market anymore as they have flaws in little or no support and deceitful practices.c8 edit update: received and emailing stating every was resolved - it was not funds were never released

cyprus has long been an attractive offshore financial hub. their economy is based on the finance sector and tourism but the gfc did come a knockin in 2013 unfortunately, with the citizens left to involuntarily foot the bill. a bailout agreement reached with eu meant that the countrys second biggest bank froze accounts so that the gov could take out 40% of the money from all uninsured accounts, as well as other measures hostile to the interests of the people.this was the catalyst for a "bail-in" of bitcoin due to people wanting to protect their wealth from their own government. the bitcoin price shot up drastically from highs of $30-$40 to $260, before we were all goxxed of course.as cyprus have long been well educated when it comes to finance it is no surprise to see many cypriots calling for cyprus to become the worlds first bitcoin hub. they realize that there are huge advantages for the country that jumps in first. (the initial meteoric rise in the price of bitcoin that they would be holding at the time is just one tantalizing prospect)for a country to become a hub for bitcoin would also be a huge win for bitcoin if not just for the initial rise in value there is also the perceived legitimacy that comes with an entire country getting behind it. and once bitcoin has a country and  their banks heavily invested in it the exchange of bitcoins for fiat will be much easier, there would be a host of new exchanges popping up out of cyprus without the banking limits the current exchanges are plagued with. cyprus also has the first university to accept bitcoin for fee payments and to offer a course in cryptocurrency. recently the worlds first bitcoin bank was opened in cyprus. this will help foster widespread adoption in a country where people are a little more openminded when it comes to bitcoin. http://www.coindesk.com/bank-like-bitcoin-portal-neo-opens-first-branch-cyprus/http://www.neo-bee.com/en/the central bank of cyprus has been more favorable to bitcoin lately.http://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-legal-says-central-bank-cyprus/

http://www.coindesk.com/unilateral-statement-regarding-mt-gox-insider/not often you get to see a ceo speak so freely. the guy is clearly passionate about bitcoin hopefully his exchange can overcome their latest us banking woes.i can’t help but be angry, and frustrated and depressed. all the hard work we’ve done to bring bitcoin in to the mainstream and now this, and the people. fuck.look, i was supposed to write some lawyer-approved pr statement about how kraken kicks ass and is super secure and compliant, and payward is leading the charge at data, and all the great things we’re doing right.

quote from: stingray on february 28, 2014, 12:09:41 am heres my theory based on that evidence. i think sr was indeed hacked and some funds were stolen. i think defcunt saw the coins vanishing and shutdown bitcoind. after this i think he realized his database was a total mess and he could not fix it so he decided to steal all the coins and blamed the hacker for everything. if you havent noticed peoples balances are fucked up and there are people who have no pending balance.thats a very good theory.. we were thinking the same thing, but we wanted to post all our physical evidence first. but that is a good point, because a lot of users (including me) have had their entire wallet stolen- after having nothing in escrow.. so it is very possible that defon or someone else behind the scene (dpr/ stexo?) realised what was going on with the hack, knew that their coding was totally fucked- since they cloned it from mt.gox- and just decided to take the rest for themselves.there is a very strong possibility that that occured, and our investigation will likely head in that direction later.. but for now, we want to try and stay impartial (as hard as that is) by just providing the physical evidence we have obtained so far.. so people can decide for themselves.but that seems a pretty good conclusion to me.xsposer.
i have pending balance and pendin escrow...both orders from before the shutdown, neither marked shipped before...one marked shipped after...the one marked shipped hasnt auto-finalized and the one with the cancel option hasnt been automatically cancelled so for now im sticking to the old escrow system until the goods arrive (and the vendor isnt receiving funds even in pending when people finalize so i want to be sure they have that worked out before i do)otherwise, my balance is now zero, just the pending balance and pending escrow balance

important: silk road has removed escrow. customer support is non existent.due to recent events, silk road has removed the security of escrow from its market. orders are now set to auto-finalize, leaving buyers at the mercy of vendors. to make matters worse; there is currently no customer support from site staff, as staff continue to direct full attention to the market itself. disputes can still be opened but responses are so far, not forthcoming.what does this mean? this means that buyers are completely in the hands of vendors. vendors are free to claim packages have been dispatched, and without staff intervention there can be no way of settling the dispute. its advisable to avoid the market in the current state but if you must use silk road - please only deal with vendors you recognise, or that can be researched thoroughly.
delete this if it seems pointless but growing numbers of users, especially new users are ignorant to the state of silk road at the moment and only become aware once theyve placed an order. if this stops one user being scammed then its worked.
go to a place like localbitcoins.com.  they put coins in escrow until deal is finished.  i just did a wu deal with a dude in china and got my coins in minutes.  you can see there feedback and everything.
that update was very interesting. the person who wrote that message knows what they are talking about. what is really interesting is the author believes the "hacker" wouldnt have gotten away with much. this suggests it was an inside job. his assessment of gox itself is very interesting. it sounds like goxs accounting was terrible because they couldnt handle bitcoin transactions correctly. if this is correct this certainly explains why gox is stalling (there database is a mess). if the blockchain transactions are similar to a linked list adt then they are going to have one hell of mess to clean up.  heres my theory based on that evidence. i think sr was indeed hacked and some funds were stolen. i think defcunt saw the coins vanishing and shutdown bitcoind. after this i think he realized his database was a total mess and he could not fix it so he decided to steal all the coins and blamed the hacker for everything. if you havent noticed peoples balances are fucked up and there are people who have no pending balance.

hi guys. just joined here. i tried posting this on sr forum but ended up with -6 karma in a couple hours. hopefully people will be more receptive/constructive here. (love sr but some customers suck dick!)i suggest using expresscoin or cashforcoin. they offer several methods for acquiring coins, one of which is sending a usps money order. to buy a money order does not require id and costs less than like $2 for every money order up to $1000. this means you can purchase several thousand dollars worth of money orders at different post offices in a very short period and keep returning to them. benefits of using money orders are that banks do not see large transactions. you can take your money from selling and turn it right into bitcoins. no intermediary of a bank is involved. also your name is not on the money order.now these sites do require you to send a picture of an id with the money order. this does not seem like the largest deal though. most resourceful people should be able to come up with valid id from several different people (not themself!). i mean jesus just pay some junkies $10 a piece for pictures of their id and in an hour you will have 20 ids. just take a picture, print that shit, and mail it off with your money order. you also need to email them a copy of pictures of id and money order. wipe exif data and you are bueno. they will keep this id on file as they are a money transfer service, but le will never get that far.why you ask? because you arent a dumbass and you mixed your coins, of course!fallbacks are necessary though. i suggest tumbling or mixing or whatever twice before depositing it into any market wallet. this redundancy will cost only a very small percentage and by the time you are done it is possible to get money into your marketplace wallet for only 5-10% more than market value in huuuuge quantities.here is how this all looks : expresscoin>wallet a>mixing>wallet b> mixing> marketplacebad scenario: they track coins to wallet b. worse scenario: they track coins to wallet a. if they track back to wallet a it is entirely your fault. but say this happens. now le sees it comes from expresscoin and subpoenas them. finds a record with an id that isnt you, but they will follow up on that person. what does this mean? well for le it means a lot of work. they now need to prove ownership of each wallet by the person whose id it is. apocalypse scenario: they are able to prove ownership of each wallet by the same person. i dont know how this apocalypse scenario would happen but i am not the most technologically savvy person either. if this happens the person whose id it is could get a visit from police but most likely not. say at this point the person drops your name. it certainly seems short of grounds for a warrant so i think they would probably do a knock and talk (police stop by without warrant to try to get you to say something that is grounds for a warrant). so police show up at your door. "hey muttley we have you linked to illegal purchases online. we need to talk to you about this downtown". "sorry officer i wouldnt know anything about that. sounds like some crazy shit though. hope you officers have a good day. bye bye now!". and that is where it ends. the only downside is if your person with the id is compromised you can never again use your own address to receive anything and will need to use someone to catch packages for you from then on.it is impossible to get to the level of police ever showing up if you mix coins properly. there are a sufficient number of failsafes though for me to use this method with regularity and in large amounts. certain steps do need to be taken though to prevent expresscoin or similar services from getting suspicious though:1)do not order from multiple ids and send them all at the same time from the same location. stagger by a few days if possible.2)make sure the ids are not all from the same location if you live in a small town. 10 orders for two thousand bucks a piece within a week from the middle of kansas will raise eyebrows.3)vary amounts slightly. you can do up to 2.5k at a time i think so this isnt a huge deal.any input or suggestions
i would expect this post to have advice on buying your coins in an anonymous fashion. that is, in order for leo to convict you they need all the pieces of the following puzzle: (1) person x purchased btc with y method, (2) same person x then transfered said purchased btc and transferred it for illegal purposes, (3) person x was taken into custody with evidence of the illegal activities. steps 2 and 3 are the ones most thought about and are dealt with by coin washing and pgp encryption of address, among other things ensuring safe delivery. i think this post should emphasize point 1 and the options for buying btc on here are mostly ones that can trace the purchase directly back to an individual (i.e., to a credit card or bank account). i endorse finding ways to purchase the btc using cash transfer in the most anonymous fashion possible. for instance, i have seen listings on localbitcoin.com for cash in the mail transfers; however one must have a high level of trust in said vendor for this to be a viable option. another localbitcoin trick is the "other online payment optioin" where you purchase something like a greendot card in cash at a grocery store or convenience store and then upload images of said card and reciept showing it was purchased in cash. if you choose this option it is vital that you know the metadata of the images you will be sending do not send images taken on a cell phone, be sure there is no accurate time or location data retrievable from the image. this can be accomplished through a function in tails or you could upload the images to imgur and then use those images for the transfer. since most vendors who work this way request an image of the receipt as well, i highly suggest using a pen or marker to remove all location/time identification from the receirpt (e.g., fold it to hide the label of the store you purchased it from, write over the letters and numbers that could be used as identifiable information). finally, when you purchase the cash to coin intermediary (e.g., vanilla reload card) i suggest you wear heavy clothing such that no images of your face can be taken while you purchase the card (i.e., hoddie and sun glasses and something to cover your chin, gloves dont hurt either). i also suggest you purchase cards from more than one location as this makes it more difficult to isolate where the purchases are taking place. remember, always act as if you are already compromised by leo. as an extra step of precautions, i would suggest parking your car a little ways aways from the purchase location so that no cameras could get a picture of you entering your car and getting your license plate number. the only better way to buy coin is to buy it in cash from a friend of yours with a decent stock pile, then there are no traces whatsoever. this way if leo ever does hit you with scenario (3), being caught with evidence of illegal activity, they will not be able to add on extra charges that would be possible if they can trace the purchase all the way back to the purchase of the btc. washing your coins is important, do it early and do it alot, but there is another step before washing the coins that can be just as important as washing the coins and that is anonymous purchase of the coins. please, anyone give feedback on this post to identify ways to improve the anonymity of purchasing coins anonymously. also, if you have some spare coin, donate it to alfred. this site is awesome and i want it to stick around just as much as erowid.org

heres an awesome corker from g0dfather:quotetheres an old saying that goes:"fall down 7 times stand up 8."source: http://silkroad5v7dywlc.onion/index.php?topic=28966.msg549473#msg549473seriously? you are quite happy to take 7 hits from sr and still shout how great they are? hahahaha and to make things better the thread had the word love in the title.moar love!!!now gimme that 0.1 you whore!
there are two types of people on the darknet. sr fanboys and those that heavily dislike sr fanboys. this is a thread for the people of the latter group who enjoy reading some of the stupidity that is shat onto the sr forums on a daily basis. post any good comments you find and think deserve a requote here. this is a laugh nothing more so leave your "somebody think of the children" idiocy out. to get the thread going i will be awarding 0.1 bitcoin to the person who posts the best fanboy quote. just copy and paste the quote as well as the link to the page so i can verify.to prove this is not a fake giveaway the bitcoin can only go to a member who was registered here before feb 28th (and is not me). have your entry in by march 3rd 10pm utc, winner will be announced midday the next day at which time you give me a btc address. if you have a good quote but are not eligible as you are too new post anyway and i might sling you some bitcoin anyway.alfie i will donate 0.3btc to the hub if you agree publicly to make this thread a sticky until at least sr finally dies
i voted no. i have a buyer account.on my account it says balance 0 but under pending it has what my balance was (like 0.0001). so im assuming that is what im owed but i havent received it yet.
i have some empathy but please do not forget the fact you are a reporter.id not have exposed your common information - poor protocol is immature just my opinion
our experience was the few initial orders there were fine - we then required support on a transaction and it was a 2 or 3 day reply from support and our issue was not resolved. we agreed to a 2/3 percent refund to the buyer and dl kept the bitcoins - buyer was out 240.00usd because of this action. we lost a small portion too.we will not vend on dls market anymore as they have flaws in little or no support and deceitful practices.c8 edit update: received and emailing stating every was resolved - it was not funds were never released

quote from: cicada on february 25, 2014, 10:33:38 pmplease elaborate on the hypervisor use case if possible, references to detailed example documentation most appreciated.is it safe to assume the torvm is comprised of a barebones installation with iptables dropping everything but tor traffic?i dont know of an off-the-shelf, play-by-play set of documentation for virtual isolation of hidden services.     the simplest method is probably using whonix gateway and a servicevm (either on whonix workstation or a bare install of linux/*bsd) behind it, all running under virtualbox.   probably the best method would involve configuring xen (using paravirtualization, not hvm, so theres less attack surface at the hypervisor) to provide a bridge interface from the ethernet adapter to the outside virtual interface of thetorvm, then using a separate virtual interface between the inside of the torvm and the servicevm.yes, the middlebox torvm should pretty much just have a tor instance and properly configured iptables/pf/etc firewall ruleset.   the tor instance will host the onion service.   the overall picture looks like this:enduser->(6 x tor hops to hidden service)->tor instance on torvm->servervmlogically, the only traffic the servervm should be seeing from the torvm is inbound http requests (assuming web server is what were talking about).therefore the only legitimate traffic that the firewall rule on the inside interface of the torvm should have to allow in that interface are *responses* to http requests.  you could track state on traffic leaving the torvm for the servervm and only allow established connections to come back in.    if you lock it down this far, literally nothing with a syn bit should be allowed out from the servervm.     once you think its good, you should at least use nmap or something similar to make sure you cant get traffic out past the torvm.youll have to have a way to manage the servervm, so you will need to allow appropriate management traffic to it..   if your management happens over tor, id recommend at least considering the use of client authorization for hidden management services.   in that scenario, your tor client needs a hidservauth entry to get to the management onion address, and the torvm will need to host a separate management onion address/service, with access controlled via the hiddenserviceauthorizeclient directive.if i was going to build one on xen, id go disassemble qubes os and steal as much as possible.    they already solve most of these problems, theyre just doing it from a client perspective instead of a server one.

hi guys. just joined here. i tried posting this on sr forum but ended up with -6 karma in a couple hours. hopefully people will be more receptive/constructive here. (love sr but some customers suck dick!)i suggest using expresscoin or cashforcoin. they offer several methods for acquiring coins, one of which is sending a usps money order. to buy a money order does not require id and costs less than like $2 for every money order up to $1000. this means you can purchase several thousand dollars worth of money orders at different post offices in a very short period and keep returning to them. benefits of using money orders are that banks do not see large transactions. you can take your money from selling and turn it right into bitcoins. no intermediary of a bank is involved. also your name is not on the money order.now these sites do require you to send a picture of an id with the money order. this does not seem like the largest deal though. most resourceful people should be able to come up with valid id from several different people (not themself!). i mean jesus just pay some junkies $10 a piece for pictures of their id and in an hour you will have 20 ids. just take a picture, print that shit, and mail it off with your money order. you also need to email them a copy of pictures of id and money order. wipe exif data and you are bueno. they will keep this id on file as they are a money transfer service, but le will never get that far.why you ask? because you arent a dumbass and you mixed your coins, of course!fallbacks are necessary though. i suggest tumbling or mixing or whatever twice before depositing it into any market wallet. this redundancy will cost only a very small percentage and by the time you are done it is possible to get money into your marketplace wallet for only 5-10% more than market value in huuuuge quantities.here is how this all looks : expresscoin>wallet a>mixing>wallet b> mixing> marketplacebad scenario: they track coins to wallet b. worse scenario: they track coins to wallet a. if they track back to wallet a it is entirely your fault. but say this happens. now le sees it comes from expresscoin and subpoenas them. finds a record with an id that isnt you, but they will follow up on that person. what does this mean? well for le it means a lot of work. they now need to prove ownership of each wallet by the person whose id it is. apocalypse scenario: they are able to prove ownership of each wallet by the same person. i dont know how this apocalypse scenario would happen but i am not the most technologically savvy person either. if this happens the person whose id it is could get a visit from police but most likely not. say at this point the person drops your name. it certainly seems short of grounds for a warrant so i think they would probably do a knock and talk (police stop by without warrant to try to get you to say something that is grounds for a warrant). so police show up at your door. "hey muttley we have you linked to illegal purchases online. we need to talk to you about this downtown". "sorry officer i wouldnt know anything about that. sounds like some crazy shit though. hope you officers have a good day. bye bye now!". and that is where it ends. the only downside is if your person with the id is compromised you can never again use your own address to receive anything and will need to use someone to catch packages for you from then on.it is impossible to get to the level of police ever showing up if you mix coins properly. there are a sufficient number of failsafes though for me to use this method with regularity and in large amounts. certain steps do need to be taken though to prevent expresscoin or similar services from getting suspicious though:1)do not order from multiple ids and send them all at the same time from the same location. stagger by a few days if possible.2)make sure the ids are not all from the same location if you live in a small town. 10 orders for two thousand bucks a piece within a week from the middle of kansas will raise eyebrows.3)vary amounts slightly. you can do up to 2.5k at a time i think so this isnt a huge deal.any input or suggestions
i would expect this post to have advice on buying your coins in an anonymous fashion. that is, in order for leo to convict you they need all the pieces of the following puzzle: (1) person x purchased btc with y method, (2) same person x then transfered said purchased btc and transferred it for illegal purposes, (3) person x was taken into custody with evidence of the illegal activities. steps 2 and 3 are the ones most thought about and are dealt with by coin washing and pgp encryption of address, among other things ensuring safe delivery. i think this post should emphasize point 1 and the options for buying btc on here are mostly ones that can trace the purchase directly back to an individual (i.e., to a credit card or bank account). i endorse finding ways to purchase the btc using cash transfer in the most anonymous fashion possible. for instance, i have seen listings on localbitcoin.com for cash in the mail transfers; however one must have a high level of trust in said vendor for this to be a viable option. another localbitcoin trick is the "other online payment optioin" where you purchase something like a greendot card in cash at a grocery store or convenience store and then upload images of said card and reciept showing it was purchased in cash. if you choose this option it is vital that you know the metadata of the images you will be sending do not send images taken on a cell phone, be sure there is no accurate time or location data retrievable from the image. this can be accomplished through a function in tails or you could upload the images to imgur and then use those images for the transfer. since most vendors who work this way request an image of the receipt as well, i highly suggest using a pen or marker to remove all location/time identification from the receirpt (e.g., fold it to hide the label of the store you purchased it from, write over the letters and numbers that could be used as identifiable information). finally, when you purchase the cash to coin intermediary (e.g., vanilla reload card) i suggest you wear heavy clothing such that no images of your face can be taken while you purchase the card (i.e., hoddie and sun glasses and something to cover your chin, gloves dont hurt either). i also suggest you purchase cards from more than one location as this makes it more difficult to isolate where the purchases are taking place. remember, always act as if you are already compromised by leo. as an extra step of precautions, i would suggest parking your car a little ways aways from the purchase location so that no cameras could get a picture of you entering your car and getting your license plate number. the only better way to buy coin is to buy it in cash from a friend of yours with a decent stock pile, then there are no traces whatsoever. this way if leo ever does hit you with scenario (3), being caught with evidence of illegal activity, they will not be able to add on extra charges that would be possible if they can trace the purchase all the way back to the purchase of the btc. washing your coins is important, do it early and do it alot, but there is another step before washing the coins that can be just as important as washing the coins and that is anonymous purchase of the coins. please, anyone give feedback on this post to identify ways to improve the anonymity of purchasing coins anonymously. also, if you have some spare coin, donate it to alfred. this site is awesome and i want it to stick around just as much as erowid.org

heres an awesome corker from g0dfather:quotetheres an old saying that goes:"fall down 7 times stand up 8."source: http://silkroad5v7dywlc.onion/index.php?topic=28966.msg549473#msg549473seriously? you are quite happy to take 7 hits from sr and still shout how great they are? hahahaha and to make things better the thread had the word love in the title.moar love!!!now gimme that 0.1 you whore!
there are two types of people on the darknet. sr fanboys and those that heavily dislike sr fanboys. this is a thread for the people of the latter group who enjoy reading some of the stupidity that is shat onto the sr forums on a daily basis. post any good comments you find and think deserve a requote here. this is a laugh nothing more so leave your "somebody think of the children" idiocy out. to get the thread going i will be awarding 0.1 bitcoin to the person who posts the best fanboy quote. just copy and paste the quote as well as the link to the page so i can verify.to prove this is not a fake giveaway the bitcoin can only go to a member who was registered here before feb 28th (and is not me). have your entry in by march 3rd 10pm utc, winner will be announced midday the next day at which time you give me a btc address. if you have a good quote but are not eligible as you are too new post anyway and i might sling you some bitcoin anyway.alfie i will donate 0.3btc to the hub if you agree publicly to make this thread a sticky until at least sr finally dies
i voted no. i have a buyer account.on my account it says balance 0 but under pending it has what my balance was (like 0.0001). so im assuming that is what im owed but i havent received it yet.
i have some empathy but please do not forget the fact you are a reporter.id not have exposed your common information - poor protocol is immature just my opinion
our experience was the few initial orders there were fine - we then required support on a transaction and it was a 2 or 3 day reply from support and our issue was not resolved. we agreed to a 2/3 percent refund to the buyer and dl kept the bitcoins - buyer was out 240.00usd because of this action. we lost a small portion too.we will not vend on dls market anymore as they have flaws in little or no support and deceitful practices.c8 edit update: received and emailing stating every was resolved - it was not funds were never released

i really do not have a definitive answer for you because nobody agrees on this. i am the kind of person who is a needle in a haystack type that likes to blend in with the crowd. mirage likes his/her obfuscated bridges. axa likes his/her vpn -> tor. you will never get everyone to come together on this never ending debate. find one that you feel best about. sorry for the lack of an answer
quote from: cicada on february 25, 2014, 10:33:38 pmplease elaborate on the hypervisor use case if possible, references to detailed example documentation most appreciated.is it safe to assume the torvm is comprised of a barebones installation with iptables dropping everything but tor traffic?i dont know of an off-the-shelf, play-by-play set of documentation for virtual isolation of hidden services.     the simplest method is probably using whonix gateway and a servicevm (either on whonix workstation or a bare install of linux/*bsd) behind it, all running under virtualbox.   probably the best method would involve configuring xen (using paravirtualization, not hvm, so theres less attack surface at the hypervisor) to provide a bridge interface from the ethernet adapter to the outside virtual interface of thetorvm, then using a separate virtual interface between the inside of the torvm and the servicevm.yes, the middlebox torvm should pretty much just have a tor instance and properly configured iptables/pf/etc firewall ruleset.   the tor instance will host the onion service.   the overall picture looks like this:enduser->(6 x tor hops to hidden service)->tor instance on torvm->servervmlogically, the only traffic the servervm should be seeing from the torvm is inbound http requests (assuming web server is what were talking about).therefore the only legitimate traffic that the firewall rule on the inside interface of the torvm should have to allow in that interface are *responses* to http requests.  you could track state on traffic leaving the torvm for the servervm and only allow established connections to come back in.    if you lock it down this far, literally nothing with a syn bit should be allowed out from the servervm.     once you think its good, you should at least use nmap or something similar to make sure you cant get traffic out past the torvm.youll have to have a way to manage the servervm, so you will need to allow appropriate management traffic to it..   if your management happens over tor, id recommend at least considering the use of client authorization for hidden management services.   in that scenario, your tor client needs a hidservauth entry to get to the management onion address, and the torvm will need to host a separate management onion address/service, with access controlled via the hiddenserviceauthorizeclient directive.if i was going to build one on xen, id go disassemble qubes os and steal as much as possible.    they already solve most of these problems, theyre just doing it from a client perspective instead of a server one.

didnt snowden say all pgp software was backdoored by the nsa?i saw on the news that criminals and terrorists use mmorpg games to communicate and carry out illegal transactions with the in-game money. they said there are fbi agents whos sole job is to play these games all day in search of said criminals.interesting shit.can one of you tech experts check out chatcrypt.com for me? they claim not even the site owner cant read your messeges.

quote from: blackstar on february 24, 2014, 09:55:22 am^^^ yea partial escrow is an excellent option to give vedors the piece of mind that they wont lose their ass if an escrow hack happens. bsm has gretly impressed me over the last few months. and juelz if you are running that ship, blackstallion thanks you.oh!  is that what partial escrow is for?  i finalized an order recently and was bewildered by this novel option.  so its not for me as a buyer after receiving product to release some of the funds and (possiby) dispute the rest?  its so that right after placing an order i can release some of the funds to the vendor, with intent to release the remainder on delivery.   thats cool as shit, i love this.is there a bluesky guide anywhere?cheers all

i have made several buys and money went in very fast. *shrugthere is a the refresh buttons which makes the money show up.
calling me law enforcement is a compliment. id love to be a law enforcement officer. unfortunately i have no job history and i doubt they would believe me when i say ive been "self employed" since age 18. in addition, i dont have the demeanour of a police officer. and the most important reason, is i cant think of a good excuse to tell them why i want to be a cop. the truth is i want to be a cop because it deals with the intricacies of crime without actually being illegal. if youre a motivated and engaged criminal fascinated by crime, what job is better then le? jules winnfield if you are an fbi agent (probably are since you are confirmed scammer) i will perform fellatio on you in order to be hiredregards

permanoid op here. obviously there seems to be trolls/fbi/misinformators here. hello!could you prove that privnote has been compromised?could you prove that pgp has fbi backdoors?at the moment, it seems to me at least that secret chats in telegram seems acceptable, but i have the feeling that the android/ios software/hardware can be compromised itself doing that last option insecure. thoughts?
nope
the bitcoins are held in escrow and not available for withdrawal. we considered it an inexpensive lesson to learn again after sr1 and the sheep show.we even have a fe only policy and they still grabbed the btcs, i asked them to release to them then to the buyer and did not receive a no response.
quote from: ed from sl on march 01, 2014, 08:53:29 amxsposer,very weird vibes on the sr2 forums tonight--almost all of the posts & replies are pro-sr ... and they are coming from a handful of nyms. no familiar faces.and then there is the murmur in the community--again, bad vibes--regarding captainwhitebeard and hiniguel. reports of scamming, being absent ... worshipped by some, reviled by others.some are now of the opinion that it is just one man behind limitless/stexo/hiniguel/dpr2/defcon/hux/etc.and it is beginning to make sense. watching the latest theatrics regarding hiniguel, its hard not to see a setup for the next big thing. nobody is buying defcons bullshit anymore, so hiniguel steps up and saves the day. he refunds a bunch of money to people (or pretends to, using more nyms), all the while denouncing defcon/sr. he says hes leaving, but hints that the market might be re-born elsewhere/in the future. people nominating him as the next leader....im comparing nyms/posts ... and while i have just begun, it looks like hiniguel = bluegiraffe = mdmazing.and hes talking to himself.consider the following quotes and study them carefully. pay attention to the sentence/paragraph structure, punctuation, etc. one thing jumps out at me--his use of the em dash and semicolon ... but he represents an em dash (--) thusly - (single hyphen with a space on either side). not many people employ these marks of punctuation in their writing or they misuse them; furthermore, there is a common use of the term "mate" used by many of these nyms, as well as a failure to capitalize the letter i (i). then there is the overall content, topics, threads--many sound like they are coming from someone on the sr staff. take gemma, for instance.perhaps compiling a list would be in order....compare just the following:dpr -- http://silkroad5v7dywlc.onion/index.php?action=profile;area=showposts;u=3770defcon -- http://silkroad5v7dywlc.onion/index.php?action=profile;area=showposts;u=1hiniguel -- http://silkroad5v7dywlc.onion/index.php?action=profile;area=showposts;u=1446especially in the admin roles (dpr/defcon), the similarity is obvious. the numerical lists, bold headlines, etc.and cwb? jabbatheslut?stealth? v? hes a goddamned one-man band!dozens of nyms, everywhere ... but maybe its all in my head, because i dont even see how it could be possible.yes, perhaps ive gone around the bend--and im not claiming that any of this is true--but i wanted to share my thoughts and see what you think.is it all really just a goddamned 419 scam?very, very interesting ed. i wish i could give you a +1, you definately deserve it.weve also noticed the similarities of certain major accounts on sr. and we even have screenshots of some posts which show an obvious correlation of writing styles between the main players of sr2.. but i wanted to restrain from adding my own speculations to this saga- as not to bias any of the impartial evidence we have posted above.that being said. i will comment on the hiniguel situation just to clear things up, as many people have been asking, on this forum and others, and i have been kind of skeptical to answer. but what i can say is this; as much as i respect hiniguel for his monetary help to the sr community, and to an extent his forum moderation- i will say that he provided no helpful information whatsoever regarding this whole sr2 investigation.he has obviously been helping the community in a lot of ways and defcon, stealth, clu have all agreed. not to mention other members i personally know have confirmed that hes helped them out.. but every reply we did receive (not many) was extremely vague and absent of fact- even when we presented evidence to him and simply asked for his input.we initially put this down to his busy schedule- because at that point he had already offered his "millions" to help out the community, so he was geting bombarded with emails & pms.but weeks after the fact, we have still received nothing of significance from him? which is weird because he got a personal thankyou from defcon and team for his investigative help? again, i respect hiniguel for his help to the sr community, but dispite our best efforts he has not contribted to this investigation.  where as bbmc, btva and to an extent, oracle went above and beyond their requirements and were more than professional in their cooperation.(oracle providing some very interesting speculation about account sharing- similar to what ed suspects above)the thought that this whole operation could be a 1 man show, while not that outragous (unless ive been up too late and have gone round the bend with you, lol) is not consistant with our findings.. it seems to be more likely a couple of very experienced, old-school players, acting together, operating as vendors/ mods/ admin & vocal forum members.we will try and clear up the whos who in all of this at some point, but whatever outcome we arrive at, will obviosly be speculation (based on evidence of course) but none the less speculation... but we can state that it is evident to us that, dpr2/ stexo & hux are 1 in the same. more to come later.xsposer.> also as ed pointed out, there are no more familliar faces on sr.. this is a clear sign that something isnt right. when all the original and experienced sr members clear out and leave nothing but tumbleweed and kiss ass noobs, its time to leave aswell.
sender email?
that is the most believable of all the options, im surprised that a bigger deal hasnt been made of it.
i have a small amount of pending balance which hasnt been returned but i wont register a vote here unless im able to change it in the event of receiving all or some of the money in future.

maybe you have detected a very few writers have experimented with the myriad possibilities of online self-expression in this case ? :-) im glad people are trying to figure out whats been going on here. i dont have the brain energy tonight to try to follow all the above hypothesizing though. i do hope we find the truth and appreciate your effort ed :-)
the wild ride continues, lol. still selling on sr. must be a "glass is 1% full" kinda optimist or something.
well ... weird things happen when a guy stays up too late--my detective work is evidence of that.
i have created two mailtor accounts. both accounts created with no problem, but i cannot log into either one, always getting a wrong password error. i notice that the login page also has a link to configure thunderbird. what is thunderbird? do i need it to use mailtor? is this why i cannot log in after creating my mail accounts?thanks in advance for any help.

quote from: ed from sl on march 01, 2014, 08:53:29 amxsposer,very weird vibes on the sr2 forums tonight--almost all of the posts & replies are pro-sr ... and they are coming from a handful of nyms. no familiar faces.and then there is the murmur in the community--again, bad vibes--regarding captainwhitebeard and hiniguel. reports of scamming, being absent ... worshipped by some, reviled by others.some are now of the opinion that it is just one man behind limitless/stexo/hiniguel/dpr2/defcon/hux/etc.and it is beginning to make sense. watching the latest theatrics regarding hiniguel, its hard not to see a setup for the next big thing. nobody is buying defcons bullshit anymore, so hiniguel steps up and saves the day. he refunds a bunch of money to people (or pretends to, using more nyms), all the while denouncing defcon/sr. he says hes leaving, but hints that the market might be re-born elsewhere/in the future. people nominating him as the next leader....im comparing nyms/posts ... and while i have just begun, it looks like hiniguel = bluegiraffe = mdmazing.and hes talking to himself.consider the following quotes and study them carefully. pay attention to the sentence/paragraph structure, punctuation, etc. one thing jumps out at me--his use of the em dash and semicolon ... but he represents an em dash (--) thusly - (single hyphen with a space on either side). not many people employ these marks of punctuation in their writing or they misuse them; furthermore, there is a common use of the term "mate" used by many of these nyms, as well as a failure to capitalize the letter i (i). then there is the overall content, topics, threads--many sound like they are coming from someone on the sr staff. take gemma, for instance.perhaps compiling a list would be in order....compare just the following:dpr -- http://silkroad5v7dywlc.onion/index.php?action=profile;area=showposts;u=3770defcon -- http://silkroad5v7dywlc.onion/index.php?action=profile;area=showposts;u=1hiniguel -- http://silkroad5v7dywlc.onion/index.php?action=profile;area=showposts;u=1446especially in the admin roles (dpr/defcon), the similarity is obvious. the numerical lists, bold headlines, etc.and cwb? jabbatheslut?stealth? v? hes a goddamned one-man band!dozens of nyms, everywhere ... but maybe its all in my head, because i dont even see how it could be possible.yes, perhaps ive gone around the bend--and im not claiming that any of this is true--but i wanted to share my thoughts and see what you think.is it all really just a goddamned 419 scam?very, very interesting ed. i wish i could give you a +1, you definately deserve it.weve also noticed the similarities of certain major accounts on sr. and we even have screenshots of some posts which show an obvious correlation of writing styles between the main players of sr2.. but i wanted to restrain from adding my own speculations to this saga- as not to bias any of the impartial evidence we have posted above.that being said. i will comment on the hiniguel situation just to clear things up, as many people have been asking, on this forum and others, and i have been kind of skeptical to answer. but what i can say is this; as much as i respect hiniguel for his monetary help to the sr community, and to an extent his forum moderation- i will say that he provided no helpful information whatsoever regarding this whole sr2 investigation.he has obviously been helping the community in a lot of ways and defcon, stealth, clu have all agreed. not to mention other members i personally know have confirmed that hes helped them out.. but every reply we did receive (not many) was extremely vague and absent of fact- even when we presented evidence to him and simply asked for his input.we initially put this down to his busy schedule- because at that point he had already offered his "millions" to help out the community, so he was geting bombarded with emails & pms.but weeks after the fact, we have still received nothing of significance from him? which is weird because he got a personal thankyou from defcon and team for his investigative help? again, i respect hiniguel for his help to the sr community, but dispite our best efforts he has not contribted to this investigation.  where as bbmc, btva and to an extent, oracle went above and beyond their requirements and were more than professional in their cooperation.(oracle providing some very interesting speculation about account sharing- similar to what ed suspects above)the thought that this whole operation could be a 1 man show, while not that outragous (unless ive been up too late and have gone round the bend with you, lol) is not consistant with our findings.. it seems to be more likely a couple of very experienced, old-school players, acting together, operating as vendors/ mods/ admin & vocal forum members.we will try and clear up the whos who in all of this at some point, but whatever outcome we arrive at, will obviosly be speculation (based on evidence of course) but none the less speculation... but we can state that it is evident to us that, dpr2/ stexo & hux are 1 in the same. more to come later.xsposer.> also as ed pointed out, there are no more familliar faces on sr.. this is a clear sign that something isnt right. when all the original and experienced sr members clear out and leave nothing but tumbleweed and kiss ass noobs, its time to leave aswell.
quote from: blackstar on february 24, 2014, 09:55:22 am^^^ yea partial escrow is an excellent option to give vedors the piece of mind that they wont lose their ass if an escrow hack happens. bsm has gretly impressed me over the last few months. and juelz if you are running that ship, blackstallion thanks you.oh!  is that what partial escrow is for?  i finalized an order recently and was bewildered by this novel option.  so its not for me as a buyer after receiving product to release some of the funds and (possiby) dispute the rest?  its so that right after placing an order i can release some of the funds to the vendor, with intent to release the remainder on delivery.   thats cool as shit, i love this.is there a bluesky guide anywhere?cheers all

privnote had been comprimised two years ago, this is old news.pgp is the only way to properly encrypt a message between two computers.  dont register your pgp key to the dir. obvious.dont let le get your hardware duh.

calling me law enforcement is a compliment. id love to be a law enforcement officer. unfortunately i have no job history and i doubt they would believe me when i say ive been "self employed" since age 18. in addition, i dont have the demeanour of a police officer. and the most important reason, is i cant think of a good excuse to tell them why i want to be a cop. the truth is i want to be a cop because it deals with the intricacies of crime without actually being illegal. if youre a motivated and engaged criminal fascinated by crime, what job is better then le? jules winnfield if you are an fbi agent (probably are since you are confirmed scammer) i will perform fellatio on you in order to be hiredregards
permanoid op here. obviously there seems to be trolls/fbi/misinformators here. hello!could you prove that privnote has been compromised?could you prove that pgp has fbi backdoors?at the moment, it seems to me at least that secret chats in telegram seems acceptable, but i have the feeling that the android/ios software/hardware can be compromised itself doing that last option insecure. thoughts?

further investigation has revealed that this is in fact the hackers wallet, (likely the former sr dev "pritel")i know that <redacted> has the money, he did the heist on sr, he made mt.gox loose 64 million usd you want to know how he did this? read the following, it fits:well you mentioned oracle, whats with his post where he stated that he has found out who did it and how he was able to do so?"mods please do not delete this, i don’t give a fuck about anti-doxxing policies and i’ve worked very hard, paid out of my pocket and have open myself to exposure to put this thieving fuck on blasteveryone else: quote and take a screen shot immediately incase this gets taken down“censored” – real name: censored (czech republic)hey censored, hows it feel reading this? panicky? i won’t ask you or enter a dialogue censored, but i’m going to insist you contact defcon or one of the moderators and arrange to pay back the money. or ask them for an address and if by magic the funds show up, you’ll probably live out the rest of your life relatively healthy. if not.. there’s people who’s money you’ve taken who will probably make you wish you were in hell. understood censored? fuck you and your ratfuck thievery.i’m going to keep this short. stexo had given laundering advice to some czechs during sr1, who were also shopping around code they “claimed” to have breached or obtained from gox and btc-e. don’t know if they’re legitimate devs or just malicious fucks, and it’s irrelevant at this point. sr2?s initial back end and engine was coded by one of these guys on contract, “censored”. libby had thought it would be useful to farm out some of the initial development of sr2 to one of the czech devs and asked fucking stexo to make an introduction. lib introduced censored to defcon in october, and he did whatever initial development he was paid for. before the site went live his contract was up and defcon and party took control of the admin stuff. most likely this is the reason for the initial spotty site access in the initial days – def just didn’t understand a lot of the code and kept fucking around with it.a very reliable source has confirmed to me unequivocally that censored (censored) has been bragging that he hit bitstamp, sr, and gox with ddos, flooded them with mutated transactions, and even made a fortune. tl;dr – czech former contractor used the transaction malleability media hoopla (which can not be used to steal coins) as a cloak to break in and steal. his initial development work probably worked as an advantage, or he kept a clone of the security methods, i don’t know – but censored is now thousands of btc richer then he was a week ago.libertas should not have recommended this piece of shit solely because they were previous clients of stexo’s. and stexo is not an authority on developers or computer security just because he once advised him and his merry band of czech bottom feeders on how to launder their btc.all of this initial incompetence brings us to a hack/heist of millions of dollars. un fucking believable, and un fucking acceptable.i’ve tried my best to present as much facts as i could obtain, and believe me i have spent my own time, energy and funds getting this information and putting the pieces together. if this post is deleted, i will repost it from different accounts every hour of every day ad nauseum.censored.. how do you feel buddy? didn’t expect this huh?anybody in prague or around this area.. i can’t advise you on what to do, but..use your imagination.oracle"they said that only the admins have access to the escrow wallet, so only they couldve done it. but their behaviour after that theft doesnt fit to a scammers one. they wouldve vanished, sr would be abandoned and they wouldve taken all funds from every wallet connected to sr. and a payback plan is the last thing a thief does. but if they didnt fit as suspects who does? and how did he get access to the sr system?they needed an coder for security features and hired this czech, someone who has atleast a slightly criminal mind otherwise wouldnt he coding anything for a drug marketplace. he coded what he was asked for, he certainly has the source code from part of srs security features, he couldve coded a backdoor or atleast some attackable code.with the source code, knowledge about possible weak spots of the sr security system and the "mutant transaction" method was he able to get access to the funds of the escrow wallet.he used the "mutant transaction" bug in the bitcoin protocol to attack mt.gox. he choosed the by far biggest and less used wallet on mt.gox, the "coldest wallet". this bug inside the bitcoin protocol made it possible to double spend bitcoins. you cant of course doubel spend something that exists just once, mt.gox raised a shortage of 64 million usd over time.he was able to create high damage to mt.gox but he was not able to steal from them.i cant verify oracles statements but they do link all those similar attacks, he even explained where the money went, how he did it etc. aslong as there is no better explanation i go with this. the czech did it.

defcon1 stole the money and sold sr2 to defcon2defcon2 is a woman, she is not a programmer.programmer1 has been stealing from sr2 since it opened with missing coin and negative balance tricks.defcon2 fired programmer1 & locked him out of sight when she discovered the thefts.defcon1 was pissed his programmer was fired so he hasnt given defcon2 the keys [a416f556] as promised.defcon2 created a new key [71dd616a] but hasnt used it in public.defcon2 is trying to find programmers she can trust to close the backdoors programmer1 put on the sight.programmer1 is trying to get rehired under new id so he can steal morethere are no programmers working on the sight now.dej kovo

didnt snowden say all pgp software was backdoored by the nsa?i saw on the news that criminals and terrorists use mmorpg games to communicate and carry out illegal transactions with the in-game money. they said there are fbi agents whos sole job is to play these games all day in search of said criminals.interesting shit.can one of you tech experts check out chatcrypt.com for me? they claim not even the site owner cant read your messeges.
i thought he said it. my bad. but some reputable(?) scource claimed all pgp software was backdoored by the nsa.i know snowden said the nsa is having great difficulty cracking tor.

maybe you have detected a very few writers have experimented with the myriad possibilities of online self-expression in this case ? :-) im glad people are trying to figure out whats been going on here. i dont have the brain energy tonight to try to follow all the above hypothesizing though. i do hope we find the truth and appreciate your effort ed :-)

the bitcoins are held in escrow and not available for withdrawal. we considered it an inexpensive lesson to learn again after sr1 and the sheep show.we even have a fe only policy and they still grabbed the btcs, i asked them to release to them then to the buyer and did not receive a no response.

and how did he get access to the sr system?they needed an coder for security features and hired this czech, someone who has atleast a slightly criminal mind otherwise wouldnt he coding anything for a drug marketplace. he coded what he was asked for, he certainly has the source code from part of srs security features, he couldve coded a backdoor or atleast some attackable code.with the source code, knowledge about possible weak spots of the sr security system and the "mutant transaction" method was he able to get access to the funds of the escrow wallet.he used the "mutant transaction" bug in the bitcoin protocol to attack mt.gox. he choosed the by far biggest and less used wallet on mt.gox, the "coldest wallet". this bug inside the bitcoin protocol made it possible to double spend bitcoins. you cant of course doubel spend something that exists just once, mt.gox raised a shortage of 64 million usd over time.he was able to create high damage to mt.gox but he was not able to steal from them.i cant verify oracles statements but they do link all those similar attacks, he even explained where the money went, how he did it etc. aslong as there is no better explanation i go with this. the czech did it.

maybe you have detected a very few writers have experimented with the myriad possibilities of online self-expression in this case ? :-) im glad people are trying to figure out whats been going on here. i dont have the brain energy tonight to try to follow all the above hypothesizing though. i do hope we find the truth and appreciate your effort ed :-)
the wild ride continues, lol. still selling on sr. must be a "glass is 1% full" kinda optimist or something.

the bitcoins are held in escrow and not available for withdrawal. we considered it an inexpensive lesson to learn again after sr1 and the sheep show.we even have a fe only policy and they still grabbed the btcs, i asked them to release to them then to the buyer and did not receive a no response.

quote from: ed from sl on march 01, 2014, 08:53:29 amxsposer,very weird vibes on the sr2 forums tonight--almost all of the posts & replies are pro-sr ... and they are coming from a handful of nyms. no familiar faces.and then there is the murmur in the community--again, bad vibes--regarding captainwhitebeard and hiniguel. reports of scamming, being absent ... worshipped by some, reviled by others.some are now of the opinion that it is just one man behind limitless/stexo/hiniguel/dpr2/defcon/hux/etc.and it is beginning to make sense. watching the latest theatrics regarding hiniguel, its hard not to see a setup for the next big thing. nobody is buying defcons bullshit anymore, so hiniguel steps up and saves the day. he refunds a bunch of money to people (or pretends to, using more nyms), all the while denouncing defcon/sr. he says hes leaving, but hints that the market might be re-born elsewhere/in the future. people nominating him as the next leader....im comparing nyms/posts ... and while i have just begun, it looks like hiniguel = bluegiraffe = mdmazing.and hes talking to himself.consider the following quotes and study them carefully. pay attention to the sentence/paragraph structure, punctuation, etc. one thing jumps out at me--his use of the em dash and semicolon ... but he represents an em dash (--) thusly - (single hyphen with a space on either side). not many people employ these marks of punctuation in their writing or they misuse them; furthermore, there is a common use of the term "mate" used by many of these nyms, as well as a failure to capitalize the letter i (i). then there is the overall content, topics, threads--many sound like they are coming from someone on the sr staff. take gemma, for instance.perhaps compiling a list would be in order....compare just the following:dpr -- http://silkroad5v7dywlc.onion/index.php?action=profile;area=showposts;u=3770defcon -- http://silkroad5v7dywlc.onion/index.php?action=profile;area=showposts;u=1hiniguel -- http://silkroad5v7dywlc.onion/index.php?action=profile;area=showposts;u=1446especially in the admin roles (dpr/defcon), the similarity is obvious. the numerical lists, bold headlines, etc.and cwb? jabbatheslut?stealth? v? hes a goddamned one-man band!dozens of nyms, everywhere ... but maybe its all in my head, because i dont even see how it could be possible.yes, perhaps ive gone around the bend--and im not claiming that any of this is true--but i wanted to share my thoughts and see what you think.is it all really just a goddamned 419 scam?very, very interesting ed. i wish i could give you a +1, you definately deserve it.weve also noticed the similarities of certain major accounts on sr. and we even have screenshots of some posts which show an obvious correlation of writing styles between the main players of sr2.. but i wanted to restrain from adding my own speculations to this saga- as not to bias any of the impartial evidence we have posted above.that being said. i will comment on the hiniguel situation just to clear things up, as many people have been asking, on this forum and others, and i have been kind of skeptical to answer. but what i can say is this; as much as i respect hiniguel for his monetary help to the sr community, and to an extent his forum moderation- i will say that he provided no helpful information whatsoever regarding this whole sr2 investigation.he has obviously been helping the community in a lot of ways and defcon, stealth, clu have all agreed. not to mention other members i personally know have confirmed that hes helped them out.. but every reply we did receive (not many) was extremely vague and absent of fact- even when we presented evidence to him and simply asked for his input.we initially put this down to his busy schedule- because at that point he had already offered his "millions" to help out the community, so he was geting bombarded with emails & pms.but weeks after the fact, we have still received nothing of significance from him? which is weird because he got a personal thankyou from defcon and team for his investigative help? again, i respect hiniguel for his help to the sr community, but dispite our best efforts he has not contribted to this investigation.  where as bbmc, btva and to an extent, oracle went above and beyond their requirements and were more than professional in their cooperation.(oracle providing some very interesting speculation about account sharing- similar to what ed suspects above)the thought that this whole operation could be a 1 man show, while not that outragous (unless ive been up too late and have gone round the bend with you, lol) is not consistant with our findings.. it seems to be more likely a couple of very experienced, old-school players, acting together, operating as vendors/ mods/ admin & vocal forum members.we will try and clear up the whos who in all of this at some point, but whatever outcome we arrive at, will obviosly be speculation (based on evidence of course) but none the less speculation... but we can state that it is evident to us that, dpr2/ stexo & hux are 1 in the same. more to come later.xsposer.> also as ed pointed out, there are no more familliar faces on sr.. this is a clear sign that something isnt right. when all the original and experienced sr members clear out and leave nothing but tumbleweed and kiss ass noobs, its time to leave aswell.

defcon1 stole the money and sold sr2 to defcon2defcon2 is a woman, she is not a programmer.programmer1 has been stealing from sr2 since it opened with missing coin and negative balance tricks.defcon2 fired programmer1 & locked him out of sight when she discovered the thefts.defcon1 was pissed his programmer was fired so he hasnt given defcon2 the keys [a416f556] as promised.defcon2 created a new key [71dd616a] but hasnt used it in public.defcon2 is trying to find programmers she can trust to close the backdoors programmer1 put on the sight.programmer1 is trying to get rehired under new id so he can steal morethere are no programmers working on the sight now.dej kovo

thanks for this one!
didnt snowden say all pgp software was backdoored by the nsa?i saw on the news that criminals and terrorists use mmorpg games to communicate and carry out illegal transactions with the in-game money. they said there are fbi agents whos sole job is to play these games all day in search of said criminals.interesting shit.can one of you tech experts check out chatcrypt.com for me? they claim not even the site owner cant read your messeges.
i thought he said it. my bad. but some reputable(?) scource claimed all pgp software was backdoored by the nsa.i know snowden said the nsa is having great difficulty cracking tor.

the bitcoins are held in escrow and not available for withdrawal. we considered it an inexpensive lesson to learn again after sr1 and the sheep show.we even have a fe only policy and they still grabbed the btcs, i asked them to release to them then to the buyer and did not receive a no response.

quote from: ed from sl on march 01, 2014, 08:53:29 amxsposer,very weird vibes on the sr2 forums tonight--almost all of the posts & replies are pro-sr ... and they are coming from a handful of nyms. no familiar faces.and then there is the murmur in the community--again, bad vibes--regarding captainwhitebeard and hiniguel. reports of scamming, being absent ... worshipped by some, reviled by others.some are now of the opinion that it is just one man behind limitless/stexo/hiniguel/dpr2/defcon/hux/etc.and it is beginning to make sense. watching the latest theatrics regarding hiniguel, its hard not to see a setup for the next big thing. nobody is buying defcons bullshit anymore, so hiniguel steps up and saves the day. he refunds a bunch of money to people (or pretends to, using more nyms), all the while denouncing defcon/sr. he says hes leaving, but hints that the market might be re-born elsewhere/in the future. people nominating him as the next leader....im comparing nyms/posts ... and while i have just begun, it looks like hiniguel = bluegiraffe = mdmazing.and hes talking to himself.consider the following quotes and study them carefully. pay attention to the sentence/paragraph structure, punctuation, etc. one thing jumps out at me--his use of the em dash and semicolon ... but he represents an em dash (--) thusly - (single hyphen with a space on either side). not many people employ these marks of punctuation in their writing or they misuse them; furthermore, there is a common use of the term "mate" used by many of these nyms, as well as a failure to capitalize the letter i (i). then there is the overall content, topics, threads--many sound like they are coming from someone on the sr staff. take gemma, for instance.perhaps compiling a list would be in order....compare just the following:dpr -- http://silkroad5v7dywlc.onion/index.php?action=profile;area=showposts;u=3770defcon -- http://silkroad5v7dywlc.onion/index.php?action=profile;area=showposts;u=1hiniguel -- http://silkroad5v7dywlc.onion/index.php?action=profile;area=showposts;u=1446especially in the admin roles (dpr/defcon), the similarity is obvious. the numerical lists, bold headlines, etc.and cwb? jabbatheslut?stealth? v? hes a goddamned one-man band!dozens of nyms, everywhere ... but maybe its all in my head, because i dont even see how it could be possible.yes, perhaps ive gone around the bend--and im not claiming that any of this is true--but i wanted to share my thoughts and see what you think.is it all really just a goddamned 419 scam?very, very interesting ed. i wish i could give you a +1, you definately deserve it.weve also noticed the similarities of certain major accounts on sr. and we even have screenshots of some posts which show an obvious correlation of writing styles between the main players of sr2.. but i wanted to restrain from adding my own speculations to this saga- as not to bias any of the impartial evidence we have posted above.that being said. i will comment on the hiniguel situation just to clear things up, as many people have been asking, on this forum and others, and i have been kind of skeptical to answer. but what i can say is this; as much as i respect hiniguel for his monetary help to the sr community, and to an extent his forum moderation- i will say that he provided no helpful information whatsoever regarding this whole sr2 investigation.he has obviously been helping the community in a lot of ways and defcon, stealth, clu have all agreed. not to mention other members i personally know have confirmed that hes helped them out.. but every reply we did receive (not many) was extremely vague and absent of fact- even when we presented evidence to him and simply asked for his input.we initially put this down to his busy schedule- because at that point he had already offered his "millions" to help out the community, so he was geting bombarded with emails & pms.but weeks after the fact, we have still received nothing of significance from him? which is weird because he got a personal thankyou from defcon and team for his investigative help? again, i respect hiniguel for his help to the sr community, but dispite our best efforts he has not contribted to this investigation.  where as bbmc, btva and to an extent, oracle went above and beyond their requirements and were more than professional in their cooperation.(oracle providing some very interesting speculation about account sharing- similar to what ed suspects above)the thought that this whole operation could be a 1 man show, while not that outragous (unless ive been up too late and have gone round the bend with you, lol) is not consistant with our findings.. it seems to be more likely a couple of very experienced, old-school players, acting together, operating as vendors/ mods/ admin & vocal forum members.we will try and clear up the whos who in all of this at some point, but whatever outcome we arrive at, will obviosly be speculation (based on evidence of course) but none the less speculation... but we can state that it is evident to us that, dpr2/ stexo & hux are 1 in the same. more to come later.xsposer.> also as ed pointed out, there are no more familliar faces on sr.. this is a clear sign that something isnt right. when all the original and experienced sr members clear out and leave nothing but tumbleweed and kiss ass noobs, its time to leave aswell.
i have made several buys and money went in very fast. *shrugthere is a the refresh buttons which makes the money show up.
thanks for that, but thats a lot of stuff i barely get ^^ i think ill just go on with the dvd drive cuz, itll probably benefit me with other things too. i checked prices and i can get one for pretty affordable price. would u have any suggestions or something?
pgp depends on the generated keys to be random. if they arent random, its simple as pie for someone to decrypt your shit. simple as that.opensourse is the only way to go like mirage said.
yea believe me i feel stupid but not that stupid because it was just $100 (i knew better than to trust those vendors with more than $100) but i read the forums about sr1coins too late. i usually buy from themiddleman but he was out so i had to buy from a new vendor. just beware people. i hate silkroad, been there for a while but its just scam central. anybody wanna give me an agora invite?
in my experience, any counterfiters on here are full of scam. if you find some that are selling quatity passible notes for 60% or less then lets us all know.  seriously i really want some fake bills to get back ay some guys who sold me some weak sihit and buying stuff with few hundo is fakes would serve me well. i habe just never seen a legiit currecy maker in all my days on the edb. there wan liek one dude who had :decent euros but tha wouldnt help me. i mean who doenst wanna spend 50$ for 100$. please update this threaad

i feel obligated to post this here"javascript cryptography considered harmful"http://www.matasano.com/articles/javascript-cryptography/and of course a rebuttal at "thoughts on critiques of javascript cryptography"http://log.nadim.cc/?p=33this is why i dislike solutions like coinb.in. yes, they are attractive as a cross platform solution to help out people with issues with crypto programs not working. i have personally read through the entire electrum codebase to, to the best of my ability, know that there are no obvious backdoors. i cannot say the same for that site, altho i think its likely not in any way malicious. it could be poorly implemented, however. i think a better solution may be to implement a mozilla compatable javascript add-on. this would be able to be vetted and verified, and work across a large number of systems. also http://www.w3.org/tr/webcryptoapi/ gettting standardized and implemented would make it much much easier to do this task as well. perhaps one of these days, i will work on such a task.

if i understand correctly, gox have been letting coins out to the hackers over many years, so this will have caused an inflation in the actual btc in circulation, or would so on the surface of things,those coins stolen will have undoubtedly been sold at other exchanges bringing the prices down,so does this mean now we see those coins are gone, in the long run there is actually much less coins in circulation that people first perceived. in which case we can expect a rise in price as is the supply/demand criteria

torescrow is planning a huge theft of all vendors bitcoins. they have been very shady from the very beginning. they ban anyone who even mentions finalizing early, anywhere. they will ban you from their market, their forum and their subreddit, and then post lies about you to try to discredit you. many people have asked some very serious and very innocent questions about fe. torescrow gives bullshit excuses about protecting cutomers (how are customers protected if the option is up to them?). then they quietly censor their forums and subreddits. lots of things being deleted.very shady market. way too insistent on using their (non multi-sig) escrow. beware of scammers. this is not a safe market.i have a 100% 5/5 reputation on all markets and never made a single transaction on torescrow. and yet torescrow is trying to paint me as a scammer as their reason for banning me from forum, subreddit, and market. when in reality it is only because i asked too many questions about their market and pointed out some very curious behavior from their admins.stay away from torescrow (i can see 99% of you are already)they also pay "oldmandrugs" to act as a user and promote them all over the internet. he is also some sort of informant for them, pointing out anyone that tries to tell the truth about torescrow, so they can be banned.very shady

yea believe me i feel stupid but not that stupid because it was just $100 (i knew better than to trust those vendors with more than $100) but i read the forums about sr1coins too late. i usually buy from themiddleman but he was out so i had to buy from a new vendor. just beware people. i hate silkroad, been there for a while but its just scam central. anybody wanna give me an agora invite?
haha that was his views?if he views this as a war, he has fallen asleep at the helm of a bomber plane and flown straight into his own peoplehis incompetence has caused this issue, no amount of passion will compensate this

hi . i am totally new to sr . so i got to the deposit bitcoin page and i have been given multiple deposit addresses. can someone please help me on how to deposit my cash in this address . thanx
pretty lame to wait that long to actually make that statement, nothing to worry about, working on it, filing for bankruptcy. surprise surprise!
wondering if anyone knows for a fact
thanks for that, but thats a lot of stuff i barely get ^^ i think ill just go on with the dvd drive cuz, itll probably benefit me with other things too. i checked prices and i can get one for pretty affordable price. would u have any suggestions or something?
if i understand correctly, gox have been letting coins out to the hackers over many years, so this will have caused an inflation in the actual btc in circulation, or would so on the surface of things,those coins stolen will have undoubtedly been sold at other exchanges bringing the prices down,so does this mean now we see those coins are gone, in the long run there is actually much less coins in circulation that people first perceived. in which case we can expect a rise in price as is the supply/demand criteria

pgp depends on the generated keys to be random. if they arent random, its simple as pie for someone to decrypt your shit. simple as that.opensourse is the only way to go like mirage said.
i feel obligated to post this here"javascript cryptography considered harmful"http://www.matasano.com/articles/javascript-cryptography/and of course a rebuttal at "thoughts on critiques of javascript cryptography"http://log.nadim.cc/?p=33this is why i dislike solutions like coinb.in. yes, they are attractive as a cross platform solution to help out people with issues with crypto programs not working. i have personally read through the entire electrum codebase to, to the best of my ability, know that there are no obvious backdoors. i cannot say the same for that site, altho i think its likely not in any way malicious. it could be poorly implemented, however. i think a better solution may be to implement a mozilla compatable javascript add-on. this would be able to be vetted and verified, and work across a large number of systems. also http://www.w3.org/tr/webcryptoapi/ gettting standardized and implemented would make it much much easier to do this task as well. perhaps one of these days, i will work on such a task.
quote from: 26a2ueoc3xxrrgs4 on march 01, 2014, 07:16:40 pmjavascript is required. well yea but the application is designed for you to use locally on your own machine. right click, save page as, etc. you also imply that javascript is bad but recommend using electrum or bitcoind?too much effort is like saying its too much effort to use pgp! its never too much effort to verify your funds!but were glad you didnt imply that there arent free open sourced solutions availablei walked away as soon as i saw js. will test it on a more secure machine later. if it works then great (leaving aside the issues raised by owockeznans links).probably being dense but dont really get your point here:"you also imply that javascript is bad but recommend using electrum or bitcoind?"i imply js is a very common attack vector used against people. not sure what that has to do with electrum or bitcoind.
hello im looking to make a purchase from the site on the hiddin wiki known as " black market " or http://dgoega4kbhnp53o7.onion/shop they said they have good comments on hub forums so i thought id make my own post and see what you guys say, any negatives scams postives good things theyve done for you let me know also another site known on the hiddin wiki as " greenpaper counterfeiters " or something like that or also http://67yjqewxrd2ewbtp.onion/ again any negatives scams postives good things theyve done for you let me know!!!!!thank you for all of your
i updated my post with the links of the sites any results?

quote from: owockeznan on march 02, 2014, 09:33:50 amtails is thinking about switching away from claws back to icedove, but it looks like thunderbird is just full of holes to be patched.https://tails.boum.org/blueprint/return_of_icedove__63__/you can also read a paper online which details the specifics of the leaks at http://bit.ly/qdzm7ci cannot suggest thunderbird at this time for any secure email. one again i must promote i2p-bote as an alternative to regular email with the security that you desire.i2p-bote mail is as anonymous and secure as it gets. but in order to use it both parties need the i2p client installed and have i2p-bote accounts, kinda limits acceptance and use since you cannot send/receive from external email accounts. all messages are encrypted so you do not need to use pgp on i2p-bote, still a good idea though.
thank you for these helpful responses. i confess i looked at mailtor based upon only one thing, the recommendation of nightcrawler on sr forums. since then, nightcrawler (who seemed to be a security/tech guru, most knowledgeable and helpful) has abruptly disappeared. which may mean something or may mean nothing. i will peruse the axa guide. vielen dank!
im having a great experience at agora, so far.  everything seems to work well and quickly.

yea believe me i feel stupid but not that stupid because it was just $100 (i knew better than to trust those vendors with more than $100) but i read the forums about sr1coins too late. i usually buy from themiddleman but he was out so i had to buy from a new vendor. just beware people. i hate silkroad, been there for a while but its just scam central. anybody wanna give me an agora invite?

quote from: mirage on march 02, 2014, 05:40:21 amnice! i alwayz kinda wondered about limitless. since we we really" used to be in touch...."we rise again?"....and tha saga continues... peacemirageyou and i were arguing about security either.  obviously you know more on the subject of intel vpro chips than the grand wizard does, and i tip my turban in apology.  that being said, i see your computer expertise and raise you one john lecarré- vlad1m1rs identity is well known to the regulars on bitcointalk.  - vlad1m1r ran a bitcoin hedge fund which turned out to be a ponzi scheme. vlad1m1r also appears to have done "money laundering" for some sr1 regiulars.  in both cases, limetless actively steered people to vlad1m1r and vouched for his honesty and ability. - after vlad1m1r did a runner, there was a great deal of speculation that vlad1m1r and limetless were the same person.  i cannot say whether or not this is true.  but i can say that, at the very least, vlad1m1r knows the person behind the "limetless" screen name.  i can also say that limetless knows several members of the current sr2 administration.  if vlad1m1r assisted any of them in "laundering money" he knows them too. the cell running silk road 2 has been compromised.  the breach is irreperable.  all smileys horses and all smileys men aint bringing humpty out of the cold again.
hi . i am totally new to sr . so i got to the deposit bitcoin page and i have been given multiple deposit addresses. can someone please help me on how to deposit my cash in this address . thanx
pretty lame to wait that long to actually make that statement, nothing to worry about, working on it, filing for bankruptcy. surprise surprise!
wondering if anyone knows for a fact
thanks for that, but thats a lot of stuff i barely get ^^ i think ill just go on with the dvd drive cuz, itll probably benefit me with other things too. i checked prices and i can get one for pretty affordable price. would u have any suggestions or something?
if i understand correctly, gox have been letting coins out to the hackers over many years, so this will have caused an inflation in the actual btc in circulation, or would so on the surface of things,those coins stolen will have undoubtedly been sold at other exchanges bringing the prices down,so does this mean now we see those coins are gone, in the long run there is actually much less coins in circulation that people first perceived. in which case we can expect a rise in price as is the supply/demand criteria

tails is thinking about switching away from claws back to icedove, but it looks like thunderbird is just full of holes to be patched.https://tails.boum.org/blueprint/return_of_icedove__63__/you can also read a paper online which details the specifics of the leaks at http://bit.ly/qdzm7ci cannot suggest thunderbird at this time for any secure email. one again i must promote i2p-bote as an alternative to regular email with the security that you desire.

id think the kgb would manage what snowden releases to the public. saying the nsa has cracked pgp may help them, as people dont bother to use it or use something else that can be cracked.its a bit odd but why not.also tell the public that the nsa is having diffculty with tor, so you keep using it and they can gather intel. tor was developed by the us navy. if that doesnt throw up a big red flag, i dont know what will.open source is the way to go so you can be peer reviewed and not trust xyz do do the right thing. just look at the enigma code and the fact that facilities like cern exist, so is it not a long shot a (super) power has vast amounts of computer power available to them.if you encrypt with xyz im sure the nsa, kgb and whatever chinas intel agency/dept is can decrypt it quite easily. i really doubt its beyond them technologically.i doubt anything available to the public and has been for some time hasnt been cracked by various intel agencies.if you are truely paranoid, use temp.pm and use the best level of pgp in your message.

cool, thanks for the info.  i wonder if the buyers option on blue sky to lock in an order at the current bitcoin rate could also be hedged?for example, if btc is $500 i place and order and lock it in, and by the time i deposit btc theyre worth $600.  im assuming the vendor only gets the $500 rate, with hedging (is that a word?) beginning when the btc are escrowed.

the current bazaar scenario is as follows: when a buyer builds up on an order, and hits proceed with order post which theyre taken to a page where they see the breakdown of the fees, shipping, total order price, and then they enter their address - which gets encrypted for the vendor.so right here, is where the proposed changes would be implemented - the buyer will then need to enter a public key to their portion of the multi-sig transaction. the vendor would have a choice to enter multiple public keys in advance, otherwise theyll be asked to enter one after receiving the order - when they choose to finalize early or escrow during the process of a sale.once the vendor has provided a public key, the bazaars public key will be automatically generated and the final multisig address, and the trasaction details will be sent to everyone: * the address* the amount that needs to be sent* the redeemscript - so they can verify it encodes all the correct details to double check!regardless of whether the payment is finalize early or escrow, the bazaar will then poll blockchain.info for payments to that address. once the full amount is paid, then the order is marked as paid - all users are messaged a link to a page that shows the generated transaction, paying the vendor the full amount, minus the bazaar fees (a raw transaction spending all the transactions sent to the multisg address, and sent to the vendor in one output).everyone will be shown the transaction paying the vendor. if the buyer for some reason choses to raise a dispute, then all involved users will start multi-party discussion on the order, and the bazaar admin will then generate a new transaction based on the outcome of the the dispute, will pay both/either parties the appropriate amount for the order. but if all is successful with the order - which should be most of the time, then one of the buyer will sign the transaction, and paste the partially signed transaction. after which the user party will then sign the transaction and broadcast it, where it will be identified by bazaar when it makes it into the blockchain network via the blockchain api. so, to break it down, the vendor and buyer both have to supply their public keys for that transaction either in advance or when their action is needed during an order, this would involve:* entering an address, or selecting escrow/fe. they need to add the multisig address to their client if using bitcoinqt using one command, and then sign using another. they can also verify the redeemscript or transaction hex so that the details are correct using their client, or else online using www.coinb.inso buyers/vendors will need to enter their public keys manually or in advance. they can generate them in their browsers using www.coinb.in/multisig (though we will be suggesting people to download an offline copy of this site/codes, because it means once funds are sent to the multisig address, the two users can add the signature to transactions in the browser, without having to use any other desktop client. its really that simple), or folks could use www.brainwallet.organyway, having users supplying them in the browser is probably the best thing until bip32 is supported in most clients, which currently is not! bitcoin-qt and electrum are definitely going to use bip32 in the foreseeable future, so thats for then. but, thats another milestone, long after multisig goes in soon and will worked on as a separate update.how does this sound? does the process sound like something you folks can easily adapt to? i think it becomes pretty straightforward, as there are only 2-3 actions the buyers/vendors need to do. it would be one less step when we automate key generation during registration. guess a small inconvinience but thats a small price to pay for absolute security for all bazaar coins. no more worrying about markets heists, as all transactions occur in the blockchain, and are only considered valid when broadcasted into blockchain.which means even if the site is run down by an attacker, they simply cant run off with any coins. also if there is unexpected downtime, or the admin (me) goes awol, the buyer and vendor have their own public keys, so can try negotiate on another channel to sort out their funds themselves. so now, if all goes good with the last few implementation tests - we should have this implemented in another week or two and see things work out.
hello,our market is now available in english, german and french language.greetings
this conversation is a few weeks old, but i think it needs revisiting since it is nonsensical.  most obviously, signing a new identity with an old one, as the op suggests, renders the change useless.  you have linked the two, proving continuity of character, an important concept in this anonymous world.perhaps the only people buyers can place some trust in are the vendors who supply them with goods and services.  finding an acceptable vendor can take many tries and involves the greatest exposure in the entire process, i.e. sending your name and address to multiple strangers in hopes of a inconspicuous package arriving is risky.  finding a vendor you "trust" (to whatever extent) is valuable and convienent.the aim of changing identities would be to break continuity of character and distance ones self from past transactions.  thus, a reputation must be built from the ground up, frusturating buyers and the seller.  the utility is minimal.  a sizeable operation will, in a matter of weeks, have shipped enough drugs to put them in jail for life, just the same as an operation that has been continuous for years.  unless a seller changes identity on a near-monthly basis and disregards reputation and customer loyalty alltogether (business suicide), changing keys is useless.barring any material comprimise in security, venders have it in their best interest to maintain continuity of character for years.

this conversation is a few weeks old, but i think it needs revisiting since it is nonsensical.  most obviously, signing a new identity with an old one, as the op suggests, renders the change useless.  you have linked the two, proving continuity of character, an important concept in this anonymous world.perhaps the only people buyers can place some trust in are the vendors who supply them with goods and services.  finding an acceptable vendor can take many tries and involves the greatest exposure in the entire process, i.e. sending your name and address to multiple strangers in hopes of a inconspicuous package arriving is risky.  finding a vendor you "trust" (to whatever extent) is valuable and convienent.the aim of changing identities would be to break continuity of character and distance ones self from past transactions.  thus, a reputation must be built from the ground up, frusturating buyers and the seller.  the utility is minimal.  a sizeable operation will, in a matter of weeks, have shipped enough drugs to put them in jail for life, just the same as an operation that has been continuous for years.  unless a seller changes identity on a near-monthly basis and disregards reputation and customer loyalty alltogether (business suicide), changing keys is useless.barring any material comprimise in security, venders have it in their best interest to maintain continuity of character for years.

i wont publicly disclose who i am here, but most of you are very intelligent and can figure it out. i worked closely with an advertising agency around february 8th to expose the war on drugs and more broadly the war on people. as a result of this work, ross finally got his arraignment date, and more importantly the gears of progress for humanity started moving in the right direction. ive slowly been adding some of the security posts of this forum to my website in an attempt to help people become more technologically enlightened and aware. please pm for more information.for now, the heresay and rumors regarding sr2 can be put to rest. ross really was dpr, dpr2 is probably (and deservedly) on a beach somewhere sipping mojitos as many of you have mentioned , and the bitcoin heist was indeed a result of the transaction mallaebility exploit rather than an elaborate (yet totally illogical) scheme to run away with everyones money.do your best to support the sr team during this transitional period. im confident that the leadership here is focused on serving everyone in this community, and i believe wholeheartedly that together we can steer this rocky ship into the horizon and towards freedom and liberty for all people.good day mates,asootsoass

id think the kgb would manage what snowden releases to the public. saying the nsa has cracked pgp may help them, as people dont bother to use it or use something else that can be cracked.its a bit odd but why not.also tell the public that the nsa is having diffculty with tor, so you keep using it and they can gather intel. tor was developed by the us navy. if that doesnt throw up a big red flag, i dont know what will.open source is the way to go so you can be peer reviewed and not trust xyz do do the right thing. just look at the enigma code and the fact that facilities like cern exist, so is it not a long shot a (super) power has vast amounts of computer power available to them.if you encrypt with xyz im sure the nsa, kgb and whatever chinas intel agency/dept is can decrypt it quite easily. i really doubt its beyond them technologically.i doubt anything available to the public and has been for some time hasnt been cracked by various intel agencies.if you are truely paranoid, use temp.pm and use the best level of pgp in your message.

well the  conspiracy theorists (ct) keep banging on about the nwo, illumanti etc and the one world currency..weve already seen the shortcommings of gold, gold backed fiat, fiat. the world reserve currency is the usd and well thats only backed by trust and opec already tried (and failed) to switch to the euro. could bitcoin be the world currency? its interesting that governments of the world have not outright banned it (yet) and just see it as another commodity.is bitcoin a veiled way to get them their own world currency and then sell ya a chip to put in your body, so you have the most secure method to store ya bitcoin wallet? youd use rfid to communicate with the chip. makes you think tho, your finances could be drained etc by unscruplous parties....i guess we can only hope that the cts hack the chip and publish, that its not to be trusted. and their results can be easily repeated.the end is near once google, paypal etc legitmise bitcoin for the mainstream? the wider majority are happy to give up their liberties for facebook and google (gmail), so why not put a rfid bitcoin wallet in your body. just my 2 cents i guess. even though i have nfi; joing the dots with (crazy) conspiracy theories. no im not smoking pot right now

welcome jor   please go to http://thehubaoydxrommh.onion/index.php?topic=12.0  to be verified by the hub.
cool, thanks for the info.  i wonder if the buyers option on blue sky to lock in an order at the current bitcoin rate could also be hedged?for example, if btc is $500 i place and order and lock it in, and by the time i deposit btc theyre worth $600.  im assuming the vendor only gets the $500 rate, with hedging (is that a word?) beginning when the btc are escrowed.
the current bazaar scenario is as follows: when a buyer builds up on an order, and hits proceed with order post which theyre taken to a page where they see the breakdown of the fees, shipping, total order price, and then they enter their address - which gets encrypted for the vendor.so right here, is where the proposed changes would be implemented - the buyer will then need to enter a public key to their portion of the multi-sig transaction. the vendor would have a choice to enter multiple public keys in advance, otherwise theyll be asked to enter one after receiving the order - when they choose to finalize early or escrow during the process of a sale.once the vendor has provided a public key, the bazaars public key will be automatically generated and the final multisig address, and the trasaction details will be sent to everyone: * the address* the amount that needs to be sent* the redeemscript - so they can verify it encodes all the correct details to double check!regardless of whether the payment is finalize early or escrow, the bazaar will then poll blockchain.info for payments to that address. once the full amount is paid, then the order is marked as paid - all users are messaged a link to a page that shows the generated transaction, paying the vendor the full amount, minus the bazaar fees (a raw transaction spending all the transactions sent to the multisg address, and sent to the vendor in one output).everyone will be shown the transaction paying the vendor. if the buyer for some reason choses to raise a dispute, then all involved users will start multi-party discussion on the order, and the bazaar admin will then generate a new transaction based on the outcome of the the dispute, will pay both/either parties the appropriate amount for the order. but if all is successful with the order - which should be most of the time, then one of the buyer will sign the transaction, and paste the partially signed transaction. after which the user party will then sign the transaction and broadcast it, where it will be identified by bazaar when it makes it into the blockchain network via the blockchain api. so, to break it down, the vendor and buyer both have to supply their public keys for that transaction either in advance or when their action is needed during an order, this would involve:* entering an address, or selecting escrow/fe. they need to add the multisig address to their client if using bitcoinqt using one command, and then sign using another. they can also verify the redeemscript or transaction hex so that the details are correct using their client, or else online using www.coinb.inso buyers/vendors will need to enter their public keys manually or in advance. they can generate them in their browsers using www.coinb.in/multisig (though we will be suggesting people to download an offline copy of this site/codes, because it means once funds are sent to the multisig address, the two users can add the signature to transactions in the browser, without having to use any other desktop client. its really that simple), or folks could use www.brainwallet.organyway, having users supplying them in the browser is probably the best thing until bip32 is supported in most clients, which currently is not! bitcoin-qt and electrum are definitely going to use bip32 in the foreseeable future, so thats for then. but, thats another milestone, long after multisig goes in soon and will worked on as a separate update.how does this sound? does the process sound like something you folks can easily adapt to? i think it becomes pretty straightforward, as there are only 2-3 actions the buyers/vendors need to do. it would be one less step when we automate key generation during registration. guess a small inconvinience but thats a small price to pay for absolute security for all bazaar coins. no more worrying about markets heists, as all transactions occur in the blockchain, and are only considered valid when broadcasted into blockchain.which means even if the site is run down by an attacker, they simply cant run off with any coins. also if there is unexpected downtime, or the admin (me) goes awol, the buyer and vendor have their own public keys, so can try negotiate on another channel to sort out their funds themselves. so now, if all goes good with the last few implementation tests - we should have this implemented in another week or two and see things work out.
haven't seen this before, but like it a lot. thanks for the link.

ive released a couple of guides onto the marketplace over the course of the past week - obviously trust has been an issue seeing as how the market is completely over-saturated with copy pasta guides full of outdated materials. ive given out a few free copies of my personally developed method to making quick cash (physical fraud guide) to mixed reviews - it seems i misjudged the marketplace when i thought that people would jump at the opportunity to pick up a hand-tailored method for performing physical fraud when in reality, most users want to hang out at their computer monitor carding all day (fair enough, its good money).so im here to reinvent myself - to fix this trust issue regarding the originality of my guides and to generate some positive feedback around committing physical fraud, which in itself is easy enough. just takes some misdirection, smooth talking and calm composure. im now offering consultation, cashout guides as well as the original methods ive developed. these methods are usa only - with an emphasis on washington, colorado, california and new jersey.general consultation topics:-hand tailored, unique credit card cashout method-how to build legitimate credit fast with little effort, legally-shoplifting techniques (different material than the clearnet guides available for free - i guarantee it)-how to hit your mark - tips for misdirection, smooth talking and how to keep your coolfor the time being, there are 4 listings up:http://omo6o7akcampiryq.onion/item/529 - physical fraud consultation (.2 btc per session)http://omo6o7akcampiryq.onion/item/528 - stans custom btc / cc cashout guide (.175 btc)http://omo6o7akcampiryq.onion/item/527 - shoplifting high-end clothing with no equipment (.125 btc)http://omo6o7akcampiryq.onion/item/526 - physical fraud basics + 1 custom developed method to commit fraud profitably (.25) btcand unlisted as of now - still gauging interest but im offering a package deal:(.5 btc)-2 private consulting sessions-all guides posted above as well as any i release in the future-a direct line of communication with a trustworthy professional experienced in performing physical fraud - if youve got any wip scams or ideas that need finishing id be happy to give a hand.<redacted>ps - to any and all who might be interested.... first ten customers will get 50% off their orders so move quick!please do not direct people to email, pm or any other direct message system for the purpose of trade.- captain jack.

any one else having problems getting on pandora?

id think the kgb would manage what snowden releases to the public. saying the nsa has cracked pgp may help them, as people dont bother to use it or use something else that can be cracked.its a bit odd but why not.also tell the public that the nsa is having diffculty with tor, so you keep using it and they can gather intel. tor was developed by the us navy. if that doesnt throw up a big red flag, i dont know what will.open source is the way to go so you can be peer reviewed and not trust xyz do do the right thing. just look at the enigma code and the fact that facilities like cern exist, so is it not a long shot a (super) power has vast amounts of computer power available to them.if you encrypt with xyz im sure the nsa, kgb and whatever chinas intel agency/dept is can decrypt it quite easily. i really doubt its beyond them technologically.i doubt anything available to the public and has been for some time hasnt been cracked by various intel agencies.if you are truely paranoid, use temp.pm and use the best level of pgp in your message.
you cant just install truecrypt in the vm and create an encrypted file? or are you trying to do whole disk encryption? i dont think that will work.make sure you are trying this with truecrypt for pc not truecrypt for osx.
what ever happened to ddw? last i checked the site was 404?also, is there an updated list of all markets?
i dont know if it was yesterday or the day before, but it seemed like every time i tried, it was 404. i was trying links for lists of markets, pgp guides, a bunch of things.could access anything all day. looked at your subreddit to see if there was any news, but none.

this conversation is a few weeks old, but i think it needs revisiting since it is nonsensical.  most obviously, signing a new identity with an old one, as the op suggests, renders the change useless.  you have linked the two, proving continuity of character, an important concept in this anonymous world.perhaps the only people buyers can place some trust in are the vendors who supply them with goods and services.  finding an acceptable vendor can take many tries and involves the greatest exposure in the entire process, i.e. sending your name and address to multiple strangers in hopes of a inconspicuous package arriving is risky.  finding a vendor you "trust" (to whatever extent) is valuable and convienent.the aim of changing identities would be to break continuity of character and distance ones self from past transactions.  thus, a reputation must be built from the ground up, frusturating buyers and the seller.  the utility is minimal.  a sizeable operation will, in a matter of weeks, have shipped enough drugs to put them in jail for life, just the same as an operation that has been continuous for years.  unless a seller changes identity on a near-monthly basis and disregards reputation and customer loyalty alltogether (business suicide), changing keys is useless.barring any material comprimise in security, venders have it in their best interest to maintain continuity of character for years.

to me it looks like some graphic from a dhs webinar like "how to identify cyber-terrorists"..."these desperate people hide behind the anonymity of their computers and plot acts lunatic violence that threaten peace, justice and the american way. they must be stopped, for our childrens sake!!!"  i think a better logo would be "something a bit more aquarian" as they say in "tank girl". like some nice geometry or something.
is pandora down?  wont load for me.
believe it or not the nsa is definitely data mining the blockchain and using it to connect your so-called anonymity to you.  perhaps it could be that they are worried about being able to use sets of repeated data for a user to be able to crack your private key?

somebody told me on here that the silk road marketplace website was programmed and coded in the php programming language. are all darknet marketplaces programmed in php as well, such as agora marketplace, pandora marketplace and blue sky marketplace? are all tor hidden services programmed using the php programming language?or are all websites on the tor browser, all .onion websites programmed in the php programming language?i am just curious, i am trying to line something up for the silk road and need to know this information before i dive head first into it. just need to know what programming language i should use if i wanted to create something to be used within the silk road marketplace website.anybody with comprehensive and extensive knowledge of computer programming able to answer my question and help me out?
sorry if this is a noob question,but,is it safe to access electrum.org through tor? i have coin poss. linked to my identity that i want to tumble around but would like to avoid fog if possible just because it seems  sketchy to me...(however if there is no other safe option, i will use fog) any way i could send them from a wallet currently linked to my id to another wallet created and only accessed through tor and repeat this 4-5 times with throwaway wallets then to my vendor of choice? hehe idk...any advice is truly appreciated! peace. mrs.bb
as topic states, it would be would be good to have a chat, please me message me when you find the time.i will keep bumping this post for the next few days.meerkovo

somebody told me on here that the silk road marketplace website was programmed and coded in the php programming language. are all darknet marketplaces programmed in php as well, such as agora marketplace, pandora marketplace and blue sky marketplace? are all tor hidden services programmed using the php programming language?or are all websites on the tor browser, all .onion websites programmed in the php programming language?i am just curious, i am trying to line something up for the silk road and need to know this information before i dive head first into it. just need to know what programming language i should use if i wanted to create something to be used within the silk road marketplace website.anybody with comprehensive and extensive knowledge of computer programming able to answer my question and help me out?

sorry if this is a noob question,but,is it safe to access electrum.org through tor? i have coin poss. linked to my identity that i want to tumble around but would like to avoid fog if possible just because it seems  sketchy to me...(however if there is no other safe option, i will use fog) any way i could send them from a wallet currently linked to my id to another wallet created and only accessed through tor and repeat this 4-5 times with throwaway wallets then to my vendor of choice? hehe idk...any advice is truly appreciated! peace. mrs.bb

looks like its just major delays...https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=50037.140deposited a little over 24 hours ago with nothing in the fog.
were running towards 2 days on an attempted deposit to fog - no action yet    its complete via the chain - had 80+ confirmations 18 hrs ago.no reply from support / 6hrs.has anyoe seen worse?  hope fogs no fu**ed now.
for some reason lately i cannot get any obfs2 or obfs3 bridges to tor network to work at all in tails bridge mode. ive collected alot of bridge addresses, i boot tails in bridge mode and enter them one at a time. from here on the directions say they should allow access to tor. but no addresses are working and ive tried over 20 or so. any tips?
the strength of tors anonynomity would increase greatly if  many more opsec minded/interested people started hosting obfs3 bridges. im looking into that too if anyone has tips for that.
whatever happened to that l shard you were hyped about?
ok managed to register....finally..thought i would log in today.....wow !!...cannot log in to this account...sorry...sorry evolution market, but you have sweet fuck all to impress me so far.you are currently still in the box marked "yet another jonny come lately asshat market ran by clowns or le hoping for quick coin".be nice to be proved otherwise.
what do you guys think of using sites like bitcoinfog.com and safepostage.com to obscure your tracks?  im not sure if i like the idea of sending money to bitcoinfog or giving details of shipments to safepostage.com, but people use them all the time?  is it just that each site has such a great reputation that no one questions their motives?  i asked this on the silk road forums, but the thread was deleted for... discussing other marketplaces.has anyone used these sites?  any advice for dealing with them?
sorry youve having trouble with evolution, it seems like an otherwise very promising marketplace. i hope you are able to resolve your login issues; so far just by perusing this topic and the evolution forums, the administration seems highly responsive to complaints and feedback and is swift to implement adjustments to make for an easier user experience.we faced a similar problem with registering then later being unable to login on agora. this really put a damper on our ability to get back to business as soon as possible after the sr2 clusterfuck, as most other markets we were interested in required a vendor deposit/fee which we could not afford and agora is one of the few marketplaces that offered a waiver of the fee to vendors in difficult positions after taking one loss after another - between sr1, smp, sr2, etc... but we have no idea where to direct our plea for assistance on agora, since we cant log in to access the support system & as far as we can tell, theres no other way to reach support. the only thing  we can think of is to pm the agora staff on the forums, but i imagine they are very busy and they explicitly state not to pm the forum account regarding support issues.its quite frustrating knowing every day we arent on agora is a day that is costing us dearly, but we cant let our frustration get in the way of our need to persevere - plus our issue is hardly reason to condemn agora as a whole (not that we could really afford to with the exposure at stake.)still, we think evolution seems promising. your services are definitely an asset to any marketplace/community, so we wish you better luck and hopefully well see you on evolution sooner or later.
hi all:longtime lurker here, vendors may recognize my handle as a bulk buyer.  my organization has a longstanding issue that we dont know how to resolve.  i would like to turn to the community now to see if anyone has any insight to our problem.  any help or even a pointer in the right direction would be immensely appreciated.without getting into too much detail, our operation is decentralized - the business end of receiving and selling our product to our clientele is in one part of the u.s. (a), and the buying of btc, connecting with vendors, and ordering of the product on various markets takes place in another (b).  a sends cash deposits through teller transactions to b, b buys untraceable btc and places orders, orders are shipped to a.as some of you may know, under the bank secrecy act, banks are required to report transactions of more than $10,000 in a currency transaction report (ctr).  we like to avoid this.  our orders are usually more than $10,000.  thus, a hypothetical transaction to get the money to b, without triggering a ctr or even worse a suspicious acitivy report (sar), generally involves depositing around $4,000 into one account, and $9,000 into an unrelated "burn" account that we never use again.  we find friends in the b area that we know, burn their account once with a big deposit, collect the cash from them, and never use their account again.the problem is, weve burned so many accounts that we are now having a hard time finding people still able and willing to do it.  we cant go back to accounts weve already burned because we believe a repeat of the large cash deposits into the same account just under $10,000 may trigger a sar due to structuring fears of the bank.my question: is there any way to get around this that we have not thought of yet?  any and all comments or questions are appreciated.  let me know what you guys think.kainan
thanks for the reply versace.  thats something well definitely have to look into.we minimize risk with the burn accounts by only ever using them once, and the people we do use never know what its actually for.  theres also no trail from a per se, since its an anonymous cash deposit, but youre right that it complicates things and implicates other people, perhaps unnecesarily.
this happens to me quite often. itll time out and i wont be able to load the site. usually i just give it a few hours and try later and i can always get back in.

hi pillfirepharmacyi have started the mixer called bitcoin blender that you mentioned in your post. i have not seen anyone post any review of it yet though. i hope it will happen soon..i posted this explanation on how the mixer works in another forum, so i copy the same text here:when you register an account you get your own deposit address.deposit coins to your address and you should see them as incoming within one minute, just refresh the deposit page.now you will see a new button that was hidden before, "get new deposit address". as soon as you have deposited coins to your current address you can get a new one.after three network confirms the coins will be added to your balance and you can withdraw.coins will be sent immediately, there is no waiting time.the mixer uses coin control to make sure to send you other coins than the coins you deposited. it keeps track of all your old deposited coins and will not send it to you.the "test send" button will go through and select coins just like when doing a normal withdraw but instead get back to you with an answer if there are enough coins in the mixer or not.if you deposited a large amount of coins and you get a negative response on "test send", what you can do is leave the coins on the mixer to let it mix with other users and withdraw a small amount every day to different addresses each time. if you still want to withdraw just do a normal send and it will do it.the automatic withdraw feature is like coinkites auto forwarding, it will automatically send coins to the address you set as your automatic withdraw address whenever coins are deposited to your account.it will however not automatically send coins if there is not enough coins in the mixer, but it will keep trying until there is. to override this just log in and turn off the automatic withdraw and it will immediately send you the coins, even if it means you will receive parts of your own old deposited coins.http://bitblendervrfkzr.onion/https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=436467.0
down for me too at 11:30 pm, eastern time.
traffic problem?
intermittent sever over load is my best guess. its been happening every few days round the peak times during the day and evening. just be patient and try again after you wait 10 mins or so. usually you will get in after a few refreshes.
yep ships from canada and you have to sign for it. usps. hands down the best vendor anywhere. complete escrow. shows everytime like clockwork. tracking# provided through pgp. best dope anywhere. what more could you ask for. oh did i say fast shipping. once through customs 1 to 2 days at your house. i should keep this shit to myself but word is going to get out with top notch vendor like this. wide selection to choose from too. dont fuck it up.
this happens to me quite often. itll time out and i wont be able to load the site. usually i just give it a few hours and try later and i can always get back in.
a lot of new users i guess, but worked fine today
what do you guys think of using sites like bitcoinfog.com and safepostage.com to obscure your tracks?  im not sure if i like the idea of sending money to bitcoinfog or giving details of shipments to safepostage.com, but people use them all the time?  is it just that each site has such a great reputation that no one questions their motives?  i asked this on the silk road forums, but the thread was deleted for... discussing other marketplaces.has anyone used these sites?  any advice for dealing with them?
it sounds like you are complicating your operation and leaving a massive paper trail that implicates many of your friends and other people who know you (the people whos accounts you are burning).these people could flip if they are arrested and an investigation of all related transactions at the bank could give the police valuable evidence about the size and scope of your operation.have you considered stealthily packaging the money (wash it with isopropyl to remove any drug residue or other smell, vacuum-seal it and then disguise it inside something) and then sending it viamail through a private courier with their fastest delivery option (privete courier priority services virtually never lose packages if you choose their more expensive insured delivery options). if somethinggoes wrong you can only ever be implicated in a single cash transferal through the mail, not a serious of bank transactions that could lead to extra charges.i have moved very large sums of money through the mail on many occasions, and never had a single problem, i have even sent many sums of cash internationally. dogs cant smell it and it can behidden inside many objects in many clever ways. i never fuck around with banks when i have the option of working with cash or bitcoins.
the fog is having delays, and not showing any deposits that are showing as completed in the blockchain. i hope its just a simple delay.  however, were not feeling like donating any more until the problems are sorted out.  so in the meantime, what are some safe and viable alternative?  ive seen bitlaunder, but heard bad things about them.  also recently saw a blurb on a forum about bitblender.  anyone have any experience with this site?blockchain.info seems to be having capcha issues, so it cannot be used. can anyone else suggest a reliable mixing/obscuring service?id love to hear from other venders about some viable options for moving coins off markets.  i do think that the fog will sort it out, but were not going to risk any more of our clients money until those funds re-appear.  we promise to ship all our customers orders when they fe, even in the event of a site seizure, theft, etc.   we will honor that promise to the end, so until the fog gets sorted, how else can we obscure btc movements off markets? spamming  - well please go under the bridge. grown folks trying to do business here.   thank you in advance for taking the time to reply.
http://silkroad5v7dywlc.onion/index.php?topic=30190.0business as usual, i never doubted these guys.
and now many people, both vendors and buyers, are reporting withdrawal issues on sr2.  i go chop your bitcoin, i take your satoshis.

(a), and the buying of btc, connecting with vendors, and ordering of the product on various markets takes place in another (b).  a sends cash deposits through teller transactions to b, b buys untraceable btc and places orders, orders are shipped to a.as some of you may know, under the bank secrecy act, banks are required to report transactions of more than $10,000 in a currency transaction report (ctr).  we like to avoid this.  our orders are usually more than $10,000.  thus, a hypothetical transaction to get the money to b, without triggering a ctr or even worse a suspicious acitivy report (sar), generally involves depositing around $4,000 into one account, and $9,000 into an unrelated "burn" account that we never use again.  we find friends in the b area that we know, burn their account once with a big deposit, collect the cash from them, and never use their account again.the problem is, weve burned so many accounts that we are now having a hard time finding people still able and willing to do it.  we cant go back to accounts weve already burned because we believe a repeat of the large cash deposits into the same account just under $10,000 may trigger a sar due to structuring fears of the bank.my question: is there any way to get around this that we have not thought of yet?  any and all comments or questions are appreciated.  let me know what you guys think.kainan
thanks for the reply versace.  thats something well definitely have to look into.we minimize risk with the burn accounts by only ever using them once, and the people we do use never know what its actually for.  theres also no trail from a per se, since its an anonymous cash deposit, but youre right that it complicates things and implicates other people, perhaps unnecesarily.
yep ships from canada and you have to sign for it. usps. hands down the best vendor anywhere. complete escrow. shows everytime like clockwork. tracking# provided through pgp. best dope anywhere. what more could you ask for. oh did i say fast shipping. once through customs 1 to 2 days at your house. i should keep this shit to myself but word is going to get out with top notch vendor like this. wide selection to choose from too. dont fuck it up.
hello officer, how nice of you to drop by.give my warm regards to leo ura fag, you know him hes yur cptn

this happens to me quite often. itll time out and i wont be able to load the site. usually i just give it a few hours and try later and i can always get back in.
the fog is having delays, and not showing any deposits that are showing as completed in the blockchain. i hope its just a simple delay.  however, were not feeling like donating any more until the problems are sorted out.  so in the meantime, what are some safe and viable alternative?  ive seen bitlaunder, but heard bad things about them.  also recently saw a blurb on a forum about bitblender.  anyone have any experience with this site?blockchain.info seems to be having capcha issues, so it cannot be used. can anyone else suggest a reliable mixing/obscuring service?id love to hear from other venders about some viable options for moving coins off markets.  i do think that the fog will sort it out, but were not going to risk any more of our clients money until those funds re-appear.  we promise to ship all our customers orders when they fe, even in the event of a site seizure, theft, etc.   we will honor that promise to the end, so until the fog gets sorted, how else can we obscure btc movements off markets? spamming  - well please go under the bridge. grown folks trying to do business here.   thank you in advance for taking the time to reply.
down for me too. any word on the problem??
just come over here to see if i could find anything as there doesnt seem to be anything on agora forums... i had trouble getting on earlier this afternoon but after about half an hour i managed to get on. now it wont load again.. i think this is probably down to a lot of traffic and hopefully nothing to worry about. i really like agora now and have started to get settled. it would be such a shame if it turned out like sheep or tm did
a lot of new users i guess, but worked fine today
just managed to log in
the strength of tors anonynomity would increase greatly if  many more opsec minded/interested people started hosting obfs3 bridges. im looking into that too if anyone has tips for that.
for some reason lately i cannot get any obfs2 or obfs3 bridges to tor network to work at all in tails bridge mode. ive collected alot of bridge addresses, i boot tails in bridge mode and enter them one at a time. from here on the directions say they should allow access to tor. but no addresses are working and ive tried over 20 or so. any tips?

http://silkroad5v7dywlc.onion/index.php?topic=30190.0business as usual, i never doubted these guys.
hi all:longtime lurker here, vendors may recognize my handle as a bulk buyer.  my organization has a longstanding issue that we dont know how to resolve.  i would like to turn to the community now to see if anyone has any insight to our problem.  any help or even a pointer in the right direction would be immensely appreciated.without getting into too much detail, our operation is decentralized - the business end of receiving and selling our product to our clientele is in one part of the u.s. (a), and the buying of btc, connecting with vendors, and ordering of the product on various markets takes place in another (b).  a sends cash deposits through teller transactions to b, b buys untraceable btc and places orders, orders are shipped to a.as some of you may know, under the bank secrecy act, banks are required to report transactions of more than $10,000 in a currency transaction report (ctr).  we like to avoid this.  our orders are usually more than $10,000.  thus, a hypothetical transaction to get the money to b, without triggering a ctr or even worse a suspicious acitivy report (sar), generally involves depositing around $4,000 into one account, and $9,000 into an unrelated "burn" account that we never use again.  we find friends in the b area that we know, burn their account once with a big deposit, collect the cash from them, and never use their account again.the problem is, weve burned so many accounts that we are now having a hard time finding people still able and willing to do it.  we cant go back to accounts weve already burned because we believe a repeat of the large cash deposits into the same account just under $10,000 may trigger a sar due to structuring fears of the bank.my question: is there any way to get around this that we have not thought of yet?  any and all comments or questions are appreciated.  let me know what you guys think.kainan
thanks for the reply versace.  thats something well definitely have to look into.we minimize risk with the burn accounts by only ever using them once, and the people we do use never know what its actually for.  theres also no trail from a per se, since its an anonymous cash deposit, but youre right that it complicates things and implicates other people, perhaps unnecesarily.
we are proamfetamine<redacted>regardsproamfetamineplease do not advertise goods or link to your marketplace before you are verified as a vendor at http://thehubaoydxrommh.onion/index.php?topic=12.0.- captain jack
it sounds like you are complicating your operation and leaving a massive paper trail that implicates many of your friends and other people who know you (the people whos accounts you are burning).these people could flip if they are arrested and an investigation of all related transactions at the bank could give the police valuable evidence about the size and scope of your operation.have you considered stealthily packaging the money (wash it with isopropyl to remove any drug residue or other smell, vacuum-seal it and then disguise it inside something) and then sending it viamail through a private courier with their fastest delivery option (privete courier priority services virtually never lose packages if you choose their more expensive insured delivery options). if somethinggoes wrong you can only ever be implicated in a single cash transferal through the mail, not a serious of bank transactions that could lead to extra charges.i have moved very large sums of money through the mail on many occasions, and never had a single problem, i have even sent many sums of cash internationally. dogs cant smell it and it can behidden inside many objects in many clever ways. i never fuck around with banks when i have the option of working with cash or bitcoins.
what do you guys think of using sites like bitcoinfog.com and safepostage.com to obscure your tracks?  im not sure if i like the idea of sending money to bitcoinfog or giving details of shipments to safepostage.com, but people use them all the time?  is it just that each site has such a great reputation that no one questions their motives?  i asked this on the silk road forums, but the thread was deleted for... discussing other marketplaces.has anyone used these sites?  any advice for dealing with them?
whatever happened to that l shard you were hyped about?
welcome  you can put links to your vendor page up, please get verified in the vendor verification thread http://thehubaoydxrommh.onion/index.php?topic=12.0
yep ships from canada and you have to sign for it. usps. hands down the best vendor anywhere. complete escrow. shows everytime like clockwork. tracking# provided through pgp. best dope anywhere. what more could you ask for. oh did i say fast shipping. once through customs 1 to 2 days at your house. i should keep this shit to myself but word is going to get out with top notch vendor like this. wide selection to choose from too. dont fuck it up.

as above, just wondered what happened to the guy and would like to get back in touch.regards,d
and now many people, both vendors and buyers, are reporting withdrawal issues on sr2.  i go chop your bitcoin, i take your satoshis.
hello officer, how nice of you to drop by.give my warm regards to leo ura fag, you know him hes yur cptn

the fog is having delays, and not showing any deposits that are showing as completed in the blockchain. i hope its just a simple delay.  however, were not feeling like donating any more until the problems are sorted out.  so in the meantime, what are some safe and viable alternative?  ive seen bitlaunder, but heard bad things about them.  also recently saw a blurb on a forum about bitblender.  anyone have any experience with this site?blockchain.info seems to be having capcha issues, so it cannot be used. can anyone else suggest a reliable mixing/obscuring service?id love to hear from other venders about some viable options for moving coins off markets.  i do think that the fog will sort it out, but were not going to risk any more of our clients money until those funds re-appear.  we promise to ship all our customers orders when they fe, even in the event of a site seizure, theft, etc.   we will honor that promise to the end, so until the fog gets sorted, how else can we obscure btc movements off markets? spamming  - well please go under the bridge. grown folks trying to do business here.   thank you in advance for taking the time to reply.

down for me too. any word on the problem??
a lot of new users i guess, but worked fine today
just come over here to see if i could find anything as there doesnt seem to be anything on agora forums... i had trouble getting on earlier this afternoon but after about half an hour i managed to get on. now it wont load again.. i think this is probably down to a lot of traffic and hopefully nothing to worry about. i really like agora now and have started to get settled. it would be such a shame if it turned out like sheep or tm did
hello officer, how nice of you to drop by.give my warm regards to leo ura fag, you know him hes yur cptn

and now many people, both vendors and buyers, are reporting withdrawal issues on sr2.  i go chop your bitcoin, i take your satoshis.
my withdrawal from fog was marked as finished 1 day 8 hours ago, but has still not shown up in the receving account... at this point i am worried...
pending balance of 1.5 btc. finalized on another order so the vendors problem now.
it sounds like you are complicating your operation and leaving a massive paper trail that implicates many of your friends and other people who know you (the people whos accounts you are burning).these people could flip if they are arrested and an investigation of all related transactions at the bank could give the police valuable evidence about the size and scope of your operation.have you considered stealthily packaging the money (wash it with isopropyl to remove any drug residue or other smell, vacuum-seal it and then disguise it inside something) and then sending it viamail through a private courier with their fastest delivery option (privete courier priority services virtually never lose packages if you choose their more expensive insured delivery options). if somethinggoes wrong you can only ever be implicated in a single cash transferal through the mail, not a serious of bank transactions that could lead to extra charges.i have moved very large sums of money through the mail on many occasions, and never had a single problem, i have even sent many sums of cash internationally. dogs cant smell it and it can behidden inside many objects in many clever ways. i never fuck around with banks when i have the option of working with cash or bitcoins.
ya fixed and in now.will apologies for blowing fuses...with all the sr stress and drama, the constant fear and mistrust being spread....i am ready to kill some fucker these days !!...watching our world slowly being destroyed has pissed me off.so, to reply. apologies to evolution. overall, the interface and general set up seems very good. lets hope they can stick around !!...
as im sure many others will say, just be patient.just the other day i had a rather large withdrawl say it was finished hours ago, but none of the addresses even showed up on the blockchian. a few hours later, there they were.if all else fails, contact their support, but i would wait atleast a day or two before.

sorry youve having trouble with evolution, it seems like an otherwise very promising marketplace. i hope you are able to resolve your login issues; so far just by perusing this topic and the evolution forums, the administration seems highly responsive to complaints and feedback and is swift to implement adjustments to make for an easier user experience.we faced a similar problem with registering then later being unable to login on agora. this really put a damper on our ability to get back to business as soon as possible after the sr2 clusterfuck, as most other markets we were interested in required a vendor deposit/fee which we could not afford and agora is one of the few marketplaces that offered a waiver of the fee to vendors in difficult positions after taking one loss after another - between sr1, smp, sr2, etc... but we have no idea where to direct our plea for assistance on agora, since we cant log in to access the support system & as far as we can tell, theres no other way to reach support. the only thing  we can think of is to pm the agora staff on the forums, but i imagine they are very busy and they explicitly state not to pm the forum account regarding support issues.its quite frustrating knowing every day we arent on agora is a day that is costing us dearly, but we cant let our frustration get in the way of our need to persevere - plus our issue is hardly reason to condemn agora as a whole (not that we could really afford to with the exposure at stake.)still, we think evolution seems promising. your services are definitely an asset to any marketplace/community, so we wish you better luck and hopefully well see you on evolution sooner or later.
ok managed to register....finally..thought i would log in today.....wow !!...cannot log in to this account...sorry...sorry evolution market, but you have sweet fuck all to impress me so far.you are currently still in the box marked "yet another jonny come lately asshat market ran by clowns or le hoping for quick coin".be nice to be proved otherwise.
ya fixed and in now.will apologies for blowing fuses...with all the sr stress and drama, the constant fear and mistrust being spread....i am ready to kill some fucker these days !!...watching our world slowly being destroyed has pissed me off.so, to reply. apologies to evolution. overall, the interface and general set up seems very good. lets hope they can stick around !!...
down for me too at 11:30 pm, eastern time.
traffic problem?
intermittent sever over load is my best guess. its been happening every few days round the peak times during the day and evening. just be patient and try again after you wait 10 mins or so. usually you will get in after a few refreshes.
down for me, couldnt access yesterday either

with bitfog being slow and iffy lately, why not use shared send for your tumbling?
as im sure many others will say, just be patient.just the other day i had a rather large withdrawl say it was finished hours ago, but none of the addresses even showed up on the blockchian. a few hours later, there they were.if all else fails, contact their support, but i would wait atleast a day or two before.
pending balance of 1.5 btc. finalized on another order so the vendors problem now.

and now many people, both vendors and buyers, are reporting withdrawal issues on sr2.  i go chop your bitcoin, i take your satoshis.
hi all:longtime lurker here, vendors may recognize my handle as a bulk buyer.  my organization has a longstanding issue that we dont know how to resolve.  i would like to turn to the community now to see if anyone has any insight to our problem.  any help or even a pointer in the right direction would be immensely appreciated.without getting into too much detail, our operation is decentralized - the business end of receiving and selling our product to our clientele is in one part of the u.s. (a), and the buying of btc, connecting with vendors, and ordering of the product on various markets takes place in another (b).  a sends cash deposits through teller transactions to b, b buys untraceable btc and places orders, orders are shipped to a.as some of you may know, under the bank secrecy act, banks are required to report transactions of more than $10,000 in a currency transaction report (ctr).  we like to avoid this.  our orders are usually more than $10,000.  thus, a hypothetical transaction to get the money to b, without triggering a ctr or even worse a suspicious acitivy report (sar), generally involves depositing around $4,000 into one account, and $9,000 into an unrelated "burn" account that we never use again.  we find friends in the b area that we know, burn their account once with a big deposit, collect the cash from them, and never use their account again.the problem is, weve burned so many accounts that we are now having a hard time finding people still able and willing to do it.  we cant go back to accounts weve already burned because we believe a repeat of the large cash deposits into the same account just under $10,000 may trigger a sar due to structuring fears of the bank.my question: is there any way to get around this that we have not thought of yet?  any and all comments or questions are appreciated.  let me know what you guys think.kainan
thanks for the reply versace.  thats something well definitely have to look into.we minimize risk with the burn accounts by only ever using them once, and the people we do use never know what its actually for.  theres also no trail from a per se, since its an anonymous cash deposit, but youre right that it complicates things and implicates other people, perhaps unnecesarily.
yep ships from canada and you have to sign for it. usps. hands down the best vendor anywhere. complete escrow. shows everytime like clockwork. tracking# provided through pgp. best dope anywhere. what more could you ask for. oh did i say fast shipping. once through customs 1 to 2 days at your house. i should keep this shit to myself but word is going to get out with top notch vendor like this. wide selection to choose from too. dont fuck it up.

this happens to me quite often. itll time out and i wont be able to load the site. usually i just give it a few hours and try later and i can always get back in.
the fog is having delays, and not showing any deposits that are showing as completed in the blockchain. i hope its just a simple delay.  however, were not feeling like donating any more until the problems are sorted out.  so in the meantime, what are some safe and viable alternative?  ive seen bitlaunder, but heard bad things about them.  also recently saw a blurb on a forum about bitblender.  anyone have any experience with this site?blockchain.info seems to be having capcha issues, so it cannot be used. can anyone else suggest a reliable mixing/obscuring service?id love to hear from other venders about some viable options for moving coins off markets.  i do think that the fog will sort it out, but were not going to risk any more of our clients money until those funds re-appear.  we promise to ship all our customers orders when they fe, even in the event of a site seizure, theft, etc.   we will honor that promise to the end, so until the fog gets sorted, how else can we obscure btc movements off markets? spamming  - well please go under the bridge. grown folks trying to do business here.   thank you in advance for taking the time to reply.
down for me too. any word on the problem??
just come over here to see if i could find anything as there doesnt seem to be anything on agora forums... i had trouble getting on earlier this afternoon but after about half an hour i managed to get on. now it wont load again.. i think this is probably down to a lot of traffic and hopefully nothing to worry about. i really like agora now and have started to get settled. it would be such a shame if it turned out like sheep or tm did
a lot of new users i guess, but worked fine today
just managed to log in
the strength of tors anonynomity would increase greatly if  many more opsec minded/interested people started hosting obfs3 bridges. im looking into that too if anyone has tips for that.
for some reason lately i cannot get any obfs2 or obfs3 bridges to tor network to work at all in tails bridge mode. ive collected alot of bridge addresses, i boot tails in bridge mode and enter them one at a time. from here on the directions say they should allow access to tor. but no addresses are working and ive tried over 20 or so. any tips?

hi pillfirepharmacyi have started the mixer called bitcoin blender that you mentioned in your post. i have not seen anyone post any review of it yet though. i hope it will happen soon..i posted this explanation on how the mixer works in another forum, so i copy the same text here:when you register an account you get your own deposit address.deposit coins to your address and you should see them as incoming within one minute, just refresh the deposit page.now you will see a new button that was hidden before, "get new deposit address". as soon as you have deposited coins to your current address you can get a new one.after three network confirms the coins will be added to your balance and you can withdraw.coins will be sent immediately, there is no waiting time.the mixer uses coin control to make sure to send you other coins than the coins you deposited. it keeps track of all your old deposited coins and will not send it to you.the "test send" button will go through and select coins just like when doing a normal withdraw but instead get back to you with an answer if there are enough coins in the mixer or not.if you deposited a large amount of coins and you get a negative response on "test send", what you can do is leave the coins on the mixer to let it mix with other users and withdraw a small amount every day to different addresses each time. if you still want to withdraw just do a normal send and it will do it.the automatic withdraw feature is like coinkites auto forwarding, it will automatically send coins to the address you set as your automatic withdraw address whenever coins are deposited to your account.it will however not automatically send coins if there is not enough coins in the mixer, but it will keep trying until there is. to override this just log in and turn off the automatic withdraw and it will immediately send you the coins, even if it means you will receive parts of your own old deposited coins.http://bitblendervrfkzr.onion/https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=436467.0
looks like its just major delays...https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=50037.140deposited a little over 24 hours ago with nothing in the fog.
my withdrawal from fog was marked as finished 1 day 8 hours ago, but has still not shown up in the receving account... at this point i am worried...

it sounds like you are complicating your operation and leaving a massive paper trail that implicates many of your friends and other people who know you (the people whos accounts you are burning).these people could flip if they are arrested and an investigation of all related transactions at the bank could give the police valuable evidence about the size and scope of your operation.have you considered stealthily packaging the money (wash it with isopropyl to remove any drug residue or other smell, vacuum-seal it and then disguise it inside something) and then sending it viamail through a private courier with their fastest delivery option (privete courier priority services virtually never lose packages if you choose their more expensive insured delivery options). if somethinggoes wrong you can only ever be implicated in a single cash transferal through the mail, not a serious of bank transactions that could lead to extra charges.i have moved very large sums of money through the mail on many occasions, and never had a single problem, i have even sent many sums of cash internationally. dogs cant smell it and it can behidden inside many objects in many clever ways. i never fuck around with banks when i have the option of working with cash or bitcoins.

sorry youve having trouble with evolution, it seems like an otherwise very promising marketplace. i hope you are able to resolve your login issues; so far just by perusing this topic and the evolution forums, the administration seems highly responsive to complaints and feedback and is swift to implement adjustments to make for an easier user experience.we faced a similar problem with registering then later being unable to login on agora. this really put a damper on our ability to get back to business as soon as possible after the sr2 clusterfuck, as most other markets we were interested in required a vendor deposit/fee which we could not afford and agora is one of the few marketplaces that offered a waiver of the fee to vendors in difficult positions after taking one loss after another - between sr1, smp, sr2, etc... but we have no idea where to direct our plea for assistance on agora, since we cant log in to access the support system & as far as we can tell, theres no other way to reach support. the only thing  we can think of is to pm the agora staff on the forums, but i imagine they are very busy and they explicitly state not to pm the forum account regarding support issues.its quite frustrating knowing every day we arent on agora is a day that is costing us dearly, but we cant let our frustration get in the way of our need to persevere - plus our issue is hardly reason to condemn agora as a whole (not that we could really afford to with the exposure at stake.)still, we think evolution seems promising. your services are definitely an asset to any marketplace/community, so we wish you better luck and hopefully well see you on evolution sooner or later.

down for me too at 11:30 pm, eastern time.
traffic problem?
intermittent sever over load is my best guess. its been happening every few days round the peak times during the day and evening. just be patient and try again after you wait 10 mins or so. usually you will get in after a few refreshes.
down for me, couldnt access yesterday either
were running towards 2 days on an attempted deposit to fog - no action yet    its complete via the chain - had 80+ confirmations 18 hrs ago.no reply from support / 6hrs.has anyoe seen worse?  hope fogs no fu**ed now.
with bitfog being slow and iffy lately, why not use shared send for your tumbling?
this happens to me quite often. itll time out and i wont be able to load the site. usually i just give it a few hours and try later and i can always get back in.
the fog is having delays, and not showing any deposits that are showing as completed in the blockchain. i hope its just a simple delay.  however, were not feeling like donating any more until the problems are sorted out.  so in the meantime, what are some safe and viable alternative?  ive seen bitlaunder, but heard bad things about them.  also recently saw a blurb on a forum about bitblender.  anyone have any experience with this site?blockchain.info seems to be having capcha issues, so it cannot be used. can anyone else suggest a reliable mixing/obscuring service?id love to hear from other venders about some viable options for moving coins off markets.  i do think that the fog will sort it out, but were not going to risk any more of our clients money until those funds re-appear.  we promise to ship all our customers orders when they fe, even in the event of a site seizure, theft, etc.   we will honor that promise to the end, so until the fog gets sorted, how else can we obscure btc movements off markets? spamming  - well please go under the bridge. grown folks trying to do business here.   thank you in advance for taking the time to reply.
down for me too. any word on the problem??
just come over here to see if i could find anything as there doesnt seem to be anything on agora forums... i had trouble getting on earlier this afternoon but after about half an hour i managed to get on. now it wont load again.. i think this is probably down to a lot of traffic and hopefully nothing to worry about. i really like agora now and have started to get settled. it would be such a shame if it turned out like sheep or tm did
a lot of new users i guess, but worked fine today
just managed to log in
the strength of tors anonynomity would increase greatly if  many more opsec minded/interested people started hosting obfs3 bridges. im looking into that too if anyone has tips for that.
for some reason lately i cannot get any obfs2 or obfs3 bridges to tor network to work at all in tails bridge mode. ive collected alot of bridge addresses, i boot tails in bridge mode and enter them one at a time. from here on the directions say they should allow access to tor. but no addresses are working and ive tried over 20 or so. any tips?

hi pillfirepharmacyi have started the mixer called bitcoin blender that you mentioned in your post. i have not seen anyone post any review of it yet though. i hope it will happen soon..i posted this explanation on how the mixer works in another forum, so i copy the same text here:when you register an account you get your own deposit address.deposit coins to your address and you should see them as incoming within one minute, just refresh the deposit page.now you will see a new button that was hidden before, "get new deposit address". as soon as you have deposited coins to your current address you can get a new one.after three network confirms the coins will be added to your balance and you can withdraw.coins will be sent immediately, there is no waiting time.the mixer uses coin control to make sure to send you other coins than the coins you deposited. it keeps track of all your old deposited coins and will not send it to you.the "test send" button will go through and select coins just like when doing a normal withdraw but instead get back to you with an answer if there are enough coins in the mixer or not.if you deposited a large amount of coins and you get a negative response on "test send", what you can do is leave the coins on the mixer to let it mix with other users and withdraw a small amount every day to different addresses each time. if you still want to withdraw just do a normal send and it will do it.the automatic withdraw feature is like coinkites auto forwarding, it will automatically send coins to the address you set as your automatic withdraw address whenever coins are deposited to your account.it will however not automatically send coins if there is not enough coins in the mixer, but it will keep trying until there is. to override this just log in and turn off the automatic withdraw and it will immediately send you the coins, even if it means you will receive parts of your own old deposited coins.http://bitblendervrfkzr.onion/https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=436467.0
looks like its just major delays...https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=50037.140deposited a little over 24 hours ago with nothing in the fog.
my withdrawal from fog was marked as finished 1 day 8 hours ago, but has still not shown up in the receving account... at this point i am worried...

ahhh, bmr, my favorite marketplace of all time. even in the glory days of the original silkroad, i favored this market! i will support back0py in anything he does if he ever returns to the community. just thinking about bmr seems to warrant the phrase, "the good ol days" though it was operating only a few months ago. i think it will always be my favorite marketplace altogether.
very good security with backopy, the site was just painfully slow. when is the new one up and running, any inside info?

dont worry guys the smalldick virgin "whyusheep" has no idea what hes talking about, hes some pimply virgin that paid someone to dos a site in a vain effort to get attention (seeing as his penis will never get any attention other than his hand).  i got faith in agora team they are the most legit site of them all so far.

reports of missing btc deposits are usually from impatient newbies who panic and do not report back when the money shows...agora rocks! its my new home.

hello hub,many of you may be interested in hiding the use of tor from your isp. some isps are already under federal orders to maintain databases of ip addresses connecting to tor nodes, and at this point you should expect the n s a to be collecting that data. there is a nice solution other than vpn services (which can prove to not be helpful depending on how you configure your pathway into tor or if you choose a bad vpn service) called pluggable transports that give you a bridge to connect to tor. bridge - ip address that connects you to tor, possibly unknown as a tor bridge. using these will hide that you are using a known tor node. obfs2 bridge - bridge that has data packets disguised as normal data, hides on the surface that you are using tor. vulnerable to dpi, (deep packet inspection) a capability of the fbi or nsa.  roughly 200-300 exist so understand using them can pool you into a smaller group. solution: host your own on a vps or the tor cloud serviceobfs3 - resistent to dpi, ultimately the safest bridge as it completely masks your data packets. the only problem is that they are few in number thus pooling you into yet a smaller group. the more people host, the infinitely stronger tor becomes!!so, go to torproject and look up some bridges, obfs2 and obfs3 bridges, the more you have the better.so now boot tails in bridge mode. wait til the menu for live or live(failsafe) comes up. hit tab, and then hit spacebar and enter the word bridge, which will launch tails in bridge mode.from here, set the system clock to sync with utc (uk) time. the menu for adding bridges will open automatically, with an attached 127:0.0.1: 7777 or some other number, do not delete this as it is necessary for bridge mode to run. add your bridges one at a time and hit the + button,connect to tor a bit more safely! tails is working on implenting support for flashproxy, the next huge tool in tor anynomity. once that is deployed for tails i would heavily consider implementing that technology. there is a special pluggable transports tor browser bundle that is configured to run bridges automatically; which supports flashproxy so it is a matter of time. the tor cloud service is a great way to host a free private obfs2/3 bridge. if you want to strengthen tor think about hosting a public bridge or obfs bridge!be safe lovies. <3spaceh0rse
i use torchat sometimes, but anything i send pertaining to stuff on the darknet is encrypted with pgp no matter what service im using. i believe anything thats sent eletronically can be stored even in chat programs like bitmessage and torchat. the new article out that sr1 was busted because the fbi got to the backup servers just make me feel uneasy about sending anything without it being pgp encrypted.

just read the whitepaper over at bitmessage.org. it looks interesting.  it uses bitcoin-like principles to hide the sender/receiver and everyone gets all the messages to make it impossible for anyone watching to tell whats going on.  you can send messages to a specific address or to those who subscribe to a mailing list.  it uses the proof-of-work concept (like bitcoin) to help prevent spam.is anyone on here using it? if so what do you think?  easier than pgp/email?
