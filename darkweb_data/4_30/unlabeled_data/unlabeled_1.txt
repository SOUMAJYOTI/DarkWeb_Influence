i can confirm that the first time i moved a large amont of btc into agora i was fucking scared shitless. while follwing and coins through i saw a chunk of them coming out the other side, from my wallet to a different wallet. that scared the shit out of me, but when nothing came of that and my large amount of coins was safe, i realized that its how the tumbler works, and thats fucking awesome. i had an outgoing transaction on the blockchain from my agora wallet that was getting confirmations and everything. i didnt lose any coin, but it looked like i was getting drained for about an hour. this wasnt the case with coin transfers under $100.
well as far as missing bitcoins go i have been on agora for about a week but have not made any transactions.  i saw the link today about missing bitcoins so i decided to check it out for myself.  i first deposited a very little bitcoin to my agora wallet, and then a little more and finally the rest of what i need to make my purchase. all and all everything went ok bitcoins transfereed over in about a half hour give or take and there not missing there still in my agora wallet.
you might have better luck looking for the stolen bitcoins in a candy vending machine. ..
would it be safest then to host your hidden service on your own using your own servers using something like whonix or a similar setup?  if this is the safest way to do it, how much bandwidth would the average hidden service need?  how much would a large marketplace site need?  and, perhaps most importantly, would any problems arise from your isp seeing that you are constantly connected to tor?

quote from: gumby on february 24, 2014, 04:19:59 pmfh wasnt hosted at home. the server was in france. the hosting provider is believed to be ovh.none of the sr servers were hosted at home either but they were all discovered. the problem with hosting at home is that its undeniable you are the owner, whereas if you rent a server anonymously then even if your hidden service is found, they wont necessarily be able to find you.the point is, it is stupid to host from home.
another point i should mention is do not use plastic bags, plastic wrap, etc to stop odor. that and vac sealing do not stop odor for more than a few minutes. even triple sealing does very little and can be smelled by a human let alone a dog after 12 hours or so.use mylar at the minimum, aluminum foil bags are even better. seal them with aluminum tape found at home improvement centers world wide.>id also suggest using 2 layers of gloves. one cloth, then an external par of "nitrile" gloves, not latexthat will certainly work but no need for 2 pair of gloves. one pair of cotton will do the job, no prints will get through that. latex or nitrile will get hot as hell if you wear them for long, same with other rubber substitutes.
bandcamp91, those are good points. mirage, you just repeated what i said about plastic vs mylar or foil.if you can find gloves that fit closely, there is nothing wrong with wearing 2 of them, i just dont see the need. wearing 2 gloves to me is like having robot fingers that are super clumsy. nothing they can trace will go through a cotton glove, you are only wearing it long enough to do the packing.what are other ways to stop odor from coming through? 1. put the goods in a glass jar2. put them in a tin of some sort and tape it carefully3. pack them in pvc4. pack them in abs or other odor proof plastic.any other tips?

so im trying to wrap my head around this whole multisig thing and i think i got down mostly, but im not sure about 1 or 2 parts, so hopefully someone here can help me out. the main concern i have is mostly about the security of it, because for what i know, it relies on a 3rd party to create a multisig address, right? now, what guarantee do i have that this 3rd party uses the public key i provided. and, what guarantee do i have that this address is indeed a 2/3 multisig, and not 2/4 or something else? is there any way of verifying this, and if so, how?
alright, thx! so if i want to order something from tmp or any other market that has multsig, i have to ask both the vendor and the marketplace for their public key every time?
well if its all about trust in the end, is there any point to multisig addresses?
thx, that explains a lot

tonight gox owner resigned from his position on the bitcoin foundations board of directors. a whale put 10k bitcoins on bitstamp (6mil usd worth) at about $580/btc and like 7k of them got bought, then the price fell some.my theory:gox insiders (who are able to withdraw coins from gox) are buying on gox and then selling on other exchanges and depressing the prices. not a new theory, of course. since btc has no rules, im not even sure it is illegal. if it is true, i hope gox is profiteering to rebuild its funds so gox can reopen solvent. i hope it is not just going rogue and ripping everyone off and hurting coin values as well.i wonder if the whale on bitstamp tonight is gox insiders buying coins from themselves to move the coins to new wallets and break the evidence trail of where the coins came from? not sure that would work really, but...?
ask the next man to provide the other 2 public keys, then generate the address (will begin with 3) and see if it matches the payment address he gave you. if it doesnt he is trying to scam you. make sure he tells you what order he passed the 3 addresses in (or try all permutations yourself).you can generate the addresses in electrum or bitcoind.

quote from: fromage on february 24, 2014, 06:17:59 pmalright, thx! so if i want to order something from tmp or any other market that has multsig, i have to ask both the vendor and the marketplace for their public key every time?yes, technically you could. but it really would not make much sense. by using the old system of escrow, you are putting trust that the server is going to pay out the money to the seller or refund it to you if there is  a dispute. in this case, you are just placing trust that the server is creating a multisignature address that is releasable to either you or the seller. if you intend on paying for your item, then what concerns do you have? requesting the public keys of the seller and server seems pointless, since it is the seller who would end up getting the funds. and this is why you choose trustworthy markets and vendors.....
quote from: fromage on february 24, 2014, 06:32:27 pmwell if its all about trust in the end, is there any point to multisig addresses?yes, it is to stop the market from getting robbed because each transaction needs to be unlocked separately with unique keys. i suppose you could get the public keys from the seller and server but this effectively would give the buyer and seller the ability to close the deal without the server and therefore you could cut out their market fees. so this is a bad idea for the server to do this. let me just say, that there is no more risk to doing multisig than regular escrow, and in fact less risk because a 3rd party hacker cannot steal everyones money. trusting the market is a choice you need to make on your own and if you want to deal directly with the vendor, then do so outside of the market.if the market is going to give its customers the ability to close deals while cutting out their market fees, it would not be worth it for the market.

before i go deeper i would like everybody to really read the following clearnet article regarding javascript and tor.http://www.itworld.com/software/367979/tor-project-stop-using-windows-disable-javascript"the vulnerability was patched by mozilla in later versions of firefox, but some people may still be using the older versions of the tor browser bundle. the bundles browser, based on firefox, is specially configured to visit tor sites, which have urls that look like "http://fakenxc4qt76tg.onion/.""several tor browser bundle versions were fixed over a four-day period starting june 26. although the browser bundle will automatically check for a new version, it is possible that some users didnt upgrade, which could have put them at risk.""although unconfirmed, computer security experts have theorized the malware may have been used by law enforcement to collect information on people who browsed certain tor websites supported by a company called freedom hosting.  that hosting company is believed to be connected to a 28-year-old man, eric eoin marques. he is being held by irish authorities pending an extradition request from the u.s. on charges of distributing and promoting child pornography, according to the irish publication the independent."now..."really, switching away from windows is probably a good security move for many reasons," according to a security advisory posted monday by the tor project.""people using linux and os x were not affected, but that doesnt mean they couldnt be targeted in the future. "this wasnt the first firefox vulnerability, nor will it be the last," the tor project warned."ok, so we know that windows isnt safe. and anyone using an older version of the tor browser bundle isnt safe. moral, dump windows and/or upgrade your software! javascript is not a huge chunk of security. the fact that a site uses javascript should not be an absolute, non negotiable issue. the tor network and javascript are just tools, along with pgp, tails, pidgin, ssl, https, multi signature transactions, crypto currency and many many more that each user has at his or her disposal to stay safewhile its true our .onion site uses javascript, according to this article, so does about 90% of the websites currently running. our site is still functional even with javascript disabled. you will not have access to certain areas of the site, but your experience still should be enjoyable. we use javascript for some of the following, captcha, image/file uploading, free multi signature transaction app, posting of free classified ads, instant messaging, etc. although darknet nation does have and maintain a .onion presence we are actively working on the clearnet aspect of our movement. we are a movement. if youd like to help or contribute please feel free to visit our site and support darknet nation26a2ueoc3xxrrgs4.onion

gumby is right.. fh was at ovh in france.   and, based on opdarknet logs and their owners posts on clearnet forums, im fairly confident they were using virtual isolation.and however they got caught, im fairly sure it wasnt because they incorrectly isolated their server instances.as with almost any security decision, its balancing risks and rewards.   vps-based hosting gives you the risk of being discovered by the vps provider (assuming youre doing something the provider cares about), and if the box gets hacked, itll get deanonymized.   you balance that with the awareness that a vps environment should be disposable, with nothing to tie it to its owner.  of course, you cant ensure the integrity of any of your data or onion key in that environment, so plan accordingly.hosting at home seems stupid once youre deanonymized.  but if you can effectively use physical isolation, and do it right, you are probably much more resistant to being deanonymized in the first place.   i dont think thats as crazy of an idea as people think, but you better be damned sure youre doing it right if you go that route.theres not a perfect solution.  anonymously renting a dedicated server and using a hypervisor to provide isolation is probably the best balance.

i think if there is a referral commission in place we should not fill the pockets of other markets. we should all join under a referral link from our favorite vendor (that is on agora and silkroad) or those who are helping this community who has suffered the most from the theft.why not use this disaster as a small positive to try to fix our marketplace rather than line the pockets of people who will use our paranoid natures as darknet dwellers as a way to profit on our misfortune.everyone has probably got an account already but if not pm me for a referral but i would much rather people change accounts to an account that gives commission to the good members of the darkweb community.

gumby is right.. fh was at ovh in france.   and, based on opdarknet logs and their owners posts on clearnet forums, im fairly confident they were using virtual isolation.and however they got caught, im fairly sure it wasnt because they incorrectly isolated their server instances.as with almost any security decision, its balancing risks and rewards.   vps-based hosting gives you the risk of being discovered by the vps provider (assuming youre doing something the provider cares about), and if the box gets hacked, itll get deanonymized.   you balance that with the awareness that a vps environment should be disposable, with nothing to tie it to its owner.  of course, you cant ensure the integrity of any of your data or onion key in that environment, so plan accordingly.hosting at home seems stupid once youre deanonymized.  but if you can effectively use physical isolation, and do it right, you are probably much more resistant to being deanonymized in the first place.   i dont think thats as crazy of an idea as people think, but you better be damned sure youre doing it right if you go that route.theres not a perfect solution.  anonymously renting a dedicated server and using a hypervisor to provide isolation is probably the best balance.

so im trying to wrap my head around this whole multisig thing and i think i got down mostly, but im not sure about 1 or 2 parts, so hopefully someone here can help me out. the main concern i have is mostly about the security of it, because for what i know, it relies on a 3rd party to create a multisig address, right? now, what guarantee do i have that this 3rd party uses the public key i provided. and, what guarantee do i have that this address is indeed a 2/3 multisig, and not 2/4 or something else? is there any way of verifying this, and if so, how?
alright, thx! so if i want to order something from tmp or any other market that has multsig, i have to ask both the vendor and the marketplace for their public key every time?

i can confirm that the first time i moved a large amont of btc into agora i was fucking scared shitless. while follwing and coins through i saw a chunk of them coming out the other side, from my wallet to a different wallet. that scared the shit out of me, but when nothing came of that and my large amount of coins was safe, i realized that its how the tumbler works, and thats fucking awesome. i had an outgoing transaction on the blockchain from my agora wallet that was getting confirmations and everything. i didnt lose any coin, but it looked like i was getting drained for about an hour. this wasnt the case with coin transfers under $100.
well as far as missing bitcoins go i have been on agora for about a week but have not made any transactions.  i saw the link today about missing bitcoins so i decided to check it out for myself.  i first deposited a very little bitcoin to my agora wallet, and then a little more and finally the rest of what i need to make my purchase. all and all everything went ok bitcoins transfereed over in about a half hour give or take and there not missing there still in my agora wallet.
ask the next man to provide the other 2 public keys, then generate the address (will begin with 3) and see if it matches the payment address he gave you. if it doesnt he is trying to scam you. make sure he tells you what order he passed the 3 addresses in (or try all permutations yourself).you can generate the addresses in electrum or bitcoind.
i have pushed 2.0 btcs through to escrow with no issues recently, showed up in about an hour. not to say that will happen like that ever-time would be nice thought to have a legit up front market.

quote from: fromage on february 24, 2014, 06:17:59 pmalright, thx! so if i want to order something from tmp or any other market that has multsig, i have to ask both the vendor and the marketplace for their public key every time?yes, technically you could. but it really would not make much sense. by using the old system of escrow, you are putting trust that the server is going to pay out the money to the seller or refund it to you if there is  a dispute. in this case, you are just placing trust that the server is creating a multisignature address that is releasable to either you or the seller. if you intend on paying for your item, then what concerns do you have? requesting the public keys of the seller and server seems pointless, since it is the seller who would end up getting the funds. and this is why you choose trustworthy markets and vendors.....
quote from: fromage on february 24, 2014, 06:32:27 pmwell if its all about trust in the end, is there any point to multisig addresses?yes, it is to stop the market from getting robbed because each transaction needs to be unlocked separately with unique keys. i suppose you could get the public keys from the seller and server but this effectively would give the buyer and seller the ability to close the deal without the server and therefore you could cut out their market fees. so this is a bad idea for the server to do this. let me just say, that there is no more risk to doing multisig than regular escrow, and in fact less risk because a 3rd party hacker cannot steal everyones money. trusting the market is a choice you need to make on your own and if you want to deal directly with the vendor, then do so outside of the market.if the market is going to give its customers the ability to close deals while cutting out their market fees, it would not be worth it for the market.

in my own case i ship firearms. i ship it in 3 pieces and ironically the receiver is the only piece thats actually illegal to ship. any handling of the gun i do with 2 pairs of gloves on. i thoroughly wipe each piece down with gun oil then a lint free cloth before putting it in a bubble mailer so no possible trace of prints. i use 3 different types of labels, different fonts with business label shipping templates. yeah im kind of anal about it..lol. the more professional you make your packages look the less likely they are to arouse suspicion. i live in a larger metropolitan city so what i do is i have a list of all the apartment complexes in a 10 mile radius. i keep track of how often i use each one. i use a fake name and simply dont put an apartment number on the return address. i take each package to a different post office each time...keeping track of which ones i go to. before walking into the post office i wipe the mailer down then bring it in holding it between my index and thumb. i swing it back and forth so people don’t wonder why i’m carrying it like that. as i’m handing it to the clerk i slide my fingers opposite each hard which gets rid of any print that might have been there. yeah…again…i’m anal..lol  with the receiver i wrap it in sticky lead tape to make it look like anything except a receiver to a gun in case it gets x-rayed. i normally throw other stuff in the packages too that are made of metal. never had one not make it.

bandcamp91, those are good points. mirage, you just repeated what i said about plastic vs mylar or foil.if you can find gloves that fit closely, there is nothing wrong with wearing 2 of them, i just dont see the need. wearing 2 gloves to me is like having robot fingers that are super clumsy. nothing they can trace will go through a cotton glove, you are only wearing it long enough to do the packing.what are other ways to stop odor from coming through? 1. put the goods in a glass jar2. put them in a tin of some sort and tape it carefully3. pack them in pvc4. pack them in abs or other odor proof plastic.any other tips?
another point i should mention is do not use plastic bags, plastic wrap, etc to stop odor. that and vac sealing do not stop odor for more than a few minutes. even triple sealing does very little and can be smelled by a human let alone a dog after 12 hours or so.use mylar at the minimum, aluminum foil bags are even better. seal them with aluminum tape found at home improvement centers world wide.>id also suggest using 2 layers of gloves. one cloth, then an external par of "nitrile" gloves, not latexthat will certainly work but no need for 2 pair of gloves. one pair of cotton will do the job, no prints will get through that. latex or nitrile will get hot as hell if you wear them for long, same with other rubber substitutes.

i think if there is a referral commission in place we should not fill the pockets of other markets. we should all join under a referral link from our favorite vendor (that is on agora and silkroad) or those who are helping this community who has suffered the most from the theft.why not use this disaster as a small positive to try to fix our marketplace rather than line the pockets of people who will use our paranoid natures as darknet dwellers as a way to profit on our misfortune.everyone has probably got an account already but if not pm me for a referral but i would much rather people change accounts to an account that gives commission to the good members of the darkweb community.

gumby is right.. fh was at ovh in france.   and, based on opdarknet logs and their owners posts on clearnet forums, im fairly confident they were using virtual isolation.and however they got caught, im fairly sure it wasnt because they incorrectly isolated their server instances.as with almost any security decision, its balancing risks and rewards.   vps-based hosting gives you the risk of being discovered by the vps provider (assuming youre doing something the provider cares about), and if the box gets hacked, itll get deanonymized.   you balance that with the awareness that a vps environment should be disposable, with nothing to tie it to its owner.  of course, you cant ensure the integrity of any of your data or onion key in that environment, so plan accordingly.hosting at home seems stupid once youre deanonymized.  but if you can effectively use physical isolation, and do it right, you are probably much more resistant to being deanonymized in the first place.   i dont think thats as crazy of an idea as people think, but you better be damned sure youre doing it right if you go that route.theres not a perfect solution.  anonymously renting a dedicated server and using a hypervisor to provide isolation is probably the best balance.
ask the next man to provide the other 2 public keys, then generate the address (will begin with 3) and see if it matches the payment address he gave you. if it doesnt he is trying to scam you. make sure he tells you what order he passed the 3 addresses in (or try all permutations yourself).you can generate the addresses in electrum or bitcoind.

quote from: flaxceed on february 23, 2014, 06:24:13 amfortunately now we can just use agora or pandora and forget about the nightmare that was sr2.yes, it there werent other options available i guess i guess i would undertand the wrenching of hair and dressing in whole cloth, wailing away at the loss of their "market place" but there are vendors at the other markets up and running and doing fines. ive been using agora for the past month and no problems yet. if it ever becomes a problem, off to use pandora, or any of te other ones around. when sr2 gets its shit together, then if folks want, they can go back to the mp. until/if that happens, for the most part  i will continue to check in at sr and if i see movement being made to fix things, then i will decide to bring my business back. doesnt have to be like jr. high school girls getting the vapors over the whole damn thing. move to another market for now. i have placed a few orders on agora and everything seems to work just fine. problems i have been seeing havent had an effect on me. right now this is my go to marketplace.
^^^ yea partial escrow is an excellent option to give vedors the piece of mind that they wont lose their ass if an escrow hack happens. bsm has gretly impressed me over the last few months. and juelz if you are running that ship, blackstallion thanks you.
quote from: fromage on february 24, 2014, 06:17:59 pmalright, thx! so if i want to order something from tmp or any other market that has multsig, i have to ask both the vendor and the marketplace for their public key every time?yes, technically you could. but it really would not make much sense. by using the old system of escrow, you are putting trust that the server is going to pay out the money to the seller or refund it to you if there is  a dispute. in this case, you are just placing trust that the server is creating a multisignature address that is releasable to either you or the seller. if you intend on paying for your item, then what concerns do you have? requesting the public keys of the seller and server seems pointless, since it is the seller who would end up getting the funds. and this is why you choose trustworthy markets and vendors.....
quote from: fromage on february 24, 2014, 06:32:27 pmwell if its all about trust in the end, is there any point to multisig addresses?yes, it is to stop the market from getting robbed because each transaction needs to be unlocked separately with unique keys. i suppose you could get the public keys from the seller and server but this effectively would give the buyer and seller the ability to close the deal without the server and therefore you could cut out their market fees. so this is a bad idea for the server to do this. let me just say, that there is no more risk to doing multisig than regular escrow, and in fact less risk because a 3rd party hacker cannot steal everyones money. trusting the market is a choice you need to make on your own and if you want to deal directly with the vendor, then do so outside of the market.if the market is going to give its customers the ability to close deals while cutting out their market fees, it would not be worth it for the market.

before i go deeper i would like everybody to really read the following clearnet article regarding javascript and tor.http://www.itworld.com/software/367979/tor-project-stop-using-windows-disable-javascript"the vulnerability was patched by mozilla in later versions of firefox, but some people may still be using the older versions of the tor browser bundle. the bundles browser, based on firefox, is specially configured to visit tor sites, which have urls that look like "http://fakenxc4qt76tg.onion/.""several tor browser bundle versions were fixed over a four-day period starting june 26. although the browser bundle will automatically check for a new version, it is possible that some users didnt upgrade, which could have put them at risk.""although unconfirmed, computer security experts have theorized the malware may have been used by law enforcement to collect information on people who browsed certain tor websites supported by a company called freedom hosting.  that hosting company is believed to be connected to a 28-year-old man, eric eoin marques. he is being held by irish authorities pending an extradition request from the u.s. on charges of distributing and promoting child pornography, according to the irish publication the independent."now..."really, switching away from windows is probably a good security move for many reasons," according to a security advisory posted monday by the tor project.""people using linux and os x were not affected, but that doesnt mean they couldnt be targeted in the future. "this wasnt the first firefox vulnerability, nor will it be the last," the tor project warned."ok, so we know that windows isnt safe. and anyone using an older version of the tor browser bundle isnt safe. moral, dump windows and/or upgrade your software! javascript is not a huge chunk of security. the fact that a site uses javascript should not be an absolute, non negotiable issue. the tor network and javascript are just tools, along with pgp, tails, pidgin, ssl, https, multi signature transactions, crypto currency and many many more that each user has at his or her disposal to stay safewhile its true our .onion site uses javascript, according to this article, so does about 90% of the websites currently running. our site is still functional even with javascript disabled. you will not have access to certain areas of the site, but your experience still should be enjoyable. we use javascript for some of the following, captcha, image/file uploading, free multi signature transaction app, posting of free classified ads, instant messaging, etc. although darknet nation does have and maintain a .onion presence we are actively working on the clearnet aspect of our movement. we are a movement. if youd like to help or contribute please feel free to visit our site and support darknet nation26a2ueoc3xxrrgs4.onion
well its not deathowl collecting for "charity", but a modest scam effort none the less.c+
in my own case i ship firearms. i ship it in 3 pieces and ironically the receiver is the only piece thats actually illegal to ship. any handling of the gun i do with 2 pairs of gloves on. i thoroughly wipe each piece down with gun oil then a lint free cloth before putting it in a bubble mailer so no possible trace of prints. i use 3 different types of labels, different fonts with business label shipping templates. yeah im kind of anal about it..lol. the more professional you make your packages look the less likely they are to arouse suspicion. i live in a larger metropolitan city so what i do is i have a list of all the apartment complexes in a 10 mile radius. i keep track of how often i use each one. i use a fake name and simply dont put an apartment number on the return address. i take each package to a different post office each time...keeping track of which ones i go to. before walking into the post office i wipe the mailer down then bring it in holding it between my index and thumb. i swing it back and forth so people don’t wonder why i’m carrying it like that. as i’m handing it to the clerk i slide my fingers opposite each hard which gets rid of any print that might have been there. yeah…again…i’m anal..lol  with the receiver i wrap it in sticky lead tape to make it look like anything except a receiver to a gun in case it gets x-rayed. i normally throw other stuff in the packages too that are made of metal. never had one not make it.
quote from: pothead on february 19, 2014, 10:23:00 pmuntil decon repays users shouldnt sr be considered a scam marketplace?or do they get a pass because they help fund this forum?i didnt realize at first you have a different market.  sr wont get a pass from the community and we are the ones that count.   the problem with making us prove it is a scam is that these admins hide their activities from us so it is impossible for us to prove anything.  so with this requirement of proof, nothing is a scam.imagine if a market takes all of our money and the admin says his dog ate the bitcoin.  that is impossible just like theft by transacion maleability but we still can not prove that a scam happened.  we can only prove that the bitcoins were not eaten / maleable.
i think op makes a valid point
i have a unique problem as someone stole my password and tried to pass themselves off as me on sr2 and i have had no help resolving this issue i created both pdxblack accounts at the same time and worked very hard to build a name that is solid on agora with almost 30,000$ in sales my first month.  the accounts had different keys but they are both mine.  i just dont want any of the shit this guy pulled to affect my name as i also have tha name on a couple other markets
bandcamp91, those are good points. mirage, you just repeated what i said about plastic vs mylar or foil.if you can find gloves that fit closely, there is nothing wrong with wearing 2 of them, i just dont see the need. wearing 2 gloves to me is like having robot fingers that are super clumsy. nothing they can trace will go through a cotton glove, you are only wearing it long enough to do the packing.what are other ways to stop odor from coming through? 1. put the goods in a glass jar2. put them in a tin of some sort and tape it carefully3. pack them in pvc4. pack them in abs or other odor proof plastic.any other tips?
another point i should mention is do not use plastic bags, plastic wrap, etc to stop odor. that and vac sealing do not stop odor for more than a few minutes. even triple sealing does very little and can be smelled by a human let alone a dog after 12 hours or so.use mylar at the minimum, aluminum foil bags are even better. seal them with aluminum tape found at home improvement centers world wide.>id also suggest using 2 layers of gloves. one cloth, then an external par of "nitrile" gloves, not latexthat will certainly work but no need for 2 pair of gloves. one pair of cotton will do the job, no prints will get through that. latex or nitrile will get hot as hell if you wear them for long, same with other rubber substitutes.

i think if there is a referral commission in place we should not fill the pockets of other markets. we should all join under a referral link from our favorite vendor (that is on agora and silkroad) or those who are helping this community who has suffered the most from the theft.why not use this disaster as a small positive to try to fix our marketplace rather than line the pockets of people who will use our paranoid natures as darknet dwellers as a way to profit on our misfortune.everyone has probably got an account already but if not pm me for a referral but i would much rather people change accounts to an account that gives commission to the good members of the darkweb community.

joint statement regarding the insolvency of mt.goxthe purpose of this document is to summarize a joint statement to the bitcoin community regarding the insolvency of mt.gox.this tragic violation of the trust of users of mt.gox was the result of one company’s abhorrent actions and does not reflect the resilience or value of bitcoin and the digital currency industry. there are hundreds of trustworthy and responsible companies involved in bitcoin. these companies will continue to build the future of money by making bitcoin more secure and easy to use for consumers and merchants. as with any new industry, there are certain bad actors that need to be weeded out, and that is what we are seeing today.we are confident, however, that strong bitcoin companies, led by highly competent teams and backed by credible investors, will continue to thrive, and to fulfill the promise that bitcoin offers as the future of payment in the internet age.in order to re-establish the trust squandered by the failings of mt. gox, responsible bitcoin exchanges are working together and are committed to the future of bitcoin and the security of all customer funds. as part of the effort to re-assure customers, the following exchanges will be coordinating efforts over the coming days to publicly reassure customers and the general public that all funds continue to be held in a safe and secure manner: coinbase, kraken, bitstamp, circle, and btc china.we strongly believe in transparent, thoughtful, and comprehensive consumer protection measures. we pledge to lead the way.bitcoin operators, whether they be exchanges, wallet services or payment providers, play a critical custodial role over the bitcoin they hold as assets for their customers. acting as a custodian should require a high-bar, including appropriate security safeguards that are independently audited and tested on a regular basis, adequate balance sheets and reserves as commercial entities, transparent and accountable customer disclosures, and clear policies to not use customer assets for proprietary trading or for margin loans in leveraged trading. it does not appear to any of us that mtgox followed any these essential requirements as a financial services provider.the following industry leaders stand by this statement:fred ehrsam — co-founder of coinbasejesse powell — ceo of krakennejc kodri? — ceo of bitstamp.netbobby lee — ceo of btc chinanicolas cary — ceo of blockchain.infojeremy allaire — ceo of circle

the markets were controlling the funds 100% and getting robbed and cleaned out on several occasions. people were placing trust in markets before and now suddenly you are worried about getting scammed? where were you speaking out with the old escrow system?quote from: ronin on february 25, 2014, 02:29:28 pm2) also it makes no sense for the market to hide this, if the buyer/seller wanted to avoid fees they could set up their own 2/2 escrow. also in the situation jolly roger describes above the buyer could sign a transaction sending all funds to vendor, and then vendor verifies and also signs the transaction. funds released, market bypassed. the market is not protected in 2/3.#2) yes, they (buyer and seller) could set up their own 2/2 escrow outside the market, but this would be stupid because having a 2/3 makes it possible for the market to become the arbitrator. in a 2/2, only one of the people involved has to be a scammer, and then the funds are locked forever. with 2/3, if the buyer tries to scam, then the market can provide the second key to unlock the funds to send to the seller. this is why 2/3 is better than 2/2. also in the case of 2/3, the market cannot be bypassed without the redeemscript generated at the time that the multisignature address is created. if the market holds the redeemscript in a 2/3 multisignature address, then the buyer and seller cannot complete the transaction on the side without the market and therefore cut out the markets fees. another security issue with releasing all 3 public keys involved is that it lets the participants know whether or not the seller, buyer, or server are reusing a private key and therefore making them more susceptible to attacks.quote from: ronin on february 25, 2014, 02:29:28 pm3) the market would rely on getting income through signing a transaction which sends most funds to vendor, and commision to market. this would then be signed by the buyer when he is happy. if the buyer starts bypassing the market fee transaction then he is banned. but to hide it all away from the user and not give them the ability to be able to verify addresses, avoid this market set up. its not healthy. #3) it is harder to verify you might think to see if the buyer and seller are closing the deal on the side. unless the market is constantly searching through the blockchain for funds spent from that multisignature address, it would be extremely difficult to verify that a buyer and seller are bypassing the market to cut out their fees. quote from: ronin on february 25, 2014, 02:29:28 pmi would warn anyone away from the setup jolly roger is promoting. will lead to more scams in the future, and it will not allow you to verify multi sig is setup correctly.so what you are basically saying here is that the market should trust the buyers, but the buyers should not trust the market. the market has every incentive to keep the ability to unlock funds itself out of its own hands, so that it is not a target for hackers. if the market has the ability to unlock the funds without any buyer or seller input, it would make the market very dangerous and this is not desirable and defeats the purpose of it for the markets. but giving out the 3 keys and the redeemscript to the buyer and seller gives them the ability to close the deal outside the market and bypass fees. again, if you are not able to trust your market, then yes, contact the seller and say you want to do a 2/2 with your seller outside of the market, and you can easily set one up. but with fees at an average of 5%, bypassing the fees will become more common than you think and is harder to detect than you think. especially when you are dealing with thousands of transactions.ronin, i understand what you are saying and you make a valid point that it would likely be desirable for a buyer to have this setup. but it is not desireable for a market to have this setup, since the market relies on market fees and by giving your customers the ability to cut you out of the deal is bad for business. there are plenty of free 2/2 and 2/3 multisignature services out there now that you can use. if you are not comfortable using the markets system, then use another one that gives you the 3 public keys. but if you expect the markets to start giving you the ability to bypass their commissions, then you will likely never be happy. i do not think it makes sense for markets to do this. the cost of running a market is high and by allowing your buyers to not "pay their taxes" so to speak, is a dumb move for the market. again, i reiterate. if you do not trust your market, do a 2/2 or a 2/3 outside of the market. you make the choice.

i am not entirely sure about the structure of the pgp key, but i can tell you that if i put both of those keys into a text document and try to import both of them, only one key will be inputted into my keyring, not two. meaning that those two keys are related to the same private key. again, i am not sure why the last 4 bytes changed, but if you are worried about it, take an old message sent to you that worked with your old key and try and decrypt it. if it works, there is nothing wrong with your key. i think nightcrawler is the expert on this though.
im seriously ready for it to die... its seriously screwing the market up across the board and its making bitcoins look shady as fuck in general !! and  since the guy is like one of the founding fathers of some bull shit organzation, he can just pull everyone along  for the ride like he has done, but i think its finally over. and for everyone that lost money im sorry! really sorry its total bullshit!
the problem has nothing to do with pgp. safe mail doesnt provide pop access to free accounts. you have to pay for the account to get pop access. thats why you cant login with thunderbird.
lets do it.the first step is to get 3 people to exchange bitcoin pubkeys so they can generate the same address and confirm that the one provided by the escrow agent isnt fake.
admin ran of with the coins... twice... why would you even consider putting more coins in?
silk road is obviously not defunct as people are still trading there. there is no such board as a "scam marketplace area" on the hub and, even if there were, that market (despite increasing suspicions) has still not been proven to be a scam.
are the deals still going on?  i may be interested in some of the hydros and klonopin.  always been favorites of mine!

if you are only sending an address you dont need to give them your key. you only need to give them your key when they are going to send you an encrpyted messege. when you send someone an encrypted messege, it is encrypted with their key, not yours.

bankruptcy guaranteed.
mtgox is a real business and the owners identities are known, this isnt like the deepweb. can they really say everyones coins are safe then close their doors and never give them back> not to mention people put real money into the site. can they really get away with that?i know there is no laws around running a bitcoin exchange. but that shouldnt mean they can just blatantly lie and rob everyone.
once it finally dies, the market will be more stable.  they were causing price fluctuations that made it more difficult to do business.

joint statement regarding the insolvency of mt.goxthe purpose of this document is to summarize a joint statement to the bitcoin community regarding the insolvency of mt.gox.this tragic violation of the trust of users of mt.gox was the result of one company’s abhorrent actions and does not reflect the resilience or value of bitcoin and the digital currency industry. there are hundreds of trustworthy and responsible companies involved in bitcoin. these companies will continue to build the future of money by making bitcoin more secure and easy to use for consumers and merchants. as with any new industry, there are certain bad actors that need to be weeded out, and that is what we are seeing today.we are confident, however, that strong bitcoin companies, led by highly competent teams and backed by credible investors, will continue to thrive, and to fulfill the promise that bitcoin offers as the future of payment in the internet age.in order to re-establish the trust squandered by the failings of mt. gox, responsible bitcoin exchanges are working together and are committed to the future of bitcoin and the security of all customer funds. as part of the effort to re-assure customers, the following exchanges will be coordinating efforts over the coming days to publicly reassure customers and the general public that all funds continue to be held in a safe and secure manner: coinbase, kraken, bitstamp, circle, and btc china.we strongly believe in transparent, thoughtful, and comprehensive consumer protection measures. we pledge to lead the way.bitcoin operators, whether they be exchanges, wallet services or payment providers, play a critical custodial role over the bitcoin they hold as assets for their customers. acting as a custodian should require a high-bar, including appropriate security safeguards that are independently audited and tested on a regular basis, adequate balance sheets and reserves as commercial entities, transparent and accountable customer disclosures, and clear policies to not use customer assets for proprietary trading or for margin loans in leveraged trading. it does not appear to any of us that mtgox followed any these essential requirements as a financial services provider.the following industry leaders stand by this statement:fred ehrsam — co-founder of coinbasejesse powell — ceo of krakennejc kodri? — ceo of bitstamp.netbobby lee — ceo of btc chinanicolas cary — ceo of blockchain.infojeremy allaire — ceo of circle
lets hope gox has finally goxed itself it needs to die

wow, well i have 3 things to say about this.1. first and foremost whyusheep you are a fucking scumbag. stealing all the coins wouldnt even have been as bad as putting 5 men in jail by cooperating with le. god i hope there is some nerdy thug in prison who slices you neck for being a snitch, you are the lowest for of scum on earth. i dont know whether to believe you or not, but if you are telling the truth. i hope you die slowly and take satans pitchfork up your ass, all 3 prongs. triple penetration. you bitch.2. whoever ordered the hit using the market was an idiot major. come on, after ross? you couldnt do some better homework? getting a hitman would be very easy if you had the correct doxx, just find a h junkie down on his luck and lace him with 15btc and some #4 and you would be straight. man i have no sympathy for that, though i wouldnt mind the snitch being executed.3. no wya that was blackopy. no way he got doxxed that easy. nd they would have found more cash then that.
so,. . . . .   is it safe to make a purchase or what?i dont want some vendor griping about not getting his money and not delivering my product because of another escrow issue.   good god.
would about a mavericks 10.9.1 macbook on a usb would that work?
what is going on with pandora?  jeez, it is slow as fuck.  agora is as fast as always.  now assuming that both saw a crush of new users as sr2 has fizzled, is it fair to say that agora had the better infrastructure in place and was ready to grow, and pandora was not?  i dont see how pandora can remain viable if it takes 5 minutes to load every time you click, and then half the time it comes up with an error.

admin ran of with the coins... twice... why would you even consider putting more coins in?
gets confusing due to the space or lack of but.....uk pharma was a 100% seller on sr1 & bmr (sr1 vendor for 1+ year 100% - trusted benzo seller)is not ukpharma that was on bmr!! (note the spacing)uk pharma (the good one) is now ukpharma on agora. (has to omit the space due to agora names not allowing spaces)just read his feedback & youll see.potential buyers should always go by the feedback + the logo uk pharma has been using for 1.5years!
thanks for the replys ive got it nowthanks dave
im seriously ready for it to die... its seriously screwing the market up across the board and its making bitcoins look shady as fuck in general !! and  since the guy is like one of the founding fathers of some bull shit organzation, he can just pull everyone along  for the ride like he has done, but i think its finally over. and for everyone that lost money im sorry! really sorry its total bullshit!

hey, i need alot of help setting up tails on snow leopard (osx 10.6.8.)im just as the stage where i need to verify the .iso file, and i cant do it for the life of me... i cant barely use terminal... -.-is anyone able to help? thanks in advance !
quote from: mirage on february 25, 2014, 10:55:37 pmhmm? then funny how i (and many others) are running tails on our macbooks?peacemiragewell then you are a lucky sum-bitch.  i guess it only works on snow leapard because i promise you it doesnt work on mountain lion.
well ive pretty much given up at this point... its really advanced stuff and my tech knowledge and skills sort of dont go that far.mirage: ive only been able to download the required files.. the .iso file and another one, and the tailssigning.key one used to verify the .iso. the tails-signing.key when i download it is a zipped file, which i cant unzip (error-corrupt file/file format not supported), so when i try import it on terminal it doesnt work. i dont know what to do at this stage, and this is like the first freaking step.also, apparently you need refit or whatever, which i dont have... also buying anything at this point isnt rly ideal, so i dunno.. i just might look into it.. maybe ill try upgrade to a more recent osx (i have snow leopard 10.6.8.)

quote from: jolly roger on february 24, 2014, 07:18:22 pmquote from: fromage on february 24, 2014, 06:32:27 pmwell if its all about trust in the end, is there any point to multisig addresses?yes, it is to stop the market from getting robbed because each transaction needs to be unlocked separately with unique keys. i suppose you could get the public keys from the seller and server but this effectively would give the buyer and seller the ability to close the deal without the server and therefore you could cut out their market fees. so this is a bad idea for the server to do this. let me just say, that there is no more risk to doing multisig than regular escrow, and in fact less risk because a 3rd party hacker cannot steal everyones money. trusting the market is a choice you need to make on your own and if you want to deal directly with the vendor, then do so outside of the market.if the market is going to give its customers the ability to close deals while cutting out their market fees, it would not be worth it for the market.i have to disagree with this guyif the server doesnt give you the opportunity to verify the address then its not worth it. they could give you a multi sig that is 2/2 with addresses both controlled by the market. this opens you up to obvious scams. dont fall for what he is proposing. verify the address and protect yourself from scams.also it makes no sense for the market to hide this, if the buyer/seller wanted to avoid fees they could set up their own 2/2 escrow. also in the situation jolly roger describes above the buyer could sign a transaction sending all funds to vendor, and then vendor verifies and also signs the transaction. funds released, market bypassed. the market is not protected in 2/3.the market would rely on getting income through signing a transaction which sends most funds to vendor, and commision to market. this would then be signed by the buyer when he is happy. if the buyer starts bypassing the market fee transaction then he is banned. but to hide it all away from the user and not give them the ability to be able to verify addresses, avoid this market set up. its not healthy. i would warn anyone away from the setup jolly roger is promoting. will lead to more scams in the future, and it will not allow you to verify multi sig is setup correctly.
quote from: ronin on february 25, 2014, 02:29:28 pmi have to disagree with this guy1) if the server doesnt give you the opportunity to verify the address then its not worth it. they could give you a multi sig that is 2/2 with addresses both controlled by the market. this opens you up to obvious scams. dont fall for what he is proposing. verify the address and protect yourself from scams.excuse me. first of all, your accusations about me are very offensive. accusing me that i am trying to get you all to "fall for something". and i do not think you completely understand the entire process of multisignature addresses to make the claims you are making. #1) how is this any more risky than the escrow system that markets had before? the markets were controlling the funds 100% and getting robbed and cleaned out on several occasions. people were placing trust in markets before and now suddenly you are worried about getting scammed? where were you speaking out with the old escrow system?quote from: ronin on february 25, 2014, 02:29:28 pm2) also it makes no sense for the market to hide this, if the buyer/seller wanted to avoid fees they could set up their own 2/2 escrow. also in the situation jolly roger describes above the buyer could sign a transaction sending all funds to vendor, and then vendor verifies and also signs the transaction. funds released, market bypassed. the market is not protected in 2/3.#2) yes, they (buyer and seller) could set up their own 2/2 escrow outside the market, but this would be stupid because having a 2/3 makes it possible for the market to become the arbitrator. in a 2/2, only one of the people involved has to be a scammer, and then the funds are locked forever. with 2/3, if the buyer tries to scam, then the market can provide the second key to unlock the funds to send to the seller. this is why 2/3 is better than 2/2. also in the case of 2/3, the market cannot be bypassed without the redeemscript generated at the time that the multisignature address is created. if the market holds the redeemscript in a 2/3 multisignature address, then the buyer and seller cannot complete the transaction on the side without the market and therefore cut out the markets fees. another security issue with releasing all 3 public keys involved is that it lets the participants know whether or not the seller, buyer, or server are reusing a private key and therefore making them more susceptible to attacks.quote from: ronin on february 25, 2014, 02:29:28 pm3) the market would rely on getting income through signing a transaction which sends most funds to vendor, and commision to market. this would then be signed by the buyer when he is happy. if the buyer starts bypassing the market fee transaction then he is banned. but to hide it all away from the user and not give them the ability to be able to verify addresses, avoid this market set up. its not healthy. #3) it is harder to verify you might think to see if the buyer and seller are closing the deal on the side. unless the market is constantly searching through the blockchain for funds spent from that multisignature address, it would be extremely difficult to verify that a buyer and seller are bypassing the market to cut out their fees. quote from: ronin on february 25, 2014, 02:29:28 pmi would warn anyone away from the setup jolly roger is promoting. will lead to more scams in the future, and it will not allow you to verify multi sig is setup correctly.so what you are basically saying here is that the market should trust the buyers, but the buyers should not trust the market. the market has every incentive to keep the ability to unlock funds itself out of its own hands, so that it is not a target for hackers. if the market has the ability to unlock the funds without any buyer or seller input, it would make the market very dangerous and this is not desirable and defeats the purpose of it for the markets. but giving out the 3 keys and the redeemscript to the buyer and seller gives them the ability to close the deal outside the market and bypass fees. again, if you are not able to trust your market, then yes, contact the seller and say you want to do a 2/2 with your seller outside of the market, and you can easily set one up. but with fees at an average of 5%, bypassing the fees will become more common than you think and is harder to detect than you think. especially when you are dealing with thousands of transactions.ronin, i understand what you are saying and you make a valid point that it would likely be desirable for a buyer to have this setup. but it is not desireable for a market to have this setup, since the market relies on market fees and by giving your customers the ability to cut you out of the deal is bad for business. there are plenty of free 2/2 and 2/3 multisignature services out there now that you can use. if you are not comfortable using the markets system, then use another one that gives you the 3 public keys. but if you expect the markets to start giving you the ability to bypass their commissions, then you will likely never be happy. i do not think it makes sense for markets to do this. the cost of running a market is high and by allowing your buyers to not "pay their taxes" so to speak, is a dumb move for the market. again, i reiterate. if you do not trust your market, do a 2/2 or a 2/3 outside of the market. you make the choice.

if you are only sending an address you dont need to give them your key. you only need to give them your key when they are going to send you an encrpyted messege. when you send someone an encrypted messege, it is encrypted with their key, not yours.

0.0001 works fine for one-to-one transactions. there is no confirmation delay. for transactions involving many addresses (like consolidation transactions) you may need to pay 0.001 or even 0.0015. the blond wig-qt client conveniently informs you of this.
shared knowledge works well for authentication. for your most trusted associates or darknet friends you should reserve secret phrases in case you need to disappear for a while, wipe your hard drive, or pop up on a new forum. a short phrase or song lyric may contain only 20 bits of information but it works remarkably well when an attacker cant brute force it. he has one chance to get it right.
wow, well i have 3 things to say about this.1. first and foremost whyusheep you are a fucking scumbag. stealing all the coins wouldnt even have been as bad as putting 5 men in jail by cooperating with le. god i hope there is some nerdy thug in prison who slices you neck for being a snitch, you are the lowest for of scum on earth. i dont know whether to believe you or not, but if you are telling the truth. i hope you die slowly and take satans pitchfork up your ass, all 3 prongs. triple penetration. you bitch.2. whoever ordered the hit using the market was an idiot major. come on, after ross? you couldnt do some better homework? getting a hitman would be very easy if you had the correct doxx, just find a h junkie down on his luck and lace him with 15btc and some #4 and you would be straight. man i have no sympathy for that, though i wouldnt mind the snitch being executed.3. no wya that was blackopy. no way he got doxxed that easy. nd they would have found more cash then that.

joint statement regarding the insolvency of mt.goxthe purpose of this document is to summarize a joint statement to the bitcoin community regarding the insolvency of mt.gox.this tragic violation of the trust of users of mt.gox was the result of one company’s abhorrent actions and does not reflect the resilience or value of bitcoin and the digital currency industry. there are hundreds of trustworthy and responsible companies involved in bitcoin. these companies will continue to build the future of money by making bitcoin more secure and easy to use for consumers and merchants. as with any new industry, there are certain bad actors that need to be weeded out, and that is what we are seeing today.we are confident, however, that strong bitcoin companies, led by highly competent teams and backed by credible investors, will continue to thrive, and to fulfill the promise that bitcoin offers as the future of payment in the internet age.in order to re-establish the trust squandered by the failings of mt. gox, responsible bitcoin exchanges are working together and are committed to the future of bitcoin and the security of all customer funds. as part of the effort to re-assure customers, the following exchanges will be coordinating efforts over the coming days to publicly reassure customers and the general public that all funds continue to be held in a safe and secure manner: coinbase, kraken, bitstamp, circle, and btc china.we strongly believe in transparent, thoughtful, and comprehensive consumer protection measures. we pledge to lead the way.bitcoin operators, whether they be exchanges, wallet services or payment providers, play a critical custodial role over the bitcoin they hold as assets for their customers. acting as a custodian should require a high-bar, including appropriate security safeguards that are independently audited and tested on a regular basis, adequate balance sheets and reserves as commercial entities, transparent and accountable customer disclosures, and clear policies to not use customer assets for proprietary trading or for margin loans in leveraged trading. it does not appear to any of us that mtgox followed any these essential requirements as a financial services provider.the following industry leaders stand by this statement:fred ehrsam — co-founder of coinbasejesse powell — ceo of krakennejc kodri? — ceo of bitstamp.netbobby lee — ceo of btc chinanicolas cary — ceo of blockchain.infojeremy allaire — ceo of circle

quote from: magicflight on february 22, 2014, 06:47:54 amyou arent wrong! so ive set up a fresh copy on a partition, installed tor, truecrypt and pgp. are there any more security measures i can be taking?there are many more security measures you *could* be taking. grab a router or raspberry pi and configure an anonymizing middle box with portal or corridor or whonix gateway. use virtual machines to isolate apps from each other. get a second (offline) computer for air gapped pgp. get a third computer for air gapped btc cold storage. encrypt and backup your blond wig wallets in at least 3 places.if you want to get really adventurous, you could roll your own hardened gentoo with the grsecurity and tresor kernel patches. i dont know why qubes isnt based on hardened gentoo. fedora was an odd choice of base operating system.in any case, you probably dont need to do all that unless you are a major vendor.
the problem has nothing to do with pgp. safe mail doesnt provide pop access to free accounts. you have to pay for the account to get pop access. thats why you cant login with thunderbird.

gets confusing due to the space or lack of but.....uk pharma was a 100% seller on sr1 & bmr (sr1 vendor for 1+ year 100% - trusted benzo seller)is not ukpharma that was on bmr!! (note the spacing)uk pharma (the good one) is now ukpharma on agora. (has to omit the space due to agora names not allowing spaces)just read his feedback & youll see.potential buyers should always go by the feedback + the logo uk pharma has been using for 1.5years!

quote from: whom on february 23, 2014, 05:30:54 pm...there are three huge problems with vps hosting for hidden services:...3. when someone exploits the vps-provider console/management interface, they have root on your vps instance - this one happens fairly often.  someone exploits a bug in solusvm or another vps-provider management console and gets control over every vps box in their environment.  including yours.a better solution is a rented, dedicated server, running xen or another hypervisor, and using the hypervisor to isolate the server (actually providing the http or other service) from the tor instance that advertises the .onion address:servervm->(private virtual network)->torvm->(internet)in that scenario, when someone pwns the servervm, they cant deanonymize it by sending arbitrary traffic out.. theyre stuck behind the torvm and can only send traffic via tor.  to deanonymize the servervm effectively, they need to exploit the hypervisor first.   in that architecture, the torvm should only be allowed to send in/out the tor traffic.  the hypervisor probably shouldnt even really be on a public network, except to bridge traffic to the torvm, and damned sure shouldnt accept arbitrary traffic from the internet itself.please elaborate on the hypervisor use case if possible, references to detailed example documentation most appreciated.is it safe to assume the torvm is comprised of a barebones installation with iptables dropping everything but tor traffic?
ok so i thought id mastered pgp but im not sure.basically i put their key in gpa, sign keys, set owner trust, send keys.  go to clipboard, write address, encrypt.then, i put my key and and the encrypted message into the address box.but occasionally i get messages from vendors saying "you gave me the key by mistake" even though i put the key and then the encrypted message underneath.  am i not supposed to do this?

if you are sending someone a message encrypted with their public key, the usual and proper way to give the recipient your own public key is to paste your public key in your message at the end before you encrypt, like so - axa-----begin pgp public key block-----version: gnupg v1.4.15 (mingw32)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=dhz8-----end pgp public key block-----

mtgox is a real business and the owners identities are known, this isnt like the deepweb. can they really say everyones coins are safe then close their doors and never give them back> not to mention people put real money into the site. can they really get away with that?i know there is no laws around running a bitcoin exchange. but that shouldnt mean they can just blatantly lie and rob everyone.
once it finally dies, the market will be more stable.  they were causing price fluctuations that made it more difficult to do business.

i am not entirely sure about the structure of the pgp key, but i can tell you that if i put both of those keys into a text document and try to import both of them, only one key will be inputted into my keyring, not two. meaning that those two keys are related to the same private key. again, i am not sure why the last 4 bytes changed, but if you are worried about it, take an old message sent to you that worked with your old key and try and decrypt it. if it works, there is nothing wrong with your key. i think nightcrawler is the expert on this though.
quote from: whom on february 23, 2014, 05:30:54 pm...there are three huge problems with vps hosting for hidden services:...3. when someone exploits the vps-provider console/management interface, they have root on your vps instance - this one happens fairly often.  someone exploits a bug in solusvm or another vps-provider management console and gets control over every vps box in their environment.  including yours.a better solution is a rented, dedicated server, running xen or another hypervisor, and using the hypervisor to isolate the server (actually providing the http or other service) from the tor instance that advertises the .onion address:servervm->(private virtual network)->torvm->(internet)in that scenario, when someone pwns the servervm, they cant deanonymize it by sending arbitrary traffic out.. theyre stuck behind the torvm and can only send traffic via tor.  to deanonymize the servervm effectively, they need to exploit the hypervisor first.   in that architecture, the torvm should only be allowed to send in/out the tor traffic.  the hypervisor probably shouldnt even really be on a public network, except to bridge traffic to the torvm, and damned sure shouldnt accept arbitrary traffic from the internet itself.please elaborate on the hypervisor use case if possible, references to detailed example documentation most appreciated.is it safe to assume the torvm is comprised of a barebones installation with iptables dropping everything but tor traffic?

let's do it.the first step is to get 3 people to exchange bitcoin pubkeys so they can generate the same address and confirm that the one provided by the escrow agent isn't fake.
the problem has nothing to do with pgp. safe mail doesn't provide pop access to free accounts. you have to pay for the account to get pop access. that's why you can't login with thunderbird.
shared knowledge works well for authentication. for your most trusted associates or darknet friends you should reserve secret phrases in case you need to disappear for a while, wipe your hard drive, or pop up on a new forum. a short phrase or song lyric may contain only 20 bits of information but it works remarkably well when an attacker can't brute force it. he has one chance to get it right.

gets confusing due to the space or lack of but.....uk pharma was a 100% seller on sr1 & bmr (sr1 vendor for 1+ year 100% - trusted benzo seller)is not ukpharma that was on bmr!! (note the spacing)uk pharma (the good one) is now ukpharma on agora. (has to omit the space due to agora names not allowing spaces)just read his feedback & youll see.potential buyers should always go by the feedback + the logo uk pharma has been using for 1.5years!
thanks for the replys ive got it nowthanks dave
im seriously ready for it to die... its seriously screwing the market up across the board and its making bitcoins look shady as fuck in general !! and  since the guy is like one of the founding fathers of some bull shit organzation, he can just pull everyone along  for the ride like he has done, but i think its finally over. and for everyone that lost money im sorry! really sorry its total bullshit!

hey, i need alot of help setting up tails on snow leopard (osx 10.6.8.)im just as the stage where i need to verify the .iso file, and i cant do it for the life of me... i cant barely use terminal... -.-is anyone able to help? thanks in advance !
quote from: mirage on february 25, 2014, 10:55:37 pmhmm? then funny how i (and many others) are running tails on our macbooks?peacemiragewell then you are a lucky sum-bitch.  i guess it only works on snow leapard because i promise you it doesnt work on mountain lion.
well ive pretty much given up at this point... its really advanced stuff and my tech knowledge and skills sort of dont go that far.mirage: ive only been able to download the required files.. the .iso file and another one, and the tailssigning.key one used to verify the .iso. the tails-signing.key when i download it is a zipped file, which i cant unzip (error-corrupt file/file format not supported), so when i try import it on terminal it doesnt work. i dont know what to do at this stage, and this is like the first freaking step.also, apparently you need refit or whatever, which i dont have... also buying anything at this point isnt rly ideal, so i dunno.. i just might look into it.. maybe ill try upgrade to a more recent osx (i have snow leopard 10.6.8.)

quote from: jolly roger on february 24, 2014, 07:18:22 pmquote from: fromage on february 24, 2014, 06:32:27 pmwell if its all about trust in the end, is there any point to multisig addresses?yes, it is to stop the market from getting robbed because each transaction needs to be unlocked separately with unique keys. i suppose you could get the public keys from the seller and server but this effectively would give the buyer and seller the ability to close the deal without the server and therefore you could cut out their market fees. so this is a bad idea for the server to do this. let me just say, that there is no more risk to doing multisig than regular escrow, and in fact less risk because a 3rd party hacker cannot steal everyones money. trusting the market is a choice you need to make on your own and if you want to deal directly with the vendor, then do so outside of the market.if the market is going to give its customers the ability to close deals while cutting out their market fees, it would not be worth it for the market.i have to disagree with this guyif the server doesnt give you the opportunity to verify the address then its not worth it. they could give you a multi sig that is 2/2 with addresses both controlled by the market. this opens you up to obvious scams. dont fall for what he is proposing. verify the address and protect yourself from scams.also it makes no sense for the market to hide this, if the buyer/seller wanted to avoid fees they could set up their own 2/2 escrow. also in the situation jolly roger describes above the buyer could sign a transaction sending all funds to vendor, and then vendor verifies and also signs the transaction. funds released, market bypassed. the market is not protected in 2/3.the market would rely on getting income through signing a transaction which sends most funds to vendor, and commision to market. this would then be signed by the buyer when he is happy. if the buyer starts bypassing the market fee transaction then he is banned. but to hide it all away from the user and not give them the ability to be able to verify addresses, avoid this market set up. its not healthy. i would warn anyone away from the setup jolly roger is promoting. will lead to more scams in the future, and it will not allow you to verify multi sig is setup correctly.
quote from: ronin on february 25, 2014, 02:29:28 pmi have to disagree with this guy1) if the server doesnt give you the opportunity to verify the address then its not worth it. they could give you a multi sig that is 2/2 with addresses both controlled by the market. this opens you up to obvious scams. dont fall for what he is proposing. verify the address and protect yourself from scams.excuse me. first of all, your accusations about me are very offensive. accusing me that i am trying to get you all to "fall for something". and i do not think you completely understand the entire process of multisignature addresses to make the claims you are making. #1) how is this any more risky than the escrow system that markets had before? the markets were controlling the funds 100% and getting robbed and cleaned out on several occasions. people were placing trust in markets before and now suddenly you are worried about getting scammed? where were you speaking out with the old escrow system?quote from: ronin on february 25, 2014, 02:29:28 pm2) also it makes no sense for the market to hide this, if the buyer/seller wanted to avoid fees they could set up their own 2/2 escrow. also in the situation jolly roger describes above the buyer could sign a transaction sending all funds to vendor, and then vendor verifies and also signs the transaction. funds released, market bypassed. the market is not protected in 2/3.#2) yes, they (buyer and seller) could set up their own 2/2 escrow outside the market, but this would be stupid because having a 2/3 makes it possible for the market to become the arbitrator. in a 2/2, only one of the people involved has to be a scammer, and then the funds are locked forever. with 2/3, if the buyer tries to scam, then the market can provide the second key to unlock the funds to send to the seller. this is why 2/3 is better than 2/2. also in the case of 2/3, the market cannot be bypassed without the redeemscript generated at the time that the multisignature address is created. if the market holds the redeemscript in a 2/3 multisignature address, then the buyer and seller cannot complete the transaction on the side without the market and therefore cut out the markets fees. another security issue with releasing all 3 public keys involved is that it lets the participants know whether or not the seller, buyer, or server are reusing a private key and therefore making them more susceptible to attacks.quote from: ronin on february 25, 2014, 02:29:28 pm3) the market would rely on getting income through signing a transaction which sends most funds to vendor, and commision to market. this would then be signed by the buyer when he is happy. if the buyer starts bypassing the market fee transaction then he is banned. but to hide it all away from the user and not give them the ability to be able to verify addresses, avoid this market set up. its not healthy. #3) it is harder to verify you might think to see if the buyer and seller are closing the deal on the side. unless the market is constantly searching through the blockchain for funds spent from that multisignature address, it would be extremely difficult to verify that a buyer and seller are bypassing the market to cut out their fees. quote from: ronin on february 25, 2014, 02:29:28 pmi would warn anyone away from the setup jolly roger is promoting. will lead to more scams in the future, and it will not allow you to verify multi sig is setup correctly.so what you are basically saying here is that the market should trust the buyers, but the buyers should not trust the market. the market has every incentive to keep the ability to unlock funds itself out of its own hands, so that it is not a target for hackers. if the market has the ability to unlock the funds without any buyer or seller input, it would make the market very dangerous and this is not desirable and defeats the purpose of it for the markets. but giving out the 3 keys and the redeemscript to the buyer and seller gives them the ability to close the deal outside the market and bypass fees. again, if you are not able to trust your market, then yes, contact the seller and say you want to do a 2/2 with your seller outside of the market, and you can easily set one up. but with fees at an average of 5%, bypassing the fees will become more common than you think and is harder to detect than you think. especially when you are dealing with thousands of transactions.ronin, i understand what you are saying and you make a valid point that it would likely be desirable for a buyer to have this setup. but it is not desireable for a market to have this setup, since the market relies on market fees and by giving your customers the ability to cut you out of the deal is bad for business. there are plenty of free 2/2 and 2/3 multisignature services out there now that you can use. if you are not comfortable using the markets system, then use another one that gives you the 3 public keys. but if you expect the markets to start giving you the ability to bypass their commissions, then you will likely never be happy. i do not think it makes sense for markets to do this. the cost of running a market is high and by allowing your buyers to not "pay their taxes" so to speak, is a dumb move for the market. again, i reiterate. if you do not trust your market, do a 2/2 or a 2/3 outside of the market. you make the choice.

if you are only sending an address you dont need to give them your key. you only need to give them your key when they are going to send you an encrpyted messege. when you send someone an encrypted messege, it is encrypted with their key, not yours.

lets hope gox has finally goxed itself it needs to die
joint statement regarding the insolvency of mt.goxthe purpose of this document is to summarize a joint statement to the bitcoin community regarding the insolvency of mt.gox.this tragic violation of the trust of users of mt.gox was the result of one company’s abhorrent actions and does not reflect the resilience or value of bitcoin and the digital currency industry. there are hundreds of trustworthy and responsible companies involved in bitcoin. these companies will continue to build the future of money by making bitcoin more secure and easy to use for consumers and merchants. as with any new industry, there are certain bad actors that need to be weeded out, and that is what we are seeing today.we are confident, however, that strong bitcoin companies, led by highly competent teams and backed by credible investors, will continue to thrive, and to fulfill the promise that bitcoin offers as the future of payment in the internet age.in order to re-establish the trust squandered by the failings of mt. gox, responsible bitcoin exchanges are working together and are committed to the future of bitcoin and the security of all customer funds. as part of the effort to re-assure customers, the following exchanges will be coordinating efforts over the coming days to publicly reassure customers and the general public that all funds continue to be held in a safe and secure manner: coinbase, kraken, bitstamp, circle, and btc china.we strongly believe in transparent, thoughtful, and comprehensive consumer protection measures. we pledge to lead the way.bitcoin operators, whether they be exchanges, wallet services or payment providers, play a critical custodial role over the bitcoin they hold as assets for their customers. acting as a custodian should require a high-bar, including appropriate security safeguards that are independently audited and tested on a regular basis, adequate balance sheets and reserves as commercial entities, transparent and accountable customer disclosures, and clear policies to not use customer assets for proprietary trading or for margin loans in leveraged trading. it does not appear to any of us that mtgox followed any these essential requirements as a financial services provider.the following industry leaders stand by this statement:fred ehrsam — co-founder of coinbasejesse powell — ceo of krakennejc kodri? — ceo of bitstamp.netbobby lee — ceo of btc chinanicolas cary — ceo of blockchain.infojeremy allaire — ceo of circle

ok so i thought id mastered pgp but im not sure.basically i put their key in gpa, sign keys, set owner trust, send keys.  go to clipboard, write address, encrypt.then, i put my key and and the encrypted message into the address box.but occasionally i get messages from vendors saying "you gave me the key by mistake" even though i put the key and then the encrypted message underneath.  am i not supposed to do this?
i like the site a lot thanks for the hard work torescrow

in response to ronins reply, to check if the addresses match, you can use bitcoin-qt.1. open bitcoin-qt2. select the "help" button, then the "debug" option from the drop-down3. select the "console" tab in the new window4. replace the public keys in this command, copy and past it into the console input, and press enter:             createmultisig 2 {["public_key_a","public_key_b","public_key_c"]}as stated by ronin, make sure the public keys are in the correct order and that your public key is one of the inputs.  after, it will generate an address.  if the address matches the one given to fund, then your public key was used to create the address.here is a visual representation of multi-sig:http://u5z75duioy7kpwun.onion/wiki/index.php/verifying_multi-sig_escrowthese addresses are just like regular addresses and can be checked on blockchain.info.if you have any questions, always feel free to contact me at the details in my sig.  im always open to helping others in the community.cheers,mdparity

mtgox is a real business and the owners identities are known, this isnt like the deepweb. can they really say everyones coins are safe then close their doors and never give them back> not to mention people put real money into the site. can they really get away with that?i know there is no laws around running a bitcoin exchange. but that shouldnt mean they can just blatantly lie and rob everyone.
once it finally dies, the market will be more stable.  they were causing price fluctuations that made it more difficult to do business.

i am not entirely sure about the structure of the pgp key, but i can tell you that if i put both of those keys into a text document and try to import both of them, only one key will be inputted into my keyring, not two. meaning that those two keys are related to the same private key. again, i am not sure why the last 4 bytes changed, but if you are worried about it, take an old message sent to you that worked with your old key and try and decrypt it. if it works, there is nothing wrong with your key. i think nightcrawler is the expert on this though.
quote from: whom on february 23, 2014, 05:30:54 pm...there are three huge problems with vps hosting for hidden services:...3. when someone exploits the vps-provider console/management interface, they have root on your vps instance - this one happens fairly often.  someone exploits a bug in solusvm or another vps-provider management console and gets control over every vps box in their environment.  including yours.a better solution is a rented, dedicated server, running xen or another hypervisor, and using the hypervisor to isolate the server (actually providing the http or other service) from the tor instance that advertises the .onion address:servervm->(private virtual network)->torvm->(internet)in that scenario, when someone pwns the servervm, they cant deanonymize it by sending arbitrary traffic out.. theyre stuck behind the torvm and can only send traffic via tor.  to deanonymize the servervm effectively, they need to exploit the hypervisor first.   in that architecture, the torvm should only be allowed to send in/out the tor traffic.  the hypervisor probably shouldnt even really be on a public network, except to bridge traffic to the torvm, and damned sure shouldnt accept arbitrary traffic from the internet itself.please elaborate on the hypervisor use case if possible, references to detailed example documentation most appreciated.is it safe to assume the torvm is comprised of a barebones installation with iptables dropping everything but tor traffic?

well ive pretty much given up at this point... its really advanced stuff and my tech knowledge and skills sort of dont go that far.mirage: ive only been able to download the required files.. the .iso file and another one, and the tailssigning.key one used to verify the .iso. the tails-signing.key when i download it is a zipped file, which i cant unzip (error-corrupt file/file format not supported), so when i try import it on terminal it doesnt work. i dont know what to do at this stage, and this is like the first freaking step.also, apparently you need refit or whatever, which i dont have... also buying anything at this point isnt rly ideal, so i dunno.. i just might look into it.. maybe ill try upgrade to a more recent osx (i have snow leopard 10.6.8.)

quote from: jolly roger on february 24, 2014, 07:18:22 pmquote from: fromage on february 24, 2014, 06:32:27 pmwell if its all about trust in the end, is there any point to multisig addresses?yes, it is to stop the market from getting robbed because each transaction needs to be unlocked separately with unique keys. i suppose you could get the public keys from the seller and server but this effectively would give the buyer and seller the ability to close the deal without the server and therefore you could cut out their market fees. so this is a bad idea for the server to do this. let me just say, that there is no more risk to doing multisig than regular escrow, and in fact less risk because a 3rd party hacker cannot steal everyones money. trusting the market is a choice you need to make on your own and if you want to deal directly with the vendor, then do so outside of the market.if the market is going to give its customers the ability to close deals while cutting out their market fees, it would not be worth it for the market.i have to disagree with this guyif the server doesnt give you the opportunity to verify the address then its not worth it. they could give you a multi sig that is 2/2 with addresses both controlled by the market. this opens you up to obvious scams. dont fall for what he is proposing. verify the address and protect yourself from scams.also it makes no sense for the market to hide this, if the buyer/seller wanted to avoid fees they could set up their own 2/2 escrow. also in the situation jolly roger describes above the buyer could sign a transaction sending all funds to vendor, and then vendor verifies and also signs the transaction. funds released, market bypassed. the market is not protected in 2/3.the market would rely on getting income through signing a transaction which sends most funds to vendor, and commision to market. this would then be signed by the buyer when he is happy. if the buyer starts bypassing the market fee transaction then he is banned. but to hide it all away from the user and not give them the ability to be able to verify addresses, avoid this market set up. its not healthy. i would warn anyone away from the setup jolly roger is promoting. will lead to more scams in the future, and it will not allow you to verify multi sig is setup correctly.
quote from: ronin on february 25, 2014, 02:29:28 pmi have to disagree with this guy1) if the server doesnt give you the opportunity to verify the address then its not worth it. they could give you a multi sig that is 2/2 with addresses both controlled by the market. this opens you up to obvious scams. dont fall for what he is proposing. verify the address and protect yourself from scams.excuse me. first of all, your accusations about me are very offensive. accusing me that i am trying to get you all to "fall for something". and i do not think you completely understand the entire process of multisignature addresses to make the claims you are making. #1) how is this any more risky than the escrow system that markets had before? the markets were controlling the funds 100% and getting robbed and cleaned out on several occasions. people were placing trust in markets before and now suddenly you are worried about getting scammed? where were you speaking out with the old escrow system?quote from: ronin on february 25, 2014, 02:29:28 pm2) also it makes no sense for the market to hide this, if the buyer/seller wanted to avoid fees they could set up their own 2/2 escrow. also in the situation jolly roger describes above the buyer could sign a transaction sending all funds to vendor, and then vendor verifies and also signs the transaction. funds released, market bypassed. the market is not protected in 2/3.#2) yes, they (buyer and seller) could set up their own 2/2 escrow outside the market, but this would be stupid because having a 2/3 makes it possible for the market to become the arbitrator. in a 2/2, only one of the people involved has to be a scammer, and then the funds are locked forever. with 2/3, if the buyer tries to scam, then the market can provide the second key to unlock the funds to send to the seller. this is why 2/3 is better than 2/2. also in the case of 2/3, the market cannot be bypassed without the redeemscript generated at the time that the multisignature address is created. if the market holds the redeemscript in a 2/3 multisignature address, then the buyer and seller cannot complete the transaction on the side without the market and therefore cut out the markets fees. another security issue with releasing all 3 public keys involved is that it lets the participants know whether or not the seller, buyer, or server are reusing a private key and therefore making them more susceptible to attacks.quote from: ronin on february 25, 2014, 02:29:28 pm3) the market would rely on getting income through signing a transaction which sends most funds to vendor, and commision to market. this would then be signed by the buyer when he is happy. if the buyer starts bypassing the market fee transaction then he is banned. but to hide it all away from the user and not give them the ability to be able to verify addresses, avoid this market set up. its not healthy. #3) it is harder to verify you might think to see if the buyer and seller are closing the deal on the side. unless the market is constantly searching through the blockchain for funds spent from that multisignature address, it would be extremely difficult to verify that a buyer and seller are bypassing the market to cut out their fees. quote from: ronin on february 25, 2014, 02:29:28 pmi would warn anyone away from the setup jolly roger is promoting. will lead to more scams in the future, and it will not allow you to verify multi sig is setup correctly.so what you are basically saying here is that the market should trust the buyers, but the buyers should not trust the market. the market has every incentive to keep the ability to unlock funds itself out of its own hands, so that it is not a target for hackers. if the market has the ability to unlock the funds without any buyer or seller input, it would make the market very dangerous and this is not desirable and defeats the purpose of it for the markets. but giving out the 3 keys and the redeemscript to the buyer and seller gives them the ability to close the deal outside the market and bypass fees. again, if you are not able to trust your market, then yes, contact the seller and say you want to do a 2/2 with your seller outside of the market, and you can easily set one up. but with fees at an average of 5%, bypassing the fees will become more common than you think and is harder to detect than you think. especially when you are dealing with thousands of transactions.ronin, i understand what you are saying and you make a valid point that it would likely be desirable for a buyer to have this setup. but it is not desireable for a market to have this setup, since the market relies on market fees and by giving your customers the ability to cut you out of the deal is bad for business. there are plenty of free 2/2 and 2/3 multisignature services out there now that you can use. if you are not comfortable using the markets system, then use another one that gives you the 3 public keys. but if you expect the markets to start giving you the ability to bypass their commissions, then you will likely never be happy. i do not think it makes sense for markets to do this. the cost of running a market is high and by allowing your buyers to not "pay their taxes" so to speak, is a dumb move for the market. again, i reiterate. if you do not trust your market, do a 2/2 or a 2/3 outside of the market. you make the choice.
quote from: mdparity on february 25, 2014, 04:47:38 amin response to ronins reply, to check if the addresses match, you can use bitcoin-qt.1. open bitcoin-qt2. select the "help" button, then the "debug" option from the drop-down3. select the "console" tab in the new window4. replace the public keys in this command, copy and past it into the console input, and press enter:             createmultisig 2 {["public_key_a","public_key_b","public_key_c"]}as stated by ronin, make sure the public keys are in the correct order and that your public key is one of the inputs.  after, it will generate an address.  if the address matches the one given to fund, then your public key was used to create the address.here is a visual representation of multi-sig:http://u5z75duioy7kpwun.onion/wiki/index.php/verifying_multi-sig_escrowthese addresses are just like regular addresses and can be checked on blockchain.info.if you have any questions, always feel free to contact me at the details in my sig.  im always open to helping others in the community.cheers,mdparityspot on.
if you are only sending an address you dont need to give them your key. you only need to give them your key when they are going to send you an encrpyted messege. when you send someone an encrypted messege, it is encrypted with their key, not yours.
try spamming the "check new deposits" button.

silk road is obviously not defunct as people are still trading there. there is no such board as a "scam marketplace area" on the hub and, even if there were, that market (despite increasing suspicions) has still not been proven to be a scam.

lets hope gox has finally goxed itself it needs to die
joint statement regarding the insolvency of mt.goxthe purpose of this document is to summarize a joint statement to the bitcoin community regarding the insolvency of mt.gox.this tragic violation of the trust of users of mt.gox was the result of one company’s abhorrent actions and does not reflect the resilience or value of bitcoin and the digital currency industry. there are hundreds of trustworthy and responsible companies involved in bitcoin. these companies will continue to build the future of money by making bitcoin more secure and easy to use for consumers and merchants. as with any new industry, there are certain bad actors that need to be weeded out, and that is what we are seeing today.we are confident, however, that strong bitcoin companies, led by highly competent teams and backed by credible investors, will continue to thrive, and to fulfill the promise that bitcoin offers as the future of payment in the internet age.in order to re-establish the trust squandered by the failings of mt. gox, responsible bitcoin exchanges are working together and are committed to the future of bitcoin and the security of all customer funds. as part of the effort to re-assure customers, the following exchanges will be coordinating efforts over the coming days to publicly reassure customers and the general public that all funds continue to be held in a safe and secure manner: coinbase, kraken, bitstamp, circle, and btc china.we strongly believe in transparent, thoughtful, and comprehensive consumer protection measures. we pledge to lead the way.bitcoin operators, whether they be exchanges, wallet services or payment providers, play a critical custodial role over the bitcoin they hold as assets for their customers. acting as a custodian should require a high-bar, including appropriate security safeguards that are independently audited and tested on a regular basis, adequate balance sheets and reserves as commercial entities, transparent and accountable customer disclosures, and clear policies to not use customer assets for proprietary trading or for margin loans in leveraged trading. it does not appear to any of us that mtgox followed any these essential requirements as a financial services provider.the following industry leaders stand by this statement:fred ehrsam — co-founder of coinbasejesse powell — ceo of krakennejc kodri? — ceo of bitstamp.netbobby lee — ceo of btc chinanicolas cary — ceo of blockchain.infojeremy allaire — ceo of circle
quote from: northwest nuggets on february 25, 2014, 08:51:06 amonce it finally dies, the market will be more stable.  they were causing price fluctuations that made it more difficult to do business.mtgoxs incompetence has caused several big crashes over the time ive been into btc. but theyre not the only ones, volatility is a fact of life with bitcoin, and we will continue to see massive swings in btc prices for the forseeable future.

if you are sending someone a message encrypted with their public key, the usual and proper way to give the recipient your own public key is to paste your public key in your message at the end before you encrypt, like so - axa-----begin pgp public key block-----version: gnupg v1.4.15 (mingw32)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=dhz8-----end pgp public key block-----

ok so i thought id mastered pgp but im not sure.basically i put their key in gpa, sign keys, set owner trust, send keys.  go to clipboard, write address, encrypt.then, i put my key and and the encrypted message into the address box.but occasionally i get messages from vendors saying "you gave me the key by mistake" even though i put the key and then the encrypted message underneath.  am i not supposed to do this?
i like the site a lot thanks for the hard work torescrow
my new favorite site!
in response to ronins reply, to check if the addresses match, you can use bitcoin-qt.1. open bitcoin-qt2. select the "help" button, then the "debug" option from the drop-down3. select the "console" tab in the new window4. replace the public keys in this command, copy and past it into the console input, and press enter:             createmultisig 2 {["public_key_a","public_key_b","public_key_c"]}as stated by ronin, make sure the public keys are in the correct order and that your public key is one of the inputs.  after, it will generate an address.  if the address matches the one given to fund, then your public key was used to create the address.here is a visual representation of multi-sig:http://u5z75duioy7kpwun.onion/wiki/index.php/verifying_multi-sig_escrowthese addresses are just like regular addresses and can be checked on blockchain.info.if you have any questions, always feel free to contact me at the details in my sig.  im always open to helping others in the community.cheers,mdparity

mtgox is a real business and the owners identities are known, this isnt like the deepweb. can they really say everyones coins are safe then close their doors and never give them back> not to mention people put real money into the site. can they really get away with that?i know there is no laws around running a bitcoin exchange. but that shouldnt mean they can just blatantly lie and rob everyone.
once it finally dies, the market will be more stable.  they were causing price fluctuations that made it more difficult to do business.

i am not entirely sure about the structure of the pgp key, but i can tell you that if i put both of those keys into a text document and try to import both of them, only one key will be inputted into my keyring, not two. meaning that those two keys are related to the same private key. again, i am not sure why the last 4 bytes changed, but if you are worried about it, take an old message sent to you that worked with your old key and try and decrypt it. if it works, there is nothing wrong with your key. i think nightcrawler is the expert on this though.
quote from: whom on february 23, 2014, 05:30:54 pm...there are three huge problems with vps hosting for hidden services:...3. when someone exploits the vps-provider console/management interface, they have root on your vps instance - this one happens fairly often.  someone exploits a bug in solusvm or another vps-provider management console and gets control over every vps box in their environment.  including yours.a better solution is a rented, dedicated server, running xen or another hypervisor, and using the hypervisor to isolate the server (actually providing the http or other service) from the tor instance that advertises the .onion address:servervm->(private virtual network)->torvm->(internet)in that scenario, when someone pwns the servervm, they cant deanonymize it by sending arbitrary traffic out.. theyre stuck behind the torvm and can only send traffic via tor.  to deanonymize the servervm effectively, they need to exploit the hypervisor first.   in that architecture, the torvm should only be allowed to send in/out the tor traffic.  the hypervisor probably shouldnt even really be on a public network, except to bridge traffic to the torvm, and damned sure shouldnt accept arbitrary traffic from the internet itself.please elaborate on the hypervisor use case if possible, references to detailed example documentation most appreciated.is it safe to assume the torvm is comprised of a barebones installation with iptables dropping everything but tor traffic?
hi jolly rogers.   thanks for the attention given !!i doubt you take off my head , will try to contact nightcrawler.cheers.
the most convenient way to buy bitcoin in the usa is through coinbase (https://coinbase.com). once you link your bank account you can purchase bitcoin with your checking account and receive the bitcoin in your coinbase account in 3-4 days. coinbase charges a 1% fee to buy or sell bitcoin, and customers with verified id can buy or sell up to 50 bitcoin per day instantly. anyone can use the coinbase wallet but at present you need a usa bank account to buy or sell bitcoin.localbitcoins.com (https://localbitcoins.com/) allows you to buy bitcoin in person from local traders using cash or from sellers online and has an escrow service built in.mycelium (http://mycelium.com/) -  the mycelium mobile wallet for android has a local trader feature built in that lets you find local sellers offering bitcoin for in person trades using cash.cash into coins (https://cashintocoins.com/index.php) is a new service (us only) that allows you to deposit cash at your local bank and receive bitcoins in about a day. can bitcoin be purchased using paypal? yes, there are sellers on localbitcoins.com who accept paypal (https://localbitcoins.com/buy-bitcoins-online/paypal/?ch=nho). you can also use paypal or your credit card to purchase bitcoin through the bitcoin insanity (http://www.bitcoininsanity.com/) service.for more ways to buy bitcoin browse the clearnet list on bitcoin wiki at https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/buying_bitcoinsremember you will have to make your newly purchased bitcoin anonymous by using a mixing service like bitcoin fog. best practice is to keep a separate bitcoin wallet for coins that have been mixed. once sent through bitcoin fog the coins can not be traced back to you.

i wasnt trying it on a macbook i was trying it on an imac with an optical drive but was trying to boot tails from usb not cd.the proccess is fairly complicated. there are a few methods to do it but the only one i got to work was installing via command line. there are directions on the site that explain how to do this, and you can simply copy/paste the commands and replace the <iso goes here> with the .iso by compy/pasting it to the command line when it asks for its directory.for me it simply would not install this way and it was because i was missing a command that was not in the instructions. something retarded like ~dev at the end of a certain command. after about 5 hours of trying i figured this out and got it to successfully install.next you need a bootloader because mac has an efi loader instead. for this they say you need refind which is an older version of refit. i could not get it to install because i already had refit on there with no hopes to remove it. when i turned on my computer the usb drive shows up but only boots to a blank screen and goes no where. after a few more hours of tinkinering i gave up.

(he just went down like that!). and there are many other good reasons to run 10.6 and nothing after. and even better reasons to run linux/tails, ect. so dont give up just yet, k? we are all here to help! try what i mentioned above and just lemmie know, k? peacemirageoki ^^ thanks for the encouragement, i wont give up yet i would get on the burning onto the dvd-r, but my cd drive is all jacked up  i put a cd in, itll never coma back out, unless i manage to pull it out ... will usb work ?i really want to avoid buying anything extra at this point (runnin low on cash) like an external cd drive or something

https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser/designhttps://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/5286basically, tails want to look exactly the same as tbb to a web server. if noscript is enabled by default in tbb, tails will change theirs to reflect the new design.of course, you could actually build your own tails with javascript turned off. there are instructions on how to roll your own tails on the website. here is the commit tree so you can how it was sup up before you got it.
tails leaves javascript enabled by default because they want to match the tbb fingerprint as closely as possible. get the tbb to fix it and tails will change without hesitation.
you have to make sure that noscript is allowing both blockchain.info and sharedcoin.comalso, i have noticed if you have an address that has mupltiple inputs, sharedcoin doesnt like them at all and tends to fail. its easier to sweep them all into one address and send.

quote from: blackstar on february 26, 2014, 05:03:11 amyea man im sorry. hopefully there is some legal recouse that can be implemented to lean on them to pay coins back. im not sure if they all got stolen or what. it wouldnt suprise me if the us feds didnt have ahand in it. seems like more and more coins are going "missing" or into wallets that are sitting still. we know how bad the feds want btc gone.. who knows though. im genuinely sorry for all involved in gox.i read somewhere where 700,000 btc had been stolen from mtgox and they never told anyone.
i dont think its any excuse for sr, its a dark net site, security is the biggest issue. of course it is for mtgox but fucking hell you dont expect a darknet market to be vulnerable thats the whole point of doing illegal activity online, security.

(e.g. some have completely re-implemented the bitcoin protocol, incorrectly, and exposed it to the outside world and suffered numerous local blockchain rejecting glitches). though its certainly taken gox a fair amount of time to sort things out.)i first heard people reporting stuck transactions back in ~september. i looked into it and determined that mtgox was spending immature coins. freshly generated bitcoins (from mining) can not be spend until they are at least 100 blocks deep in the blockchain. this prevents the funds from vanishing forever if the chain reorgs. i pinged magicaltux and after a couple tries got a hold of him. i think they also wasted some time on dead ends trying to resolve this before the actual nature of the problem was brought to their attention, e.g. raising their transaction fees with a mistaken belief that their fees weren’t high enough.mtgox wasn’t tracking if the coins were freshly generated or what their height was in their software. including this data would apparently be a non-trivial change, and for high risk finance software even a trivial change takes a lot of work. i suggested a workaround (basically, just try to spend the oldest coins), and as far as i know they implemented it and it was effective.they continued to have problems with stuck transactions after, and further analysis revealed that they were producing transactions with excessively padded signatures. a minor tangent is required here:there is a design flaw in the bitcoin protocol where its possible for a third party to take a valid transaction of yours and mutate it in a way which leaves it valid and functionally identical but with a different transaction id. this greatly complicates writing correct wallet software, and it can be used abusively to invalidate long chains of unconfirmed transactions that depend on the non-mutant transaction (since transactions refer to each other by txid).this issue arises from several sources, one of them being openssl’s willingness to accept and make sense of signatures with invalid encodings. a normal ecdsa signature encodes two large integers, the encoding isn’t constant length— if there are leading zeros you are supposed to drop them.it’s easy to write software that assumes the signature will be a constant length and then leave extra leading zeros in them.in order to eventually remove this malleability flaw we’ve been gradually tightening the rules that govern what transactions nodes in the network will consider valid when they relay them or mine them. in bitcoin 0.8— after months of work chasing down software authors to get them to fix their bugs transactions with these invalid encodings were no longer relayed.this caused some problems for a few things.. for example bc.i’s iphone app— bc.i itself had been fixed long before but they couldn’t update the iphone app without fear of triggering another review by apple. eventually this was just worked around on the server side by mutating the transactions produced by the iphone wallets. (and is moot now, i guess!).mtgox also had problems with occasionally producing invalid signatures. this would normally be a simple fix. e.g. here is an example where i fixed this type of issue in some python wallet code i’ve never used (but saw a lot of people were copying): https://github.com/…/4c64603ab60b0fa23c51090b3112be2f16…but as i said before, in high value systems like mtgox, even simple fixes aren’t simple and it took them quite some time to deploy a fix. however, i believe that it is actually fixed now.my current understanding and inference is that the remaining issues are because while mtgox was producing transactions of the bad form that the network won’t relay anymore— some people decided to help out by ‘fixing’ these transactions like bc.i did for iphone users— making the signatures normal and broadcasting them. of course, the new transactions— while functionally identical— have different txids.the difference here is that the mtgox wallet software appears to have not handled this case gracefully at all, and apparently simply wouldn’t notice transactions that it “didn’t make” spending its own coins.as a result the mtgox wallet believed some coins were available for spending which really had already been spent and it began double spending those inputs. this may have interacted particularly poorly with the earlier workaround i mentioned— trying to always use the oldest available coins— if they did implement that workaround.worse, some of this may have resulted in users getting paid multiple times and could have been intentionally triggered with that end in mind if someone helpfully fixed some transactions and then noticed they got paid twice. (i think this is unlikely to have caused large losses, before people run off worrying about that, both because of the reuse of the oldest inputs and because of the hot wallet/cold wallet split).at this point they likely have an accounting mess to clean up— figuring out who did and didn’t get paid now with none of the txids matching. cleaning that up will be somewhat tricky e.g. say there were three payments of mtgox coins to 1apple in the block chain… and three users that attempted to pay 1apple, and mtgox’s records thinks that only one went through.. etc. so software will have to be written that matches up transactions with their mutants in order to figure out what went where.i am not personally concerned— at least not by any of the details here. mtgox’s slow speed at resolving these sorts of issues and poor communications are not terribly inspiring. they seem to be horribly short staffed— but competent and trustworthy people in this space may be hard to find: the regulatory morass of that business is sure to make many steer clear.the claims that the delays indicate insolvency strike me as just hysteria: the technical background doesn’t support this conclusion, and there may be a bit of opportunism at play from people who want to manipulate the market too. don’t get me wrong: i have not seen their books: gox may well have financial problems— though with their income its hard for me to see how— but if any problems like that exist they’re not being indicated here.of course, none of this suggests anyone should be happy with the service mtgox has been providing, but our anger should at least be well informed.february 11 at 2:02am ”(that wasn’t the uk time, it is from a copy saved by another recipient)i still think defcon is full of shit, with his “we will prevail” our community shit. but i don’t think the boy dunnit.".........................redbookthe bbmc team_________________________________________________________there you have it.. take from it what you will.... but i still wont be going anywhere near sr.xsposer.
**update 2**having closely studied what is posted above, i have come to the conclusion that,,, (gasp) oracle form the sr forum was probably correct in his theory & dox, last week.. not that i support doxxing, but his dox of "pritel" (internet name- mods do not delete) was pretty accurate.the dox included everything that the above post says; about the mtgox theft and other btc hacks.. turns out this guy "pritel" was bragging about how he helped code these sites and had found vulnerabilities in the btc protocol.. he says that he hit bitstamp, sr, and gox with ddos, flooded them with mutated transactions, and made a fortune..it all sounded, well- oracle- at the time, but now this bbmc update has come to light, i actually believe this guy "pritel" is a person of deep interest.i have a full, uncensored copy of "pritel" dox, and will post a redacted version of it below, so you can all see the relation and importance.. but no names or address will be included- so mods, dont freak out.to me, this now looks pretty conclusive. but only time will tell..> also, not to stir shit, but my explanation above still doesnt put defcon in the clear.. defcon hired "pritel" after a reccomendation from, non other than stexo.... so it is possible that they could all be sharing the profits behind the scenes. hence the repeated call for narco93- who probably doesnt exist and is likely a dropshpper from spain/ france....redacted dox of "pritel" will be posted soon...quote from: blackstar on february 26, 2014, 11:39:03 amwow, have you posted this there? this is incredible if true. mind if i share it?yeah, go for it, theres a lot of important information here... especially for the right people.. please repost.xsposer.

im sure you know this, but ill mention it anyway.  blockchain.info is very javascript heavy so you need it enabled for that site.i dont use tails, just the tor browser bundle. here is my expereince with shared send on blockchain.info since it was modified to use sharedcoin.com several weeks ago.it can be very slow. the little popup that happens when you start a transaction can take a long time to complete.  sometimes it will not complete.when the transaction is initiated it will take longer to confirm than a standard transaction.  sometimes a couple hours. sometimes a full day.rather than do a shared send to a vendor i now have a separate wallet in blockchain.info that i do a shared send to.  i keep some btc there so that when i want to use it i can transfer directly from there to a vendor.  that way i am not concerned with the reliability or time for a shared send.
has anyone been having problems with their tails freezing while they try to do a shared coin send? is there a way i can avoid this in the future?

the markets were controlling the funds 100% and getting robbed and cleaned out on several occasions. people were placing trust in markets before and now suddenly you are worried about getting scammed? where were you speaking out with the old escrow system?im sorry that you feel offended but dont think i have said anything below the belt. you are proposing a multi sig escrow solution which doesnt protect the buyer from rogue markets or incompetent developers. kind of poinltess in my opionion.regarding risk compared to previous, its the same, market could go rogue or loose all its coins due to incompetent devs. whats your point? you are proposing a solution that still exposes users to the same problems. and its not a sudden worry. i have raised the issue of mutli sig way before the sr2 debacle. take the time to go through my postings on this forum and others and you will see i have been a long term proponent of multi sig. way beforfe it became fashinable.quote from: jolly roger on february 25, 2014, 05:57:28 pmquote from: ronin on february 25, 2014, 02:29:28 pm2) also it makes no sense for the market to hide this, if the buyer/seller wanted to avoid fees they could set up their own 2/2 escrow. also in the situation jolly roger describes above the buyer could sign a transaction sending all funds to vendor, and then vendor verifies and also signs the transaction. funds released, market bypassed. the market is not protected in 2/3.#2) yes, they (buyer and seller) could set up their own 2/2 escrow outside the market, but this would be stupid because having a 2/3 makes it possible for the market to become the arbitrator. in a 2/2, only one of the people involved has to be a scammer, and then the funds are locked forever. with 2/3, if the buyer tries to scam, then the market can provide the second key to unlock the funds to send to the seller. this is why 2/3 is better than 2/2. also in the case of 2/3, the market cannot be bypassed without the redeemscript generated at the time that the multisignature address is created. if the market holds the redeemscript in a 2/3 multisignature address, then the buyer and seller cannot complete the transaction on the side without the market and therefore cut out the markets fees. another security issue with releasing all 3 public keys involved is that it lets the participants know whether or not the seller, buyer, or server are reusing a private key and therefore making them more susceptible to attacks.it doesnt benefit the scammer financially to pull a scam. which removes most of the motive. i agree 2/3 is better, but not if the market doesnt allow the buyer/vendor to confirm the address (as you are proposing). i wouldnt touch a market that insists on hiding the details of the address from you. its too open to abuse/incompetence.agreed re: the redeem script. but the market cant really withold the script if someone can generate it themselves from the original inputs.i dont think its a security issue if the buyer/vendor can see the market is reusing the same keys. this would be an excellent way of people being able to ascertain if the market is coded by an incompetent.quote from: jolly roger on february 25, 2014, 05:57:28 pmquote from: ronin on february 25, 2014, 02:29:28 pm3) the market would rely on getting income through signing a transaction which sends most funds to vendor, and commision to market. this would then be signed by the buyer when he is happy. if the buyer starts bypassing the market fee transaction then he is banned. but to hide it all away from the user and not give them the ability to be able to verify addresses, avoid this market set up. its not healthy. #3) it is harder to verify you might think to see if the buyer and seller are closing the deal on the side. unless the market is constantly searching through the blockchain for funds spent from that multisignature address, it would be extremely difficult to verify that a buyer and seller are bypassing the market to cut out their fees. i dont see the issue here. what is difficult about this exactly? anyone running the bitcond client is always getting every transaction. the databse holding transactions could be checked for transactions once a week that are older than one month. any such transaction which has the funds removed from the address would be flagged as having done a deal outside the market. account banned. i could probably write a bash script to do this fairly quickly. am i missing something here? what is the difficulty?quote from: jolly roger on february 25, 2014, 05:57:28 pmquote from: ronin on february 25, 2014, 02:29:28 pmi would warn anyone away from the setup jolly roger is promoting. will lead to more scams in the future, and it will not allow you to verify multi sig is setup correctly.so what you are basically saying here is that the market should trust the buyers, but the buyers should not trust the market. the market has every incentive to keep the ability to unlock funds itself out of its own hands, so that it is not a target for hackers. if the market has the ability to unlock the funds without any buyer or seller input, it would make the market very dangerous and this is not desirable and defeats the purpose of it for the markets. but giving out the 3 keys and the redeemscript to the buyer and seller gives them the ability to close the deal outside the market and bypass fees. again, if you are not able to trust your market, then yes, contact the seller and say you want to do a 2/2 with your seller outside of the market, and you can easily set one up. but with fees at an average of 5%, bypassing the fees will become more common than you think and is harder to detect than you think. especially when you are dealing with thousands of transactions.ronin, i understand what you are saying and you make a valid point that it would likely be desirable for a buyer to have this setup. but it is not desireable for a market to have this setup, since the market relies on market fees and by giving your customers the ability to cut you out of the deal is bad for business. there are plenty of free 2/2 and 2/3 multisignature services out there now that you can use. if you are not comfortable using the markets system, then use another one that gives you the 3 public keys. but if you expect the markets to start giving you the ability to bypass their commissions, then you will likely never be happy. i do not think it makes sense for markets to do this. the cost of running a market is high and by allowing your buyers to not "pay their taxes" so to speak, is a dumb move for the market. again, i reiterate. if you do not trust your market, do a 2/2 or a 2/3 outside of the market. you make the choice.i think it has already been shown that markets suffer from fraudulent owners or incompetent developers. i am not saying markets shouldnt charge a fee. but i am also not proposing a solution that offers no benefits unless you abolutely trust the markets honesty and development abiity, which recent events have shown arent a good bet.i think this benefits everyone involved. while i hear what you are saying about maintaining the dominance of markets and that users should trust them with multi sig, i respectfully disagree, i think its an appalling setup, and will only lead to more scams and hacks. it sovles nothing and doesnt move us towards a trustless system.

bitcoin qt also messed up my computer and i dont like the idea of the client having to store the entire blockchain on my computer. i use blockchain.info because it is pretty damn simple and has never given me problems. however, i know i will have to sacrafice conveinience for security and i am happy to do so. unfortunetly not all people will feel that way, quite possibly the majority. im ready to try a wallet that supports mst and will have to do so soon so i can explain how it works to all the n00bs.
web wallets can be secure if they are fully client side, but you take the risk that the javascript is not malicious unless you verify it everytime.i prefer bitcoind over electrum for 2 reasons - electrum is crap for signing multisigs. give it a go and you will see what i mean. other than transfering coins to a multi sig address it isnt multi sig compliant. - bitcoind has the whole blockchain. electrum requests the data for addresses it sends to a server. the server can then link your addresses and potentially deanonoymise you. on bitcoind you have the whole blockchain so no one can link nothing to you.having said that electrum is obviously more convenient and space saving. i have been working on a plugin for trying to fix multi sig signing on electrum but havent had as much time to devote to this as i would have liked recently. but will continue on it and hopefully have it out before electrum fix it!albert, one thing i would say though is to allow people to be able to verify the multi sig address is legit by giving them the public keys needed to recreate it (i.e. markets and vendors, buyer will already have his own key). pointless to have multi sig if the user cant generate the address themselves and verify it is legit.
this brings some credibility to sr theft.  if mt gox gets robbed anyone else can too.
yea man im sorry. hopefully there is some legal recouse that can be implemented to lean on them to pay coins back. im not sure if they all got stolen or what. it wouldnt suprise me if the us feds didnt have ahand in it. seems like more and more coins are going "missing" or into wallets that are sitting still. we know how bad the feds want btc gone.. who knows though. im genuinely sorry for all involved in gox.

i have a feeling that they disabled registration to help deal with all the users whose bitcoins were already missing due to the "negative balance bug", the users whose bitcoins do not show as "pending", and other users who will not be getting repaid.
here is another tip. if you have no foil bags and want to ship something that will smell, you can use pvc pipe. get anything from 1" to 4", larger than that and it gets very heavy. look for thinwall. get end caps and the glue. put your goods in the pipe section you cut off, glue on the end caps and wait a bit for them to dry. you now have an odor proof container to send out and it wont set off any metal detectors either.
otr can be used with nearly any transport. otr is likely the most secure way youll have of messaging for a while.
im not sure where they are pulling their btc rate from. its also entirely possible that due to the rapid fall and an expected quick rebound that the devs locked it temporarily to keep customers from drastically over spending. ofc this would have been a bad move if the rebound had not happened as it would have put a burden back onto us vendors, but overall i cant blame them for doing it. honestly, it was probably a good move in favor of the customers at the time, but since it looks like btc is going to be back on the rise now that the whole fear of gox collapsing is over they should put it back on auto tracking.
yeah bitcoin is to money as torrent is to download.it is not centralized which means instead of running on one server which if shut down would be the end it is running on 1000s upon 1000s of computers and servers so in order for it to be shut down you would need to shut down every computer running it aka the whole internet.this is precisely how the next generation of darkent markets need to be designed.
howdy,blackbanks system takes the commission before starting the escrow transaction.  the transaction only has a single output instead of two.this way, blackbank is more than happy to allow vendors/buyers to finalize outside of blackbank.  the only trust issue would be if blackbank offers support if there are problems.  however, that is a lot less risky than traditional centralized escrow systems and easier for the buyer/vendor.  im sure buyer/vendor would prioritize verifying that the funds/transactions over verifying support.however, i still promise to continue support with any issues; ive been offering advice and support outside of blackbank entirely, even to members of other markets.  its important to help each other in the community.  growing a safe and secure community is mutually beneficial for everyone, regardless of immediate financial gain.cheers,mdparity

pm it to me.... xsposer..recent sr scam revelation: http://thehubaoydxrommh.onion/index.php?topic=1408.0
well, ive been playing around with the idea of having a secure multi-sigs implementation at tba for a while now, and been toying around with a number of different bitcoin clients that currently support a 2/3 transaction in some form or another. and ive had folks pm me with their ideas asto why we should have such a system in place, as well as why they believe not. so id set it up for a debate amongst our users.. and having heard both sides of the argument, the overwhelming choice was for in favor of a multi-sig integration.. despite the niggles and constraints it presented to an end-user.with various bicoin clients out there, i was wondering what the spread was like and hence the poll. maybe if you could also drop in a line or two asto why you use/prefer the said client over another - thatd be totally awesome. though am pretty close to having had worked out a fine balance for how to go about it, without it being too complicated (as some users suggested it seemed) id like to know what people out here use as their favorite bitcoin client.
security of bitcoin depends on the blockchain being held in full by many people. bitcoin-qt and armory do exactly that. however, given enough copies of the blockchain, one can assume the system is secure from the data being lost and rely on other nodes to provide the information we require when we need it. many users like having the whole blockchain available to them, but if that is a problem for you use a lightweight wallet like electrum. of all the wallets available, only armory and electrum only need to be backed up once, ever.  be careful with web wallets, they have been hacked before. keeping your bitcoin locally using a client on your own computer is always more secure.

you have to make sure that noscript is allowing both blockchain.info and sharedcoin.comalso, i have noticed if you have an address that has mupltiple inputs, sharedcoin doesnt like them at all and tends to fail. its easier to sweep them all into one address and send.
i heard on the news (2-25-14) that there are issues with the btc mkt. i didnt catch the full story. hopefully, i misunderstood the little that i heard. i was under the impression that the only way that thebtc could be "destroyed" is if/when the entire internet goes down. hopefully someone can shed come light on the topic...
this looks good. i like the wot rating system.
im sure you know this, but ill mention it anyway.  blockchain.info is very javascript heavy so you need it enabled for that site.i dont use tails, just the tor browser bundle. here is my expereince with shared send on blockchain.info since it was modified to use sharedcoin.com several weeks ago.it can be very slow. the little popup that happens when you start a transaction can take a long time to complete.  sometimes it will not complete.when the transaction is initiated it will take longer to confirm than a standard transaction.  sometimes a couple hours. sometimes a full day.rather than do a shared send to a vendor i now have a separate wallet in blockchain.info that i do a shared send to.  i keep some btc there so that when i want to use it i can transfer directly from there to a vendor.  that way i am not concerned with the reliability or time for a shared send.

howdy,blackbanks system takes the commission before starting the escrow transaction.  the transaction only has a single output instead of two.this way, blackbank is more than happy to allow vendors/buyers to finalize outside of blackbank.  the only trust issue would be if blackbank offers support if there are problems.  however, that is a lot less risky than traditional centralized escrow systems and easier for the buyer/vendor.  im sure buyer/vendor would prioritize verifying that the funds/transactions over verifying support.however, i still promise to continue support with any issues; ive been offering advice and support outside of blackbank entirely, even to members of other markets.  its important to help each other in the community.  growing a safe and secure community is mutually beneficial for everyone, regardless of immediate financial gain.cheers,mdparity

what do you think, hubites?  is your experience with agora and pandora the same as mine?
how can we make it go back up to 1,000. and remember when the silkroad got busted and the feds sold all there funds and the price went up. how come when utopia got busted its still at 500$
opps i seen a topic on agora lol some guy said this "yeah, went to go check.  their exchange rate ticker api is frozen at $528.  the issue is actually with blockchain, not agora.******** clearnet *********https://blockchain.info/ticker
good answer thats what im thinking also just wanted some input.. yea im not sure about there rate seems close to bitstamp,  usually but thats because i check bitstamp probably. hope it starts to move i really havent seen it move in 12 hrs ...
whats going on it cant still be at 528.00 like yesterday is the caculator or whatever stuck anyone wanna talk about this with me haha? i decided to invest( nothing huge)  in bitcoins today at about 530.00  and it went up to about 560.00 right now at most places, and agora still says 528.00... is it stuck or what. also i think bitcoins are about to go up^^^^ ...  it hit fucking yahoo and other mainstream media outlets today because of that mt gox fucker

the pump and dump was done by wall street after sr1 fell. they pumped it past 1000. then did a massive sell off. rumor has is chase banking cartel used the fast profits they made in bitcoin to help fund the development of their version of bitcoin.
if the sr1 forums are still available online you should be able to find the whole sad saga easily enough. as i remember it, limetless vouched for vladimirs "bitcoin hedge fund" which was offering silly returns and was an obvious ponzi scheme. ultimately vladimir disappeared with the funds after he was late on some payments and began receiving calls at his workplace. and not long afterwards limetless "had an overdose" and disappeared from the scene.does anybody else remember this or have a link to a mirror of the sr1 forums? i wonder what ever became of that cast of screen names.
i had money in my account before the attack or whatever happened.. now it says 0 but i have been reading where some people have been getting their money back.. my accont is at 0 and i have hit refresh etc etc.. still says 0, will i ever get my coin back?
1) buy all the bitcoins in existance2) advertise everywhere that bitcoins are the best thing since sliced bread3) sell the bitcoinsi say pump you say dumppump
im not sure where they are pulling their btc rate from. its also entirely possible that due to the rapid fall and an expected quick rebound that the devs locked it temporarily to keep customers from drastically over spending. ofc this would have been a bad move if the rebound had not happened as it would have put a burden back onto us vendors, but overall i cant blame them for doing it. honestly, it was probably a good move in favor of the customers at the time, but since it looks like btc is going to be back on the rise now that the whole fear of gox collapsing is over they should put it back on auto tracking.
yea and unlike sr where the theif is virtually anonymous, fatfuck has to worry about more than moving coins around. he needs to worry about moving himself around, his doxx are pretty much public record. almost feel bad for the guy... almost

quote from: axa on february 26, 2014, 02:28:36 pmsecurity of bitcoin depends on the blockchain being held in full by many people. bitcoin-qt and armory do exactly that. however, given enough copies of the blockchain, one can assume the system is secure from the data being lost and rely on other nodes to provide the information we require when we need it. many users like having the whole blockchain available to them, but if that is a problem for you use a lightweight wallet like electrum. of all the wallets available, only armory and electrum only need to be backed up once, ever.  be careful with web wallets, they have been hacked before. keeping your bitcoin locally using a client on your own computer is always more secure.i can see no reason to use a web wallet unless you have a small amount on there.it has to be armory as the most secure at moment.
i wasnt trying it on a macbook i was trying it on an imac with an optical drive but was trying to boot tails from usb not cd.the proccess is fairly complicated. there are a few methods to do it but the only one i got to work was installing via command line. there are directions on the site that explain how to do this, and you can simply copy/paste the commands and replace the <iso goes here> with the .iso by compy/pasting it to the command line when it asks for its directory.for me it simply would not install this way and it was because i was missing a command that was not in the instructions. something retarded like ~dev at the end of a certain command. after about 5 hours of trying i figured this out and got it to successfully install.next you need a bootloader because mac has an efi loader instead. for this they say you need refind which is an older version of refit. i could not get it to install because i already had refit on there with no hopes to remove it. when i turned on my computer the usb drive shows up but only boots to a blank screen and goes no where. after a few more hours of tinkinering i gave up.

(he just went down like that!). and there are many other good reasons to run 10.6 and nothing after. and even better reasons to run linux/tails, ect. so dont give up just yet, k? we are all here to help! try what i mentioned above and just lemmie know, k? peacemirageoki ^^ thanks for the encouragement, i wont give up yet i would get on the burning onto the dvd-r, but my cd drive is all jacked up  i put a cd in, itll never coma back out, unless i manage to pull it out ... will usb work ?i really want to avoid buying anything extra at this point (runnin low on cash) like an external cd drive or something

quote from: jolly roger on february 25, 2014, 05:57:28 pmquote from: ronin on february 25, 2014, 02:29:28 pmi have to disagree with this guy1) if the server doesnt give you the opportunity to verify the address then its not worth it. they could give you a multi sig that is 2/2 with addresses both controlled by the market. this opens you up to obvious scams. dont fall for what he is proposing. verify the address and protect yourself from scams.excuse me. first of all, your accusations about me are very offensive. accusing me that i am trying to get you all to "fall for something". and i do not think you completely understand the entire process of multisignature addresses to make the claims you are making. #1) how is this any more risky than the escrow system that markets had before? the markets were controlling the funds 100% and getting robbed and cleaned out on several occasions. people were placing trust in markets before and now suddenly you are worried about getting scammed? where were you speaking out with the old escrow system?im sorry that you feel offended but dont think i have said anything below the belt. you are proposing a multi sig escrow solution which doesnt protect the buyer from rogue markets or incompetent developers. kind of poinltess in my opionion.regarding risk compared to previous, its the same, market could go rogue or loose all its coins due to incompetent devs. whats your point? you are proposing a solution that still exposes users to the same problems. and its not a sudden worry. i have raised the issue of mutli sig way before the sr2 debacle. take the time to go through my postings on this forum and others and you will see i have been a long term proponent of multi sig. way beforfe it became fashinable.quote from: jolly roger on february 25, 2014, 05:57:28 pmquote from: ronin on february 25, 2014, 02:29:28 pm2) also it makes no sense for the market to hide this, if the buyer/seller wanted to avoid fees they could set up their own 2/2 escrow. also in the situation jolly roger describes above the buyer could sign a transaction sending all funds to vendor, and then vendor verifies and also signs the transaction. funds released, market bypassed. the market is not protected in 2/3.#2) yes, they (buyer and seller) could set up their own 2/2 escrow outside the market, but this would be stupid because having a 2/3 makes it possible for the market to become the arbitrator. in a 2/2, only one of the people involved has to be a scammer, and then the funds are locked forever. with 2/3, if the buyer tries to scam, then the market can provide the second key to unlock the funds to send to the seller. this is why 2/3 is better than 2/2. also in the case of 2/3, the market cannot be bypassed without the redeemscript generated at the time that the multisignature address is created. if the market holds the redeemscript in a 2/3 multisignature address, then the buyer and seller cannot complete the transaction on the side without the market and therefore cut out the markets fees. another security issue with releasing all 3 public keys involved is that it lets the participants know whether or not the seller, buyer, or server are reusing a private key and therefore making them more susceptible to attacks.it doesnt benefit the scammer financially to pull a scam. which removes most of the motive. i agree 2/3 is better, but not if the market doesnt allow the buyer/vendor to confirm the address (as you are proposing). i wouldnt touch a market that insists on hiding the details of the address from you. its too open to abuse/incompetence.agreed re: the redeem script. but the market cant really withold the script if someone can generate it themselves from the original inputs.i dont think its a security issue if the buyer/vendor can see the market is reusing the same keys. this would be an excellent way of people being able to ascertain if the market is coded by an incompetent.quote from: jolly roger on february 25, 2014, 05:57:28 pmquote from: ronin on february 25, 2014, 02:29:28 pm3) the market would rely on getting income through signing a transaction which sends most funds to vendor, and commision to market. this would then be signed by the buyer when he is happy. if the buyer starts bypassing the market fee transaction then he is banned. but to hide it all away from the user and not give them the ability to be able to verify addresses, avoid this market set up. its not healthy. #3) it is harder to verify you might think to see if the buyer and seller are closing the deal on the side. unless the market is constantly searching through the blockchain for funds spent from that multisignature address, it would be extremely difficult to verify that a buyer and seller are bypassing the market to cut out their fees. i dont see the issue here. what is difficult about this exactly? anyone running the bitcond client is always getting every transaction. the databse holding transactions could be checked for transactions once a week that are older than one month. any such transaction which has the funds removed from the address would be flagged as having done a deal outside the market. account banned. i could probably write a bash script to do this fairly quickly. am i missing something here? what is the difficulty?quote from: jolly roger on february 25, 2014, 05:57:28 pmquote from: ronin on february 25, 2014, 02:29:28 pmi would warn anyone away from the setup jolly roger is promoting. will lead to more scams in the future, and it will not allow you to verify multi sig is setup correctly.so what you are basically saying here is that the market should trust the buyers, but the buyers should not trust the market. the market has every incentive to keep the ability to unlock funds itself out of its own hands, so that it is not a target for hackers. if the market has the ability to unlock the funds without any buyer or seller input, it would make the market very dangerous and this is not desirable and defeats the purpose of it for the markets. but giving out the 3 keys and the redeemscript to the buyer and seller gives them the ability to close the deal outside the market and bypass fees. again, if you are not able to trust your market, then yes, contact the seller and say you want to do a 2/2 with your seller outside of the market, and you can easily set one up. but with fees at an average of 5%, bypassing the fees will become more common than you think and is harder to detect than you think. especially when you are dealing with thousands of transactions.ronin, i understand what you are saying and you make a valid point that it would likely be desirable for a buyer to have this setup. but it is not desireable for a market to have this setup, since the market relies on market fees and by giving your customers the ability to cut you out of the deal is bad for business. there are plenty of free 2/2 and 2/3 multisignature services out there now that you can use. if you are not comfortable using the markets system, then use another one that gives you the 3 public keys. but if you expect the markets to start giving you the ability to bypass their commissions, then you will likely never be happy. i do not think it makes sense for markets to do this. the cost of running a market is high and by allowing your buyers to not "pay their taxes" so to speak, is a dumb move for the market. again, i reiterate. if you do not trust your market, do a 2/2 or a 2/3 outside of the market. you make the choice.i think it has already been shown that markets suffer from fraudulent owners or incompetent developers. i am not saying markets shouldnt charge a fee. but i am also not proposing a solution that offers no benefits unless you abolutely trust the markets honesty and development abiity, which recent events have shown arent a good bet.i think this benefits everyone involved. while i hear what you are saying about maintaining the dominance of markets and that users should trust them with multi sig, i respectfully disagree, i think its an appalling setup, and will only lead to more scams and hacks. it sovles nothing and doesnt move us towards a trustless system.

im sure you know this, but ill mention it anyway.  blockchain.info is very javascript heavy so you need it enabled for that site.i dont use tails, just the tor browser bundle. here is my expereince with shared send on blockchain.info since it was modified to use sharedcoin.com several weeks ago.it can be very slow. the little popup that happens when you start a transaction can take a long time to complete.  sometimes it will not complete.when the transaction is initiated it will take longer to confirm than a standard transaction.  sometimes a couple hours. sometimes a full day.rather than do a shared send to a vendor i now have a separate wallet in blockchain.info that i do a shared send to.  i keep some btc there so that when i want to use it i can transfer directly from there to a vendor.  that way i am not concerned with the reliability or time for a shared send.
has anyone been having problems with their tails freezing while they try to do a shared coin send? is there a way i can avoid this in the future?

any of you guys want to start a bitcoin exchange with me?we can all split half a billion dollars!
yeah bitcoin is to money as torrent is to download.it is not centralized which means instead of running on one server which if shut down would be the end it is running on 1000s upon 1000s of computers and servers so in order for it to be shut down you would need to shut down every computer running it aka the whole internet.this is precisely how the next generation of darkent markets need to be designed.
like, man, it aint no "movement" at all, just a secret place to buy and sell stuff. and, like any other marketplace on the planet, if they cant properly manage the folks property or, worse, if they cant keep their hands out of the cookie jar, then theyve failed at being a market, and will wither away with all the other frauds.
opps i seen a topic on agora lol some guy said this "yeah, went to go check.  their exchange rate ticker api is frozen at $528.  the issue is actually with blockchain, not agora.******** clearnet *********https://blockchain.info/ticker
good answer thats what im thinking also just wanted some input.. yea im not sure about there rate seems close to bitstamp,  usually but thats because i check bitstamp probably. hope it starts to move i really havent seen it move in 12 hrs ...
whats going on it cant still be at 528.00 like yesterday is the caculator or whatever stuck anyone wanna talk about this with me haha? i decided to invest( nothing huge)  in bitcoins today at about 530.00  and it went up to about 560.00 right now at most places, and agora still says 528.00... is it stuck or what. also i think bitcoins are about to go up^^^^ ...  it hit fucking yahoo and other mainstream media outlets today because of that mt gox fucker
how can we make it go back up to 1,000. and remember when the silkroad got busted and the feds sold all there funds and the price went up. how come when utopia got busted its still at 500$
what do you think, hubites?  is your experience with agora and pandora the same as mine?
any intelligent person would register a website and business like mtgox in a stolen identity. not only do these websites operate completely in the gray area of law, but in a situation like this you would def want to run off with that 500 million in bitcoin dat 500 mill 500 million dollai bet mr fatboy faggot feels like a dick now for not understanding identity theftjust cost you 500 million dollarsfaggot

had some coin in there to day trade with, which is pretty easy to profit from in a volatile market like gox when you can see the order book and know when the spikes would happen. i never bothered to leave an aml trail because it was easy enough to withdraw profits as btc sell on localbitcoins.now it appears im shit out of luck for rest of it stuck in there.

been waiting on almost 3 weeks to withdraw/wash coins and now the sites gone down. what are the people in the know doing about this?
yea and unlike sr where the theif is virtually anonymous, fatfuck has to worry about more than moving coins around. he needs to worry about moving himself around, his doxx are pretty much public record. almost feel bad for the guy... almost

shared send is gone my friend ^^.  and op i have been having issues with tails using shared coin, it simply wont let me do it. it says "loading" but nothing is working or happening (the box stays greyish rather than the blue "clickable" button". i thought it was just me.

the pump and dump was done by wall street after sr1 fell. they pumped it past 1000. then did a massive sell off. rumor has is chase banking cartel used the fast profits they made in bitcoin to help fund the development of their version of bitcoin.

i had money in my account before the attack or whatever happened.. now it says 0 but i have been reading where some people have been getting their money back.. my accont is at 0 and i have hit refresh etc etc.. still says 0, will i ever get my coin back?

if the sr1 forums are still available online you should be able to find the whole sad saga easily enough. as i remember it, limetless vouched for vladimirs "bitcoin hedge fund" which was offering silly returns and was an obvious ponzi scheme. ultimately vladimir disappeared with the funds after he was late on some payments and began receiving calls at his workplace. and not long afterwards limetless "had an overdose" and disappeared from the scene.does anybody else remember this or have a link to a mirror of the sr1 forums? i wonder what ever became of that cast of screen names.
this is where they say they can see your ip though in the tor section

very interested in this. should prevent drama when a seller goes rogue.
the most convenient way to buy bitcoin in the usa is through coinbase (https://coinbase.com). once you link your bank account you can purchase bitcoin with your checking account and receive the bitcoin in your coinbase account in 3-4 days. coinbase charges a 1% fee to buy or sell bitcoin, and customers with verified id can buy or sell up to 50 bitcoin per day instantly. anyone can use the coinbase wallet but at present you need a usa bank account to buy or sell bitcoin.localbitcoins.com (https://localbitcoins.com/) allows you to buy bitcoin in person from local traders using cash or from sellers online and has an escrow service built in.mycelium (http://mycelium.com/) -  the mycelium mobile wallet for android has a local trader feature built in that lets you find local sellers offering bitcoin for in person trades using cash.cash into coins (https://cashintocoins.com/index.php) is a new service (us only) that allows you to deposit cash at your local bank and receive bitcoins in about a day. can bitcoin be purchased using paypal? yes, there are sellers on localbitcoins.com who accept paypal (https://localbitcoins.com/buy-bitcoins-online/paypal/?ch=nho). you can also use paypal or your credit card to purchase bitcoin through the bitcoin insanity (http://www.bitcoininsanity.com/) service.for more ways to buy bitcoin browse the clearnet list on bitcoin wiki at https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/buying_bitcoinsremember you will have to make your newly purchased bitcoin anonymous by using a mixing service like bitcoin fog. best practice is to keep a separate bitcoin wallet for coins that have been mixed. once sent through bitcoin fog the coins can not be traced back to you.
this looks good. i like the wot rating system.

i wasnt trying it on a macbook i was trying it on an imac with an optical drive but was trying to boot tails from usb not cd.the proccess is fairly complicated. there are a few methods to do it but the only one i got to work was installing via command line. there are directions on the site that explain how to do this, and you can simply copy/paste the commands and replace the <iso goes here> with the .iso by compy/pasting it to the command line when it asks for its directory.for me it simply would not install this way and it was because i was missing a command that was not in the instructions. something retarded like ~dev at the end of a certain command. after about 5 hours of trying i figured this out and got it to successfully install.next you need a bootloader because mac has an efi loader instead. for this they say you need refind which is an older version of refit. i could not get it to install because i already had refit on there with no hopes to remove it. when i turned on my computer the usb drive shows up but only boots to a blank screen and goes no where. after a few more hours of tinkinering i gave up.

(he just went down like that!). and there are many other good reasons to run 10.6 and nothing after. and even better reasons to run linux/tails, ect. so dont give up just yet, k? we are all here to help! try what i mentioned above and just lemmie know, k? peacemirageoki ^^ thanks for the encouragement, i wont give up yet i would get on the burning onto the dvd-r, but my cd drive is all jacked up  i put a cd in, itll never coma back out, unless i manage to pull it out ... will usb work ?i really want to avoid buying anything extra at this point (runnin low on cash) like an external cd drive or something

https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser/designhttps://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/5286basically, tails want to look exactly the same as tbb to a web server. if noscript is enabled by default in tbb, tails will change theirs to reflect the new design.of course, you could actually build your own tails with javascript turned off. there are instructions on how to roll your own tails on the website. here is the commit tree so you can how it was sup up before you got it.
tails leaves javascript enabled by default because they want to match the tbb fingerprint as closely as possible. get the tbb to fix it and tails will change without hesitation.
you have to make sure that noscript is allowing both blockchain.info and sharedcoin.comalso, i have noticed if you have an address that has mupltiple inputs, sharedcoin doesnt like them at all and tends to fail. its easier to sweep them all into one address and send.

otr can be used with nearly any transport. otr is likely the most secure way youll have of messaging for a while.
bitcoin qt also messed up my computer and i dont like the idea of the client having to store the entire blockchain on my computer. i use blockchain.info because it is pretty damn simple and has never given me problems. however, i know i will have to sacrafice conveinience for security and i am happy to do so. unfortunetly not all people will feel that way, quite possibly the majority. im ready to try a wallet that supports mst and will have to do so soon so i can explain how it works to all the n00bs.
web wallets can be secure if they are fully client side, but you take the risk that the javascript is not malicious unless you verify it everytime.i prefer bitcoind over electrum for 2 reasons - electrum is crap for signing multisigs. give it a go and you will see what i mean. other than transfering coins to a multi sig address it isnt multi sig compliant. - bitcoind has the whole blockchain. electrum requests the data for addresses it sends to a server. the server can then link your addresses and potentially deanonoymise you. on bitcoind you have the whole blockchain so no one can link nothing to you.having said that electrum is obviously more convenient and space saving. i have been working on a plugin for trying to fix multi sig signing on electrum but havent had as much time to devote to this as i would have liked recently. but will continue on it and hopefully have it out before electrum fix it!albert, one thing i would say though is to allow people to be able to verify the multi sig address is legit by giving them the public keys needed to recreate it (i.e. markets and vendors, buyer will already have his own key). pointless to have multi sig if the user cant generate the address themselves and verify it is legit.

**update 2**having closely studied what is posted above, i have come to the conclusion that,,, (gasp) oracle form the sr forum was probably correct in his theory & dox, last week.. not that i support doxxing, but his dox of "pritel" (internet name- mods do not delete) was pretty accurate.the dox included everything that the above post says; about the mtgox theft and other btc hacks.. turns out this guy "pritel" was bragging about how he helped code these sites and had found vulnerabilities in the btc protocol.. he says that he hit bitstamp, sr, and gox with ddos, flooded them with mutated transactions, and made a fortune..it all sounded, well- oracle- at the time, but now this bbmc update has come to light, i actually believe this guy "pritel" is a person of deep interest.i have a full, uncensored copy of "pritel" dox, and will post a redacted version of it below, so you can all see the relation and importance.. but no names or address will be included- so mods, dont freak out.to me, this now looks pretty conclusive. but only time will tell..> also, not to stir shit, but my explanation above still doesnt put defcon in the clear.. defcon hired "pritel" after a reccomendation from, non other than stexo.... so it is possible that they could all be sharing the profits behind the scenes. hence the repeated call for narco93- who probably doesnt exist and is likely a dropshpper from spain/ france....redacted dox of "pritel" will be posted soon...quote from: blackstar on february 26, 2014, 11:39:03 amwow, have you posted this there? this is incredible if true. mind if i share it?yeah, go for it, theres a lot of important information here... especially for the right people.. please repost.xsposer.
update from bbmc account... looks like theyre backing away from the defcon theory. but i dont know if i totally buy it- defcon still seems pretty shady to me.op=  http://silkroad6ownowfk.onion/items/here-is-the-stolen-silk-rd-walletbbmc is a full member of the british tor vendors association (btva)copy & pasted:(scroll down for the updates)_________________________________________________________ever get the feeling youve been swindled?https://blockchain.info/address/1grfntylwoyqnk7s3mffaz5qpkdwp7ysoytheyve been moving our bitcoins out of the sites " fac" wallet since the end of january. its only 5,770.000666 btcmore interesting is all the 777s ive been finding associated with silk road from this wallet:-https://blockchain.info/address/12nxd2x12wzeysjucbtm5nps3d81yh8skheach "777" payment marks a massive cashpile, there are 120 of them. the wallet has been busy again today. (19 feb)i believe the thief uses this wallet. i was worried that this info could compromise dpr;s trial, if it is bitcoin earned by him.ive even tried to make myself known to the wallet owner by firing in the numbers for v-e-n-d-o-r-b-b-m-c- (using 1 to 26)but ross cant be moving that money around, hes in custody.when defcon claimed to be unable to find the escrow funds in december, i felt sorry for him, so i found as many sr2.0 system wallets as i could for him, marked them from the 1ah wallet on dec 24th, then messaged support to let them know where dpr2 kept the money.https://blockchain.info/address/1ahynaomxdpd7bnnvxusy9fb1cdvieuqzzon thursday 13th feb, my escrow went missing again at about 18:30 uk time, along with those of other uk vendors. silk road support had been specifically asked not to steal from any of the british tor vendors association members. i was contacted by the btva, and asked to find our missing funds.it was very easy, and easier because i already had wallets such ashttps://blockchain.info/address/1facb8qnikfpuoo8wvfnyai3e1hcov9y8tmarked on 24 dec and 31 decthe irony that a thief was using small 777 bitcoin payments to mark his own swag piles wasnt lost on me.the 777ing wallet now has a 666 in itjust go and add up a few of those hundreds of fat wallets, all filled, then marked with wallethttps://blockchain.info/address/12nxd2x12wzeysjucbtm5nps3d81yh8skhin close succession.i havent added it all up, but it looks around half a billion dollars move and marked in february. most of that must be unspent historical silk road and sr2 earnings.whoever owns the android phone with bitcoin wallet 12nxd is the thief (i believe). my money is on defcon. and some of my money is with him. about 3 btc.if the thief hadnt misappropriated it from the brotherhood of british meth chemists, none of this need have happened**update 1**edit 20 feb ****it was an inside job, but not the current staff. the same goes for mt gox. i believe it is a programmer who coded the mt gox wallets, the sr2 wallets, and also set up thegaming sites which have been spamming the bitcoin network with micropayments.he hacked our investigators facebook in order to message him on feb 11th, (which he was investigating before being contracted by us), using the name "phibbo bit". this is the message:-"“some background: mtgox runs custom wallet software.this is a reasonable and common practice for a service of its size and nature.getting a wallet implementing right isn’t easy as there is very little room for error, much like the rest of the bitcoin system.some have criticized their use of custom software here but it is a reasonable and common practice for a service of its size and nature. the reference client’s wallet is basically suitable for small scale single party use. i would not recommend something like mtgox use the reference node wallet, at least not without a healthy layer of abstraction on top of it— relieving it of duties harder than key management and chain monitoring— or otherwise improving it greatly.(for that matter, mtgox’s wallet software has caused them fewer concerning problems than some other companies. (e.g. some have completely re-implemented the bitcoin protocol, incorrectly, and exposed it to the outside world and suffered numerous local blockchain rejecting glitches). though its certainly taken gox a fair amount of time to sort things out.)i first heard people reporting stuck transactions back in ~september. i looked into it and determined that mtgox was spending immature coins. freshly generated bitcoins (from mining) can not be spend until they are at least 100 blocks deep in the blockchain. this prevents the funds from vanishing forever if the chain reorgs. i pinged magicaltux and after a couple tries got a hold of him. i think they also wasted some time on dead ends trying to resolve this before the actual nature of the problem was brought to their attention, e.g. raising their transaction fees with a mistaken belief that their fees weren’t high enough.mtgox wasn’t tracking if the coins were freshly generated or what their height was in their software. including this data would apparently be a non-trivial change, and for high risk finance software even a trivial change takes a lot of work. i suggested a workaround (basically, just try to spend the oldest coins), and as far as i know they implemented it and it was effective.they continued to have problems with stuck transactions after, and further analysis revealed that they were producing transactions with excessively padded signatures. a minor tangent is required here:there is a design flaw in the bitcoin protocol where its possible for a third party to take a valid transaction of yours and mutate it in a way which leaves it valid and functionally identical but with a different transaction id. this greatly complicates writing correct wallet software, and it can be used abusively to invalidate long chains of unconfirmed transactions that depend on the non-mutant transaction (since transactions refer to each other by txid).this issue arises from several sources, one of them being openssl’s willingness to accept and make sense of signatures with invalid encodings. a normal ecdsa signature encodes two large integers, the encoding isn’t constant length— if there are leading zeros you are supposed to drop them.it’s easy to write software that assumes the signature will be a constant length and then leave extra leading zeros in them.in order to eventually remove this malleability flaw we’ve been gradually tightening the rules that govern what transactions nodes in the network will consider valid when they relay them or mine them. in bitcoin 0.8— after months of work chasing down software authors to get them to fix their bugs transactions with these invalid encodings were no longer relayed.this caused some problems for a few things.. for example bc.i’s iphone app— bc.i itself had been fixed long before but they couldn’t update the iphone app without fear of triggering another review by apple. eventually this was just worked around on the server side by mutating the transactions produced by the iphone wallets. (and is moot now, i guess!).mtgox also had problems with occasionally producing invalid signatures. this would normally be a simple fix. e.g. here is an example where i fixed this type of issue in some python wallet code i’ve never used (but saw a lot of people were copying): https://github.com/…/4c64603ab60b0fa23c51090b3112be2f16…but as i said before, in high value systems like mtgox, even simple fixes aren’t simple and it took them quite some time to deploy a fix. however, i believe that it is actually fixed now.my current understanding and inference is that the remaining issues are because while mtgox was producing transactions of the bad form that the network won’t relay anymore— some people decided to help out by ‘fixing’ these transactions like bc.i did for iphone users— making the signatures normal and broadcasting them. of course, the new transactions— while functionally identical— have different txids.the difference here is that the mtgox wallet software appears to have not handled this case gracefully at all, and apparently simply wouldn’t notice transactions that it “didn’t make” spending its own coins.as a result the mtgox wallet believed some coins were available for spending which really had already been spent and it began double spending those inputs. this may have interacted particularly poorly with the earlier workaround i mentioned— trying to always use the oldest available coins— if they did implement that workaround.worse, some of this may have resulted in users getting paid multiple times and could have been intentionally triggered with that end in mind if someone helpfully fixed some transactions and then noticed they got paid twice. (i think this is unlikely to have caused large losses, before people run off worrying about that, both because of the reuse of the oldest inputs and because of the hot wallet/cold wallet split).at this point they likely have an accounting mess to clean up— figuring out who did and didn’t get paid now with none of the txids matching. cleaning that up will be somewhat tricky e.g. say there were three payments of mtgox coins to 1apple in the block chain… and three users that attempted to pay 1apple, and mtgox’s records thinks that only one went through.. etc. so software will have to be written that matches up transactions with their mutants in order to figure out what went where.i am not personally concerned— at least not by any of the details here. mtgox’s slow speed at resolving these sorts of issues and poor communications are not terribly inspiring. they seem to be horribly short staffed— but competent and trustworthy people in this space may be hard to find: the regulatory morass of that business is sure to make many steer clear.the claims that the delays indicate insolvency strike me as just hysteria: the technical background doesn’t support this conclusion, and there may be a bit of opportunism at play from people who want to manipulate the market too. don’t get me wrong: i have not seen their books: gox may well have financial problems— though with their income its hard for me to see how— but if any problems like that exist they’re not being indicated here.of course, none of this suggests anyone should be happy with the service mtgox has been providing, but our anger should at least be well informed.february 11 at 2:02am ”(that wasn’t the uk time, it is from a copy saved by another recipient)i still think defcon is full of shit, with his “we will prevail” our community shit. but i don’t think the boy dunnit.".........................redbookthe bbmc team_________________________________________________________there you have it.. take from it what you will.... but i still wont be going anywhere near sr.xsposer.

quote from: jolly roger on february 25, 2014, 05:57:28 pmquote from: ronin on february 25, 2014, 02:29:28 pmi have to disagree with this guy1) if the server doesnt give you the opportunity to verify the address then its not worth it. they could give you a multi sig that is 2/2 with addresses both controlled by the market. this opens you up to obvious scams. dont fall for what he is proposing. verify the address and protect yourself from scams.excuse me. first of all, your accusations about me are very offensive. accusing me that i am trying to get you all to "fall for something". and i do not think you completely understand the entire process of multisignature addresses to make the claims you are making. #1) how is this any more risky than the escrow system that markets had before? the markets were controlling the funds 100% and getting robbed and cleaned out on several occasions. people were placing trust in markets before and now suddenly you are worried about getting scammed? where were you speaking out with the old escrow system?im sorry that you feel offended but dont think i have said anything below the belt. you are proposing a multi sig escrow solution which doesnt protect the buyer from rogue markets or incompetent developers. kind of poinltess in my opionion.regarding risk compared to previous, its the same, market could go rogue or loose all its coins due to incompetent devs. whats your point? you are proposing a solution that still exposes users to the same problems. and its not a sudden worry. i have raised the issue of mutli sig way before the sr2 debacle. take the time to go through my postings on this forum and others and you will see i have been a long term proponent of multi sig. way beforfe it became fashinable.quote from: jolly roger on february 25, 2014, 05:57:28 pmquote from: ronin on february 25, 2014, 02:29:28 pm2) also it makes no sense for the market to hide this, if the buyer/seller wanted to avoid fees they could set up their own 2/2 escrow. also in the situation jolly roger describes above the buyer could sign a transaction sending all funds to vendor, and then vendor verifies and also signs the transaction. funds released, market bypassed. the market is not protected in 2/3.#2) yes, they (buyer and seller) could set up their own 2/2 escrow outside the market, but this would be stupid because having a 2/3 makes it possible for the market to become the arbitrator. in a 2/2, only one of the people involved has to be a scammer, and then the funds are locked forever. with 2/3, if the buyer tries to scam, then the market can provide the second key to unlock the funds to send to the seller. this is why 2/3 is better than 2/2. also in the case of 2/3, the market cannot be bypassed without the redeemscript generated at the time that the multisignature address is created. if the market holds the redeemscript in a 2/3 multisignature address, then the buyer and seller cannot complete the transaction on the side without the market and therefore cut out the markets fees. another security issue with releasing all 3 public keys involved is that it lets the participants know whether or not the seller, buyer, or server are reusing a private key and therefore making them more susceptible to attacks.it doesnt benefit the scammer financially to pull a scam. which removes most of the motive. i agree 2/3 is better, but not if the market doesnt allow the buyer/vendor to confirm the address (as you are proposing). i wouldnt touch a market that insists on hiding the details of the address from you. its too open to abuse/incompetence.agreed re: the redeem script. but the market cant really withold the script if someone can generate it themselves from the original inputs.i dont think its a security issue if the buyer/vendor can see the market is reusing the same keys. this would be an excellent way of people being able to ascertain if the market is coded by an incompetent.quote from: jolly roger on february 25, 2014, 05:57:28 pmquote from: ronin on february 25, 2014, 02:29:28 pm3) the market would rely on getting income through signing a transaction which sends most funds to vendor, and commision to market. this would then be signed by the buyer when he is happy. if the buyer starts bypassing the market fee transaction then he is banned. but to hide it all away from the user and not give them the ability to be able to verify addresses, avoid this market set up. its not healthy. #3) it is harder to verify you might think to see if the buyer and seller are closing the deal on the side. unless the market is constantly searching through the blockchain for funds spent from that multisignature address, it would be extremely difficult to verify that a buyer and seller are bypassing the market to cut out their fees. i dont see the issue here. what is difficult about this exactly? anyone running the bitcond client is always getting every transaction. the databse holding transactions could be checked for transactions once a week that are older than one month. any such transaction which has the funds removed from the address would be flagged as having done a deal outside the market. account banned. i could probably write a bash script to do this fairly quickly. am i missing something here? what is the difficulty?quote from: jolly roger on february 25, 2014, 05:57:28 pmquote from: ronin on february 25, 2014, 02:29:28 pmi would warn anyone away from the setup jolly roger is promoting. will lead to more scams in the future, and it will not allow you to verify multi sig is setup correctly.so what you are basically saying here is that the market should trust the buyers, but the buyers should not trust the market. the market has every incentive to keep the ability to unlock funds itself out of its own hands, so that it is not a target for hackers. if the market has the ability to unlock the funds without any buyer or seller input, it would make the market very dangerous and this is not desirable and defeats the purpose of it for the markets. but giving out the 3 keys and the redeemscript to the buyer and seller gives them the ability to close the deal outside the market and bypass fees. again, if you are not able to trust your market, then yes, contact the seller and say you want to do a 2/2 with your seller outside of the market, and you can easily set one up. but with fees at an average of 5%, bypassing the fees will become more common than you think and is harder to detect than you think. especially when you are dealing with thousands of transactions.ronin, i understand what you are saying and you make a valid point that it would likely be desirable for a buyer to have this setup. but it is not desireable for a market to have this setup, since the market relies on market fees and by giving your customers the ability to cut you out of the deal is bad for business. there are plenty of free 2/2 and 2/3 multisignature services out there now that you can use. if you are not comfortable using the markets system, then use another one that gives you the 3 public keys. but if you expect the markets to start giving you the ability to bypass their commissions, then you will likely never be happy. i do not think it makes sense for markets to do this. the cost of running a market is high and by allowing your buyers to not "pay their taxes" so to speak, is a dumb move for the market. again, i reiterate. if you do not trust your market, do a 2/2 or a 2/3 outside of the market. you make the choice.i think it has already been shown that markets suffer from fraudulent owners or incompetent developers. i am not saying markets shouldnt charge a fee. but i am also not proposing a solution that offers no benefits unless you abolutely trust the markets honesty and development abiity, which recent events have shown arent a good bet.i think this benefits everyone involved. while i hear what you are saying about maintaining the dominance of markets and that users should trust them with multi sig, i respectfully disagree, i think its an appalling setup, and will only lead to more scams and hacks. it sovles nothing and doesnt move us towards a trustless system.

the pump and dump was done by wall street after sr1 fell. they pumped it past 1000. then did a massive sell off. rumor has is chase banking cartel used the fast profits they made in bitcoin to help fund the development of their version of bitcoin.
if the sr1 forums are still available online you should be able to find the whole sad saga easily enough. as i remember it, limetless vouched for vladimirs "bitcoin hedge fund" which was offering silly returns and was an obvious ponzi scheme. ultimately vladimir disappeared with the funds after he was late on some payments and began receiving calls at his workplace. and not long afterwards limetless "had an overdose" and disappeared from the scene.does anybody else remember this or have a link to a mirror of the sr1 forums? i wonder what ever became of that cast of screen names.

1) buy all the bitcoins in existance2) advertise everywhere that bitcoins are the best thing since sliced bread3) sell the bitcoinsi say pump you say dumppump
im not sure where they are pulling their btc rate from. its also entirely possible that due to the rapid fall and an expected quick rebound that the devs locked it temporarily to keep customers from drastically over spending. ofc this would have been a bad move if the rebound had not happened as it would have put a burden back onto us vendors, but overall i cant blame them for doing it. honestly, it was probably a good move in favor of the customers at the time, but since it looks like btc is going to be back on the rise now that the whole fear of gox collapsing is over they should put it back on auto tracking.
yea and unlike sr where the theif is virtually anonymous, fatfuck has to worry about more than moving coins around. he needs to worry about moving himself around, his doxx are pretty much public record. almost feel bad for the guy... almost

quote from: axa on february 26, 2014, 02:28:36 pmsecurity of bitcoin depends on the blockchain being held in full by many people. bitcoin-qt and armory do exactly that. however, given enough copies of the blockchain, one can assume the system is secure from the data being lost and rely on other nodes to provide the information we require when we need it. many users like having the whole blockchain available to them, but if that is a problem for you use a lightweight wallet like electrum. of all the wallets available, only armory and electrum only need to be backed up once, ever.  be careful with web wallets, they have been hacked before. keeping your bitcoin locally using a client on your own computer is always more secure.i can see no reason to use a web wallet unless you have a small amount on there.it has to be armory as the most secure at moment.
i wasnt trying it on a macbook i was trying it on an imac with an optical drive but was trying to boot tails from usb not cd.the proccess is fairly complicated. there are a few methods to do it but the only one i got to work was installing via command line. there are directions on the site that explain how to do this, and you can simply copy/paste the commands and replace the <iso goes here> with the .iso by compy/pasting it to the command line when it asks for its directory.for me it simply would not install this way and it was because i was missing a command that was not in the instructions. something retarded like ~dev at the end of a certain command. after about 5 hours of trying i figured this out and got it to successfully install.next you need a bootloader because mac has an efi loader instead. for this they say you need refind which is an older version of refit. i could not get it to install because i already had refit on there with no hopes to remove it. when i turned on my computer the usb drive shows up but only boots to a blank screen and goes no where. after a few more hours of tinkinering i gave up.

(he just went down like that!). and there are many other good reasons to run 10.6 and nothing after. and even better reasons to run linux/tails, ect. so dont give up just yet, k? we are all here to help! try what i mentioned above and just lemmie know, k? peacemirageoki ^^ thanks for the encouragement, i wont give up yet i would get on the burning onto the dvd-r, but my cd drive is all jacked up  i put a cd in, itll never coma back out, unless i manage to pull it out ... will usb work ?i really want to avoid buying anything extra at this point (runnin low on cash) like an external cd drive or something
shared send is gone my friend ^^.  and op i have been having issues with tails using shared coin, it simply wont let me do it. it says "loading" but nothing is working or happening (the box stays greyish rather than the blue "clickable" button". i thought it was just me.

tails leaves javascript enabled by default because they want to match the tbb fingerprint as closely as possible. get the tbb to fix it and tails will change without hesitation.
https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser/designhttps://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/5286basically, tails want to look exactly the same as tbb to a web server. if noscript is enabled by default in tbb, tails will change theirs to reflect the new design.of course, you could actually build your own tails with javascript turned off. there are instructions on how to roll your own tails on the website. here is the commit tree so you can how it was sup up before you got it.

quote from: jolly roger on february 25, 2014, 05:57:28 pmquote from: ronin on february 25, 2014, 02:29:28 pmi have to disagree with this guy1) if the server doesnt give you the opportunity to verify the address then its not worth it. they could give you a multi sig that is 2/2 with addresses both controlled by the market. this opens you up to obvious scams. dont fall for what he is proposing. verify the address and protect yourself from scams.excuse me. first of all, your accusations about me are very offensive. accusing me that i am trying to get you all to "fall for something". and i do not think you completely understand the entire process of multisignature addresses to make the claims you are making. #1) how is this any more risky than the escrow system that markets had before? the markets were controlling the funds 100% and getting robbed and cleaned out on several occasions. people were placing trust in markets before and now suddenly you are worried about getting scammed? where were you speaking out with the old escrow system?im sorry that you feel offended but dont think i have said anything below the belt. you are proposing a multi sig escrow solution which doesnt protect the buyer from rogue markets or incompetent developers. kind of poinltess in my opionion.regarding risk compared to previous, its the same, market could go rogue or loose all its coins due to incompetent devs. whats your point? you are proposing a solution that still exposes users to the same problems. and its not a sudden worry. i have raised the issue of mutli sig way before the sr2 debacle. take the time to go through my postings on this forum and others and you will see i have been a long term proponent of multi sig. way beforfe it became fashinable.quote from: jolly roger on february 25, 2014, 05:57:28 pmquote from: ronin on february 25, 2014, 02:29:28 pm2) also it makes no sense for the market to hide this, if the buyer/seller wanted to avoid fees they could set up their own 2/2 escrow. also in the situation jolly roger describes above the buyer could sign a transaction sending all funds to vendor, and then vendor verifies and also signs the transaction. funds released, market bypassed. the market is not protected in 2/3.#2) yes, they (buyer and seller) could set up their own 2/2 escrow outside the market, but this would be stupid because having a 2/3 makes it possible for the market to become the arbitrator. in a 2/2, only one of the people involved has to be a scammer, and then the funds are locked forever. with 2/3, if the buyer tries to scam, then the market can provide the second key to unlock the funds to send to the seller. this is why 2/3 is better than 2/2. also in the case of 2/3, the market cannot be bypassed without the redeemscript generated at the time that the multisignature address is created. if the market holds the redeemscript in a 2/3 multisignature address, then the buyer and seller cannot complete the transaction on the side without the market and therefore cut out the markets fees. another security issue with releasing all 3 public keys involved is that it lets the participants know whether or not the seller, buyer, or server are reusing a private key and therefore making them more susceptible to attacks.it doesnt benefit the scammer financially to pull a scam. which removes most of the motive. i agree 2/3 is better, but not if the market doesnt allow the buyer/vendor to confirm the address (as you are proposing). i wouldnt touch a market that insists on hiding the details of the address from you. its too open to abuse/incompetence.agreed re: the redeem script. but the market cant really withold the script if someone can generate it themselves from the original inputs.i dont think its a security issue if the buyer/vendor can see the market is reusing the same keys. this would be an excellent way of people being able to ascertain if the market is coded by an incompetent.quote from: jolly roger on february 25, 2014, 05:57:28 pmquote from: ronin on february 25, 2014, 02:29:28 pm3) the market would rely on getting income through signing a transaction which sends most funds to vendor, and commision to market. this would then be signed by the buyer when he is happy. if the buyer starts bypassing the market fee transaction then he is banned. but to hide it all away from the user and not give them the ability to be able to verify addresses, avoid this market set up. its not healthy. #3) it is harder to verify you might think to see if the buyer and seller are closing the deal on the side. unless the market is constantly searching through the blockchain for funds spent from that multisignature address, it would be extremely difficult to verify that a buyer and seller are bypassing the market to cut out their fees. i dont see the issue here. what is difficult about this exactly? anyone running the bitcond client is always getting every transaction. the databse holding transactions could be checked for transactions once a week that are older than one month. any such transaction which has the funds removed from the address would be flagged as having done a deal outside the market. account banned. i could probably write a bash script to do this fairly quickly. am i missing something here? what is the difficulty?quote from: jolly roger on february 25, 2014, 05:57:28 pmquote from: ronin on february 25, 2014, 02:29:28 pmi would warn anyone away from the setup jolly roger is promoting. will lead to more scams in the future, and it will not allow you to verify multi sig is setup correctly.so what you are basically saying here is that the market should trust the buyers, but the buyers should not trust the market. the market has every incentive to keep the ability to unlock funds itself out of its own hands, so that it is not a target for hackers. if the market has the ability to unlock the funds without any buyer or seller input, it would make the market very dangerous and this is not desirable and defeats the purpose of it for the markets. but giving out the 3 keys and the redeemscript to the buyer and seller gives them the ability to close the deal outside the market and bypass fees. again, if you are not able to trust your market, then yes, contact the seller and say you want to do a 2/2 with your seller outside of the market, and you can easily set one up. but with fees at an average of 5%, bypassing the fees will become more common than you think and is harder to detect than you think. especially when you are dealing with thousands of transactions.ronin, i understand what you are saying and you make a valid point that it would likely be desirable for a buyer to have this setup. but it is not desireable for a market to have this setup, since the market relies on market fees and by giving your customers the ability to cut you out of the deal is bad for business. there are plenty of free 2/2 and 2/3 multisignature services out there now that you can use. if you are not comfortable using the markets system, then use another one that gives you the 3 public keys. but if you expect the markets to start giving you the ability to bypass their commissions, then you will likely never be happy. i do not think it makes sense for markets to do this. the cost of running a market is high and by allowing your buyers to not "pay their taxes" so to speak, is a dumb move for the market. again, i reiterate. if you do not trust your market, do a 2/2 or a 2/3 outside of the market. you make the choice.i think it has already been shown that markets suffer from fraudulent owners or incompetent developers. i am not saying markets shouldnt charge a fee. but i am also not proposing a solution that offers no benefits unless you abolutely trust the markets honesty and development abiity, which recent events have shown arent a good bet.i think this benefits everyone involved. while i hear what you are saying about maintaining the dominance of markets and that users should trust them with multi sig, i respectfully disagree, i think its an appalling setup, and will only lead to more scams and hacks. it sovles nothing and doesnt move us towards a trustless system.
quote from: blackstar on february 26, 2014, 05:03:11 amyea man im sorry. hopefully there is some legal recouse that can be implemented to lean on them to pay coins back. im not sure if they all got stolen or what. it wouldnt suprise me if the us feds didnt have ahand in it. seems like more and more coins are going "missing" or into wallets that are sitting still. we know how bad the feds want btc gone.. who knows though. im genuinely sorry for all involved in gox.i read somewhere where 700,000 btc had been stolen from mtgox and they never told anyone.
as a legal tax paying business surely there is aduty of care and reimbursement here. i mean whether btc are seen as legit or not they were providing a service and they have failed on that right?
i dont think its any excuse for sr, its a dark net site, security is the biggest issue. of course it is for mtgox but fucking hell you dont expect a darknet market to be vulnerable thats the whole point of doing illegal activity online, security.
until/if mt gox comes back online nothing can be done.
i have a feeling that they disabled registration to help deal with all the users whose bitcoins were already missing due to the "negative balance bug", the users whose bitcoins do not show as "pending", and other users who will not be getting repaid.

im sure you know this, but ill mention it anyway.  blockchain.info is very javascript heavy so you need it enabled for that site.i dont use tails, just the tor browser bundle. here is my expereince with shared send on blockchain.info since it was modified to use sharedcoin.com several weeks ago.it can be very slow. the little popup that happens when you start a transaction can take a long time to complete.  sometimes it will not complete.when the transaction is initiated it will take longer to confirm than a standard transaction.  sometimes a couple hours. sometimes a full day.rather than do a shared send to a vendor i now have a separate wallet in blockchain.info that i do a shared send to.  i keep some btc there so that when i want to use it i can transfer directly from there to a vendor.  that way i am not concerned with the reliability or time for a shared send.
has anyone been having problems with their tails freezing while they try to do a shared coin send? is there a way i can avoid this in the future?

any of you guys want to start a bitcoin exchange with me?we can all split half a billion dollars!
yeah bitcoin is to money as torrent is to download.it is not centralized which means instead of running on one server which if shut down would be the end it is running on 1000s upon 1000s of computers and servers so in order for it to be shut down you would need to shut down every computer running it aka the whole internet.this is precisely how the next generation of darkent markets need to be designed.
like, man, it aint no "movement" at all, just a secret place to buy and sell stuff. and, like any other marketplace on the planet, if they cant properly manage the folks property or, worse, if they cant keep their hands out of the cookie jar, then theyve failed at being a market, and will wither away with all the other frauds.
here is another tip. if you have no foil bags and want to ship something that will smell, you can use pvc pipe. get anything from 1" to 4", larger than that and it gets very heavy. look for thinwall. get end caps and the glue. put your goods in the pipe section you cut off, glue on the end caps and wait a bit for them to dry. you now have an odor proof container to send out and it wont set off any metal detectors either.

well, ive been playing around with the idea of having a secure multi-sigs implementation at tba for a while now, and been toying around with a number of different bitcoin clients that currently support a 2/3 transaction in some form or another. and ive had folks pm me with their ideas asto why we should have such a system in place, as well as why they believe not. so id set it up for a debate amongst our users.. and having heard both sides of the argument, the overwhelming choice was for in favor of a multi-sig integration.. despite the niggles and constraints it presented to an end-user.with various bicoin clients out there, i was wondering what the spread was like and hence the poll. maybe if you could also drop in a line or two asto why you use/prefer the said client over another - thatd be totally awesome. though am pretty close to having had worked out a fine balance for how to go about it, without it being too complicated (as some users suggested it seemed) id like to know what people out here use as their favorite bitcoin client.
the most convenient way to buy bitcoin in the usa is through coinbase (https://coinbase.com). once you link your bank account you can purchase bitcoin with your checking account and receive the bitcoin in your coinbase account in 3-4 days. coinbase charges a 1% fee to buy or sell bitcoin, and customers with verified id can buy or sell up to 50 bitcoin per day instantly. anyone can use the coinbase wallet but at present you need a usa bank account to buy or sell bitcoin.localbitcoins.com (https://localbitcoins.com/) allows you to buy bitcoin in person from local traders using cash or from sellers online and has an escrow service built in.mycelium (http://mycelium.com/) -  the mycelium mobile wallet for android has a local trader feature built in that lets you find local sellers offering bitcoin for in person trades using cash.cash into coins (https://cashintocoins.com/index.php) is a new service (us only) that allows you to deposit cash at your local bank and receive bitcoins in about a day. can bitcoin be purchased using paypal? yes, there are sellers on localbitcoins.com who accept paypal (https://localbitcoins.com/buy-bitcoins-online/paypal/?ch=nho). you can also use paypal or your credit card to purchase bitcoin through the bitcoin insanity (http://www.bitcoininsanity.com/) service.for more ways to buy bitcoin browse the clearnet list on bitcoin wiki at https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/buying_bitcoinsremember you will have to make your newly purchased bitcoin anonymous by using a mixing service like bitcoin fog. best practice is to keep a separate bitcoin wallet for coins that have been mixed. once sent through bitcoin fog the coins can not be traced back to you.

you have to make sure that noscript is allowing both blockchain.info and sharedcoin.comalso, i have noticed if you have an address that has mupltiple inputs, sharedcoin doesnt like them at all and tends to fail. its easier to sweep them all into one address and send.
this is where they say they can see your ip though in the tor section
anyone used bizniz from sr2? any info/discussion would be appreciated, thanks.
this brings some credibility to sr theft.  if mt gox gets robbed anyone else can too.

this looks good. i like the wot rating system.
i just signed up. im mpressed by the layout as well as their "trust" system.i would feel confident placing an order through torescrow.
howdy,blackbanks system takes the commission before starting the escrow transaction.  the transaction only has a single output instead of two.this way, blackbank is more than happy to allow vendors/buyers to finalize outside of blackbank.  the only trust issue would be if blackbank offers support if there are problems.  however, that is a lot less risky than traditional centralized escrow systems and easier for the buyer/vendor.  im sure buyer/vendor would prioritize verifying that the funds/transactions over verifying support.however, i still promise to continue support with any issues; ive been offering advice and support outside of blackbank entirely, even to members of other markets.  its important to help each other in the community.  growing a safe and secure community is mutually beneficial for everyone, regardless of immediate financial gain.cheers,mdparity

i have to imagine its taken quite a toll on you.[11:43] <magicaltux> well, first i would guess is my health[11:43] <jonwickedfire> what do you mean?[11:44] <magicaltux> took on more than 30kg since handling mtgox[11:44] <magicaltux> (compensating for stress by eating)[11:47] <jonwickedfire> im guessing stress from lack of sleep too, like now..[11:48] <magicaltux> heh[11:48] <magicaltux> and drinking liters of coca cola[11:48] <magicaltux> how american[11:48] <magicaltux> (almost american, actually, since some people see coca cola as being non-american)[11:52] <jonwickedfire> lol[11:54] <magicaltux> anyway[11:54] <magicaltux> i should try to get some sleep[11:55] <magicaltux> already 2am[11:55] <magicaltux> waking up in 4 hours[11:55] <jonwickedfire> err[11:55] <jonwickedfire> one more thing..[11:55] <magicaltux> and starting to be tired of pushing my keyboard so it stays on the desk[11:56] <jonwickedfire> do you still believe in the viability of an unregulated digital currency like bitcoin tho?[11:57] <magicaltux> difficult[11:57] <magicaltux> tbqh the pressure we got from banks and governments makes things very hard[11:58] <jonwickedfire> do you think if it were regulated it would make it easier to work things out?[11:58] <magicaltux> partially[11:58] <jonwickedfire> how so?[11:59] <magicaltux> well, first avoid being blocked by banks and governments around the world[11:59] <magicaltux> if regulated, it means that as long as you follow the regulations youre fine[12:00] <jonwickedfire> the biggest question people really have asked though is are you personally vested in mtgox with your own btc?[12:01] <jonwickedfire> and whether or not you, like everyone else, have taken a personal hit and are in the same boat as they are in terms of taking a loss/hit from the recent events?[12:01] <magicaltux> [02:00:59] <jonwickedfire> and whether or not you, like everyone else, have taken a personal hit and are in the same boat as they are in terms of taking a loss/hit from the recent events?

something like that: why do we fall? - 9gag[12:09] <magicaltux> well, well see how this one goes anyway[12:16] <jonwickedfire> well, id like to chat more, but i know youre pushing to go to sleep.[12:17] <jonwickedfire> and so long as you are saying youre not disappearing from this.. thats okay.[12:17] <jonwickedfire> i still think you should say something more to all these people or at least reveal how much youve taken a hit for, personally..[12:17] <jonwickedfire> it would show them that you are still on their side.[12:19] <jonwickedfire> by the way, that whole removal from the foundation, did you decide to leave that before or after the chats with them to help save gox versus let it fail?

had some coin in there to day trade with, which is pretty easy to profit from in a volatile market like gox when you can see the order book and know when the spikes would happen. i never bothered to leave an aml trail because it was easy enough to withdraw profits as btc sell on localbitcoins.now it appears im shit out of luck for rest of it stuck in there.

bitcoin qt also messed up my computer and i dont like the idea of the client having to store the entire blockchain on my computer. i use blockchain.info because it is pretty damn simple and has never given me problems. however, i know i will have to sacrafice conveinience for security and i am happy to do so. unfortunetly not all people will feel that way, quite possibly the majority. im ready to try a wallet that supports mst and will have to do so soon so i can explain how it works to all the n00bs.
web wallets can be secure if they are fully client side, but you take the risk that the javascript is not malicious unless you verify it everytime.i prefer bitcoind over electrum for 2 reasons - electrum is crap for signing multisigs. give it a go and you will see what i mean. other than transfering coins to a multi sig address it isnt multi sig compliant. - bitcoind has the whole blockchain. electrum requests the data for addresses it sends to a server. the server can then link your addresses and potentially deanonoymise you. on bitcoind you have the whole blockchain so no one can link nothing to you.having said that electrum is obviously more convenient and space saving. i have been working on a plugin for trying to fix multi sig signing on electrum but havent had as much time to devote to this as i would have liked recently. but will continue on it and hopefully have it out before electrum fix it!albert, one thing i would say though is to allow people to be able to verify the multi sig address is legit by giving them the public keys needed to recreate it (i.e. markets and vendors, buyer will already have his own key). pointless to have multi sig if the user cant generate the address themselves and verify it is legit.

im not sure where they are pulling their btc rate from. its also entirely possible that due to the rapid fall and an expected quick rebound that the devs locked it temporarily to keep customers from drastically over spending. ofc this would have been a bad move if the rebound had not happened as it would have put a burden back onto us vendors, but overall i cant blame them for doing it. honestly, it was probably a good move in favor of the customers at the time, but since it looks like btc is going to be back on the rise now that the whole fear of gox collapsing is over they should put it back on auto tracking.

quote from: axa on february 26, 2014, 02:28:36 pmsecurity of bitcoin depends on the blockchain being held in full by many people. bitcoin-qt and armory do exactly that. however, given enough copies of the blockchain, one can assume the system is secure from the data being lost and rely on other nodes to provide the information we require when we need it. many users like having the whole blockchain available to them, but if that is a problem for you use a lightweight wallet like electrum. of all the wallets available, only armory and electrum only need to be backed up once, ever.  be careful with web wallets, they have been hacked before. keeping your bitcoin locally using a client on your own computer is always more secure.i can see no reason to use a web wallet unless you have a small amount on there.it has to be armory as the most secure at moment.
i wasnt trying it on a macbook i was trying it on an imac with an optical drive but was trying to boot tails from usb not cd.the proccess is fairly complicated. there are a few methods to do it but the only one i got to work was installing via command line. there are directions on the site that explain how to do this, and you can simply copy/paste the commands and replace the <iso goes here> with the .iso by compy/pasting it to the command line when it asks for its directory.for me it simply would not install this way and it was because i was missing a command that was not in the instructions. something retarded like ~dev at the end of a certain command. after about 5 hours of trying i figured this out and got it to successfully install.next you need a bootloader because mac has an efi loader instead. for this they say you need refind which is an older version of refit. i could not get it to install because i already had refit on there with no hopes to remove it. when i turned on my computer the usb drive shows up but only boots to a blank screen and goes no where. after a few more hours of tinkinering i gave up.

(he just went down like that!). and there are many other good reasons to run 10.6 and nothing after. and even better reasons to run linux/tails, ect. so dont give up just yet, k? we are all here to help! try what i mentioned above and just lemmie know, k? peacemirageoki ^^ thanks for the encouragement, i wont give up yet i would get on the burning onto the dvd-r, but my cd drive is all jacked up  i put a cd in, itll never coma back out, unless i manage to pull it out ... will usb work ?i really want to avoid buying anything extra at this point (runnin low on cash) like an external cd drive or something

tails leaves javascript enabled by default because they want to match the tbb fingerprint as closely as possible. get the tbb to fix it and tails will change without hesitation.
https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser/designhttps://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/5286basically, tails want to look exactly the same as tbb to a web server. if noscript is enabled by default in tbb, tails will change theirs to reflect the new design.of course, you could actually build your own tails with javascript turned off. there are instructions on how to roll your own tails on the website. here is the commit tree so you can how it was sup up before you got it.

quote from: jolly roger on february 25, 2014, 05:57:28 pmquote from: ronin on february 25, 2014, 02:29:28 pmi have to disagree with this guy1) if the server doesnt give you the opportunity to verify the address then its not worth it. they could give you a multi sig that is 2/2 with addresses both controlled by the market. this opens you up to obvious scams. dont fall for what he is proposing. verify the address and protect yourself from scams.excuse me. first of all, your accusations about me are very offensive. accusing me that i am trying to get you all to "fall for something". and i do not think you completely understand the entire process of multisignature addresses to make the claims you are making. #1) how is this any more risky than the escrow system that markets had before? the markets were controlling the funds 100% and getting robbed and cleaned out on several occasions. people were placing trust in markets before and now suddenly you are worried about getting scammed? where were you speaking out with the old escrow system?im sorry that you feel offended but dont think i have said anything below the belt. you are proposing a multi sig escrow solution which doesnt protect the buyer from rogue markets or incompetent developers. kind of poinltess in my opionion.regarding risk compared to previous, its the same, market could go rogue or loose all its coins due to incompetent devs. whats your point? you are proposing a solution that still exposes users to the same problems. and its not a sudden worry. i have raised the issue of mutli sig way before the sr2 debacle. take the time to go through my postings on this forum and others and you will see i have been a long term proponent of multi sig. way beforfe it became fashinable.quote from: jolly roger on february 25, 2014, 05:57:28 pmquote from: ronin on february 25, 2014, 02:29:28 pm2) also it makes no sense for the market to hide this, if the buyer/seller wanted to avoid fees they could set up their own 2/2 escrow. also in the situation jolly roger describes above the buyer could sign a transaction sending all funds to vendor, and then vendor verifies and also signs the transaction. funds released, market bypassed. the market is not protected in 2/3.#2) yes, they (buyer and seller) could set up their own 2/2 escrow outside the market, but this would be stupid because having a 2/3 makes it possible for the market to become the arbitrator. in a 2/2, only one of the people involved has to be a scammer, and then the funds are locked forever. with 2/3, if the buyer tries to scam, then the market can provide the second key to unlock the funds to send to the seller. this is why 2/3 is better than 2/2. also in the case of 2/3, the market cannot be bypassed without the redeemscript generated at the time that the multisignature address is created. if the market holds the redeemscript in a 2/3 multisignature address, then the buyer and seller cannot complete the transaction on the side without the market and therefore cut out the markets fees. another security issue with releasing all 3 public keys involved is that it lets the participants know whether or not the seller, buyer, or server are reusing a private key and therefore making them more susceptible to attacks.it doesnt benefit the scammer financially to pull a scam. which removes most of the motive. i agree 2/3 is better, but not if the market doesnt allow the buyer/vendor to confirm the address (as you are proposing). i wouldnt touch a market that insists on hiding the details of the address from you. its too open to abuse/incompetence.agreed re: the redeem script. but the market cant really withold the script if someone can generate it themselves from the original inputs.i dont think its a security issue if the buyer/vendor can see the market is reusing the same keys. this would be an excellent way of people being able to ascertain if the market is coded by an incompetent.quote from: jolly roger on february 25, 2014, 05:57:28 pmquote from: ronin on february 25, 2014, 02:29:28 pm3) the market would rely on getting income through signing a transaction which sends most funds to vendor, and commision to market. this would then be signed by the buyer when he is happy. if the buyer starts bypassing the market fee transaction then he is banned. but to hide it all away from the user and not give them the ability to be able to verify addresses, avoid this market set up. its not healthy. #3) it is harder to verify you might think to see if the buyer and seller are closing the deal on the side. unless the market is constantly searching through the blockchain for funds spent from that multisignature address, it would be extremely difficult to verify that a buyer and seller are bypassing the market to cut out their fees. i dont see the issue here. what is difficult about this exactly? anyone running the bitcond client is always getting every transaction. the databse holding transactions could be checked for transactions once a week that are older than one month. any such transaction which has the funds removed from the address would be flagged as having done a deal outside the market. account banned. i could probably write a bash script to do this fairly quickly. am i missing something here? what is the difficulty?quote from: jolly roger on february 25, 2014, 05:57:28 pmquote from: ronin on february 25, 2014, 02:29:28 pmi would warn anyone away from the setup jolly roger is promoting. will lead to more scams in the future, and it will not allow you to verify multi sig is setup correctly.so what you are basically saying here is that the market should trust the buyers, but the buyers should not trust the market. the market has every incentive to keep the ability to unlock funds itself out of its own hands, so that it is not a target for hackers. if the market has the ability to unlock the funds without any buyer or seller input, it would make the market very dangerous and this is not desirable and defeats the purpose of it for the markets. but giving out the 3 keys and the redeemscript to the buyer and seller gives them the ability to close the deal outside the market and bypass fees. again, if you are not able to trust your market, then yes, contact the seller and say you want to do a 2/2 with your seller outside of the market, and you can easily set one up. but with fees at an average of 5%, bypassing the fees will become more common than you think and is harder to detect than you think. especially when you are dealing with thousands of transactions.ronin, i understand what you are saying and you make a valid point that it would likely be desirable for a buyer to have this setup. but it is not desireable for a market to have this setup, since the market relies on market fees and by giving your customers the ability to cut you out of the deal is bad for business. there are plenty of free 2/2 and 2/3 multisignature services out there now that you can use. if you are not comfortable using the markets system, then use another one that gives you the 3 public keys. but if you expect the markets to start giving you the ability to bypass their commissions, then you will likely never be happy. i do not think it makes sense for markets to do this. the cost of running a market is high and by allowing your buyers to not "pay their taxes" so to speak, is a dumb move for the market. again, i reiterate. if you do not trust your market, do a 2/2 or a 2/3 outside of the market. you make the choice.i think it has already been shown that markets suffer from fraudulent owners or incompetent developers. i am not saying markets shouldnt charge a fee. but i am also not proposing a solution that offers no benefits unless you abolutely trust the markets honesty and development abiity, which recent events have shown arent a good bet.i think this benefits everyone involved. while i hear what you are saying about maintaining the dominance of markets and that users should trust them with multi sig, i respectfully disagree, i think its an appalling setup, and will only lead to more scams and hacks. it sovles nothing and doesnt move us towards a trustless system.
quote from: blackstar on february 26, 2014, 05:03:11 amyea man im sorry. hopefully there is some legal recouse that can be implemented to lean on them to pay coins back. im not sure if they all got stolen or what. it wouldnt suprise me if the us feds didnt have ahand in it. seems like more and more coins are going "missing" or into wallets that are sitting still. we know how bad the feds want btc gone.. who knows though. im genuinely sorry for all involved in gox.i read somewhere where 700,000 btc had been stolen from mtgox and they never told anyone.
as a legal tax paying business surely there is aduty of care and reimbursement here. i mean whether btc are seen as legit or not they were providing a service and they have failed on that right?
i dont think its any excuse for sr, its a dark net site, security is the biggest issue. of course it is for mtgox but fucking hell you dont expect a darknet market to be vulnerable thats the whole point of doing illegal activity online, security.
until/if mt gox comes back online nothing can be done.
i have a feeling that they disabled registration to help deal with all the users whose bitcoins were already missing due to the "negative balance bug", the users whose bitcoins do not show as "pending", and other users who will not be getting repaid.

im sure you know this, but ill mention it anyway.  blockchain.info is very javascript heavy so you need it enabled for that site.i dont use tails, just the tor browser bundle. here is my expereince with shared send on blockchain.info since it was modified to use sharedcoin.com several weeks ago.it can be very slow. the little popup that happens when you start a transaction can take a long time to complete.  sometimes it will not complete.when the transaction is initiated it will take longer to confirm than a standard transaction.  sometimes a couple hours. sometimes a full day.rather than do a shared send to a vendor i now have a separate wallet in blockchain.info that i do a shared send to.  i keep some btc there so that when i want to use it i can transfer directly from there to a vendor.  that way i am not concerned with the reliability or time for a shared send.
has anyone been having problems with their tails freezing while they try to do a shared coin send? is there a way i can avoid this in the future?

i heard on the news (2-25-14) that there are issues with the btc mkt. i didnt catch the full story. hopefully, i misunderstood the little that i heard. i was under the impression that the only way that thebtc could be "destroyed" is if/when the entire internet goes down. hopefully someone can shed come light on the topic...

any of you guys want to start a bitcoin exchange with me?we can all split half a billion dollars!
yeah bitcoin is to money as torrent is to download.it is not centralized which means instead of running on one server which if shut down would be the end it is running on 1000s upon 1000s of computers and servers so in order for it to be shut down you would need to shut down every computer running it aka the whole internet.this is precisely how the next generation of darkent markets need to be designed.
like, man, it aint no "movement" at all, just a secret place to buy and sell stuff. and, like any other marketplace on the planet, if they cant properly manage the folks property or, worse, if they cant keep their hands out of the cookie jar, then theyve failed at being a market, and will wither away with all the other frauds.
here is another tip. if you have no foil bags and want to ship something that will smell, you can use pvc pipe. get anything from 1" to 4", larger than that and it gets very heavy. look for thinwall. get end caps and the glue. put your goods in the pipe section you cut off, glue on the end caps and wait a bit for them to dry. you now have an odor proof container to send out and it wont set off any metal detectors either.

well, ive been playing around with the idea of having a secure multi-sigs implementation at tba for a while now, and been toying around with a number of different bitcoin clients that currently support a 2/3 transaction in some form or another. and ive had folks pm me with their ideas asto why we should have such a system in place, as well as why they believe not. so id set it up for a debate amongst our users.. and having heard both sides of the argument, the overwhelming choice was for in favor of a multi-sig integration.. despite the niggles and constraints it presented to an end-user.with various bicoin clients out there, i was wondering what the spread was like and hence the poll. maybe if you could also drop in a line or two asto why you use/prefer the said client over another - thatd be totally awesome. though am pretty close to having had worked out a fine balance for how to go about it, without it being too complicated (as some users suggested it seemed) id like to know what people out here use as their favorite bitcoin client.
the most convenient way to buy bitcoin in the usa is through coinbase (https://coinbase.com). once you link your bank account you can purchase bitcoin with your checking account and receive the bitcoin in your coinbase account in 3-4 days. coinbase charges a 1% fee to buy or sell bitcoin, and customers with verified id can buy or sell up to 50 bitcoin per day instantly. anyone can use the coinbase wallet but at present you need a usa bank account to buy or sell bitcoin.localbitcoins.com (https://localbitcoins.com/) allows you to buy bitcoin in person from local traders using cash or from sellers online and has an escrow service built in.mycelium (http://mycelium.com/) -  the mycelium mobile wallet for android has a local trader feature built in that lets you find local sellers offering bitcoin for in person trades using cash.cash into coins (https://cashintocoins.com/index.php) is a new service (us only) that allows you to deposit cash at your local bank and receive bitcoins in about a day. can bitcoin be purchased using paypal? yes, there are sellers on localbitcoins.com who accept paypal (https://localbitcoins.com/buy-bitcoins-online/paypal/?ch=nho). you can also use paypal or your credit card to purchase bitcoin through the bitcoin insanity (http://www.bitcoininsanity.com/) service.for more ways to buy bitcoin browse the clearnet list on bitcoin wiki at https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/buying_bitcoinsremember you will have to make your newly purchased bitcoin anonymous by using a mixing service like bitcoin fog. best practice is to keep a separate bitcoin wallet for coins that have been mixed. once sent through bitcoin fog the coins can not be traced back to you.
oh damn, shut me up

why dont u just put peace in your signiture. u say it all the time

<- i have some doubts[11:14] <jonwickedfire> heh, i bet.[11:17] <jonwickedfire> are you stepping down as ceo and away from gox too?[11:17] <jonwickedfire> (if you cant legally disclose, then just say so)[11:20] <magicaltux> cant disclose that yety[11:20] <magicaltux> yet[11:20] <jonwickedfire> k np.[11:22] <jonwickedfire> the reason im asking is because after yesterdays events of you removing yourself from the foundation and deleting the twitter account/posts and all.. right away speculation within the bitcoin arena went into hyper chaotic mode, and the word on the street was that you were closing up shop and running away with all of their monies and bitcoin...[11:22] <jonwickedfire> how does that make you feel to hear or see people you bailed out yourself and stood up for over the years, turn on you like that?[11:22] <magicaltux> not good[11:24] <jonwickedfire> mark, i know youre not one for expressing yourself, but heres your chance at it, because you really have stepped up before, and done things no one else ever had.. or probably will again.. and it seems like all of it has been quickly forgotten and instead youre being labeled as the madoff of bitcoin.[11:25] <jonwickedfire> were having this chat, and youre still in japan at your apt/office and not in a cave somewhere, right?[11:34] <jonwickedfire> look mark, you took mtgox and ran with it, built on it, stuck with it and took it to a level no one ever thought possible. when other exchanges were crippled, you stepped in and bailed them out or absorbed them to save the bitcoin market in general. in exchange it brought you a massive surge of customers and press that made you look like the hero of the day and then some.[11:34] <jonwickedfire> but what most people forget too was that you werent set up to handle this from the start..[11:35] <magicaltux> [01:25:02] <jonwickedfire> were having this chat, and youre still in japan at your apt/office and not in a cave somewhere, right? <- at home, with my cat being a pain sleeping on the keyboard[11:35] <jonwickedfire> yeah, doesnt sound like someone on the run with bags of money...[11:37] <jonwickedfire> whats the plan now for you and mtgox?[11:37] <magicaltux> cant comment on that yet[11:37] <jonwickedfire> alright.[11:37] <magicaltux> (mostly because doing so could compromise our current efforts)[11:38] <magicaltux> imgur: the simple image sharer <- my cat pushing my keyboard, me pushing the keyboard back on the desk[11:38] <jonwickedfire> so you guys are still actively trying to save it though?[11:38] <magicaltux> we havent given up[11:40] <jonwickedfire> you could have given up and walked away a bunch of times previously, but you always stuck it out... even though others have closed up and walked away, why have you continued to fight and work at it and not give up?[11:41] <magicaltux> "giving up" is not part of how i usually do things[11:42] <jonwickedfire> do you want to tell your side of this a bit more?[11:43] <jonwickedfire> like what youve sacrificed or given up, personally? i have to imagine its taken quite a toll on you.[11:43] <magicaltux> well, first i would guess is my health[11:43] <jonwickedfire> what do you mean?[11:44] <magicaltux> took on more than 30kg since handling mtgox[11:44] <magicaltux> (compensating for stress by eating)[11:47] <jonwickedfire> im guessing stress from lack of sleep too, like now..[11:48] <magicaltux> heh[11:48] <magicaltux> and drinking liters of coca cola[11:48] <magicaltux> how american[11:48] <magicaltux> (almost american, actually, since some people see coca cola as being non-american)[11:52] <jonwickedfire> lol[11:54] <magicaltux> anyway[11:54] <magicaltux> i should try to get some sleep[11:55] <magicaltux> already 2am[11:55] <magicaltux> waking up in 4 hours[11:55] <jonwickedfire> err[11:55] <jonwickedfire> one more thing..[11:55] <magicaltux> and starting to be tired of pushing my keyboard so it stays on the desk[11:56] <jonwickedfire> do you still believe in the viability of an unregulated digital currency like bitcoin tho?[11:57] <magicaltux> difficult[11:57] <magicaltux> tbqh the pressure we got from banks and governments makes things very hard[11:58] <jonwickedfire> do you think if it were regulated it would make it easier to work things out?[11:58] <magicaltux> partially[11:58] <jonwickedfire> how so?[11:59] <magicaltux> well, first avoid being blocked by banks and governments around the world[11:59] <magicaltux> if regulated, it means that as long as you follow the regulations youre fine[12:00] <jonwickedfire> the biggest question people really have asked though is are you personally vested in mtgox with your own btc?[12:01] <jonwickedfire> and whether or not you, like everyone else, have taken a personal hit and are in the same boat as they are in terms of taking a loss/hit from the recent events?[12:01] <magicaltux> [02:00:59] <jonwickedfire> and whether or not you, like everyone else, have taken a personal hit and are in the same boat as they are in terms of taking a loss/hit from the recent events? <- any btc i own personally were on mtgox[12:02] <jonwickedfire> how much did you lose yourself?[12:04] <magicaltux> well, technically speaking its not "lost" just yet, just temporarily unavailable[12:05] == magicaltux [~magicaltu@mtgox/staff/magicaltux][12:05] == realname : mark karpeles[12:05] == channels : channelname[12:05] == server : calvino.freenode.net [milan, it][12:05] == account : magicaltux[12:05] == end of whois[12:05] <jonwickedfire> well, how much is unavail for you?[12:06] <magicaltux> im not even sure[12:06] <jonwickedfire> guys on reddit and wickedfire are running around posting screenshots of horror stories about how much bitcoin they have lost from this..[12:06] <magicaltux> didnt check my wallet before pushing the site offline[12:07] <magicaltux> anyway[12:07] <magicaltux> maybe i should go to sleep now[12:07] <jonwickedfire> anything else youd like to say to everyone before all the pissed off people start going nuts, even more...?[12:09] <magicaltux> not really[12:09] <magicaltux> maybe just a link? something like that: why do we fall? - 9gag[12:09] <magicaltux> well, well see how this one goes anyway[12:16] <jonwickedfire> well, id like to chat more, but i know youre pushing to go to sleep.[12:17] <jonwickedfire> and so long as you are saying youre not disappearing from this.. thats okay.[12:17] <jonwickedfire> i still think you should say something more to all these people or at least reveal how much youve taken a hit for, personally..[12:17] <jonwickedfire> it would show them that you are still on their side.[12:19] <jonwickedfire> by the way, that whole removal from the foundation, did you decide to leave that before or after the chats with them to help save gox versus let it fail?
yea it was all over the news yesterday all i can say is.....
been waiting on almost 3 weeks to withdraw/wash coins and now the sites gone down. what are the people in the know doing about this?

had some coin in there to day trade with, which is pretty easy to profit from in a volatile market like gox when you can see the order book and know when the spikes would happen. i never bothered to leave an aml trail because it was easy enough to withdraw profits as btc sell on localbitcoins.now it appears im shit out of luck for rest of it stuck in there.

quote from: wrathmore on february 26, 2014, 11:14:53 amas a legal tax paying business surely there is aduty of care and reimbursement here. i mean whether btc are seen as legit or not they were providing a service and they have failed on that right?i think so too, but with no fdic insurance they wouldnt have the funds to pay back people if the coins were "stolen". like a bank not fdic insured may not be able to pay you back after a bank robbery, if its gon, its gone. thats the main issue i see, even if he was court ordered to pay back the btc, he just simply does not have it and i guess that would just be bankruptcy for him and gox and he has to live with death threats forever.

otr can be used with nearly any transport. otr is likely the most secure way youll have of messaging for a while.
bitcoin qt also messed up my computer and i dont like the idea of the client having to store the entire blockchain on my computer. i use blockchain.info because it is pretty damn simple and has never given me problems. however, i know i will have to sacrafice conveinience for security and i am happy to do so. unfortunetly not all people will feel that way, quite possibly the majority. im ready to try a wallet that supports mst and will have to do so soon so i can explain how it works to all the n00bs.
web wallets can be secure if they are fully client side, but you take the risk that the javascript is not malicious unless you verify it everytime.i prefer bitcoind over electrum for 2 reasons - electrum is crap for signing multisigs. give it a go and you will see what i mean. other than transfering coins to a multi sig address it isnt multi sig compliant. - bitcoind has the whole blockchain. electrum requests the data for addresses it sends to a server. the server can then link your addresses and potentially deanonoymise you. on bitcoind you have the whole blockchain so no one can link nothing to you.having said that electrum is obviously more convenient and space saving. i have been working on a plugin for trying to fix multi sig signing on electrum but havent had as much time to devote to this as i would have liked recently. but will continue on it and hopefully have it out before electrum fix it!albert, one thing i would say though is to allow people to be able to verify the multi sig address is legit by giving them the public keys needed to recreate it (i.e. markets and vendors, buyer will already have his own key). pointless to have multi sig if the user cant generate the address themselves and verify it is legit.

i just wanted to post this to beware all buyers. vender sr1coins is currently on silkroad, i dont know if hes on other sites or not but he is a well known scammer in the forums of silkroad and unfortunately he just scammed me outta $100 so beware people. hes scammed others out of more money and im positive hes writing his own reviews as well.
why is everybody making this so complicated! make sure you guys visit these clearnet site before continuing. they have free open sourced software that facilitates multi signature transaction. http://coinb.inhttp://bitrated.comalso theres a great article on deepdotweb with a mini-tutorial on how its donehttp://www.deepdotweb.com/2014/02/17/bitrated-bitcoin-arbitration-marketplace/we like the coinb.in way as it allows for more flexibility.the first thing is we must all agree on the correct terminology. multi signature transaction as outlined by bitcoin improvement protocol 016 is not escrow. when using multi sig at no point does anybody have the ability to run off with the funds. multi sig is more like a lock, that takes a predetermined number of keys to unlock and have access to the funds. in most cases this is done using a 2 of 3 multi sig transaction.its really very simple and anyone should be able to figure it out.

has hininguel reappeared with his theories/proofs/and hired hackers? i know he was helping ppl with funds, but does his "evidence" currently match up with oracle too? i just want this done so people can move on from it and we rebuild rite.
***update 3***here it is. the redacted dox oracle posted of the suspected hacker, "pritel".. this information combined with the information from bbmc, makes this seem pretty conclusive. down to the quarter billion btc wallet we found.. again make of this what you want.. but all in all it looks pretty conclusive and pretty damning for "pritel". and possibly defcon, libertas & stexo- although their exact role in this is less definative for now.oracles sr post/ dox. (redacted of course)=====start quote====*mods please do not delete this, i don’t give a fuck about anti-doxxing policies and i’ve worked very hard, paid out of my pocket and have open myself to exposure to put this thieving fuck on blast*everyone else: quote and take a screen shot immediately incase this gets taken down“pritel” – real name: pxxxxx xxxxxxaddress: xxxxxx xxxxxx, xxxxxx – xxxxxx (xxxxxx xxxxxx)hey xxxxx, hows it feel reading this? panicky? i won’t ask you or enter a dialogue xxxxx, but i’m going to insist you contact defcon (silk road 2 admin) or one of the moderators and arrange to pay back the money. or ask them for an address and if by magic the funds show up, you’ll probably live out the rest of your life relatively healthy. if not.. there’s people who’s money you’ve taken who will probably make you wish you were in hell. understood xxxxx? fuck you and your ratfuck thievery.i’m going to keep this short. stexo (known money launderer used to be active on sr1, suspected of being dpr2) had given laundering advice to some xxxxx during sr1, who were also shopping around code they “claimed” to have breached or obtained from gox and btc-e. don’t know if they’re legitimate devs or just malicious fucks, and it’s irrelevant at this point. sr2’s initial back end and engine was coded by one of these guys on contract, “pxxxxx”. libby had thought it would be useful to farm out some of the initial development of sr2 to one of the xxxxx devs and asked fucking stexo to make an introduction. lib (libertas – one of the arrested silk road forum moderators)  introduced pxxxxx to defcon in october, and he did whatever initial development he was paid for. before the site went live his contract was up and defcon and party took control of the admin stuff. most likely this is the reason for the initial spotty site access in the initial days – def just didn’t understand a lot of the code and kept fucking around with it.a very reliable source has confirmed to me unequivocally that pxxxxx (pxxxxx xxxxxx) has been bragging that he hit bitstamp, sr, and gox with ddos, flooded them with mutated transactions, and even made a fortune. tl;dr – xxxxx former contractor used the transaction malleability media hoopla (which can not be used to steal coins) as a cloak to break in and steal. his initial development work probably worked as an advantage, or he kept a clone of the security methods, i don’t know – but pxxxxx xxxxxx is now thousands of btc richer then he was a week ago.libertas should not have recommended this piece of shit solely because they were previous clients of stexo’s. and stexo is not an authority on developers or computer security just because he once advised him and his merry band of xxxxx bottom feeders on how to launder their btc.all of this initial incompetence brings us to a hack/heist of millions of dollars. un fucking believable, and un fucking acceptable.i’ve tried my best to present as much facts as i could obtain, and believe me i have spent my own time, energy and funds getting this information and putting the pieces together. if this post is deleted, i will repost it from different accounts every hour of every day ad nauseum.xxxxxx xxxxxx, xxxxxx – xxxxxx (xxxxxx xxxxxx) .. how do you feel buddy? didn’t expect this huh?anybody in xxxxx or around this area.. i can’t advise you on what to do, but..use your imagination.oracle=====end quote====there you have it, in total- minus "pritels" real name and address of course.. but oracles allegations along with the evidence provided by bbmc and the btva are pretty compelling. although it does raise 1 serious question as to who this narco93 is/was. a fall guy, a fake, a ploy, a distraction, or a small part of the hack team? this is the one unanswered question in all of this, and it is more intriguing as defcon is repeatedly citing his name on the forums, even as of yesterday? possibly more info to come on this.. but the documents above from both, oracle and bbmc should be enough to shed some light on this whole cluster fuck- and to me, its looking bad for "pritel".... whilst also doing defcon, libertas and stexo no favors.stay safe.xsposer.(slightly improved redaction by captain jack).

both blond wig-qt and electrum support multisig operations in their console/command line tool.heres an example of how it works on the command line: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=468334.msg5178588#msg5178588as a buyer you only need to know two commands, validateaddress to get the public key, and signrawtransaction to sign the transaction hex output you are given. you may also want to know createmultisig so you can confirm that the address you are given is the correct address created from the 3 pubkeys.as a seller or escrow agent, whoever creates the multisig address and transaction, you need to know validateaddress, createmultisig, createrawtransaction, signrawtransaction and sendrawtransaction to publish the transaction to the network.sites like bitrated do this for you so you only need to know validateaddress to get your pubkey.
while were waiting for others to get involved, why dont we test your escrow agent skillz, thurgood. ill be the buyer and seller. if youre down, ill create two addresses and give you the pubkeys to both. in order to confirm the address you create is the correct multisig address, you should give me your pubkey too. then ill create the same address in my blond wig-qt client and i can watch the funds get transferred to it.in a real world situation, all three participants could/would do this but each would only have one pubkey so they couldnt spend the coins without the participation of one other person.hopefully this will give people a sense of how easy it is.do you want to use bitrated? if so let me know when to be online.
that sucks! sorry to hear that. preach to others to stay away from sr.

http://www.coindesk.com/leaked-mt-gox-document-linked-consulting-firm-mandalah/coindesk is a great source of news for all things bitcoin. it is founded by shakil khan who is heavily invested in bitpay so take bitpay-related news with a grain of salt. they certainly keep in touch with many important bitcoiners in the american community and have a good track record of publishing rumors that are later revealed to be correct. in this article a source believes karpeles was involved in arbitrage attempts, something that has long been suspected:further allegationsmt. gox has allegedly never conducted a single audit of its customer deposits, and it is believed that karpeles may have been the only one within the company to have knowledge of how to actually tap the exchange’s cold storage.it remains unclear exactly how this type of storage leak could have happened over a multi-year period without any knowledge on the part of the executives at mt. gox.as a result of karpeles’ apparent “wizard of oz” status within the organization, it also appears unlikely that the true technical cause of the leak will be fully understood until the embattled ceo speaks. whether that will happen during an interview or a possible criminal case is unclear.the latter seems likely, however, as one source believes that karpeles knew about the pervasive damage of the transaction malleability attacks for several weeks and was engaging in an arbitrage scheme that leveraged the depressed mt. gox price to reap gains on other exchanges.this was allegedly happening well before the exchange’s breaking point this past weekend.
i saw thats good news ! i guess i should have reported back sorry !
oh
i got a email today  dear mt gox customers,please sign the papers attached, we can complete the process of closing the account and send you what the balance to another wallet.sincerly,mark karpelesfeb 26th (today)"i dont have any money there but was this email real anyone seen it but me lol?
while were waiting for others to get involved, why dont we test your escrow agent skillz, thurgood. ill be the buyer and seller. if youre down, ill create two addresses and give you the pubkeys to both. in order to confirm the address you create is the correct multisig address, you should give me your pubkey too. then ill create the same address in my bitcoin-qt client and i can watch the funds get transferred to it.in a real world situation, all three participants could/would do this but each would only have one pubkey so they couldnt spend the coins without the participation of one other person.hopefully this will give people a sense of how easy it is.do you want to use bitrated? if so let me know when to be online.
both bitcoin-qt and electrum support multisig operations in their console/command line tool.heres an example of how it works on the command line: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=468334.msg5178588#msg5178588as a buyer you only need to know two commands, validateaddress to get the public key, and signrawtransaction to sign the transaction hex output you are given. you may also want to know createmultisig so you can confirm that the address you are given is the correct address created from the 3 pubkeys.as a seller or escrow agent, whoever creates the multisig address and transaction, you need to know validateaddress, createmultisig, createrawtransaction, signrawtransaction and sendrawtransaction to publish the transaction to the network.sites like bitrated do this for you so you only need to know validateaddress to get your pubkey.
i am interested. i understand tmp uses multisig? what software are people there using? i dont have a problem with command line tools as long as commands are not too complicated. after much mucking around with gui pgp tools, i have found nothing beats gpg, perhaps the same is true with multisig?

after looking at some interesting sr1 forum posts (courtesy of gwern) and doing some discreet googling, the grand wizard may not know exactly who was responsible for the sr2 scam.   but i am reasonably certain that vlad1m1r, an sr1 bitcoin scammer and thief friendly with/identical to limetless, either is part of the game or knows exactly who is.  i know beyond a reasonable doubt that vlad1m1rs identity is an open secret in the bitcoin community.   i also know that at least one anglo-nigerian living in london knows who limetless is, and some circumstantial evidence which makes me suspect strongly that vlad1m1r and limetless are the same person.  and if a talented amateur like the grand wizard can find this with 15 minutes of digging you can expect leo did the same research and came up with the same conclusions.

***update 3***here it is. the redacted dox oracle posted of the suspected hacker, "pritel".. this information combined with the information from bbmc, makes this seem pretty conclusive. down to the quarter billion btc wallet we found.. again make of this what you want.. but all in all it looks pretty conclusive and pretty damning for "pritel". and possibly defcon, libertas & stexo- although their exact role in this is less definative for now.oracles sr post/ dox. (redacted of course)=====start quote====*mods please do not delete this, i don’t give a fuck about anti-doxxing policies and i’ve worked very hard, paid out of my pocket and have open myself to exposure to put this thieving fuck on blast*everyone else: quote and take a screen shot immediately incase this gets taken down“pritel” – real name: pxxxxx xxxxxxaddress: xxxxxx xxxxxx, xxxxxx – xxxxxx (xxxxxx xxxxxx)hey xxxxx, hows it feel reading this? panicky? i won’t ask you or enter a dialogue xxxxx, but i’m going to insist you contact defcon (silk road 2 admin) or one of the moderators and arrange to pay back the money. or ask them for an address and if by magic the funds show up, you’ll probably live out the rest of your life relatively healthy. if not.. there’s people who’s money you’ve taken who will probably make you wish you were in hell. understood xxxxx? fuck you and your ratfuck thievery.i’m going to keep this short. stexo (known money launderer used to be active on sr1, suspected of being dpr2) had given laundering advice to some xxxxx during sr1, who were also shopping around code they “claimed” to have breached or obtained from gox and btc-e. don’t know if they’re legitimate devs or just malicious fucks, and it’s irrelevant at this point. sr2’s initial back end and engine was coded by one of these guys on contract, “pxxxxx”. libby had thought it would be useful to farm out some of the initial development of sr2 to one of the xxxxx devs and asked fucking stexo to make an introduction. lib (libertas – one of the arrested silk road forum moderators)  introduced pxxxxx to defcon in october, and he did whatever initial development he was paid for. before the site went live his contract was up and defcon and party took control of the admin stuff. most likely this is the reason for the initial spotty site access in the initial days – def just didn’t understand a lot of the code and kept fucking around with it.a very reliable source has confirmed to me unequivocally that pxxxxx (pxxxxx xxxxxx) has been bragging that he hit bitstamp, sr, and gox with ddos, flooded them with mutated transactions, and even made a fortune. tl;dr – xxxxx former contractor used the transaction malleability media hoopla (which can not be used to steal coins) as a cloak to break in and steal. his initial development work probably worked as an advantage, or he kept a clone of the security methods, i don’t know – but pxxxxx xxxxxx is now thousands of btc richer then he was a week ago.libertas should not have recommended this piece of shit solely because they were previous clients of stexo’s. and stexo is not an authority on developers or computer security just because he once advised him and his merry band of xxxxx bottom feeders on how to launder their btc.all of this initial incompetence brings us to a hack/heist of millions of dollars. un fucking believable, and un fucking acceptable.i’ve tried my best to present as much facts as i could obtain, and believe me i have spent my own time, energy and funds getting this information and putting the pieces together. if this post is deleted, i will repost it from different accounts every hour of every day ad nauseum.xxxxxx xxxxxx, xxxxxx – xxxxxx (xxxxxx xxxxxx) .. how do you feel buddy? didn’t expect this huh?anybody in xxxxx or around this area.. i can’t advise you on what to do, but..use your imagination.oracle=====end quote====there you have it, in total- minus "pritels" real name and address of course.. but oracles allegations along with the evidence provided by bbmc and the btva are pretty compelling. although it does raise 1 serious question as to who this narco93 is/was. a fall guy, a fake, a ploy, a distraction, or a small part of the hack team? this is the one unanswered question in all of this, and it is more intriguing as defcon is repeatedly citing his name on the forums, even as of yesterday? possibly more info to come on this.. but the documents above from both, oracle and bbmc should be enough to shed some light on this whole cluster fuck- and to me, its looking bad for "pritel".... whilst also doing defcon, libertas and stexo no favors.stay safe.xsposer.(slightly improved redaction by captain jack).

after looking at some interesting sr1 forum posts (courtesy of gwern) and doing some discreet googling, the grand wizard may not know exactly who was responsible for the sr2 scam.   but i am reasonably certain that vlad1m1r, an sr1 bitcoin scammer and thief friendly with/identical to limetless, either is part of the game or knows exactly who is.  i know beyond a reasonable doubt that vlad1m1rs identity is an open secret in the bitcoin community.   i also know that at least one anglo-nigerian living in london knows who limetless is, and some circumstantial evidence which makes me suspect strongly that vlad1m1r and limetless are the same person.  and if a talented amateur like the grand wizard can find this with 15 minutes of digging you can expect leo did the same research and came up with the same conclusions.
i think it was a glitch of some sort that caused their exchange rate to be frozen at 528.00. regardless, it is fixed now

quote from: ep1cxm457 on february 28, 2014, 05:51:51 ami would expect this post to have advice on buying your coins in an anonymous fashion. that is, in order for leo to convict you they need all the pieces of the following puzzle: (1) person x purchased btc with y method, (2) same person x then transfered said purchased btc and transferred it for illegal purposes, (3) person x was taken into custody with evidence of the illegal activities. steps 2 and 3 are the ones most thought about and are dealt with by coin washing and pgp encryption of address, among other things ensuring safe delivery. i think this post should emphasize point 1 and the options for buying btc on here are mostly ones that can trace the purchase directly back to an individual (i.e., to a credit card or bank account). i endorse finding ways to purchase the btc using cash transfer in the most anonymous fashion possible. for instance, i have seen listings on localbitcoin.com for cash in the mail transfers; however one must have a high level of trust in said vendor for this to be a viable option. another localbitcoin trick is the "other online payment optioin" where you purchase something like a greendot card in cash at a grocery store or convenience store and then upload images of said card and reciept showing it was purchased in cash. if you choose this option it is vital that you know the metadata of the images you will be sending do not send images taken on a cell phone, be sure there is no accurate time or location data retrievable from the image. this can be accomplished through a function in tails or you could upload the images to imgur and then use those images for the transfer. since most vendors who work this way request an image of the receipt as well, i highly suggest using a pen or marker to remove all location/time identification from the receirpt (e.g., fold it to hide the label of the store you purchased it from, write over the letters and numbers that could be used as identifiable information). finally, when you purchase the cash to coin intermediary (e.g., vanilla reload card) i suggest you wear heavy clothing such that no images of your face can be taken while you purchase the card (i.e., hoddie and sun glasses and something to cover your chin, gloves dont hurt either). i also suggest you purchase cards from more than one location as this makes it more difficult to isolate where the purchases are taking place. remember, always act as if you are already compromised by leo. as an extra step of precautions, i would suggest parking your car a little ways aways from the purchase location so that no cameras could get a picture of you entering your car and getting your license plate number. the only better way to buy coin is to buy it in cash from a friend of yours with a decent stock pile, then there are no traces whatsoever. this way if leo ever does hit you with scenario (3), being caught with evidence of illegal activity, they will not be able to add on extra charges that would be possible if they can trace the purchase all the way back to the purchase of the btc. washing your coins is important, do it early and do it alot, but there is another step before washing the coins that can be just as important as washing the coins and that is anonymous purchase of the coins. please, anyone give feedback on this post to identify ways to improve the anonymity of purchasing coins anonymously. also, if you have some spare coin, donate it to alfred. this site is awesome and i want it to stick around just as much as erowid.orgmost folks already realize that using a bitcoin mixing service is essential, and recommended for security even if you purchase bitcoin locally with cash.it is becoming more difficult to purchase bitcoin without providing identity information which will taint your coins and make it possible to track the use back to you, so keep a separate bitcoin wallet for clean coins. send all your newly purchased bitcoin through bitcoin fog with delivery to your clean wallet and you are good to go.
http://www.coindesk.com/unilateral-statement-regarding-mt-gox-insider/not often you get to see a ceo speak so freely. the guy is clearly passionate about bitcoin hopefully his exchange can overcome their latest us banking woes.i can’t help but be angry, and frustrated and depressed. all the hard work we’ve done to bring bitcoin in to the mainstream and now this, and the people. fuck.look, i was supposed to write some lawyer-approved pr statement about how kraken kicks ass and is super secure and compliant, and payward is leading the charge at data, and all the great things we’re doing right.

i have some empathy but please do not forget the fact you are a reporter.id not have exposed your common information - poor protocol is immature just my opinion
go to a place like localbitcoins.com.  they put coins in escrow until deal is finished.  i just did a wu deal with a dude in china and got my coins in minutes.  you can see there feedback and everything.
well we have one of these for agora links so i figured we better get this going before the link spam ensues.it is against the rules of the hub to spam referral links in the open forum, so please limit them to your signatures, and this thread.ill kick this off, heres mine: http://3p42y56a76g6okuv.onion/index.php/register/5f5fba823f1894d4
ya seems reasonable. wish agora would spend the time to explain their referral program the way you just did for yours.
first let me say im excited to announce one more market which my customers may find me on. the doors are open come and get some.second let me say thanks for the opportunity albert, and sorry for ruffling your feathers the other day.
yea i have .008 or something in my site wallet, i asked support and the told me becasue its below the minimum.
important: silk road has removed escrow. customer support is non existent.due to recent events, silk road has removed the security of escrow from its market. orders are now set to auto-finalize, leaving buyers at the mercy of vendors. to make matters worse; there is currently no customer support from site staff, as staff continue to direct full attention to the market itself. disputes can still be opened but responses are so far, not forthcoming.what does this mean? this means that buyers are completely in the hands of vendors. vendors are free to claim packages have been dispatched, and without staff intervention there can be no way of settling the dispute. its advisable to avoid the market in the current state but if you must use silk road - please only deal with vendors you recognise, or that can be researched thoroughly.
delete this if it seems pointless but growing numbers of users, especially new users are ignorant to the state of silk road at the moment and only become aware once theyve placed an order. if this stops one user being scammed then its worked.

quote from: stingray on february 28, 2014, 12:09:41 am heres my theory based on that evidence. i think sr was indeed hacked and some funds were stolen. i think defcunt saw the coins vanishing and shutdown bitcoind. after this i think he realized his database was a total mess and he could not fix it so he decided to steal all the coins and blamed the hacker for everything. if you havent noticed peoples balances are fucked up and there are people who have no pending balance.thats a very good theory.. we were thinking the same thing, but we wanted to post all our physical evidence first. but that is a good point, because a lot of users (including me) have had their entire wallet stolen- after having nothing in escrow.. so it is very possible that defon or someone else behind the scene (dpr/ stexo?) realised what was going on with the hack, knew that their coding was totally fucked- since they cloned it from mt.gox- and just decided to take the rest for themselves.there is a very strong possibility that that occured, and our investigation will likely head in that direction later.. but for now, we want to try and stay impartial (as hard as that is) by just providing the physical evidence we have obtained so far.. so people can decide for themselves.but that seems a pretty good conclusion to me.xsposer.
there are two types of people on the darknet. sr fanboys and those that heavily dislike sr fanboys. this is a thread for the people of the latter group who enjoy reading some of the stupidity that is shat onto the sr forums on a daily basis. post any good comments you find and think deserve a requote here. this is a laugh nothing more so leave your "somebody think of the children" idiocy out. to get the thread going i will be awarding 0.1 bitcoin to the person who posts the best fanboy quote. just copy and paste the quote as well as the link to the page so i can verify.to prove this is not a fake giveaway the bitcoin can only go to a member who was registered here before feb 28th (and is not me). have your entry in by march 3rd 10pm utc, winner will be announced midday the next day at which time you give me a btc address. if you have a good quote but are not eligible as you are too new post anyway and i might sling you some bitcoin anyway.alfie i will donate 0.3btc to the hub if you agree publicly to make this thread a sticky until at least sr finally dies

cyprus has long been an attractive offshore financial hub. their economy is based on the finance sector and tourism but the gfc did come a knockin in 2013 unfortunately, with the citizens left to involuntarily foot the bill. a bailout agreement reached with eu meant that the countrys second biggest bank froze accounts so that the gov could take out 40% of the money from all uninsured accounts, as well as other measures hostile to the interests of the people.this was the catalyst for a "bail-in" of bitcoin due to people wanting to protect their wealth from their own government. the bitcoin price shot up drastically from highs of $30-$40 to $260, before we were all goxxed of course.as cyprus have long been well educated when it comes to finance it is no surprise to see many cypriots calling for cyprus to become the worlds first bitcoin hub. they realize that there are huge advantages for the country that jumps in first. (the initial meteoric rise in the price of bitcoin that they would be holding at the time is just one tantalizing prospect)for a country to become a hub for bitcoin would also be a huge win for bitcoin if not just for the initial rise in value there is also the perceived legitimacy that comes with an entire country getting behind it. and once bitcoin has a country and  their banks heavily invested in it the exchange of bitcoins for fiat will be much easier, there would be a host of new exchanges popping up out of cyprus without the banking limits the current exchanges are plagued with. cyprus also has the first university to accept bitcoin for fee payments and to offer a course in cryptocurrency. recently the worlds first bitcoin bank was opened in cyprus. this will help foster widespread adoption in a country where people are a little more openminded when it comes to bitcoin. http://www.coindesk.com/bank-like-bitcoin-portal-neo-opens-first-branch-cyprus/http://www.neo-bee.com/en/the central bank of cyprus has been more favorable to bitcoin lately.http://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-legal-says-central-bank-cyprus/

very much agree. ill +1 you when i get a chance.it is strange when everybody wants to know as much as possible about everything and everyone,while we are sharing tips and tutorials on how to stay anonymous on tor hidden services.i have no affiliation with any market, just to be clear. but, its annoying to see personal info posted left-and-right.would you like somebody to do that to you. karma is a bitch.what goes around comes around.stay safe all.
i really do not have a definitive answer for you because nobody agrees on this. i am the kind of person who is a needle in a haystack type that likes to blend in with the crowd. mirage likes his/her obfuscated bridges. axa likes his/her vpn -> tor. you will never get everyone to come together on this never ending debate. find one that you feel best about. sorry for the lack of an answer
hi guys. just joined here. i tried posting this on sr forum but ended up with -6 karma in a couple hours. hopefully people will be more receptive/constructive here. (love sr but some customers suck dick!)i suggest using expresscoin or cashforcoin. they offer several methods for acquiring coins, one of which is sending a usps money order. to buy a money order does not require id and costs less than like $2 for every money order up to $1000. this means you can purchase several thousand dollars worth of money orders at different post offices in a very short period and keep returning to them. benefits of using money orders are that banks do not see large transactions. you can take your money from selling and turn it right into bitcoins. no intermediary of a bank is involved. also your name is not on the money order.now these sites do require you to send a picture of an id with the money order. this does not seem like the largest deal though. most resourceful people should be able to come up with valid id from several different people (not themself!). i mean jesus just pay some junkies $10 a piece for pictures of their id and in an hour you will have 20 ids. just take a picture, print that shit, and mail it off with your money order. you also need to email them a copy of pictures of id and money order. wipe exif data and you are bueno. they will keep this id on file as they are a money transfer service, but le will never get that far.why you ask? because you arent a dumbass and you mixed your coins, of course!fallbacks are necessary though. i suggest tumbling or mixing or whatever twice before depositing it into any market wallet. this redundancy will cost only a very small percentage and by the time you are done it is possible to get money into your marketplace wallet for only 5-10% more than market value in huuuuge quantities.here is how this all looks : expresscoin>wallet a>mixing>wallet b> mixing> marketplacebad scenario: they track coins to wallet b. worse scenario: they track coins to wallet a. if they track back to wallet a it is entirely your fault. but say this happens. now le sees it comes from expresscoin and subpoenas them. finds a record with an id that isnt you, but they will follow up on that person. what does this mean? well for le it means a lot of work. they now need to prove ownership of each wallet by the person whose id it is. apocalypse scenario: they are able to prove ownership of each wallet by the same person. i dont know how this apocalypse scenario would happen but i am not the most technologically savvy person either. if this happens the person whose id it is could get a visit from police but most likely not. say at this point the person drops your name. it certainly seems short of grounds for a warrant so i think they would probably do a knock and talk (police stop by without warrant to try to get you to say something that is grounds for a warrant). so police show up at your door. "hey muttley we have you linked to illegal purchases online. we need to talk to you about this downtown". "sorry officer i wouldnt know anything about that. sounds like some crazy shit though. hope you officers have a good day. bye bye now!". and that is where it ends. the only downside is if your person with the id is compromised you can never again use your own address to receive anything and will need to use someone to catch packages for you from then on.it is impossible to get to the level of police ever showing up if you mix coins properly. there are a sufficient number of failsafes though for me to use this method with regularity and in large amounts. certain steps do need to be taken though to prevent expresscoin or similar services from getting suspicious though:1)do not order from multiple ids and send them all at the same time from the same location. stagger by a few days if possible.2)make sure the ids are not all from the same location if you live in a small town. 10 orders for two thousand bucks a piece within a week from the middle of kansas will raise eyebrows.3)vary amounts slightly. you can do up to 2.5k at a time i think so this isnt a huge deal.any input or suggestions
i would expect this post to have advice on buying your coins in an anonymous fashion. that is, in order for leo to convict you they need all the pieces of the following puzzle: (1) person x purchased btc with y method, (2) same person x then transfered said purchased btc and transferred it for illegal purposes, (3) person x was taken into custody with evidence of the illegal activities. steps 2 and 3 are the ones most thought about and are dealt with by coin washing and pgp encryption of address, among other things ensuring safe delivery. i think this post should emphasize point 1 and the options for buying btc on here are mostly ones that can trace the purchase directly back to an individual (i.e., to a credit card or bank account). i endorse finding ways to purchase the btc using cash transfer in the most anonymous fashion possible. for instance, i have seen listings on localbitcoin.com for cash in the mail transfers; however one must have a high level of trust in said vendor for this to be a viable option. another localbitcoin trick is the "other online payment optioin" where you purchase something like a greendot card in cash at a grocery store or convenience store and then upload images of said card and reciept showing it was purchased in cash. if you choose this option it is vital that you know the metadata of the images you will be sending do not send images taken on a cell phone, be sure there is no accurate time or location data retrievable from the image. this can be accomplished through a function in tails or you could upload the images to imgur and then use those images for the transfer. since most vendors who work this way request an image of the receipt as well, i highly suggest using a pen or marker to remove all location/time identification from the receirpt (e.g., fold it to hide the label of the store you purchased it from, write over the letters and numbers that could be used as identifiable information). finally, when you purchase the cash to coin intermediary (e.g., vanilla reload card) i suggest you wear heavy clothing such that no images of your face can be taken while you purchase the card (i.e., hoddie and sun glasses and something to cover your chin, gloves dont hurt either). i also suggest you purchase cards from more than one location as this makes it more difficult to isolate where the purchases are taking place. remember, always act as if you are already compromised by leo. as an extra step of precautions, i would suggest parking your car a little ways aways from the purchase location so that no cameras could get a picture of you entering your car and getting your license plate number. the only better way to buy coin is to buy it in cash from a friend of yours with a decent stock pile, then there are no traces whatsoever. this way if leo ever does hit you with scenario (3), being caught with evidence of illegal activity, they will not be able to add on extra charges that would be possible if they can trace the purchase all the way back to the purchase of the btc. washing your coins is important, do it early and do it alot, but there is another step before washing the coins that can be just as important as washing the coins and that is anonymous purchase of the coins. please, anyone give feedback on this post to identify ways to improve the anonymity of purchasing coins anonymously. also, if you have some spare coin, donate it to alfred. this site is awesome and i want it to stick around just as much as erowid.org

delete this if it seems pointless but growing numbers of users, especially new users are ignorant to the state of silk road at the moment and only become aware once theyve placed an order. if this stops one user being scammed then its worked.
important: silk road has removed escrow. customer support is non existent.due to recent events, silk road has removed the security of escrow from its market. orders are now set to auto-finalize, leaving buyers at the mercy of vendors. to make matters worse; there is currently no customer support from site staff, as staff continue to direct full attention to the market itself. disputes can still be opened but responses are so far, not forthcoming.what does this mean? this means that buyers are completely in the hands of vendors. vendors are free to claim packages have been dispatched, and without staff intervention there can be no way of settling the dispute. its advisable to avoid the market in the current state but if you must use silk road - please only deal with vendors you recognise, or that can be researched thoroughly.

http://www.coindesk.com/unilateral-statement-regarding-mt-gox-insider/not often you get to see a ceo speak so freely. the guy is clearly passionate about bitcoin hopefully his exchange can overcome their latest us banking woes.i can’t help but be angry, and frustrated and depressed. all the hard work we’ve done to bring bitcoin in to the mainstream and now this, and the people. fuck.look, i was supposed to write some lawyer-approved pr statement about how kraken kicks ass and is super secure and compliant, and payward is leading the charge at data, and all the great things we’re doing right.

there are two types of people on the darknet. sr fanboys and those that heavily dislike sr fanboys. this is a thread for the people of the latter group who enjoy reading some of the stupidity that is shat onto the sr forums on a daily basis. post any good comments you find and think deserve a requote here. this is a laugh nothing more so leave your "somebody think of the children" idiocy out. to get the thread going i will be awarding 0.1 bitcoin to the person who posts the best fanboy quote. just copy and paste the quote as well as the link to the page so i can verify.to prove this is not a fake giveaway the bitcoin can only go to a member who was registered here before feb 28th (and is not me). have your entry in by march 3rd 10pm utc, winner will be announced midday the next day at which time you give me a btc address. if you have a good quote but are not eligible as you are too new post anyway and i might sling you some bitcoin anyway.alfie i will donate 0.3btc to the hub if you agree publicly to make this thread a sticky until at least sr finally dies
heres an awesome corker from g0dfather:quotetheres an old saying that goes:"fall down 7 times stand up 8."source: http://silkroad5v7dywlc.onion/index.php?topic=28966.msg549473#msg549473seriously? you are quite happy to take 7 hits from sr and still shout how great they are? hahahaha and to make things better the thread had the word love in the title.moar love!!!now gimme that 0.1 you whore!
just to add to this, admin are preparing a status update on the situation over the next couple of days or so, which should add clarity to the situation. keep an eye on the main board over the latter half of the weekend.v
