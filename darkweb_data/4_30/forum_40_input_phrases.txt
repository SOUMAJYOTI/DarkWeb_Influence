sigh such shameleave alone. 
wow that was fast. 
only just signed this site the other day glad didnt have chance place order yet. 
looked promising marketplace unfortunately. 
from ilovespaghetti february amthe fact why you write about your issue here instead using the support section implemented the forum fair point. 
lube didnt even get kissed. 
from doctorclu february ami shut whitedreams well everyhammond protect users. 
trust earned understand. 
could have taken the cold storage and ran. 
fact sacrificed our pay the event that wasnt returned. 
could have not even opened after christmas steal everyones money. 
friends were arrested. 
defcon used the contingency plan. 
dpr could have hit the killswitch the whole time. 
millions pass through the road each month. 
could and take all. 
have anyone wants help combat the fud and constant complaints that can continue act support while the synced. 
doctor clu whitedreams was removed from after weeks complaints and open threat his vendor page. 
many other scammers are currently running unchecked despite forum threads featuring hundreds yes hundreds complaints. 
the staff has time protect their customers putting spam filters the forums that nobody can post links competing markets. 
yet takes weeks remove vendors who are taking advantage buyers and even bragging about. 
far constant complaints many the people complaining have had thousands tied escrow for months while the resolution centre implementation continues delayed. 
others have been unable access their bitcoins for weeks thanks the negative balance bug while still others have paid for vendor bond and are waiting weeks approved. 
you want the steady stream complaints stop try addressing them. 
genuinely feel for the forum moderators who are acting glorified aol customer service reps. 
you have the power listen complaints and serve whipping boy you dont have the kind access the system which would allow you actually anything about the problems. 
sound frustrated its because tired fanboys genuflecting front the sacred camel and blaming the victims these various setbacks and fuckups. 
wont piss your leg and tell you its raining appreciate you and other spokespeople returned the favor.

was not because was rude was because was amateur programmer who was somehow gaining lot traction with vendors and buyers. 
was putting lot people risk not having the ability back his claims. 
when was confronted with the truth about his massive security flaws his greed made him lie about attacks and ignore. 
you should thankful more people didnt waste their money vendor accoutns and vendors didnt rack sales that could used prosecute them.

com onions comments xlwsy utopia marketplace seized dutch police thats awefull thing why resort such harmfull actions pretty fucked. 
first not firm that fucking idiot thinks hes anonymous and that trolling utopias forums amounted hacking. 
did because utopia was shitty website with shitty security and for some dumbass reason everyone was going sheep the slaughter their terrible market. 
used xss jlaw obtain his login and leveraged that root his server. 
told him about and called cunt and refused talk about further. 
shut down his registration prevent any new users from joining and turned him the police. 
was terrible admin his site was shitty and they would have eventually been caught hacked. 
you should thank. 
involving because someone was rude you uncalled for. 
what about the users they have done nothing harm you and are damaged direct restult your actions. 
you could have easily given everyone chance withdraw coin. 
are talking about peoples lives here think about think about what this does for your karma. 
news technology was the end long investigation dating back early. 
they were caught because they had previously been sending drugs and guns through the mail and the cops had already building case against them for those things. 
when they made the arrests they were delighted find the server hardware and everything too. 
word the news article about anonymous tip from year old basement dweller usa. 
firm thinks apart anonymous his idea hacking trolling utopia forums. 
while was doing that was locating xss exploit using jlaw rooting their servers and stealing their database. 
and yes did hand over the dutch police. 
its just frim being his usual dipshit self. 
posts proof just talk. 
from sorrymario february pmhes such leeto that was able build time machine and turn the info over the cops back the beginning just like back the future. 
think very plausible that the person using the name whyusheep haz close connection with are somehow related most likely underpaid and under appreciated young people who get fucked over the same system gouvernments. 
they stick around long enough some will eventually see that are fact the good guys. 
this was really fast. 
well all know that there risk this happening any marketplace but wow they managed take this site what less than weeks thats just surprising.

since earlier post the grand wizard has seen evidence the forums that doctorclu working fix the vendor bond issue appears have helped several new vendors least. 
congratulate him his efforts and acknowledge his sincerity and his ethics. 
lot remains done but heres credit where credit due. 
hope the doctor can keep the good work and cautiously optimistic that the road will weather these storms. 
disagreement may blunt but praise sincere. 
the grand wizard wont piss your leg but wont blow sunshine your ass either. 
not into that sort thing. 
nothing against those who are course. 
thank you for your hard work. 
they took the money there was hacker wake and smell the scam burning. 
much pointing they did. 
from whom january amthe two are actually fairly similar many ways but ill talk little about the differences. 
both rely sending your traffic across more different relays before gets your final destination. 
tor primarily meant allow anonymous access the clearnet internet via exit nodes. 
onion addresses like this site are really just icing the cake. 
tor relays servers handle routing for clients tor clients stay fairly anonymous. 
they dont advertise their addresses each other and they connect known public tor relays less advertised tor bridges basically just relay thats not advertised publicly. 
the advantage with this architecture that clients are always just clients. 
they dont route traffic for other people and nobody but their first hop into the tor network known entry guard bridge using tor bridges has the ability see their real address. 
everything has tradeoff and there are some disadvantages. 
here are few. 
tor relays have provide all the bandwidth used the entire network. 
clients dont contribute bandwidth back the tor network. 
its nearly impossible peer peer protocols with tor clients without having turn the client into hidden server like torchat does. 
tor hidden services arent the primary purpose tor getting people the internet anonymously they dont get much development. 
there have been number academic papers focusing deanonymizing tor hidden services figuring out their true addresses which allows adversaries target them directly and without significant number high volume hidden services also running the tor network gets harder hide the few high volume services that are left. 
tor client only sends traffic from itself. 
never routes traffic for other people. 
theres significant plausible deniability about the traffic from the client. 
its coming from your tor instance its your traffic. 
designed primarily provide anonymous access resources within the network called eepsites. 
really designed connect the equivalent tor hidden services and doesnt provide reliable connectivity the clear internet. 
unlike tor where clients connect servers and servers all the work the model largely built around model where every client relay well. 
the way its meant work wed all run instances all the time and theyd connect each other large mesh and was building path site that needed three hops might very well use your instance one the hops. 
this has advantages. 
every client contributes bandwidth since youre basically having agree route traffic for everyone else and theyre agreeing route traffic for you its closer pay you but youre paying with your own bandwidth. 
plausible deniability just because traffic coming from router instance that doesnt necessarily mean its traffic. 
could one peers traffic that just routing. 
there are also some disadvantages everything life has cost. 
isnt fire and forget. 
you cant just connect expect get good bandwidth with tor for free then disconnect. 
really built around the model that youre connected least for hours end and always routing traffic for everyone. 
the farther you stray from that model the worse the performance gets. 
you can connect hidden mode where youre similar tor client but performance going take hit. 
why would other participants want haul your traffic for you youre not contributing them might take few hours day speed decent performance levels after you fire and most complaints about its performance are from people who arent using the way was intended. 
cant hide the real ips its clients well because theyre relays too. 
everyone relay everyone needs way know who all the relays are and the net result that its much easier build list all relays any given time. 
this opens some attacks where adversary harvests lists all relays regular basis. 
who all using right now then works that into intersection attack. 
basically whom posted times and. 
which relays were all online those three times. 
over time intersection attacks get very effective. 
one criticism that has been argued hell and back srfv that marketplace scenario adversary already knows rough geographic location for user. 
they received package from vendor located seattle that intersection attack gets much easier. 
not going rehash here. 
its hasnt received much scrutiny. 
academics have been beating the tor network for decade. 
very few analyses have occurred and that doesnt mean its problem free. 
just means that nobodys looked closely. 
the third rarely mentioned network freenet which high latency network that works much differently from tor and. 
wont bore you with that description here. 
hope that helps little. 
gets complicated quick and everybody ends getting into religious battles over this versus that. 
theyre both pretty interesting technologies and neither one really stands well adversaries like nsa over the long haul but theyre really all everyone has work with right now. 
does vpn running with increases the security. 
ive set shop there. 
still not even but guess its just new. 
from jules winnfield february pmllama socks good see you around. 
havent seen you hot minute. 
llama socks rocks hub users good see another good vendor still doing. 
thank you small dont usually get noticed appreciated. 
from nevermind february pmwe are talking about peoples lives here think about think about what this does for your karma. 
from nevermind february pmif you are fact you are being fucked over that same system where politicians have power over the skilled they make you damage our society enforcing druglaws that are wrong. 
you are pawn for the moraly and ethically wrong side this conflict and invite you change side. 
from ilovespaghetti february nevermind post great thought. 
from sorrymario february pmle certainly has interest disseminating fud that possibility. 
however due the new information being given news releases the seizure looking more and more like cosanostra and possibly one more the other admins had already been identified back when they were personally shipping drugs weapons. 
the arrests seem all stem from things which occurred and the market seizure appears only incidental having already idd the admins and stumbled upon their computers and servers the end the investigation. 
you think the press release would mention tip off from some random redditor that got them the server you are moron. 
also yes they were under investigation but they never explained how they obtained the server location. 
gave you that explanation. 
evolution next and cant get their shit together and wants war will show them that they are fucking amateurs too. 
opinions are like assholes lets hear yours. 
from thewhiteshadow february amits god dam shame they couldnt just sit back keep there nose clean and earn millions with ease and comfort. 
need full nerds start site. 
not hardcore fucking druggosquote from nevermind february pmwell thats how these bitches roll they are not stupid and have been this game for decadesthink more nerds less violence would also good thing for parts society outside dnminteresting. 
why would help you for free the only one like here maybe nevermind. 
the rest you are censoring assholes. 
too much attack surface and increases the number adversaries. 
from ripsnorta february pmquote from tyrone february amquote from lonewolf february amwhat was wrong with astors security advice let think. 
told people that was safe sign atlantis through phishing proxy and then people got phished. 
after that called the phishing proxy very sophisticated when was the simplest type proxy out there. 
discouraged automatic universal pgp for black market websites. 
that means buyer didnt send pgp the website would convert the message address pgp the vendor and only the encrypted messages address would remain the server. 
gave the wrong advice regarding tor leaks. 
told people not use proxy conjunction with tor. 
the only thing that can protect against leak and many more things that cant even remember. 
anyway this guy the one running. 
look how that turned out. 
its stexo running the site opinion just like ross ran. 
seriously doubt its anymore than one man operation. 
dpr didnt disappear has just morphed into defcon. 
ive seen various posts now the board asking where cirrus went where did and why terp. 
this sheep guy needs clap around his fucking forehead personally saw the cunt the street pussy. 
well one thing convinced whyusheep not frim. 
dpr and staff stole our coin. 
not btc bug known since. 
yet they find time ban for posting legit invites market that actually running and not stealing btc from its users fuck. 
heres agora invite. 
onion register uiaku kvzg. 
hey sunwu ordered from you last saturday and fed and messaged you and you replied monday saying would shipped and processed asap. 
now friday and still package. 
were you able send mine out time please get touch with possible will send you pgp message well with more details but you could just give any update order would really appreciate. 
from cooked february amhello allowed vendor evolutioni think you should unban from tcf regardsno. 
interesting see how this show ends indeed. 
ive changed mine about eight thousand times since this all started. 
its now time assume that every thing you see before you part the process. 
from top bottom from defcon oracle its being very well played. 
keeps going not only will they have pocketed some coins but they may even have customer base ready and willing line and and scammed again. 
there was glimpse hope the early hours when hiniguel seemed blowing the place apart but the cold light day think its become apparent that last night was stimulant fueled journey headfirst into superhero fantasy. 
for man speaking extreme hacking partners and boasting his moneys object approach when quick background check reveals someone importanting meth and maybe making good month think tells you what you need know. 
its going fun watch fall apart over the next few days. 
well move some learning from and maybe even analysing decentralised options while doubt large group will fall into the same old traps. 
thats what ive been thinking lot users seem the same person and you can see fairly easy with some. 
dpr defcon ploy make someone look good. 
the day the last original mods went was when started showing cracks that really stopped using. 
from ilovespaghetti february pmheres article about. 
actueel undercover onderzoek translation anyone. 
thought the admins utopia were arrested. 
wouldnt that mean you ilovespagetti just curious. 
not many hours seems much. 
the market has maximum six hours. 
the movements correct wallet. 
remember reading somewhere that astor was actually the infamous sabu. 
iirc the reason automated pgp was shunned was because might rely javascript which would additional attack vector for this what happened with freedom hosting you rely someone else for your own personal security then youll brought down eventually. 
theres reason tor browser ships with noscript even though javascript still enabled the default config for convenience. 
from february amscout pine astor nope. 
pine and astor are definitely different people. 
scout was fired dpr. 
from tyrone february amquote from brassballs february amquote from jules winnfield february ami remember reading somewhere that astor was actually the infamous sabu. 
and dont forget pineyes pine. 
was was also against universal automated pgp. 
everything was pgp through automation then the authorities would have nothing they grabbed the server. 
pine was against this. 
pine did advise people manual pgp. 
the problem that the majority did not use pgp and pine knew. 
dont see mistake she did there. 
you send some cleartext the server which encrypts the server and authorities find the servers there trace from the plain text anymore this gives additional security over encryption done myself does give false sense security and even more would rely the site security instead their own your decission. 
few know what was found stexos identity dpr and links the recent hack but should released soon the forums. 
you should look much more close hux and oracle and told you about stexo. 
this post convinced that astor left the community for good. 
lets hear good and loud. 
from doctorclu february amwe know what happened. 
are not clueless. 
dont doubt that you are not the theft. 
that said you have been providing cover for and enabling through your blandishments the forum before the theft that everything fine. 
that makes you culpable. 
from doctorclu february amwe know what happened. 
are not clueless. 
why are you even still here everyone disgusted you. 
why are any mods given staff here think that smart. 
from mycarneedstint february amdpr and staff stole our coin. 
not btc bug known since. 
bubba replied you twice please avoid double posting only slows. 
one the best posts ive read very long time. 
you bring some much need clarity and eloquence the public discourse and provide brief respite from the adolescent and drug fueled ramblings weve become accustomed. 
politics can just much ratfuck. 
hope you stay journalist for the dark markets you are appreciated. 
those you who used its your own fault. 
the market screamed scam from the very beginning and there was countless warnings throughout its operation. 
the user cooked signed and somehow used pgp key. 
its not problem side think bypassed your security measures something. 
from sunwu february amso have been having pgp bug with tba since signed some weeks ago put the right key but the admins encryption not correct now the admin account deleted and way contact them. 
shame looked good but the team seems too small and market premature dont think will join. 
market owners need take note releasing premature market only damages the long run. 
stop trying race out there. 
thanks for raising your issues and bringing forth your apprehensions and hope with this post can address them. 
ive said this before and ill say again. 
firstly our sub forum here the hub was not intended support forum. 
much try stay updated with posts here remedy any issues brought our notice. 
have our own official support forum where any bugs are reported and and the ones reported thus far have been fixed asap and recommend you use stay upto date with the latest. 
not have army staff and all the work myself despite that and reported other users here such issues have been fixed the soonest possible and often the fix solution has been action that has been required from the users end rectify something they hadnt done correctly the first place. 
its new site and number things work differently from what you buyer vendor would have been used different market. 
for the issue you reported via was not being able decrypt your received messages. 
sent you another follow track what where the issue was but since you havent been the support forum you likely havent read how this can has been addressed. 
would recommend the following. 
log your account disable tfa click account tab edit upload pub key logout login back again you will not prompted for tfa its disabled. 
send yourself test message. 
you should receive encrypted and you should able decrypt else happy send you test messages again. 
your login pin and pms order encryption and profile are all connected with your pgg key and sometime while uploading them its not correctly formatted. 
this has been reported twice you included from over thousand accounts. 
also all other administrative accounts have now been disabled for security reasons. 
and therefore you see previous account disabled the system. 
but reachable the same handle and happy send you test messages for when youre done with the steps above. 
also pls note for month gave away free vendor registrations and zero commisions orders there was not penny the market made. 
but now since were charging for both vendor registration and orders will devoting much that fund pimping security and having more hands the deck assist and you guys round the clock. 
have been having pgp bug with tba since signed some weeks ago put the right key but the admins encryption not correct now the admin account deleted and way contact them. 
shame looked good but the team seems too small and market premature dont think will join. 
market owners need take note releasing premature market only damages the long run. 
stop trying race out there. 
from bullionaire february pmman this sucks. 
really liked the utopia admins. 
from mycarneedstint february pmmy prayers are with them all. 
from deepdotweb february amin the the public prosecution document. 
com the utopia bust details prosecution announcement thanks for the story. 
ive done lot orders bsm works really good. 
they allow customers release partial escrow too. 
from jules winnfield february pmyour ganja looks mouth watering the way. 
course was scam. 
get real people and wake. 
after reading through all forum posts news comments the mods and admins. 
there are too many fishy things and contradictions blaming transaction malleability and the admin clearly saying that recently discovered bug laughable. 
wasnt published last week stated his latest forum post was published ago. 
just before this heist thread named reality check was posted stating that users should thankful for all the positive security measures that had been made and for all the effort the admin put the development the website. 
also another thread was being publicized promoting that nobody should finalize early any transaction which then resulted more btc escrow. 
also nothing was done regarding the required ban certain well known scammers and certain users reported negative btc balance their account after depositing substantial amount btc their wallet. 
the admin defcon claims hes been off internet for like whole week didnt know about the mtgox announcement and the ddos attacks. 
lets clear here runs black market the last thing would not informed for whole damn week. 
hed had live under rock not hear about the recent mtgox scandal. 
and really didnt then hes not trusted with running any site let alone. 
long minutes hours after the admin stated the forum that the site has been hacked and all coins were stolen several transactions were still happening which deducted funds from known vendor accounts. 
repeat after the post has been made. 
this just written scam all over. 
the admin claims took all funds from the wallets single hot storage wallet enable the auto finalize option the site. 
and left there for days straight. 
refuse believe this level stupidity from admin who runs site like. 
then tried explain typing that was stressed out. 
the posts certain mods have too many contradictions. 
one minute they say only moderator here are only paid run the forums have nothing with itself the usual blablabla and the next minute the same person different thread writes sentences like will open the market when this and this will finished. 
suddenly its also they claim they accidentally delete threads. 
the most important one recently regarding the admins statement the situation. 
sounds believable right the admin defcon who failed his community being hacked claims has the audacity warn people security issues other sites suggesting people not use other marketplaces doesnt even know because fears for the safety the customers funds. 
suspect that the forums mods also have other forum accounts they can publicly write positive opinions about themselves and anybody who still believes them. 
otherwise cannot explain mods and other users allegedly female the black market giving each other hugs and kisses and things that nature while some people lost thousands dollars few days. 
also the admin has bunch dedicated groupies signing whatever says exchanging female like emotional comments like deeply thankful for the hundreds supportive messages ive received. 
this business not cking female high school. 
simply put cant believe this unprofessional manner conduct business run website and the obvious scam that this. 
these people should not trusted with anything related any black market the future. 
unfortunately the fact that they can pop anywhere anytime under different name and identity and probably wouldnt know thing about. 
from doctorclu february amwe know what happened. 
are not clueless. 
stop spewing nonsense and misinformation. 
hack you mean stolen then use correct terminology. 
you honestly believe was hack then you are truly cluless. 
yes that was play your name duh clueless for sure. 
the mods have been show for months. 
well they have been busy deleting forum accounts and censoring both facts and opinions. 
not helping advising properly. 
not protecting all letting the kitty build. 
the lies excuse drp. 
defcon gave did not make any sense. 
more holes than swiss cheese that story. 
prehaps you didnt understand how btc works website you may easily buy into the web lies. 
but the ones who understand know for fact that defcon lied. 
plain and simple. 
defcons hack story. 
which what all our account wallets. 
not expect any coin. 
not expect honest apology. 
not expect hear the truth from defcon any mod. 
the truth stole from the community. 
just stop speading lies about wink wink hack some btc problem that has been known about for years nothing like this happened. 
there were other scams then. 
were possible steal btc described conjobs. 
defcons explanation someone would have done. 
but noone did because not possible. 
sorry for all those who lost coin. 
never use again that site has been burned and have lets dox defcon and all the other thieves. 
scum defcon stole our coin. 
doubts has been scam from day one you continue use you will burned again. 
regardless regardless whats done done. 
just irl trust you cannot put price. 
its personal decision and those that continue riding the gravy train that sadly the defunct road has now become are kind the most most tolerant people. 
you wanna harsh about they are religious fanatics emotionally attached different romance scamsyou know say your stuck boat and someone dies you should wait until every other member the boat has mourned the death until throwing them overboard otherwise mass hysteria will ensue. 
from mycarneedstint february amit still for debate will ever get its act together. 
believe that all the coin sitting site will disappear for whatever reason. 
dishonest owner operator another takedown. 
the coin gone imo. 
challenge anyone actually involved with prove wrong bring actual proof not just cause say. 
where coin bty yeah. 
tied your site. 
defcon definetly con job. 
and indeed did. 
the good thing about you can download files videos use java script. 
this correct you just have wait while while the router populates. 
can you explain what you mean vacation mode. 
why the article password protected would like read. 
had one transaction with project black flag. 
the site shut down when order was transit. 
received order but wasnt able release money escrow and vendor didnt get paid. 
php register check out the doctorgirl got what you. 
from february pmquote from february pmbeen trying sign for days but keep getting reg failed help same thing here. 
tried register about month ago and registration still shows failed. 
havent been able log once. 
has bugs that keep registered people from logging dont think the rest the site could very promising. 
not trying hate pirate just sharing that ive had common experience. 
hope for their sake they get sorted out. 
hello you use special letters only allowed special characters are allowed and space names are also not allowed. 
example account quoteusername which everyone will see thepiratelogin which you need login thepirate password dsf asddf dgpin code rfoif you still have problems you can contact and will create account for you. 
after that you can change the password and pin. 
from nevermind february amquote from february pmwhat fucking going with all black markets has been hacked dont believe that bullshit cant register agora because problem utopia fallen down. 
maybe can this the begin the end dont wanna believe that but all this subject very strange. 
only can still waiting preferent for. 
but later they has been hacked. 
cant believe this yet. 
not the end friend its just new beginningi like how sounds that. 
here for all you friends from bmr and utopia. 
deeo account taken need talk about mods and forgot password deeo account. 
for now you wanna check use pgp from bmr. 
still utopia forum cause works best for while this hub dont load many times. 
not selling anything anywhere. 
can fuck off with those dumb pms hey can get your email. 
and for clarification. 
the dox question was that scammer and person doing everything their wee power disrupt the market and its community. 
you are conserned about this happening you then the description above probably fits you too which case one wants you their market anyways. 
cant wait until see staff and busted paraded front the media their way daily ass rapings from big black cock the clink. 
was theft hack. 
from amai february pmhopefully the culprit culprits will found. 
from whom february pmdo you know way pin local router instance hidden mode specific router your local router always uses your vps always first hop your local isnt advertised and the vps blind the content your traffic since its just relaying traffic that seems like pretty much perfect world from perspective. 
you get the bandwidth high bandwidth router but dont have let the vps see the traffic before its encrypted for transport. 
this would restricted route and has been planning for basically forever. 
just enjoyed thread about why you shouldnt use counterfeit pay hookers. 
nice break from the drama and abounding elsewhere. 
you cant humorous without trolling drama.

anyone can see that silk road has just pulled off the biggest scam darknet history you got remember stealth you are not talking dumbass fanboys all the time and most that have been around for more than minutes can see exactly what has happened. 
just cant believe that many are willing back get scammed again for round. 
ignore this stealth idiot who cannot even properly explain how mtgox transaction malleability allowed some hacker empty the entire value the balance sheets. 
coincidentally this the exact amount corrupt owner operator would able steal. 
silk road dead. 
drive stake into its rancid heart and move. 
from pirate market february pmnah took down because didnt earn day. 
lolquote from the dfather february amlol the signiture says life goes matter what happens felt more like brave live your dreams always keep getting the next level. 
have been vendor since was roadsilk. 
they not have large consumer base but are very dedicated and fast acting. 
all messages never take longer then day respond. 
all customers were very satisfied with the way the support handled all situations. 
the very basic but has made many improvements over the months. 
looking forward long term partner ship with. 
thought this market needed some because very underrated and the personal interactions have had with the support owner are far the best have seen the darknet markets. 
hope becomes what wants and maintains the current mindset over the course there business. 
all markets are unsafe but its harm remind newbies the history particular franchise fbi. 
the whole thing just stinks high heaven and riddled with host unanswered questions. 
was always taught that looks like duck walks like duck and quacks like duck then its duck. 
feel sorry for you you actually believe this was anything other than inside job. 
was most likely defcon who lead the scam but possible somebody that worked with him screwed him over but that seems unlikely. 
definite con his name unabbreviated doesnt give damn about anybody but himself and will continue spin his intricate web lies. 
cant believe some people are actually drinking the koolaid. 
you must suck basic math you believe any because simply doesnt add. 
the whole equation doesnt make sense. 
from every february pmquote from february amjust enjoyed thread about why you shouldnt use counterfeit pay hookers. 
nice break from the drama and abounding elsewhere. 
read that thread few weeks back when joined evolution. 
the forums are fairly tame over there. 
its nice but just dont have the time maintain different forum presences mainly check this one and the markets work. 
yes checking different forums can become tiresome. 
all the drama right now left exhausted the peacefulness evolution was much appreciated. 
its also apparent that people there least for now are serious about doing good business instead having tons trolls spreading fud fast they can type. 
the admins are also very present and interactive the forums. 
its quite refreshing. 
love the hub too but not all customers come here yet. 
working that though. 
wanna buy bench cooked ill set custom sale sale just for. 
really like evo its good market that functions quite well with fast page loads and host cool feature for the vendor. 
lets make suggest here they can make more better. 
vacation mode one click disable hide all current listings for when need take break. 
clone listing for many list same product different quantity and being able one click copy the listing and edit the price and quantity very helpful. 
buyer feedback having stats our buyers helps know when your dealing with someone positive potential scammer. 
thats all can think right now. 
please chime with your suggestion. 
just managed login. 
use blender for small portion our clean out process never observed problem concerning tainted coins move cash outyes observe the blockchain transaction process too. 
quotethe big problem silk road has right now trust. 
the big problem right now there are bunch accounts with negative balances and mine which has nan error which has over stuck and one fixing the issue. 
you start fucking with peoples money and nothing about big issue. 
all vendors have removed listing and have moved. 
still hanging around because would like get money back when your money does not come back that screams major bullshit many levels you can fill thoughts from there. 
from perfectscans january pmlook. 
really very simple. 
when considering new market you must ask one critical question that market and its owners and support. 
your first language english yes continue with usual precaution. 
cant tell trolling stupid.

first not firm that fucking idiot thinks hes anonymous and that trolling utopias forums amounted hacking. 
did because utopia was shitty website with shitty security and for some dumbass reason everyone was going sheep the slaughter their terrible market. 
used xss jlaw obtain his login and leveraged that root his server. 
told him about and called cunt and refused talk about further. 
shut down his registration prevent any new users from joining and turned him the police. 
was terrible admin his site was shitty and they would have eventually been caught hacked. 
you should thank. 
firm idiot who thinks apart anonymous but his hacking skills amount trolling forums. 
while was busy dicking around forums was shutting down utopia. 
from brassballs february pmyou could make clearnet site last longer tehn utopia didi think speak for everyone when say type fucking normally. 
good hear from you ils. 
you have utmost respect putting your freedom the line provide people the opportunity practice their right stay safe mate.

not only refused listen lied his community when continued attacks. 
the guy was scumbag and the site was terrible. 
charged withdraw funds and convinced everyone backopy was involved. 
jlaw was scumbag amateur who got what deserved. 
dont disagree that marijuana isnt big deal you are preaching the choir but when you run market you are risking not only yourself but everyone you convince join for you make profit. 
looks like they expected raid vendor and ended getting lucky and landing couple marketplace administrators. 
its always sad when market goes down because means someone has fallen foul anachronistic drug laws and faces time jail that someone several people have just been ripped off. 
just saw this shit reddit. 
com onions comments xlwsy utopia marketplace seized dutch police this guy turned utopia and looking bring down more markets dont know its true but. 
the fucking prick. 
certainly has interest disseminating fud that possibility. 
however due the new information being given news releases the seizure looking more and more like cosanostra and possibly one more the other admins had already been identified back when they were personally shipping drugs weapons. 
the arrests seem all stem from things which occurred and the market seizure appears only incidental having already idd the admins and stumbled upon their computers and servers the end the investigation. 
now please not begin war here. 
wont respond discuss again. 
police has declared they busted them after undercover investigations going from the.

dont care about weed. 
its all the other market staples that are causing the problems. 
are down but not out. 
you were good guy interested helping the community you would have advised and helped not burn. 
and were telling everyone were early stagespeace. 
yeah its bad situation all around. 
people least one whom admin have their lives ruined. 
people lose their money seized wallets. 
cops get tons free bitcoins order shit from vendors fuck with markets. 
chances are mistake was made early the creation the site and the dutch police were waiting for some transactions occur before legitimately seizing the server. 
let know there anything the can. 
from february pmwow that was fast. 
only just signed this site the other day glad didnt have chance place order yet. 
looked promising marketplace unfortunately. 
the process regstering account was never fixed for and now its gone thoughts out all those who are affected only divided fall. 
unluckily they were under investigation from undercover agents since. 
should have been painfully obvious the site was poorly constructed. 
was made with cakephp. 
heres article about. 
actueel undercover onderzoek. 
man this sucks. 
was hoping they were the run rather than jail. 
really liked the utopia admins. 
super damn really hope the police screw have release the coins and the people involved. 
prayers are with them all. 
was fast because like evolution not properly setup. 
may know your opinion evolution also you should consider selling your testing service. 
anyone else experiencing delays with btc deposites going out site btc address ive been waiting hrs now.

whats all this shit your saying about ddos and bringing the admins justice the fbi cant even that now man you and your backtrack little are going outwit the feds haha. 
hacked the forum says someone found bug inside the cashout function. 
today according their staff bug was exploited which allowed hacker steal their entire hot storage balance. 
the future the market right now uncertain but they are offering non escrow trading and sparing expense tracking down the culprit. 
bstring you crack. 
cannot lurkive never liked doctorclu. 
the days irc chat before his modship had tendency kick people for minor shit insulting him. 
look what the mods have been doing theyve been spending all their time telling people calm down that their funds would released that they would get some degree support. 
meanwhile they constantly reiterated that the developers were focusing security that the site was designed unbreakable. 
problems were ignored and the website was chronically understaffed they said. 
now have been completely shat. 
best defcon and the dev team were incompetent and the mods had main job assuring everyone that they were competent. 
however suspect the worse possibility that the site scam. 
the cold storage fiasco was obviously ruse they recovered the coins and everyone collectively circle jerked when they though defcon and are trustworthy. 
then heard assurances from the admins that bitcoins would now stored multi signature cold storage where multiple admins would needed steal funds something that effect. 
next have had information that the site was hacked specific vendor. 
remember ebook the vendor who hacked sheep marketplace such statement obvious diversion away from the fact that the site has stolen the coins. 
enjoy chasing phantoms. 
now there slighlty possibility that the coins will miraculously recovered adding trust the the silk road. 
this time however believe that its unlikely. 
big fuck you the mods who are all pigs. 
doctorclu particular like squealer addition being dog because took his piggy little ass shaking his tail convincing all the face piles evidence that was secure that they were under much pressure. 
like malleability transactions would allow someone hack and steal all the coins. 
for whyusheep ignore his posts. 
any hacker who really pulled this shit off the hacker scenario quite unlikely would keep low profile rather than bragging reddit. 
any self respecting person who able hack entire marketplace one day would not give shit about constantly parading himself reddit. 
whyusheep fuck off. 
anyone who continues feel assuaged hugs and kisses from chemcat should look the ceiling. 
gullible written there. 
time for great reckoning and another slaughter the sheep. 
youre the same fucking idiots that buy things based brand names notlurking. 
napolean the pig and his fellow pigstersthe fucktard assuage fear mods like chemcat etc. 
squealer the pigthe ban people who spread fud mods like doctorclu the dogslaw enforcement humanspeople who use the site for buying vending buyers are sheep vendors are ducks chickens etc.

not hardcore fucking orchestrated the situation and another undercover offering take care this problem which got ross accused conspiring commit murder. 
they knew who was but instead just filing report and shutting the server down they decide for oscar. 
like they were playing with him. 
well thats how these bitches roll they are not stupid and have been this game for decades wouldnt supprising the dutch secret service also orchestrated problem that leaded the ordering hit. 
the way see them just game they currently are not even playing win otherwise they would least attempt synchronise arrests globally they depend gouvernment budget and ironicly dissapearing would hurt their funding. 
think more nerds less violence would also good thing for parts society outside dnm. 
and need improve our game ofcourse. 
they were already under investigation thats. 
unlickily irl drug weapons dealing and murder attempts raise lot attention. 
from nevermind february pmwonder how located the server other markets can take precautions and safe. 
from mary february pmfeel bad for peoples loss again its the chance all take guess. 
etc only troll and you are seeing the extent his masterful abilities registering accounts and posting shit. 
has lot time waste weekends and non school hours eastern and well youve seen yourself how easy register new accounts the forum. 
good luck with this one. 
have the codebase and the database for utopia. 
hours going destroy sold not because fuck you this isnt show and dont keep trophies. 
willing sell under escrow because not scammer. 
you will receive onion address with directory that contains. 
both the database copied when shutting down their registration has most the users with the passwords already cracked. 
will also give you the entire shitty cakephp codebase. 
edit fuck you guys for censoring sale isnt that ironic that you support dark net markets but wont let sale whatever want. 
like copy the not much the codebase. 
but certainly cant afford btc because not going use hack anyone steal their balances other markets anything like that just want for future analysis and research. 
can maybe afford. 
assuming not asshole you can find key email. 
net links contact. 
legitimate question here this guy has many bitcoins dont have job and can afford fuck with you. 
why doesnt just give the code base away. 
selling not permitted the forum please respect community rules. 
evolution pretty website with bad programming. 
already have hacked their servers and know their address. 
toying their administrators see they want actually fix too greedy admit they dont know shit about opsec. 
would sell pen testing services depending the market. 
frank most these markets admins are total assholes when you confront them with the fact that they are out their league. 
they have this image themselves that when shattered makes them incredibly defensive. 
youve considered building marketplace. 
from amsterdam uplier february likewise.

from lonewolf february amwhat was wrong with astors security advice let think. 
told people that was safe sign atlantis through phishing proxy and then people got phished. 
after that called the phishing proxy very sophisticated when was the simplest type proxy out there. 
discouraged automatic universal pgp for black market websites. 
that means buyer didnt send pgp the website would convert the message address pgp the vendor and only the encrypted messages address would remain the server. 
gave the wrong advice regarding tor leaks. 
told people not use proxy conjunction with tor. 
the only thing that can protect against leak and many more things that cant even remember.

look how that turned out.

seriously doubt its anymore than one man operation. 
dpr didnt disappear has just morphed into defcon.

yeah want know about cirrus. 
cirrus somehow the only person with some credibility left threw his long track record with and yet heard from. 
probably one the other moderators.

can you please get the fuck out nobody wants sign with your fucking invite code. 
doesnt benefit anybody you obviously are only posting for your own personal profit which why they banned you. 
you seem mad that you were trying push invites but staff stopped you. 
sorry guys but hahahahahaha. 
you were buyer and lost money silk road its your own fault and youre fucking idiot. 
sorry but its true. 
has been fishy fuck from the start. 
the people feel sorry for are the vendors some them had escrow. 
and thats exactly how the staff wanted. 
more steal when they hit the switch. 
does anyone actually believe that system easy implement such auto finalize was taking this long they did help keep money the site and prevent vendors from withdrawing everyday. 
now theyre spitting your faces talking about being hacked theyre probably only lying they can keep taking the commission once theyre back and running. 
sites like these are big business they might even planning sell once they get the multi sig escrow system implemented. 
and people have proven time and again theyll keep using site like this after being ripped off all takes some bullshit forum post from the admin. 
one things for sure they just ripped you off and now theyre laughing your face. 
vpn pretty worthless for. 
the idea that your not secret. 
its just that nobody knows what belongs what router. 
you try analyse whats goin and you just see this big ball traffic where everybody talking everybody else. 
vps however super useful for because you can leave running. 
nodes with very high uptimes dont suffer nearly much from eepsite timeout errors. 
plus your node routing and the vast majority the traffic routes not generated you becomes much harder know when you are online. 
think its prommesing market looks good feels good buyers perspective just look and when the right vendors there load btc think has good change. 
hello allowed vendor evolutioni think you should unban from tcf regards. 
have removed the requirement for version info pgp keys and replaced the captcha with something bit more user friendly.

please climb down from atop your horse and watch closely like good journalist. 
the fatuous whining beneath you. 
while agree that the. 
team was likely involved the caper the incendiary insults directed the community are uncalled for. 
you make your living leeching off the story and drama being written here. 
dont take for granted. 
gentlemen distinct possibilty that the. 
forums have been compromised law enforcement some other group since least the time the arrests december. 
screenshots copies text documents correspondence and statements from other knowledgeable users tend lend credibility this notion. 
this true then almost certainly the. 
operation its entirety being monitored and controlled some capacity and probably has been for some time. 
according sources one more the admins mods either cooperating with authorities cirrus was named. 
these same allegations were made others december during act when incriminating photos were printed the forums only deleted. 
staff denied this then and sure that they will continue now. 
whether not the above mentioned theory true remains seen. 
involved not sure yet how this all fits together however something tells that this going good one. 
but fuck all that for now. 
well worry about act after fill those you who drifted off sleep went the can during act. 
was not hacked was looted its captain loathesome annoying moniker ive ever heard one along with couple his buddies. 
together they more closely resemble amateur theater troupe than gang pirates. 
december myself and others watched they staged shameful scripted performance the forums all for the benefit the droves newcomers who watched from their seats. 
they clapped furiously the end. 
and then they rose from their chairs and gave standing ovation dpr defcon hux etc. 
strolled out for his curtain call. 
that was when picked the stage prop. 
mean your sack bitcoins which incidentally had been stowed the trunk his car the entire time and looked out all your smiling faces before bowing deeply and blowing few kisses. 
while you were out the town taking all that culture the rest were shaking our heads and going about our business were keeping our fingers crossed that what seemed almost certain happen wouldnt. 
but were also exchanging messages and pining for simpler times and silently betting whether would swat team angry mob dope sick torch wielding townspeople who showed first. 
and how soon would they arrive the. 
forums are useless now even more than december. 
back then they deleted hundreds posts threads citing security the reason. 
theyre doing again. 
the only entries that youll see are the actors themselves. 
and the noobs whose simple natures and naivete makes shenanigans such these possible the first place. 
and finally handful members masquerading dozens more with hoards disguises and countless aliases their disposal. 
times they even carry conversations with themselves inside thread. 
when see happening reminds child putting puppet show and compelling one hand talk the other. 
the forums are like fucking daycare for noobs while simultaneously functioning kind giant playground for the adults who take the opportunity trade inside jokes and troll one another. 
and the real communication what very little there can read between the lines. 
one ever says much and when they subtle codes are employed. 
consider these quotes just few examples from meerkovo february pmoracle quick question accroding defcon all wallets were affected business has cash assets just wondering should kiss coins goodbye and wish the person who might spend them choke their daily bread. 
better yet hope they buy motorbike meerkovoquote from lashesxo february pmtheres only few people power remove account. 
wonder who that might. 
the mods are good people that leaves who oracle you kill kid. 
from oracle february amquote from randomuser february amquote from oracle february amgood question deleted the old key when thought would never returning this place again. 
email account forgot the for. 
tried few times and then gave. 
months does make ones mind rusty but luckily this account was still active. 
happens the best with burners and char passwords. 
looking forward reading what you have say wish you had responded what said before the email and pgp question though sometimes silence speaks volumes. 
has defcon been contact with with dpr lately hey oracle whereve you been seriously oracle just fucking nym that redacted and redacted. 
and redacted trot out for these special occasions. 
nothing what seems folks. 
the communitys core the dark market communitys core lot smaller than you think. 
just remember that while youre totally anonymous stranger who lives ohio and thought that this silk road thing sounded like fun the people who conceived all this who built and have been here from the start. 
theyre all well acquainted. 
some are allies while others share bitter rivalries. 
wink wink yeah. 
and the grand finale. 
ill publishing obituary for this goddamned zoo the near future and then going back writing about politics. 
not directly tied any this author for crying out loud therefore ive lost nothing the various dark markets nor have profited from them instead ive sat here and ive watched. 
and lve come wish that others would take the time well. 
technically speaking really journalist albeit shitty inefficient one and fed with the bullshit which theyve taken just too goddamned far this time. 
you ever hear quitting while youre ahead cant sit here and watch while you guys bamboozle these poor bastards out their money especially when they dont doubt you for second even you point down the street and cry was the one armed man went that way posts like these have been written before. 
hell watched couple get deleted just this morning. 
and then another unsuspecting victim strolls through the door and whips out his social security card and his drivers license all eager get the action. 
where sign says. 
and this gets deleted the hub. 
well know where their loyalties are. 
its time weed out the thieves and liars and trolls might well start here. 
cant say with any certainty whether not the silk road sub reddit trustworthy either. 
but once have more information will pass along. 
and the meantime deepdotweb probably your best source for accurate timely news regarding the markets believe his integrity. 
incidentally has nothing with this posting nor was aware prior its publication. 
despite everything remain opposed prohibition while supporting online trading. 
believe that the majority folks who frequent these markets are decent good natured citizens. 
but you fuckers want keep the criminals bay youre going have start neighborhood watch something. 
ill see about having shirts made. 
was all con. 
and hence youre most certainly not inefficient shitty journalist you present yourself. 
the stage now set just right for dpr come sailing along the high winds. 
this the likely explanation imo. 
looks like when was taken down some the guys the background that never really got take part decided use their advantage. 
was mostly filled with lots big speeches and large things happening the background but beyond the words few people what did really get see most their development announcements were about security features and hardening etc etc but never really got see any. 
the things that got see were fixes and feature development that any site development would have. 
and course the big features that were really needed kept getting delayed. 
and longer buy the cold storage thing for second. 
there way prove any actually happened beyond them freezing some coin for while. 
such easy thing stage and gained them lot trust for doing basically nothing. 
perfect way gain lot traction for their con. 
was lucky this time. 
ive never kept coin stored markets beyond pocket change but because bad timing did lose fair amount. 
could have happened here too. 
last deposit was only weeks ago. 
hope this the final nail the coffin for centralized marketplaces know wont ever use one again. 
weve let these people burn time after time its time learn from our mistakes and stop this shit. 
dont know really anything about who who and who did what and all that hope what youre working will good and informative read. 
you seem like good man from. 
this was very well played and orchestrated and much pains say you have say they got everyone pretty well.

and dont forget pineyes pine. 
was was also against universal automated pgp. 
everything was pgp through automation then the authorities would have nothing they grabbed the server. 
pine was against this. 
pine did advise people manual pgp. 
the problem that the majority did not use pgp and pine knew.

always thought scout and pine were the same person. 
scout pine astor. 
stexo was definitely dpr. 
way back the begining dpr made pgp signed message except mistakenly signed with stexos key just minor slip also not too long ago hux made post and signed with dprs key another minor slip course then came and made excuse saying that some the mods had access dprs forum profile for posting updates. 
true who knows you decide. 
there are plenty people with plenty opinions but opinions are kind personal and every person has one. 
like think that there reason have two eyes and ears but only one mouth.

thats what all really wanna hear isnt. 
from doctorclu february amwe know what happened.

sorry doc you lost all credibility that humbled and disgusted thread where you try blame the hack. 
gox transaction malleability claiming allowed every single bitcoin held all customers vendors out escrow. 
see the now deleted thread. 
com file ede cae dcc explain that ridiculous theory that the many who actually understand bitcoin and the transaction malleability issue can see even passes the smell test. 
wasnt bitcoin hack was the admin pulling disappearing act when the market was its most profitable. 
you were not the theft and yet still defend them you are gullible fool. 
from doctorclu february amwe know what happened. 
are not clueless. 
would you kind tell little bit more the matter. 
know what happened. 
are not clueless. 
youre fucking piece shit doctorclu. 
does turn out that the admin are responsible then someone needs get word ross his lawyer. 
tell him roll those piece shits and get better deal for himself. 
and the process will all find out their true identities. 
then will able get them. 
gtfo here promote safe use practices evident safe thread here. 
review vendors product and generally hang out need get nasty. 
and you cant sign agora without invite its mutual benefit thing see few dollars here and there from referrals nothing big. 
just thought help out anyone over while they were down they obviously arent half competition friendly they profess over there. 
and look around this aint board friendo.

hes back court next wednesday. 
see thoughts here. 
comthanks you coverage worth reading always. 
just word add. 
should any tba user need report bug account related issue need any sort support pls report them the official forum for faster resolution. 
you may double post them here but having posted the forum helps stay documented and helps other users the process. 
links the support forum the official sticky post and the home page the. 
ill just steal his account then. 
from cooked february amthe user cooked signed and somehow used pgp key. 
its not problem side think bypassed your security measures free create account with there such security measure for creating user account. 
pgp encryption mentioned above. 
the central part your account. 
now the user cooked tba not the owner the private key from the corresponding pub key uploaded the account then simply cannot login. 
since will not able decrypt the two factor login challenge. 
that most likely has been the case since the account owner has not been logged back since the time was first created. 
was con scammer probably did not reslise how the login worked. 
now you are the owner the private key for that pub key you have nothing worry about. 
all inactive accounts are auto deleted days from the system. 
from cooked february amok ill just steal his account thenyou could try thats you know the password get the tfa bit later. 
albert quick help out sunwu. 
its good see vendor such high caliber like you show. 
have chit chat albert you will able see that and his team are legit. 
dont doubt they are honest good guys this why had looked them but with bugs like this worries there are others and only look the most secure market dont have through this again everytime market fail lose and sometimes thousands. 
this not something wish repeat time and time again. 
know what you mean. 
have said this before and ill say again for all here the hub read sunwu you have been inspiration vendor since saw youre contest threads forum. 
the gratitude that buyers abroad expressed for your services actually brought tear eyes. 
specially when was genuine people talking about genuine problems they face irl. 
you being there for them and being the awesome vendor that you are really made consider what were all doing earth and the dark net. 
the universe will not let ever catch you for you service the universe far greater ways than and their evil manipulative war tactics. 
from sunwu february amso have been having pgp bug with tba since signed some weeks ago put the right key but the admins encryption not correct now the admin account deleted and way contact them. 
shame looked good but the team seems too small and market premature dont think will join. 
market owners need take note releasing premature market only damages the long run. 
stop trying race out there. 
new seller the dnm. 
dont have the experience most have. 
have listings tied list almost dozen sites. 
most have been problematic most have one contact with issues. 
far tba albert and blackbank mdparity are the main ones where can get issues resolved almost instantly. 
torescrow was also good one this counts for lot. 
support slow non existent other sites least for. 
would certainly give these future there will always something that comes resolved. 
from sunwu february ami dont doubt they are honest good guys this why had looked them but with bugs like this worries there are others and only look the most secure market dont have through this again everytime market fail lose and sometimes thousands. 
this not something wish repeat time and time again. 
well ill honest with you. 
not the coder the market just simple forum mod. 
albert the one who coded the market. 
you have any questions about bugs you can ask him our forums. 
the bugs have had far have been corrected within hour albert being aware them. 
albert currently working multi sig transactions. 
dont know whole lot about but believe protects the users coins against hacking sezures. 
this not implimented yet but the priority the moment and will implimented soon. 
already have cold storage coins. 
and all withdraws are processed manually which prevents theft via hacking. 
the market has whole lot security features. 
would also like note that albert has been hosting onion sites for vendors for few years and has expirience keeping servers secure. 
hes not newbie the scene. 
you would like learn more about tba please come the forums. 
when albert has minute free time sure would more than happy address any your concerns. 
thank you much jules knew the customer gives lot love but did not know vendors too are always here for people because makes happy what and know the best way for success have said before things will get worse before getting better and feeling positive about the future. 
there are few bugs but nothing albert cant help you with. 
you could him our forums and could definetly sort you out. 
ive been over there for while and have had nothing but positive experiences. 
alice the administrator does not make many appearances the forums usually handling tickets proving support the actual marketplace. 
not that hes working site upgrades updates. 
for example wont show the forum for while but then posts big update. 
pandora support handled mostly the actual market opposed the forum. 
there are support staff who appear the forum much more often. 
they have direct contact with the admin alice they can pass anything that requires admin intervention since rarely has the time visit the forums. 
this least the way seems have been since joined. 
alices forum account isnt active for few days and everyone screams scam arrest but then turns out was just working the market relying the support staff monitor and forward any necessary information from the forums. 
this literally happens every weeks please stop creating these where alice topics just because doesnt visit the forums for few days. 
actually specifically says his forum profile not him because does not check his forum pms. 
you must contact him via vendorsupport youre vendor the appropriate support ect both the actual marketplace not the forum. 
not affiliated with the website being paid say any this. 
its just that started using pandora near its beginning both because main vendor was here and because all the drama unfolding tormarket and. 
while continue hear all sorts sketchy shit coming from those markets ive been placing orders for months pandora now and have not run into single problem. 
from darts february amive been placing orders for months pandora now and have not run into single problem super. 
from february pmwhat fucking going with all black markets has been hacked dont believe that bullshit cant register agora because problem utopia fallen down. 
maybe can this the begin the end dont wanna believe that but all this subject very strange. 
only can still waiting preferent for. 
but later they has been hacked. 
cant believe this yet. 
not the end friend its just new beginning. 
from nevermind february amnot the end friend its just new beginningpeace love. 
what went wrong history repeats. 
anyone recall what went wrong with carders market. 
someone agrees this you would have incredibly naive and ignorant. 
this database has zero relevance. 
has lot information from the bmrv userbase but guess what its gone too this just ploy order try get money for something bit too late. 
should have sold this before utopia was taken down the dutch feds. 
one more great option and read this and only can say awesome its perfect that you recieved the btc the generate adress less hour even minutes what see like really and readed the new release defcon and seems fine the moment with that plan but dont wrong because the first release since closes said that escrows not trusted and they need another method with multi sig dont know how works that. 
hope that their moment they put tutorial something the home page. 
said too that the new system multi sig ill ready months that mean stay the certain believe yes cant place orders until then and dont want wait much time until then. 
while can register more markets trusted and still recieve the orders that placed and too look for new markets new alternatives read about that and test the markets for myself. 
but certainly need more options not only. 
they says anyone market that have escrow isnt trusted. 
dont believe that think that only common method dont lose customers believe that have the reason this thought. 
much people continues make and recieve the placed orders another markets since fell down and think with almost total security that before that too was viewing this site minutes ago one person gave the info the existence this market and the url and with good feedbacks see and out the site with agora are favourites elections for the moment without course that was main choice. 
this market has got good prices too many things comparation with others not too course but this give good feelings like agora too. 
these markets must grow increasingly and can that possible and whatever still using when possible place orders same time remember monopolies have never been good. 
need make grow these and more markets trusted can and much more things. 
our hands got the water the seeds are the earth and can makes possible that these markets grow more markets confidence these are good news guys really good news. 
and personally like said dont trust nothing the part when defcon said anyone market that have escrow isnt trusted. 
good vibes people. 
its possible that hack some other type robbery did happen but happened while ago. 
have suspected for some time that didnt have all the bitcoins that were supposedly peoples wallets and were using these bugs borrow money from vendors when deposits were not enough fund the withdrawls. 
now that people are losing faith and leaving the site deposits are much less than withdrawls and vendors are requiring customers finalize early they cant borrow the money anymore. 
from february pmyoure fucking piece shit doctorclu. 
this the neck. 
was hack who hacked not any outside vendor thats for sure how can you have the balls come with that account. 
from what have read and know the problem with btc couldt have been the reason that all the btc was taken didnt expect see defcon any mods post anything again but after reading threw the forums its wonder theyre back users were still depositing coin after the hack and are over their now ready throw more coin away. 
wonder they came back its unbelievable the amount idiots there. 
the only other thing can think they have heap accounts spread propaganda. 
from mycarneedstint february amdpr and staff stole our coin. 
not btc bug known since. 
from february amsince earlier post the grand wizard has seen evidence the forums that doctorclu working fix the vendor bond issue appears have helped several new vendors least. 
congratulate him his efforts and acknowledge his sincerity and his ethics. 
lot remains done but heres credit where credit due. 
hope the doctor can keep the good work and cautiously optimistic that the road will weather these storms. 
disagreement may blunt but praise sincere. 
the grand wizard wont piss your leg but wont blow sunshine your ass either. 
not into that sort thing. 
nothing against those who are course. 
thank you for your hard work. 
from nick cotton february pmif does turn out that the admin are responsible then someone needs get word ross his lawyer. 
tell him roll those piece shits and get better deal for himself. 
and the process will all find out their true identities. 
then will able get them. 
time will tell nick. 
hopefully the culprit culprits will found. 
shouldnt problem getting the govt allow him achieve justice for the reincarnation the very thing hes behind iron for. 
from owockeznan february ama vps however super useful for because you can leave running. 
nodes with very high uptimes dont suffer nearly much from eepsite timeout errors. 
plus your node routing and the vast majority the traffic routes not generated you becomes much harder know when you are online. 
vps definitely good way for performance but really hate the level visibility the vps provider ends with and dedicated server overkill. 
you know way pin local router instance hidden mode specific router your local router always uses your vps always first hop your local isnt advertised and the vps blind the content your traffic since its just relaying traffic that seems like pretty much perfect world from perspective. 
you get the bandwidth high bandwidth router but dont have let the vps see the traffic before its encrypted for transport. 
obviously there are million ways get traffic vps router ssh tunnel vpn etc but what would much better way keep the vps instance blind the content even the vps admin decides start stracing processes. 
that would mean that dirt cheap openvz vps would perfectly great way connect. 
last service that does not advertize stolen credit cards and other nasty stuff. 
can someone sort invite cheers. 
making account for this board and asking for invites the very first post could potentially dissuade people from offering one. 
may want mingle bit and make some friends. 
evolution very smooth marketplace. 
the sales are still very slow but drugs are kind side market for this particular. 
the vendor backend very feature rich and functional though. 
just wish they had vacation mode like many other markets. 
think means vacation mode. 
when vendor wants take break from sales they can set time frame when their sales listings will cut off that buyers dont load escrow with coin and wonder why the vendor never shipped contacted them. 
sure does look good. 
thanks for pointing out. 
awaiting vender approval now. 
from lexdysic february ami think means vacation mode. 
when vendor wants take break from sales they can set time frame when their sales listings will cut off that buyers dont load escrow with coin and wonder why the vendor never shipped contacted them. 
from every february pmyes this bascially that. 
for example agora bsm and you can enable vacation mode with single click and will automatically hide all your listings. 
for vendors with lots listings this significant time saver rather than going and disabling listings one time. 
then when your ready get back work you simply click disable vacation mode and all your listings become visible again. 
thanks for the suggestion. 
well look into getting something like this set the near future. 
from verto february amcan you explain what you mean vacation mode from february amit sure does look good. 
thanks for pointing out. 
awaiting vender approval now. 
yes this bascially that.

from cooked february amhello allowed vendor evolutioni think you should unban from tcf regardsyou wont getting unbanned from tcf you had plenty enough warnings.

brings back many great memories bmr was wonderful only joined there after was siezed but was great market and loved how was run. 
layout was messy but always worked perfectly. 
backopy was great and dont think you could have asked for anyone better run black market. 
the original dpr was also great opinion seemed genuinly believed the movement and think was honourable man unlike many the learders now who are very much for the money which sad but guess quite predictable. 
lol the signiture says life goes matter what happens duno why but gave good chuckle gusse when die some thing happens right lol.

from february pmbeen trying sign for days but keep getting reg failed help same thing here. 
tried register about month ago and registration still shows failed. 
havent been able log once.

not trying hate pirate just sharing that ive had common experience. 
hope for their sake they get sorted out. 
this article answers some your questions. 
com crime arrests utopia black market reloaded. 
asked could sell someones information because just happened the only one with high value tarkets info. 
who isnt exactly high value target but you probably get what mean. 
there has also been some speculation about that being the person the admins were hiring assassin for which case was fool not pming admin and selling them directly. 
find the admins choice condone this action very unprofessional and dangerous. 
despite the fact was rooting for yes the time. 
from flaxceed february pmquote from northwest nuggets february amits possible that hack some other type robbery did happen but happened while ago. 
have suspected for some time that didnt have all the bitcoins that were supposedly peoples wallets and were using these bugs borrow money from vendors when deposits were not enough fund the withdrawls. 
now that people are losing faith and leaving the site deposits are much less than withdrawls and vendors are requiring customers finalize early they cant borrow the money anymore. 
just idea thisthis would explain lot but theres coming back now.

from sorrymario february pmif you were not the theft and yet still defend them you are gullible fool. 
interesting from lkyw february the fact that they can pop anywhere anytime under different name and identity and probably wouldnt know thing about. 
its incredibly frustrating read here and the clearnet that was hacked. 
the theft was inside job. 
bugs far cashout feature concerned. 
btc mal problem first told. 
some mysterious frenchy didnt break. 
was greedy admin stealing. 
maybe the admin defcon french and was projecting idk the myth will. 
lies will believed and yet again more btc will stolen. 
its damn shame will never use that site again and will steer others away well. 
for the ones who still believe.

haha that quality stuff. 
all these extraditian treaties are bullshit. 
country should protect its own citizens. 
usual these piss weak career politicians roll over any demands from the howard gillard rudd abbot are all the same. 
traitors the australian people. 
remember when people kept trying decide ssbd was girl not. 
one more casualty either way. 
thank you ozfreelancer for being our battlefield journalist. 
reading again now its sad whats happening our courts and the nonsense well hand over citizen for. 
org wiki hew raymond griffithsim tempted barge into the court with bunch tractor paper and computer file some old laptop and say travesty justice about occur here ssbd and can prove then wave the tractor paper around spout bunch technobabble about deep packet inspection hand over the computer and see what they all. 
unsure why the article password protected but have from rss and going right ahead and repost here without the authors permission given this onion router hidden site and all. 
cant wait for that book. 
honestly dont think youre going hear from enterthematrix scales injustice silk road ssbdby all things vicessbd had role play the silk road marketplace where drugs were bought and sold. 
was moderator the silk road discussion forum which had its own url and was hosted different server the marketplace. 
why the determined extradite someone who may may not him peter philip nash has been sitting brisbane jail cell since december. 
facing extradition the united states face allegations narcotics conspiracy maximum sentence life prison and mandatory minimum sentence years conspiracy commit computer hacking maximum years and money laundering conspiracy which carries maximum sentence years prison. 
scales the indictment nash was known online better known silk road members ssbd. 
ssbd was well loved moderator the now defunct silk road discussion forums new forums colloquially known have replaced the old. 
his job was answer questions explain the rules move posts their proper forum with over million posts many were bound wind the wrong place and generally attend banal administrative tasks. 
any event nash may may not ssbd. 
what exactly was ssbd crime all have the indictment. 
don know what other information the authorities have but all they have what the indictment would travesty australia was agree deport him. 
ssbd had role play the silk road marketplace where drugs were bought and sold. 
was moderator the silk road discussion forum which had its own url and was hosted different server the marketplace. 
his job was confined that site. 
two others who were arrested concurrently andrew jones aka inigo and gary davis libertas were immediately released bail under the laws the usa and ireland respectively. 
according the indictment inigo and libertas did have roles the marketplace well the forums. 
the indictment differentiates the two where says inigo worked site administrator silk road libertas worked site administrator silk road worked the primary moderator the silk road discussion forums emphasis nash was not granted bail because under the australian extradition act magistrate eligible federal circuit court judge shall not remand person bail under this section unless there are special circumstances justifying such remand. 
seems nash could not fulfil the special circumstances requirement. 
next wednesday nash due back court for magistrate determine whether eligible for surrender the. 
nash will remanded custody until the next phase the proceedings surrender review can consent extradition. 
the act will eligible for surrender authorities the magistrate satisfied the supporting documents relation the offence have been produced the magistrate judge any additional requirements imposed the australia extradition treaty are satisfied the conduct would have constituted extradition offence had occurred australia and there are substantial grounds for believing that there extradition objection relation the offencenow disclaimer. 
although was lawyer deep dark past have zero experience with either crime extradition law. 
don know any more than anyone else. 
these are simply uninformed opinions after looking the act and extradition treaty and knowing from two years investigating silk road what ssbd role consisted. 
any additional requirements imposed the australia extradition treaty are the treaty says extradition shall granted only the evidence found sufficient according the laws the territory where the person whose extradition requested found either justify his trial committal for trial the offence with which charged its equivalent had been committed that territory like said don know what evidence they have can only the indictment. 
seems evidence pretty lacking that document. 
first have idea what evidence the authorities have that nash ssbd. 
they may have found some correspondence the silk road servers between and the site owner dread pirate roberts. 
perhaps ross ulbricht the man accused being dread pirate roberts provided his details attempt plea bargain. 
ulbricht should noted has denied being dpr and has denied all charges this seems unlikely. 
the indictment claims ssbd was paid around per year. 
this presumably was paid bitcoin. 
possible though again unlikely that the bitcoin trail was followed nash bank account. 
most likely the evidence email from anonymous email account message through anonymous private claiming that ssbd real name peter nash. 
not too compelling. 
this requirement for evidence also relevant the next two stipulations. 
the conduct would have constituted extradition offence had occurred australiathe wording says conduct not crimes which the person accused. 
the only conduct could find attributed ssbd the indictment was relation the narcotics charge sent message dread pirate roberts owner silk road summarising the actions had taken during the previous week his capacity the primary forum moderator the silk road discussion forums. 
doubt that sending message from one anonymous online account another anonymous online account constitutes extradition offence the narcotics charge the only charge have any overt acts which sounds similar conduct listed underneath the charges attributable ssbd relation the hacking charge intentionally accessed computers without authorisation for commercial advantage and private financial gain and furtherance criminal and tortious acts overt acts were listed under this charge the above was general accusation aimed all three defendants this does not sound like could considered conduct the person constituting the offence which what the act requires would interested see what evidence they have that ssbd accessed computers without authorisation. 
there would certainly need order carry out his functions moderating discussion forum. 
would have carried out his duties his own computer logging the silk road administration panel least the small part had access completely authorised. 
relation the money laundering charge conduct and attempt conduct such financial transactions which fact involved the proceeds specified unlawful activity wit narcotics trafficking and computer hacking overt acts were listed under this charge the above was general accusation aimed all three defendants this does not sound like could considered conduct the person constituting the offence which what the act requires again would interested see what evidence they have that ssbd conducted attempted conduct illegal financial transactions especially conducting any transactions whatsoever was explicitly banned the silk road forums the only site ssbd had access any sort administrative capacity. 
not surprisingly dread pirate roberts wanted keep all financial transactions the marketplace where received commission for each one there are substantial grounds for believing that there extradition objection relation the offence extradition objections. 
include the surrender the person far purports sought for the extradition offence actually sought for the purpose prosecuting punishing the person account his her race sex sexual orientation religion nationality political opinions surrender the extradition country respect the extradition offence the person may prejudiced his her trial punished detained restricted his her personal liberty reason his her race sex sexual orientation religion nationality political opinions emphasis this probably isn much legal argument but the real world this whole extradition attempt smacks politics. 
all show that politicians can trumpet win their long doomed war drugs. 
spending this sort taxpayers money extradite man who may may not have been paid paltry year perform mundane administration tasks what was purely website for discussions there suggestion that nash sold drugs himself. 
hell there not even suggestion that bought drugs. 
just these trumped charges conservatives can parade him front the media claiming they brought down some sort evil drug cartel. 
according the attorney general department annual reports most extradition requests are return pats not australian citizens. 
they tend for fugitives that have escaped with hundreds millions fraudulently obtained funds child sex predators the most heinous kind. 
the united states requests extradition two four people from australia year. 
should peter nash really one them. 
amazing how your attitude toward changes once market takes hit. 
you couldnt stay online for week without getting taken down yet you espouse your security expertise like invalid limp dicked version astor.

rebuked journalist for painting whole community and team with single brush. 
was insulted and said. 
you sir are prick. 
offered you home our forums and immediately put stop all the shit our users were talking about utopia the day you were seized.

amazing how you react when take hit. 
karma not the forum kind either going get you one these days. 
hey there are some honest people that silk road team. 
fact wajor would that the majority them are.

thats why love the hub. 
this place gives platform openly discuss what going without being influenced the market question. 
this place can help all from losing money and other things. 
link sigi want easy money too. 
from evilgrin february ami want easy money too hehee. 
would also like say thank you the hub for giving subforum and for starting the hub the first place. 
when was first introduced didnt really know liked the idea but now see very useful tool keep contact with people between markets especially when market goes down. 
from nevermind february amnice see tba having subforum the hub very nice market active support and awesome refferal action hope more will join soon this. 
pandora smooth indeed must say. 
using the site since october. 
anyone else getting this http error pandora every time tryn log. 
yes but they not help you proamfetamine. 
dude its sad but honestly this the best way couldve happened. 
their opsec was not even close par. 
wouldve been worse fallout time went. 
welcome the hub deeo. 
all valid points. 
the hub should make stick thread warning about. 
have opened the discussion this policy everyone the hub its own separate thread. 
please contribute here. 
from alfred february pmalso anything other than the official story confirmed defcon just speculation and will not condemn established marketplace like based speculation. 
the problem what becoming known the official story completely implausible. 
swear its like listening obama bush spew their bullshit wars spying. 
the whole thing oozing with disnifo misinfo misdirection and pure unadulterated crap that will only work those who are ignorant about bitcoin and want believe. 
can appreciate the hubs desire appear impartial but remember silk road not established market. 
market that took the name and look previously established market which unfortunately got pwned narcos and feds. 
reeks con and even worse honeypot. 
far insiders have been able loot over btc top the atrocious commission. 
now they are promoting the most insecure possible transaction arrangement terms traceability the blockchain. 
anyone who sticks around for that sideshow will find themselves quickly busted the low hanging fruit that they are. 
from alfred february pmthe hub impartial. 
what that means give you the facts which have done telling you was hacked and you decide what with. 
you can decide never use again you can decide back and use the marketplace which now only. 
also anything other than the official story confirmed defcon just speculation and will not condemn established marketplace like based speculation. 
would the same way with any the established marketplaces. 
anyone has any hard evidence that was indeed inside job and that the current administration responsible please with. 
thanks for the reply. 
think you are missing point. 
think probably inside job. 
however point that even was not inside job then means that the administrators know nothing about coding and nothing about doing business. 
that means that certainly financial risk users confirmed and not speculation and possibly security risk speculation. 
there reason equivocate million dollars worth user funds were stolen under their administration. 
from alfred february pmi would like for someone come with list qualifications for what you consider established market. 
for instance should have treated utopia established market will answer your question. 
first you should not have treated utopia established market. 
and yes say that one the utopia forum moderators. 
actually quite surprised that utopia has its own section here. 
utopia should have been under the new marketplaces subforum for least month two while was its infancy. 
and let step further and say that someone created new utopia. 
market would even further down the list possibly established markets. 
trying cash formerly reputable name big red flag. 
market should considered established once has been operation for least months has had strange ripoffs changes admin and has significant enough market share that admins could have but did not run off with several million dollars bitcoin. 
from february pmagree with these but was compromised for what months before the takedown true however some things really cant predicted. 
all can hope that new markets learn from the mistakes previous markets and not enter the game they have been lackadaisical about opsec. 
from ripsnorta february pmthe whole thing just stinks high heaven and riddled with host unanswered questions. 
was always taught that looks like duck walks like duck and quacks like duck then its duck absolutely. 
there point treating normal market site anymore than would treat sheep marketplace normal market site they came back. 
represents financial risk and probably also security risk. 
the hub should make that clear its users. 
from sorrymario february pmi can appreciate the hubs desire appear impartial but remember silk road not established market. 
market that took the name and look previously established market which unfortunately got pwned narcos and feds. 
this has relationship with the original silk road. 
anything the owners are guilty trademark fraud and. 
why would they this trade the good reputation the original silk road. 
has far less credibility than any other current market because has proven unwilling unable protect user funds. 
impartial stance would warning use your own risk.

agree with these but was compromised for what months before the takedown alfred agree one cant spoonfeed new people who shouldnt darknet but helpfulness the naive greatly appreciated. 
its probably fair speculation that naive newbies will more likely because the name makes them think its safer sooner than going the marketplace which needs that extra technical step. 
for computer illiterates even getting darknet tough process. 
not saying that admins necessarilly have duty buyers but getting accurate histories marketplaces personalities can difficult. 
from tyrone february impartial stance would warning use your own risk. 
all the markets listed and discused here are use your own risk. 
have made that clear from the beginning here. 
would like for someone come with list qualifications for what you consider established market. 
for instance should have treated utopia established market also all saying that anyone coming this subforum hopefully going read all the posts here and make their own conclusions. 
have tell them that they could potentially lose money after reading what they have seen here any the other marketplace subforums then they probably should not the darknet full stop. 
this just opinion though and would certainly love hear arguments. 
long meaningful always appreciate discourse. 
has recently had incidents which funds escrow were stolen. 
here are the facts know them. 
the latest theft over bitcoins were stolen. 
more than double the amount that staff has admitted being stolen. 
staff have blamed the theft hackers. 
many people knowledgeable about the bitcoin protocol find the theft all the coins held through transaction malleability implausible. 
hackers did fact manage steal from users then the administration incompetent. 
moderators the forum have been deceptively stating that only users had their funds stolen. 
fact only total users had funds their bitcoin wallets escrow and those funds were stolen. 
should deemed suspicious site and the hub community deserves warning. 
minimum warning saying use your own risk. 
the hub impartial. 
what that means give you the facts which have done telling you was hacked and you decide what with. 
you can decide never use again you can decide back and use the marketplace which now only. 
also anything other than the official story confirmed defcon just speculation and will not condemn established marketplace like based speculation. 
would the same way with any the established marketplaces. 
anyone has any hard evidence that was indeed inside job and that the current administration responsible please with. 
the only way they can save themselves repay all the coins back. 
someone made lot coins there the last couple months. 
doesnt matter what happened being scam legit theft the management responsible without repayment they should avoided. 
they dont repay they should put the scammers list. 
periodthey made statement few days ago saying they were gonna repay the coins. 
anyone get refunded yet. 
this why you totally kick ass you are doing something positive and sparking meaningful debate. 
and you like long walks the beach. 
thanks alfred new fav mod. 
topicseenhold onto your hats were off again. 
time for new key. 
lol cooked has karma. 
kids are butthurt here see. 
from february amjust enjoyed thread about why you shouldnt use counterfeit pay hookers. 
nice break from the drama and abounding elsewhere. 
read that thread few weeks back when joined evolution. 
the forums are fairly tame over there. 
its nice but just dont have the time maintain different forum presences mainly check this one and the markets work. 
from every february pmok really like evo its good market that functions quite well with fast page loads and host cool feature for the vendor. 
lets make suggest here they can make more better. 
vacation mode one click disable hide all current listings for when need take break. 
clone listing for many list same product different quantity and being able one click copy the listing and edit the price and quantity very helpful. 
buyer feedback having stats our buyers helps know when your dealing with someone positive potential scammer. 
thats all can think right now. 
please chime with your suggestion. 
another good thing about agora that they have implemented everything your list. 
may suggest posting this the evolution forum forum link. 
onion its great see other venders focused improving and streamlining can serve our customers better. 
like your style. 
help get high.

yep only been able get twice today. 
must traffic load from guess. 
hello kwikeemart are really happy see that vendor enjoy our market since the beginning. 
keep working improvement and new features. 
need more security conscious web developers with understanding that youll make more btc running security tight site than vending and scamming. 
utopia was already under investigation from its inception. 
you cannot vend and admin and also successful with freedom. 
its all too much handle. 
run secure site. 
always updating and being aware. 
admin doesnt vend and only deals with site business. 
escrow locking out scammers resolutions forum issues ect. 
that should the site owners admins only job. 
make the website hum and sing sweetly. 
enjoy your freedom. 
you cannot greedy troll. 
you always make more being honest. 
look ross defcon. 
honest ross had million site and million his wallet.

the mob doesnt kill you you owe them money. 
not right away. 
long you pay you live. 
the mob bleeds you. 
youre dead they make. 
you pay over time the mob makes lot more. 
utopia was also run out someones home. 
don forget that the first time coins disappeared cold storage issue they were all returned within few weeks after dpr contacted the new admins. 
how does that fit with your scam theory why would they return all the money once and then stage elaborate scam only month later thanks alfred for keeping this discussion leveled. 
fuckrobertb fuck off you trolling cunt. 
anyone else not able get. 
page says cant connect server problem loading page. 
does that mean they are going repay the funds they stole just round scam. 
for the record the hub currently funded only alfred and the few donations have received from individual forum members. 
moving this the silk road subforum its more concept than breaking news. 
think the input the silk road community would certainly useful indicator whether your opinion holds weight and look forward reading the discussion come. 
until decon repays users shouldnt considered scam marketplace they get pass because they help fund this forum. 
thanks for covering this eiley. 
the politics and the legal system this country are beyond disgusting and the fate ssbd needs covered and not forgotten. 
for you lolmodfags you are real piece work and sociopath. 
had the dollars would pay have keyboard warrior like you hunted down and have all your secret shortcomings paraded the world.

what went wrong stupidity and greed generally land criminals jail. 
from february amquote from neferti february amdon forget that the first time coins disappeared cold storage issue they were all returned within few weeksnot taking sides here but the only proof the coins being returned was the admins saying. 
they seem have record not being truthful their community. 
they could have been returned they could have just used the money escrow. 
dont think anyone will ever know this point. 
why this point difficult for many devotees understand genuine stupidity outright denial blatant dishonesty brain hurts anytime see one these idiots asking people why they returned the cold storage coins they were scammers anyway. 
for the sticky defintiely favour. 
deepdotweb has them the dead scam category their site and big majority the darknet community seems believe scam why should the hub treat any differently.

glad youre not any trouble starting swayed the stories hearing. 
maybe its the years buying the street that has critical the minute something like that happens will wait and see not owed much just few quid change really not enough for usual order when that goes back ill know for sure. 
deliberately not making much noise with buyers account see all goes back automatically. 
that happens will have doubts all but until then wont ordering anything. 
can afford loss will either get some the street shit till then not stuck all but its consistency the street its either good and really small shit and little bigger not like what was getting. 
pays everyone back. 
that opinion this matter.
