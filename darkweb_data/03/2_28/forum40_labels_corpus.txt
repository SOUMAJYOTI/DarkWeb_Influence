what does everyone think about a temporary sr shutdown for like a week or two or a month something like that a market without af or support is a bottomless pit for you to throw you bitcoins down any other ideas for improvements welcome.

public prosecution confirmed tuesday that the police are indeed behind the action the police have taken the site offline will be announced according to a spokesman for the prosecution later this week read this a few mins ago i do not know if swim cosa and jlaw have been arrested or not i do not know if cold storage has been taken too waiting for further declarations from the police and a contact from one of them if they will ever contact me again.
very sorry to hear that man i know how much time and effort you guys put into it.
how so quickly then.
whyusheep is frim banned from utopia and now spreading fuds everywhere also if you go to authorithies showing them the ip they will tell you to go playing elsewhere because theyve got something important to do.
any one who speaks dutch might be able to search the dutch media police site.
im feeling so useless.
deepdotweb on february pmnot much info at this point but not looking good for them and stickied.
sigh such a shameleave us alon.
wow that was fast i only just signed up to this site the other day glad i didnt have a chance to place an order yet looked promising as a marketplace unfortunately.
ilovespaghetti on february amthe fact is why you write about your issue here instead of using the support section implemented on the forum fair point.
no lube an i didnt even get kissed.
doctorclu on february ami shut up whitedreams as well as everyhammond to protect my users trust is earned i understand we could have taken the cold storage and ran we didnt in fact we sacrificed our pay in the event that it wasnt returned we could have not even opened after christmas to steal everyones money we didnt my friends were arrested defcon used the contingency plan dpr could have hit the killswitch the whole time he didnt millions pass through the road each month we could up and take it all have we if anyone wants to help combat the fud and constant complaints so that i can continue to act as support while the ui is synced doctor clu whitedreams was removed from sr after weeks of complaints and an open threat on his vendor page many other scammers are currently running unchecked on sr despite forum threads featuring hundreds yes hundreds of complaints the sr staff has time to protect their customers by putting spam filters on the forums so that nobody can post links to competing markets yet it takes weeks to remove vendors who are taking advantage of buyers and even bragging about it as far as constant complaints go many of the people complaining have had thousands tied up in escrow for months while the af resolution centre implementation continues to be delayed others have been unable to access their bitcoins for weeks thanks to the negative balance bug while still others have paid for a vendor bond and are waiting weeks to be approved you want the steady stream of complaints to stop try addressing them i genuinely feel for the sr forum moderators who are acting as glorified aol customer service reps you have the power to listen to complaints and to serve as a whipping boy you dont have the kind of access to the system which would allow you to actually do anything about the problems if i sound frustrated its because im tired of fanboys genuflecting in front of the sacred camel and blaming the victims of these various setbacks and fuckups i wont piss on your leg and tell you its raining id appreciate it if you and other sr spokespeople returned the favor.
ssbd has been sitting in jail since december hes back in court next wednesday see my thoughts on it here.
amsterdam uplier on january amwe all know that swimm costranostra ilovespaghetti etc have been working under backopy at bmr so theyre competent to run utopia for sure i think both these sites will make the difference in the future seeing that their staff is anonymously known to the public and well respected  trc on february amutopia may be the closest we get to a v of bmr a real black market is back on the block thanks to swim and ils and backopy too  trc on february amyeah i miss backopy more than i thought was possible for a man i dont even know thanks for sharin.
perfectscans on january pmis your first language english yes continue with usual precaution no forget about it thats an interesting opinion some people will do business no other way  wsph eej d on january pmaround of this planets population has english as their first language everyone else is not trust worthy  sunwu on february pmi know people who have english as a second language and they are still more articulate than many with english as their first hahcouldnt agree more.
it was not because he was rude it was because he was an amateur programmer who was somehow gaining a lot of traction with vendors and buyers he was putting a lot of people at risk by not having the ability to back up his claims when was confronted with the truth about his massive security flaws his greed made him lie about my attacks and ignore me you should be thankful more people didnt waste their money on vendor accoutns and vendors didnt rack up sales that could be used to prosecute them.
whyusheep on february pmquote from nevermind on february amquote from drbitchung on february pmwhyusheep is claiming to have turned over the ip to the authorities a awefull thing to do why resort to such harmfull actions pretty fucked up first im not firm that fucking idiot thinks hes in anonymous and that trolling utopias forums amounted to hacking i did it because utopia was a shitty website with shitty security and for some dumbass reason everyone was going to sheep to the slaughter to their terrible market i used an xss on jlaw to obtain his login and leveraged that to root his server i told him about it and he called me a cunt and refused to talk to me about it further so i shut down his registration to prevent any new users from joining and turned him in to the police he was a terrible admin his site was shitty and they would have eventually been caught or hacked you should thank me involving le because someone was rude to you is uncalled for what about the users they have done nothing to harm you and are damaged as a direct restult of your actions you could have easily given everyone a chance to withdraw coin we are talking about peoples lives here think about it think about what this does for your karma.
was the end of a long investigation dating back to early they were caught because they had previously been sending drugs and guns through the mail and the cops had already building a case against them for those things when they made the arrests they were delighted to find the server hardware and everything too no word in the news article about an anonymous tip from a year old basement dweller in usa.
firm thinks he is apart of anonymous his idea of hacking is trolling utopia forums while he was doing that i was locating an xss exploit using it on jlaw rooting their servers and stealing their database and yes i did hand it over to the dutch police.
its just frim being his usual dipshit self he posts no proof just tal.
sorrymario on february pmhes such a leeto that he was able to build a time machine and turn the info over to the cops back in the beginning of just like in back to the future whyusheep is a joke i think it is very plausible that the person s using the name whyusheep haz close connection with or are somehow related to le most likely underpaid and under appreciated young people who get fucked over by the same system gouvernments if they stick around long enough some will eventually see that we are in fact the good guy.
this was really fast fuckpolic.
well we all know that there is a risk of this happening on any marketplace but wow they managed to take this site in what less than weeks thats just surprising.

hi it is an open secret it was initially discussed on the cheers sr channel on irc astor stexo and atomix sp floated the idea to ssbd then all three of the former completely disappeared to become sr admin ssbd brought the other sr moderators on board.
fuck you drclu that wasnt even that hard.
bisto on february pmquote from whyusheep on february pmfuck you drclu that wasnt even that hard if it was you why what did i or others who are not part of your war do you were a sheep who picked the wrong shepard it wasnt hard why where you so gullible to believe someone just because they had the same layout.

quoteso pull your funds before me or le takes them all the funds are already gone all mil worth you a rich man now i would probably not be posting on a forum would be on a small island somewhere.
my bad thanks edited.
millions pass through the road each month we could up and take it all have we doctor clui simply do not believe millions worth of btc pass through each month because sellers cannot get vendor accounts maybe sr has taken in millions worth in btc since inception its possible all the coin that goes in cannot be gotten out few orders imo get sent out the site is riddled with security holes and scammers more con artists in and working for sr than in prison system it is still up for debate if sr will ever get its act together i do believe that all the coin sitting on site will disappear for whatever reason dishonest owner s operator s or by another le takedown either way the coin is gone imo i challenge anyone actually involved with sr to prove me wrong bring actual proof not just cause i say so where is my coin bty oh yeah tied up in your site bring it dpr defcon definetly a con job.
since my earlier post the grand wizard has seen evidence on the sr forums that doctorclu is working to fix the vendor bond issue he appears to have helped several new vendors at least i congratulate him on his efforts and acknowledge his sincerity and his ethics a lot remains to be done but heres credit where credit is due i hope the doctor can keep up the good work and am cautiously optimistic that the road will weather these storms my disagreement may be blunt but my praise is sincere the grand wizard wont piss on your leg but i wont blow sunshine up your ass either im not into that sort of thing nothing against those who are of course thank you for your hard work.
they took the money there was no hacker wake up and smell the scam burning to much pointing at they did it.
whom on january amthe two are actually fairly similar in many ways but ill talk a little about the differences both rely on sending your traffic across or more different relays before it gets to your final destination tor primarily meant to allow anonymous access to the clearnet internet via exit nodes hidden services onion addresses like this site are really just icing on the cake tor relays servers handle routing for clients so tor clients stay fairly anonymous they dont advertise their addresses to each other and they connect to known public tor relays or less advertised tor bridges basically just a relay thats not advertised as publicly the advantage with this architecture is that clients are always just clients they dont route traffic for other people and nobody but their first hop into the tor network known as an entry guard or a bridge if using tor bridges has the ability to see their real ip address everything has a tradeoff and there are some disadvantages here are a few tor relays have to provide all of the bandwidth used by the entire network clients dont contribute bandwidth back to the tor network its nearly impossible to do peer to peer protocols with tor clients without having to turn the client into a hidden server like torchat does tor hidden services arent the primary purpose of tor getting people to the internet anonymously is so they dont get as much development there have been a number of academic papers focusing on deanonymizing tor hidden services figuring out their true ip addresses which allows adversaries to target them directly and without a significant number of high volume hidden services also running on the tor network it gets harder to hide the few high volume services that are left a tor client only sends traffic from itself it never routes traffic for other people so theres no significant plausible deniability about the traffic from the client if its coming from your tor instance its your traffic i p designed primarily to provide anonymous access to resources within the i p network called eepsites i p is really designed to connect to the equivalent of tor hidden services and doesnt provide reliable connectivity to the clear internet unlike tor where clients connect to servers and servers do all the work the i p model is largely built around a model where every client is a relay as well the way its meant to work wed all run i p instances all the time and theyd connect to each other in a large mesh and if i was building a path to a site that needed three hops i might very well use your i p instance as one of the hops this has advantages every client contributes bandwidth since youre basically having to agree to route traffic for everyone else and theyre agreeing to route traffic for you its closer to pay as you go but youre paying with your own bandwidth plausible deniability just because traffic is coming from my i p router instance that doesnt necessarily mean its my traffic could be one of my peers traffic that im just routing there are also some disadvantages everything in life has a cost i p isnt fire and forget you cant just connect expect to get good bandwidth as with tor for free then disconnect it really is built around the model that youre connected or at least for hours on end and always routing traffic for everyone the farther you stray from that model the worse the performance gets you can connect to i p in a hidden mode where youre similar to a tor client but performance is going to take a hit why would other i p participants want to haul your traffic for you if youre not contributing to them i p might take a few hours or a day to speed up to decent performance levels after you fire it up and most complaints about its performance are from people who arent using it the way it was intended i p cant hide the real ips of its clients as well because theyre relays too if everyone is a relay everyone needs a way to know who all the relays are and the net result is that its much easier to build a list of all i p relays at any given time this opens up some attacks where an adversary harvests lists of all i p relays on a regular basis i e who all is using i p right now then works that into an intersection attack basically whom posted at times x y and z which i p relays were all online at those three times over time intersection attacks get very effective one criticism that has been argued to hell and back at srfv is that in a marketplace scenario if an adversary already knows a rough geographic location for an i p user i e they received a package from a vendor located in seattle that intersection attack gets much easier not going to rehash it here its hasnt received as much scrutiny academics have been beating on the tor network for a decade very few analyses of i p have occurred and that doesnt mean its problem free it just means that nobodys looked at it closely the third rarely mentioned network is freenet which is a high latency network that works much differently from tor and i p wont bore you with that description here hope that helps a little it gets complicated quick and everybody ends up getting into religious battles over this versus that theyre both pretty interesting technologies and neither one really stands up well to adversaries like nsa over the long haul but theyre really all everyone has to work with right now does a vpn running with i p increases the security.
ive set up shop there still not even a pm but i guess its just new patience is a virgin p.
jules winnfield on february pmllama socks good to see you around havent seen you in a hot minute llama socks rocks hub users good to see another good vendor still doing it thank you as im so small i dont usually get noticed appreciated.
nevermind on february pmwe are talking about peoples lives here think about it think about what this does for your karma  nevermind on february pmif you are in fact le you are being fucked over by that same system where politicians have power over the skilled they make you damage our society by enforcing druglaws that are wrong you are a pawn for the moraly and ethically wrong side in this conflict and i invite you to change side  ilovespaghetti on february pm to nevermind post great thought.
sorrymario on february pmle certainly has an interest in disseminating fud so that is a possibility however due to the new information being given in news releases on the seizure it is looking more and more like cosanostra and possibly one or more of the other admins had already been identified by le back when they were personally shipping drugs weapons the arrests seem to all stem from things which occurred in and the market seizure appears to only be incidental to le having already idd the admins and stumbled upon their computers and servers in at the end of the investigation if you think the le press release would mention a tip off from some random redditor that got them the server you are a moron also yes they were under investigation but they never explained how they obtained the server location i gave you that explanation evolution is next and if sr cant get their shit together and wants to go to war i will show them that they are fucking amateurs too.
opinions are like assholes lets hear yours.
thewhiteshadow on february amits a god dam shame they couldnt just sit back keep there nose clean and earn millions with ease and comfort we need full on nerds to start up a site not hardcore fucking druggosquote from nevermind on february pmwell thats how these bitches roll they are not stupid and have been in this game for decadesthink more nerds less violence would be also a good thing for parts of society outside dnminteresting.
why would i help you for free the only one i like here is maybe nevermind the rest of you are censoring assholes.
too much attack surface and increases the number of my adversaries.
ripsnorta on february pmquote from tyrone on february amquote from lonewolf on february amwhat was wrong with astors security advice let me think told people that it was safe to sign up to atlantis through phishing proxy and then people got phished after that called the phishing proxy very sophisticated when it was the simplest type of proxy out there discouraged automatic universal pgp for black market websites that means if a buyer didnt send by pgp the website would convert the message or address to pgp to the vendor and only the encrypted messages or address would remain on the server gave the wrong advice regarding tor ip leaks told people not to use a proxy in conjunction with tor the only thing that can protect against an ip leak and many more things that i cant even remember anyway this guy is the one running sr look how that turned out its stexo running the site in my opinion just like ross ran sr i seriously doubt if its anymore than a one man operation dpr didnt disappear he has just morphed into defcon and hux ive seen various posts now on the sr board asking where cirrus went to so where did he go to and why ter.
this sheep guy needs a clap around his fucking forehead id personally do it if i saw the cunt in the street puss.
well one thing im convinced of is whyusheep is not frim.
whyusheep defco.
dpr and or staff stole our coin geesh read up no bugs not a btc bug known since simple theft.
yet they find time to ban me for posting legit invites to a market that is actually up running and not stealing btc from its users fuck sr heres an agora invite.
hey sunwu i ordered from you last saturday and fed and messaged you and you replied on monday saying it would be shipped and processed asap it is now friday and still no package were you able to send mine out in time please get in touch with me if possible i will send you a pgp message as well with more details but if you could just give me any update on my order i would really appreciate it.
cooked on february amhello am i allowed to be a vendor on evolutioni think you should unban me from tcf regardsn.
be interesting to see how this show ends indeed.
ive changed my mine about eight thousand times since this all started its now time to assume that every thing you see before you is part of the process from top to bottom from defcon to oracle its being very well played if it keeps going as is not only will they have pocketed some coins but they may even have a customer base ready and willing to line and up and be scammed again there was a glimpse of hope in the early hours when hiniguel seemed to be blowing the place apart but in the cold light of day i think its become apparent that last night was a stimulant fueled journey headfirst into a superhero fantasy for a man to be speaking of extreme hacking partners and boasting of his k k moneys no object approach when a quick background check reveals someone importanting meth and maybe making k on a good month i think tells you what you need to know its going to be fun to watch fall apart over the next few days well move on some of us learning from it and maybe even analysing decentralised options while no doubt a large group will fall into the same old traps.
thats what ive been thinking ed a lot of users seem to be the same person and you can see it fairly easy with some dpr defcon is a ploy to make someone look good the day the last original mods went was when it started showing cracks that really stopped me using i.
ilovespaghetti on february pmheres an article about it anyone.
i thought the admins on utopia were arrested wouldnt that mean you ilovespagetti just curiou.
not so many hours it seems much the market has a maximum of six hours the movements correct of my wallet cheers.
i remember reading somewhere that astor was actually le or the infamous sabu.
iirc the reason automated pgp was shunned was because it might rely on javascript which would be an additional attack vector for le this is what happened with freedom hosting if you rely on someone else for your own personal security then youll be brought down eventually theres a reason tor browser ships with noscript even though javascript is still enabled in the default config for convenience.
on february amscout pine astor nope pine and astor are definitely different people scout was fired by dpr.
tyrone on february amquote from brassballs on february amquote from jules winnfield on february ami remember reading somewhere that astor was actually le or the infamous sabu and dont forget pineyes pine was was also against universal automated pgp if everything was in pgp through automation then the authorities would have nothing if they grabbed the server pine was against this pine did advise people to do manual pgp the problem is that the majority did not use pgp and pine knew it i dont see a mistake she he did there you send some cleartext to the server which encrypts it on the server and if authorities find the servers there is no trace from the plain text anymore this gives me additional security over encryption done by myself or does it give a false sense of security and even more would rely on the site security instead of their own your decission.
red herrings a few of us know what was found re stexos identity as dpr and links to the recent hack but should be released soon on the forums you should look much more close at hux and oracle and ps told you so about stex.
this post convinced me that astor left the community for good.
lets hear it good and loud.
doctorclu on february amwe know what happened we are not clueless it was a hack absolutely hilarious i dont doubt that you are not in on the theft that said you have been providing cover for it and enabling it through your blandishments of the forum before the theft that everything is fine that makes you culpable.
doctorclu on february amwe know what happened we are not clueless it was a hack why are you even still here everyone is disgusted by you.
why are any sr mods given staff id here think that is smart.
mycarneedstint on february amdpr and or staff stole our coin geesh read up no bugs not a btc bug known since simple theft.
hi bubba replied to you twice please avoid double posting it only slows us s.
one of the best posts ive read in a very long time you bring some much need clarity and eloquence to the public discourse and provide a brief respite from the adolescent and drug fueled ramblings weve become so accustomed to politics can be just as much of a ratfuck i hope you stay on as a journalist for the dark markets you are appreciated to those of you who used sr its your own fault the market screamed scam from the very beginning and there was countless warnings throughout its operation.
the user cooked signed up and somehow used my pgp key its not a problem on my side i think he bypassed your security measures or somethin.
sunwu on february amso i have been having pgp bug with tba since i signed up some weeks ago we put in the right key but the admins encryption is not correct now the admin account is deleted and no way to contact them shame it looked good but the team seems too small and market premature i dont think we will join market owners need to take note releasing premature market only damages it in the long run stop trying to race it out there hi thanks for raising your issues and bringing forth your apprehensions and i hope with this post i can address them ive said this before and ill say it again firstly our sub forum here at the hub is was not intended to be a support forum as much as i try to stay updated with posts here to remedy any issues brought to our notice we have our own official support forum where any bugs are to be reported and and the ones reported thus far have been fixed asap and i recommend you to use it to stay upto to date with the latest i do not have an army of staff and do all the work myself despite that and as reported by other users here such issues have been fixed the soonest possible and often the fix solution has been an action that has been required from the users end to rectify something they hadnt done correctly in the first place its a new site and a number of things work differently from what you as a buyer vendor would have been used to in a different market as for the issue you reported to me via pm to me was not being able to decrypt your received messages i sent you another follow up pm to track what where the issue was but since you havent been on the support forum you likely havent read how this can has been addressed i would recommend the following log in to your account disable tfa click account tab edit re upload pub key logout login back again you will not be prompted for tfa as its disabled re enable tfa send yourself a test message you should receive it encrypted and you should be able to decrypt it else happy to send you test messages again as your login pin and pms order encryption and profile p are all connected with your pgg key and sometime while uploading them its not correctly formatted this is has been reported twice you included from over a thousand accounts also all other administrative accounts have now been disabled for security reasons including mine and therefore you see my previous account disabled on the system but am reachable by the same handle and happy to send you test messages for when youre done with the steps above also pls note for a month we gave away free vendor registrations and zero commisions on orders there was not a penny the market made but now since were charging for both vendor registration and orders we will be devoting much of that fund in pimping up security and having more hands at the deck to assist me and you guys round the clock hope it helps cheers.
so i have been having pgp bug with tba since i signed up some weeks ago we put in the right key but the admins encryption is not correct now the admin account is deleted and no way to contact them shame it looked good but the team seems too small and market premature i dont think we will join market owners need to take note releasing premature market only damages it in the long run stop trying to race it out there.
bullionaire on february pmman this sucks really liked the utopia admins  mycarneedstint on february pmmy prayers are with them all  deepdotweb on february amin the op of the public prosecution document for the story.
ive done a lot of orders on bsm it works really good they allow customers to release partial escrow too.
jules winnfield on february pmyour ganja looks mouth watering by the way haha good view.
of course it was a scam get real people and wake up after reading through all forum posts news comments of the mods and admins of sr there are too many fishy things and contradictions blaming transaction malleability and the admin clearly  that it is a recently discovered bug is laughable it wasnt published last week as he stated in his latest forum post it was published ago just before this heist a thread named reality check was posted stating that users should be thankful for all the positive security measures that had been made and for all the effort the admin s put in the development of the website also another thread was being publicized promoting that nobody should finalize early any transaction which then resulted in more btc in escrow also nothing was done regarding the required ban of certain well known scammers and certain users reported negative btc balance on their account after depositing a substantial amount of btc to their sr wallet the admin defcon claims hes been off internet for like a whole week so he didnt know about the mtgox announcement and the ddos attacks lets be clear here he runs a black market the last thing he would do is not be informed for a whole damn week hed had to live under a rock to not hear about the recent mtgox scandal and if he really didnt then hes not to be trusted with running any site let alone sr long minutes hours after the admin stated in the sr forum that the site has been hacked and all coins were stolen several transactions were still happening which deducted funds from known vendor accounts i repeat after the post has been made this is just written scam all over it the admin claims he took all funds from the wallets to a single hot storage wallet to re enable the auto finalize option on the site and he left it there for days straight i refuse to believe this level of stupidity from an admin who runs a site like sr then he tried to explain it by typing that he was stressed out sure the posts of certain mods have too many contradictions one minute they say im only a moderator here we are only paid to run the forums i have nothing to do with sr itself the usual blablabla and the next minute the same person on a different thread writes sentences like we will open the market when this and this will be finished oh so suddenly its a we also they claim they accidentally delete threads i e the most important one recently regarding the admins statement on the situation sounds believable right the admin defcon who failed his community by being hacked as he claims has the audacity to warn people of security issues of other sites suggesting people not to use other marketplaces he doesnt even know because he fears for the safety of the customers funds oh the irony i suspect that the forums mods also have other forum accounts so they can publicly write positive opinions about themselves sr and anybody who still believes in them otherwise i cannot explain mods and other users allegedly female in the black market giving each other hugs and kisses and things of that nature while some people lost thousands of dollars in a few days also the admin has a bunch of dedicated groupies co signing whatever he says exchanging female like emotional comments like i am deeply thankful for the hundreds of supportive messages ive received this is a business not a f cking female high school simply put i cant believe this unprofessional manner to conduct business run a website and the obvious scam that this is these people should not be trusted with anything related to any black market in the future unfortunately the fact is that they can pop up anywhere anytime under a different name and identity and we probably wouldnt know a thing about it.
doctorclu on february amwe know what happened we are not clueless it was a hack stop spewing nonsense and misinformation if by hack you mean stolen then use correct terminology if you honestly believe it was a hack then you are truly cluless yes that was a play on your name duh clueless for sure the mods have been a no show for months well they have been busy deleting forum accounts and censoring both facts and opinions not helping or advising properly in fact misleading not protecting us at all letting the sr kitty build up the lies excuse drp puppet accounts defcon gave us did not make any sense more holes than swiss cheese in that story prehaps if you didnt understand how btc works or a website you may easily buy into the web of lies but the ones who do understand know for a fact that defcon lied plain and simple fact defcons hack story which is what is in all our account wallets i do not expect any coin i do not expect an honest apology i do not expect to hear the truth from defcon or any sr mod ie the truth i stole from the community just stop speading lies about a wink wink hack or some btc problem that has been known about for years nothing like this happened on sr there were other scams then if it were possible to steal btc as described in conjobs defcons explanation someone would have done it on sr but noone did because it is not possible im sorry for all those who lost coin never use sr again that site has been burned and so have we lets dox defcon and all the other thieves.
for sure scum defcon stole our coin no doubts sr has been a scam from day one if you continue to use sr you will be burned again guarenteed.
regardless of regardless whats done is done just as irl trust you cannot put a price on its a personal decision and those that continue riding the gravy train that sadly the defunct road has now become are kind of the most most tolerant of people if you wanna be harsh about it they are religious fanatics emotionally attached no different to romance scamsyou know say your stuck on a boat and someone dies you should wait until every other member on the boat has mourned the death until throwing them overboard otherwise mass hysteria will ensu.
mycarneedstint on february amit is still up for debate if sr will ever get its act together i do believe that all the coin sitting on site will disappear for whatever reason dishonest owner s operator s or by another le takedown either way the coin is gone imo i challenge anyone actually involved with sr to prove me wrong bring actual proof not just cause i say so where is my coin bty oh yeah tied up in your site bring it dpr defcon definetly a con job and indeed it di.
the good thing about i p is you can download files videos use java script is this correct you just have to wait a while while the router populates.

nevermind on february amquote from on february pmwhat fucking going on with all black markets sr has been hacked i dont believe that bullshit cant register in agora because a problem utopia fallen down maybe can this the begin of the end i dont wanna believe in that but all this subject is very strange only we can still waiting preferent for sr but later of they has been hacked i cant believe this yet not the end friend its just a new beginningi like how sounds that.
im here for all of you my friends from bmr and utopia deeo account is taken i need to talk about it to mods and i forgot password to deeo account for now if you wanna check me use pgp from bmr im still on utopia forum cause it works best for me while this hub dont load many times im not selling anything anywhere can le fuck off with those dumb pms hey can i get your email.
and for clarification the dox in question was that of a scammer and a person doing everything in their wee power to disrupt the market and its community so if you are conserned about this happening to you then the description above probably fits you too in which case no one wants you on their market anyways.
i cant wait until i see sr staff and busted paraded in front of the media on their way to daily ass rapings from big black cock in the clink.
so was theft or hack.
amai on february pmhopefully the culprit or culprits will be found ame.
whom on february pmdo you know of a way to pin a local i p router instance in hidden mode to specific i p router so your local i p router always uses your vps is always as first hop your local ip isnt advertised and the vps is blind to the content of your traffic since its just relaying i p traffic that seems like pretty much a perfect world from an i p perspective you get the bandwidth of a high bandwidth i p router but dont have to let the vps see the traffic before its encrypted for i p transport this would be a restricted route and has been in planning for basically forever.
just enjoyed a thread about why you shouldnt use counterfeit s to pay hookers priceless a nice break from the drama and bs abounding elsewhere.
you cant be humorous without trolling drama unless of course black kids are being counted absent for nigh schoolor evolution sells benches to niggers so they can support their familie.
lolmodfags on february ami hope he enjoys getting raped in one of those nice american jails just relax ssbd youll only make it harder on yourself youre nex.
anyone can see that silk road has just pulled off the biggest scam in darknet history you got to remember stealth you are not talking to dumbass fanboys all the time and most of us that have been around for more than minutes can see exactly what has happened i just cant believe that so many are willing to go back to get scammed again for round.
ignore this stealth idiot who cannot even properly explain how mtgox transaction malleability allowed some hacker to empty the entire value of the sr balance sheets coincidentally this is the exact amount a corrupt owner operator would be able to steal silk road is dead drive a stake into its rancid heart and move on.

we have been a vendor on pm since it was roadsilk they do not have a large consumer base but are very dedicated and fast acting all messages never take longer then a day to respond to all of my customers were very satisfied with the way the support handled all situations the ui is very basic but has made many improvements over the months looking forward to a long term partner ship with pm thought this market needed some pr because it is very underrated and the personal interactions we have had with the support owner are by far the best we have seen in the darknet markets hope pm becomes what it wants to be and maintains the current mindset over the course of there business ap.
all markets are unsafe but its no harm to remind newbies of the history of a particular franchise sr fbi sr robbed twice sr.
the whole thing just stinks to high heaven and is riddled with a host of unanswered questions i was always taught that if it looks like a duck walks like a duck and quacks like a duck then its a duck.
i feel sorry for you if you actually believe this was anything other than an inside job it was most likely defcon who lead the scam but it is possible somebody that worked with him screwed him over but that seems unlikely definite con his name unabbreviated doesnt give a damn about anybody but himself and will continue to spin his intricate web of lies i cant believe some people are actually drinking the koolaid you must suck at basic math if you believe any of it because it simply doesnt add up the whole equation doesnt make sense.
rc every ne on february pmquote from on february amjust enjoyed a thread about why you shouldnt use counterfeit s to pay hookers priceless a nice break from the drama and bs abounding elsewhere ha ya i read that thread a few weeks back when i joined evolution the forums are fairly tame over there its nice but i just dont have the time to maintain different forum presences so i mainly check this one and the markets i work on yes checking different forums can become tiresome all the drama on sr right now left me exhausted so the peacefulness at evolution was much appreciated its also apparent that people there at least for now are serious about doing good business instead of having tons of trolls spreading fud as fast as they can type the admins are also very present and interactive on the forums its quite refreshing i love the hub too but not all of my customers come here yet im working on that though.
wanna buy a bench cooked ill set up a custom sale sale just for.
ok so i really like evo its a good market that functions quite well with fast page loads and a host of cool feature for the vendor lets make suggest here so they can make it more better vacation mode one click to disable hide all current listings for when we need to take break clone listing for many we list same product in different quantity and being able to one click copy the listing and edit the price and quantity is very helpful buyer feedback having stats on our buyers helps to know when your dealing with someone positive or potential scammer thats all i can think of right now please chime in with your suggestion.
i just managed to login.
we use b blender for a small portion of our clean out process never observed a problem concerning tainted coins we move to cash outyes we observe the blockchain transaction process too.
quotethe big problem silk road has right now is trust the big problem right now is there are a bunch of accounts with negative balances and mine which has nan error which has over stuck and no one if fixing the issue you start fucking with peoples money and do nothing about it is a big issue all my vendors have removed listing and have moved on i am still hanging around because i would like to get my money back when your money does not come back that screams major bullshit on many levels you can fill my thoughts from there.
la la la llama socks.
perfectscans on january pmlook it really is very simple when considering a new market you must ask one critical question of that market and its owners and support is your first language english yes continue with usual precaution no forget about it cant tell if trolling or stupid.

hello guys bitcoin core version has been released and it now has an really interesting feature use tor hidden with tor version it is possible through tor s control socket api to create and destroy ephemeral hidden services bitcoin core has been updated to make use of this this means that if tor is running and proper authorization is available bitcoin core automatically creates a hidden service to listen on without manual configuration bitcoin core will also use tor automatically to connect to other onion nodes if the control socket can be successfully opened this will positively affect the number of available onion nodes and their usage this new feature is enabled by default if bitcoin core is listening and a connection to tor can be made it can be configured with the listenonion torcontrol and torpassword settings to show verbose debugging information pass debug tor source anyone played around with it bitcoin core has some really nice commands like onlynet onion etc might be very useful could anyone here whos apparently more tech than i am be so kind to explain which would be the best combination of those fancy new commands options on tails id really appreciate your help so many thanks in advance.

ok we have some news to someone on reddit quoteit says that the dutch police has confirmed that theyve seized the marketsite details on how they did it will be available later this week.
on february pmquote from unknownand the website was today for a few hours offline maybe they changed the host to a dutch police server lol.
deepdotweb on february pmany one who speaks dutch might be able to search the dutch media police site good idea mate hopefully someone will shortly.
ilovespaghetti on february pmim feeling so useless you are doing all that you can ils no one could ask for more.
well that escalated quickly.
wow this was fast luckly im sticked with pirate marke.
feel bad for peoples loss again its the chance we all take i guess.
i think its really sad news the market just opened wonder how le located the server so other markets can take precautions and be safe most of all i hope the staff is safe and users didnt lose to much coin.
backopyive no role at utopia you know the people behind it and their history at bmr they were and are great friends and staff members thats all i can say i wish them all the best in the world  backopyhere before it starts i stated that i have no role there and never had it remains the same for me i know the people who were running it from bmr they were mostly my staff but they went on their own i did not code it or ever worked there in anyway im truly sorry to know today about its seizure and im obviously concern about its admins ive no other information at the moment about if there were any arrests or know about them except for ils and shader.
ilovespaghetti on february amthe fact is why you write about your issue here instead of using the support section implemented on the forum.
clu stop saying this shit is yours none of this is yours you did not make any of it you were appointed as a mod because the real mods got fucking jailed jesus fucking christ i like you man i really do and i think youre a fine mod but recently ive seen you be an unjust asswipe to several people you have not wronged me and i dont expect you to but this shit is ridiculous you keep saying my marketplace and my users my this and my that like you had any fucking ounce of responsibility in its construction ive seen you ban people for expressing negative opinions about the site censoring people telling them to fuck off and leave if they do not like it i have always supported you and i thought it was awesome when you made mod but this is not silk road give it a fucking rest.
i shut up whitedreams as well as everyhammond to protect my users trust is earned i understand we could have taken the cold storage and ran we didnt in fact we sacrificed our pay in the event that it wasnt returned we could have not even opened after christmas to steal everyones money we didnt my friends were arrested defcon used the contingency plan dpr could have hit the killswitch the whole time he didnt millions pass through the road each month we could up and take it all have we if anyone wants to help combat the fud and constant complaints so that i can continue to act as support while the ui is synced.
deepdotweb on january pmfor those of you who did not follow this story from the beginning to the end we bring you the most recent fiasco edited into a complete and clear timeline with alot of help from the avid owners please take your security seriously what a story great lessons thanks.

yeah we know was moved to the dead section.
ziggy on february amquote from losttemple on february ami lost from the bond made sales it was open for a few weeks its my opinion that metadpr will be back and operating a market under another pseudo name someone estimated that hed made around btc which was not worth a huge amount at the time he has the infrastructure experience and expertise to begin all over again and orchestrate another scam the question is which of the current markets belongs to him and when will he bite i mirror your thinking and agree mettadpr did get all but though so that would of shaken him up a bit things people can d.

to nevermind post great thought.
look your course of action is one that leads to more people getting hurt and honestly your presence here gives me a bad vibe but you seem to have a reason to visit drugmarkets if so we have a common interest so im gonna work from that im no expert but i have the impression that you are rather good with computers are angry and have enough time on your hands to make a rather large impact on a community that i happen to like a lot if you are so concerned with our safety why dont you start your own market make it the most secure market ever i for one would be happy to shop there and others might too your time and knowledge pays off and your actions are constructive regardless of your conflict with the admin turning in utopia is helping le and by doing so you are helping the current oppression by the powers that be that deny me my basic human rights youve probably been fucked over by the system that is keeping me down so why not help to create something new and better serious man we need skilled people on our side if you are in fact le you are being fucked over by that same system where politicians have power over the skilled they make you damage our society by enforcing druglaws that are wrong you are a pawn for the moraly and ethically wrong side in this conflict and i invite you to change side.
drbitchung on february pmwhyusheep is claiming to have turned over the ip to the authorities a awefull thing to do why resort to such harmfull actions pretty fucked up.
nevermind on february amquote from drbitchung on february pmthats a awefull thing to do why resort to such harmfull actions because sorymario started a crusade against him deleting any acount he n suspcted of being him this needed resolution but handled wrong imo stil thers no proof he did it he mite be taking the credit for it becoz he pissed off atm.
nevermind on february amquote from drbitchung on february pmwhyusheep is claiming to have turned over the ip to the authorities a awefull thing to do why resort to such harmfull actions pretty fucked up first im not firm that fucking idiot thinks hes in anonymous and that trolling utopias forums amounted to hacking i did it because utopia was a shitty website with shitty security and for some dumbass reason everyone was going to sheep to the slaughter to their terrible market i used an xss on jlaw to obtain his login and leveraged that to root his server i told him about it and he called me a cunt and refused to talk to me about it further so i shut down his registration to prevent any new users from joining and turned him in to the police he was a terrible admin his site was shitty and they would have eventually been caught or hacked you should thank me.
im not firm firm is a idiot who thinks he is apart of anonymous but his hacking skills amount to trolling forums while he was busy dicking around on forums i was shutting down utopia.
brassballs on february pmyou could make clearnet site last longer tehn utopia didi think i speak for everyone when i say type fucking normally.
good to hear from you ils you have my utmost respect putting your freedom on the line to provide people the opportunity to practice their right stay safe mate a.
i did advise i went to jlaw immediately after rooting his server and his greed made it impossible for him to admit his massive security fuck ups he not only refused to listen he lied to his community when i continued my attacks the guy was a scumbag and the site was terrible he charged to withdraw funds and convinced everyone backopy was involved jlaw was a scumbag amateur who got what he deserved i dont disagree that marijuana isnt a big deal you are preaching to the choir but when you run a market you are risking not only yourself but everyone you convince to join for you to make profit.
it looks to me like they expected to raid a vendor and ended up getting lucky and landing a couple of marketplace administrators.
its always sad when a market goes down because it means someone has fallen foul of anachronistic drug laws and faces time in jail or that someone or several people have just been ripped off no positives there.
just saw this shit on reddit this guy turned in utopia and is looking to bring down more markets dont know if its true but if it is the fucking prick.
le certainly has an interest in disseminating fud so that is a possibility however due to the new information being given in news releases on the seizure it is looking more and more like cosanostra and possibly one or more of the other admins had already been identified by le back when they were personally shipping drugs weapons the arrests seem to all stem from things which occurred in and the market seizure appears to only be incidental to le having already idd the admins and stumbled upon their computers and servers in at the end of the investigation.
now please do not begin a war here.
ok i wont respond to it or discuss it agai.
police has declared they busted them after undercover investigations going on from the.
pothead on february pmthe hacker that killed cannabis road also tried to blackmail us he said he would call fbi with names ect if we didnt pay himneedless so say we did not complydealing with hackers le bitcoin in turmoil what the fuck is next lol he would just call the fbi up that is a funny threat i wasnt blackmailing them i was trying to get them to either acknowledge their massive security fuckups or i was going to shut them down they would have taken out a lot of vendors with them if i did not.
sorrymario on february pmok i wont respond to it or discuss it again good to hear from you aswell sorrymario stay safe mate a.

the hacker that killed cannabis road also tried to blackmail us he said he would call fbi with names ect if we didnt pay himneedless so say we did not complydealing with hackers le bitcoin in turmoil what the fuck is next.
we did take the advice but deleting our member base was wrong where i am pot is legal no one gives a fuck about it le dont care about weed its all the other market staples that are causing the problems we are down but not out if you were good guy interested in helping the community you would have advised us and helped us not burn us up and we were telling everyone we were in early stagespeac.
yeah its a bad situation all around people at least one of whom is an admin have their lives ruined people lose their money to seized wallets cops get tons of free bitcoins to order shit from vendors i fuck with markets.
chances are a mistake was made early on in the creation of the site and the dutch police were waiting for some transactions to occur before legitimately seizing the server ils im so sorry let me know if there is anything the sr can do.
on february pmwow that was fast i only just signed up to this site the other day glad i didnt have a chance to place an order yet looked promising as a marketplace unfortunately the process of regstering an account was never fixed for me and now its gone thoughts out to all those who are affected only divided we fal.
unluckily they were under investigation from undercover agents since.
it should have been painfully obvious the site was poorly constructed it was made with cakephp.
heres an article about it.
man this sucks i was hoping they were on the run rather than in jail really liked the utopia admins.
super damn i really hope the police screw up have to release the coins and the people involved my prayers are with them all.
it was so fast because like evolution it is not properly setup.
may i know your opinion on evolution also you should consider selling your testing service.

hacked on the forum it says someone found a bug inside the cashout function.
today according to their staff a bug was exploited which allowed a hacker to steal their entire hot storage balance the future of the market is right now uncertain but they are offering non escrow trading and sparing no expense in tracking down the culprit discuss.
bstring you crack me u.
cannot lurkive never liked doctorclu in the days of irc chat before his sr modship he had a tendency to kick people for minor shit insulting him look at what the mods have been doing on sr theyve been spending all of their time telling people to calm down that their funds would be released that they would get some degree of support meanwhile they constantly reiterated that the developers were focusing on security that the site was designed to be unbreakable problems were ignored and the website was chronically understaffed or so they said now we have been completely shat on at best defcon and the dev team were incompetent and the mods had a main job of assuring everyone that they were competent however i suspect the worse possibility that the site is a scam the cold storage fiasco was obviously a ruse they recovered the coins and everyone collectively circle jerked when they though oh my defcon and co are so trustworthy then we heard assurances from the admins that bitcoins would now be stored in multi signature cold storage where multiple admins would be needed to steal funds or something to that effect next we have had information that the site was hacked by a specific vendor remember ebook the vendor who hacked sheep marketplace such a statement is an obvious diversion away from the fact that the site has stolen the coins enjoy chasing phantoms now there is a slighlty possibility that the coins will be miraculously recovered adding trust the the silk road this time however i believe that its unlikely so a big fuck you to the mods who are all pigs doctorclu in particular is like squealer in addition to being a dog because he took his piggy little ass shaking his tail convincing us all in the face of piles of evidence that sr was secure that they were under oh so much pressure like malleability of transactions would allow someone to hack and steal all of the coins as for whyusheep ignore his posts any hacker who really pulled this shit off the hacker scenario is quite unlikely would keep a low profile rather than bragging on reddit any self respecting person who is able to hack an entire marketplace in one day would not give a shit about constantly parading himself in reddit whyusheep fuck off anyone who continues to feel assuaged by hugs and kisses from chemcat should look at the ceiling gullible is written there time for a great reckoning and another slaughter of the sheep youre the same fucking idiots that buy things based on brand names notlurking defcon and co napolean the pig and his fellow pigstersthe fucktard assuage fear mods like chemcat etc squealer the pigthe ban people who spread fud mods like doctorclu the dogslaw enforcement humanspeople who use the site for buying vending buyers are sheep vendors are ducks chickens etc burnt out hippies who post on the forum repeatedly about stupid shit like lsd microdosing the raven who talks about sugarcandy mountaingwern myself and other people who continue warning benjamin the donkeythe scamming vendors the ratlibertas ssbd synergy etc snowballross ulbricht old majo.

doctorclu on february pmquote from whyusheep on february pmi did advise i went to jlaw immediately after rooting his server and his greed made it impossible for him to admit his massive security fuck ups he not only refused to listen he lied to his community when i continued my attacks the guy was a scumbag and the site was terrible he charged to withdraw funds and convinced everyone backopy was involved jlaw was a scumbag amateur who got what he deserved i dont disagree that marijuana isnt a big deal you are preaching to the choir but when you run a market you are risking not only yourself but everyone you convince to join for you to make profit if you gave them the db as you say i fucking doubt you are more than a script kiddie if that they would have user information and hashed passwords but wouldnt be able to seize the site they have control over the private key for that onion address that isnt stored on a market database dipshit first i said i gave the db and the ip address using that they probably found the physical location of the server and seized it that would let them get the onion address you must not be very bright or illiterate if you couldnt put that together as a potential possibly and not just assume your one guess was right also fuck you and your piece of shit market it runs like shit instead of being a vulture why dont you correct your shit before i knock it down to and you end up in jail like jlaw.
i decided not to leave a reply as to many people seem to be commenting on this thread anywaythis is my opinion most likely totally wrong but what kind of idiots would go selling that much drugs and guns irl and start offering to wack people for money and offering to le out of all people its a god dam shame they couldnt just sit back keep there nose clean and earn millions with ease and comfort we need full on nerds to start up a site not hardcore fucking druggo.
no one hacked into the server also sorrymario i think you and ils should get a job at sr i think sr could use a couple of standup guys like you two right doctorclu.
amsterdam uplier on february amno one hacked into the server also sorrymario i think you and ils should get a job at sr i think sr could use a couple of standup guys like you two right doctorclu i for one would love to see ils here at the hub more there is little to no bmr utopia presence here i will say that seeing doctorchu extend ils an olive branch when the shitstorm was at its heaviest was a great moment.
thewhiteshadow on february ami decided not to leave a reply as to many people seem to be commenting on this thread anywaythis is my opinion most likely totally wrong but what kind of idiots would go selling that much drugs and guns irl and start offering to wack people for money and offering to le out of all people its a god dam shame they couldnt just sit back keep there nose clean and earn millions with ease and comfort we need full on nerds to start up a site not hardcore fucking sr le orchestrated the situation and another le undercover offering to take care of this problem which got ross accused of conspiring to commit murder they knew who he was but instead of just filing a report and shutting the server down they decide to go for an oscar like they were playing with him well thats how these bitches roll they are not stupid and have been in this game for decades it wouldnt be supprising if the dutch secret service also orchestrated a problem that leaded to the ordering of a hit the way i see it to them it is just a game they currently are not even playing to win otherwise they would at least attempt to synchronise arrests globally they depend on gouvernment budget and ironicly us dissapearing would hurt their funding think more nerds less violence would be also a good thing for parts of society outside dnm and we need to improve our game ofcourse.
they were already under investigation thats it unlickily irl drug weapons dealing and murder attempts raise a lot of attention.
nevermind on february pmwonder how le located the server so other markets can take precautions and be safe  mary on february pmfeel bad for peoples loss again its the chance we all take i guess i guess.
he whyusheep whyusheep etc is only a troll and you are seeing the extent of his masterful abilities re registering accounts and posting shit he has a lot of time to waste on weekends and non school hours eastern us and well youve seen yourself how easy it is to register new accounts on the forum good luck with this one.
i have the codebase and the database for utopia in hours im going to destroy it sold or not because fuck you this isnt a tv show and i dont keep trophies im willing to sell under escrow because im not a scammer btc you will receive a onion address with a directory that contains a tar gz of both the database i copied when shutting down their registration has most of the users with the passwords already cracked i will also give you the entire shitty cakephp codebase edit fuck you guys for censoring my sale isnt that ironic that you support dark net markets but wont let me sale whatever i want.
id like a copy of the db not so much the codebase but i certainly cant afford btc because im not going to use it to hack anyone or steal their balances on other markets or anything like that i just want it for future analysis and research i can maybe afford btc assuming im not an asshole you can find my key email at.
ok legitimate question here if this guy has so many bitcoins i dont have a job and can afford to fuck with you why doesnt he just give the code base away.
selling is not permitted on the forum please respect community rules.
evolution is a pretty website with bad programming i already have hacked their servers and know their ip address im toying their administrators to see if they want to actually fix it or be too greedy to admit they dont know shit about opsec i would sell my pen testing services depending on the market to be frank most of these markets admins are total assholes when you confront them with the fact that they are out of their league they have this image of themselves that when shattered makes them incredibly defensive.
youve considered building a marketplace.

lonewolf on february amwhat was wrong with astors security advice let me think told people that it was safe to sign up to atlantis through phishing proxy and then people got phished after that called the phishing proxy very sophisticated when it was the simplest type of proxy out there discouraged automatic universal pgp for black market websites that means if a buyer didnt send by pgp the website would convert the message or address to pgp to the vendor and only the encrypted messages or address would remain on the server gave the wrong advice regarding tor ip leaks told people not to use a proxy in conjunction with tor the only thing that can protect against an ip leak and many more things that i cant even remember anyway this guy is the one running sr look how that turned out.

what was wrong with astors security advice.
yeah i want to know about cirrus to cirrus is somehow the only person with some credibility left threw his long track record with sr and he is yet to be heard from probably he is one of the other moderators hux is definately dpr and stexo judged from writing style the admins pulled an heist it is simple as that.
as the church lady would say how pquote from brassballs on february pmwhyusheep defconbingo give that man a ciga.
mycarneedstint on february amdpr and or staff stole our coin geesh read up no bugs not a btc bug known since simple theft.
can you please get the fuck out nobody wants to sign up with your fucking invite code it doesnt benefit anybody you obviously are only posting for your own personal profit which is why they banned you you seem mad that you were trying to push invites but sr staff stopped you gtf.
hahahaha im sorry guys but hahahahahaha if you were a buyer and lost money on silk road its your own fault and youre a fucking idiot sorry but its true sr has been fishy as fuck from the start the people i feel sorry for are the vendors some of them had in escrow and thats exactly how the sr staff wanted it more to steal when they hit the switch does anyone actually believe that a system as easy to implement such as auto finalize was taking this long they did it to help keep money in the site and prevent vendors from withdrawing everyday now theyre spitting in your faces talking about being hacked theyre probably only lying so they can keep taking the commission once theyre back up and running sites like these are big business they might even be planning to sell it once they get the multi sig escrow system implemented and people have proven time and again theyll keep using a site like this after being ripped off all it takes is some bullshit forum post from the admin one things for sure they just ripped you off and now theyre laughing in your face.
a vpn is pretty worthless for i p the idea is that your ip is not a secret its just that nobody knows what ip belongs to what router you try to analyse whats goin on and you just see this big ball of i p traffic where everybody is talking to everybody else a vps however is super useful for i p because you can leave it running i p nodes with very high uptimes dont suffer nearly as much from eepsite timeout errors plus if your node is routing and the vast majority of the traffic it routes is not generated by you it becomes much harder to know when you are online.
i think its a prommesing market looks good feels good in a buyers perspective i just look and when the right vendors on there i load up btc s i think it has a good change f.
hello am i allowed to be a vendor on evolutioni think you should unban me from tcf regard.
we have removed the requirement for version info on pgp keys and replaced the captcha with something a bit more user friendly.
hi eiley when i went to that link i couldnt see anything because it said it was password protected.
ed please climb down from atop your horse and watch closely like a good journalist the fatuous whining is beneath you while i agree that the sr team was likely involved in the caper the incendiary insults directed at the community are uncalled for you make your living by leeching off the story and drama being written here dont take it for granted.
gentlemen it is a distinct possibilty that the sr forums have been compromised by law enforcement or some other group since at least the time of the arrests in december screenshots copies of text documents correspondence and statements from other knowledgeable users tend to lend credibility to this notion if this is true then almost certainly the sr operation in its entirety is being monitored and or controlled in some capacity and probably has been for some time according to my sources one or more of the admins mods is either le or is cooperating with authorities cirrus was named these same allegations were made by others in december during act i when incriminating photos were printed on the forums only to be deleted staff denied this then and im sure that they will continue to do so now whether or not the above mentioned theory is true remains to be seen if le is involved im not sure yet how this all fits together however something tells me that this is going to be a good one but fuck all that for now well worry about act after i fill in those of you who drifted off to sleep or went to the can during act ii silk road was not hacked it was looted by its captain a loathesome annoying moniker if ive ever heard one along with a couple of his buddies together they more closely resemble an amateur theater troupe than a gang of pirates in december myself and others watched as they staged a shameful scripted performance in the forums all for the benefit of the droves of newcomers who watched from their seats they clapped furiously at the end and then they rose from their chairs and gave a standing ovation as dpr defcon hux etc strolled out for his curtain call that was when he picked up the stage prop er i mean your sack of bitcoins which incidentally had been stowed in the trunk of his car the entire time and looked out at all of your smiling faces before bowing deeply and blowing a few kisses while you were out on the town taking in all of that culture the rest of us were shaking our heads and going about our business we were keeping our fingers crossed that what seemed almost certain to happen wouldnt but we were also exchanging messages and pining for simpler times and silently betting on whether it would be a swat team or an angry mob of dope sick torch wielding townspeople who showed up first and how soon would they arrive the sr forums are useless now even more so than in december back then they deleted hundreds of posts threads citing security as the reason theyre doing it again the only entries that youll see are by the actors themselves and the noobs whose simple natures and naivete makes shenanigans such as these possible in the first place and finally a handful of members masquerading as dozens more with hoards of disguises and countless aliases at their disposal at times they even carry on conversations with themselves inside of a thread when i see it happening it reminds me of a child putting on a puppet show and compelling one hand to talk to the other the forums are like a fucking daycare for noobs while simultaneously functioning as a kind of giant playground for the adults who take the opportunity to trade inside jokes and troll one another and the real communication what very little there is can be read between the lines no one ever says much and when they do subtle codes are employed consider these quotes as just a few examples  meerkovo on february pmoracle quick question accroding to defcon all wallets were affected so as sr as a business has cash assets just wondering if i should kiss my coins goodbye and wish the person who might spend them to choke on their daily bread better yet i hope they buy a motorbike meerkovoquote from lashesxo on february pmtheres only a few people in power to remove an account wonder who that might be the mods are good people so that leaves who oracle you kill me kid  oracle on february amquote from randomuser on february amquote from oracle on february amgood question i deleted the old key when i thought i would never be returning to this place again email account i forgot the pw for i tried a few times and then gave up months does make ones mind rusty but luckily this account was still active fair enough happens to the best of us with burners and char passwords im looking forward to reading what you have to say i wish you had responded to what i said before the email and pgp question though sometimes silence speaks volumes has defcon been in contact with with dpr lately hey oracle whereve you been seriously oracle is just a fucking nym that redacted and redacted oh and redacted trot out for these special occasions nothing is what it seems folks the communitys core the dark market communitys core is a lot smaller than you think youll see just remember that while youre a totally anonymous stranger who lives in ohio and thought that this silk road thing sounded like fun the people who conceived of all of this who built it and have been here from the start well theyre all well acquainted some are allies while others share bitter rivalries jesus christ think about it research it its a secret wink wink yeah and so is the grand finale ill be publishing an obituary for this goddamned zoo in the near future and then im going back to writing about politics im not directly tied up in any of this im an author for crying out loud therefore ive lost nothing to the various dark markets nor have i profited from them instead ive sat here and ive watched and lve come to wish that others would take the time to do so as well technically speaking i really am a journalist albeit a shitty inefficient one and im fed up with the bullshit which theyve taken just too goddamned far this time you ever hear of quitting while youre ahead i cant sit here and watch while you guys bamboozle these poor bastards out of their money especially when they dont doubt you for a second even as you point down the street and cry it was the one armed man he went that way posts like these have been written before hell i watched a couple get deleted just this morning and then another unsuspecting victim strolls through the door and whips out his social security card and his drivers license all eager to get in on the action where do i sign up he says come on people and if this gets deleted in the hub well well know where their loyalties are its time to weed out the thieves and liars and trolls so we might as well start here i cant say with any certainty whether or not the silk road sub reddit is trustworthy either but once i have more information i will pass it along and in the meantime deepdotweb is probably your best source for accurate timely news regarding the markets as i believe in his integrity incidentally he has nothing to do with this posting nor was he aware of it prior to its publication despite everything i remain opposed to prohibition while supporting online trading i believe that the majority of folks who frequent these markets are decent good natured citizens but if you fuckers want to keep the criminals at bay youre going to have to start a neighborhood watch or something ill see about having t shirts made disgustedly e.
it was all a co.
nice write up and hence youre most certainly not an inefficient or shitty journalist as you present yourself to be the stage now set just right for a dpr to come sailing along the high winds.
su.
this is the likely explanation imo it looks to me like when sr was taken down some of the guys in the background that never really got to take part decided to use it to their advantage sr was mostly filled with lots of big speeches and large things happening in the background but beyond the words of a few people what did we really get to see most of their development announcements were about security features and hardening etc etc but we never really got to see any of it the things that we got to see were fixes and feature development that any site in development would have and of course the big features that were really needed kept getting delayed and i no longer buy the cold storage thing for a second there is no way to prove any of it actually happened beyond them freezing some coin for a while such an easy thing to stage and it gained them a lot of trust for doing basically nothing a perfect way to gain a lot of traction for their con i was lucky this time ive never kept coin stored on markets beyond pocket change but because of bad timing i did lose a fair amount on sm it could have happened here too my last deposit was only weeks ago i hope this is the final nail in the coffin for centralized marketplaces i know i wont ever use one again weve let these people burn us time after time its time to learn from our mistakes and stop this shit i dont know really anything about who is who and who did what and all that so i hope what youre working on will be a good and informative read you seem like a good man ed from sl.
this was very well played and orchestrated and as much as it pains me to say it you have to say they got everyone pretty well its makes me realize i should have gone into coding a long long time ago lo.
gwern on february pmapparently site owner took it down due to lack of interest he took it down because he didnt earn in a day.

what fucking going on with all black markets sr has been hacked i dont believe that bullshit cant register in agora because a problem utopia fallen down maybe can this the begin of the end i dont wanna believe in that but all this subject is very strange only we can still waiting preferent for sr but later of they has been hacked i cant believe this yet.

shortly after i posted btc moved it was actually shortly after a couple of btc exchanges opened up your ganja looks mouth watering by the way.
brassballs on february amquote from jules winnfield on february ami remember reading somewhere that astor was actually le or the infamous sabu and dont forget pineyes pine was was also against universal automated pgp if everything was in pgp through automation then the authorities would have nothing if they grabbed the server pine was against this pine did advise people to do manual pgp the problem is that the majority did not use pgp and pine knew it.

tyrone on february amquote from on february amscout pine astor nope pine and astor are definitely different people scout was fired by dpr i always thought scout and pine were the same person.
scout pine astor.
stexo was definitely dpr way back in the begining dpr made a pgp signed message except he mistakenly signed it with stexos key just a minor slip up also not too long ago hux made a post and signed it with dprs key another minor slip up of course he then came on and made an excuse saying that some of the mods had access to dprs forum profile for posting updates true who knows you decide.
there are plenty of people with plenty of opinions but opinions are kind of personal and every person has one i like to think that there is a reason we have two eyes and ears but only one mouth.
doctorclu on february amwe know what happened we are not clueless it was a hack so whats next just suck it up and move on to the next market i thats what we all really wanna hear isnt it.
doctorclu on february amwe know what happened we are not clueless it was a hack sorry doc you lost all credibility in that humbled and disgusted thread where you try to blame the hack on mt gox transaction malleability claiming it allowed every single bitcoin held by all customers vendors in or out of escrow see the now deleted thread that ridiculous theory so that the many of us who actually understand bitcoin and the transaction malleability issue can see if it even passes the smell test you cant it wasnt a bitcoin hack it was the admin pulling a disappearing act when the market was at its most profitable if you were not in on the theft and yet still defend them you are a gullible fool.
doctorclu on february amwe know what happened we are not clueless it was a hack would you be so kind to tell us a little bit more on the matte.
we know what happened we are not clueless it was a hack.
youre a fucking piece of shit doctorclu.
if it does turn out that the admin are responsible then someone needs to get word to ross or his lawyer tell him to roll on those piece of shits and get a better deal for himself and in the process we will all find out their true identities then we will be able to go get to them.
me gtfo im here to promote safe use practices as evident by my safe iv thread here to review vendors product and to generally hang out no need to get nasty and you cant sign up to agora without an invite so its a mutual benefit thing it see a few dollars here and there from referrals nothing big just thought id help out anyone over on sr while they were down they obviously arent half as competition friendly as they profess to be over there and look around this aint sr board friendo.
vince on february pmcan you please get the fuck out nobody wants to sign up with your fucking invite code it doesnt benefit anybody you obviously are only posting for your own personal profit which is why they banned you you seem mad that you were trying to push invites but sr staff stopped you gtfolol nice first post.
my apologies i was just uneasy not knowing if i lost out like others did or whether you managed to get it out in time but i am glad and no worries i wont double post again excuse me for that.
godspeed to him.
ozfreelancer on february pmssbd has been sitting in jail since december hes back in court next wednesday see my thoughts on it here oz you coverage is worth reading as always.
just a word to add should any tba user need to report a bug or an account related issue or need any sort of support pls report them at the official forum for faster resolution you may double post them here but having it posted on the forum helps it stay documented and helps other users in the process links to the support forum is in the official sticky post and on the home page of the bazaar thanks.
ok ill just steal his account the.
cooked on february amthe user cooked signed up and somehow used my pgp key its not a problem on my side i think he bypassed your security measures or is free to create an account with us there is no such security measure for creating a user account pgp encryption as mentioned above is the central part to your bazaar account now if the user cooked on tba is not the owner of the private key from the corresponding pub key uploaded to the account then he simply cannot login as since he will not be able to decrypt the two factor login challenge that most likely has been the case since the account owner has not been logged back on since the time it was first created if it was con scammer he probably did not reslise how the login worked now if you are the owner of the private key for that pub key you have nothing to worry about as all inactive accounts are auto deleted in days from the system.
cooked on february amok ill just steal his account thenyou could try thats if you know the password to get to the tfa bit later.
albert is quick to help out sunwu its good to see a vendor of such high caliber like you show up have a chit chat w albert you will be able to see that he and his team are legit.
i dont doubt they are honest good guys this is why i had looked to them but with bugs like this it worries me there are others and we only look to be at the most secure market so we dont have to go through this again everytime a market fail we lose s and sometimes s thousands of this is not something i wish to repeat time and time again.
i know what you mean i have said this before and ill say it again for all here the hub to read sunwu you have been an inspiration to me as a vendor since i st saw youre contest threads on sr forum the gratitude that buyers abroad expressed for your services actually brought a tear to my eyes specially when it was genuine people talking about genuine problems they face irl you being there for them and being the awesome vendor that you are really made me re consider what it is were all doing on earth and in the dark net the universe will not let le ever catch you for you service the universe in far greater ways than le and their evil manipulative war tactics respect.
sunwu on february amso i have been having pgp bug with tba since i signed up some weeks ago we put in the right key but the admins encryption is not correct now the admin account is deleted and no way to contact them shame it looked good but the team seems too small and market premature i dont think we will join market owners need to take note releasing premature market only damages it in the long run stop trying to race it out there i am a new seller on the dnm i dont have the experience most have i have my listings or tied to list on almost a dozen sites most have been problematic most have no one to contact with issues so far tba albert and blackbank mdparity are the main ones where i can get issues resolved almost instantly torescrow was also a good one this counts for a lot support is slow or non existent on other sites at least for me so i would certainly give these a go as in future there will always be something that comes up to be resolve.
sunwu on february ami dont doubt they are honest good guys this is why i had looked to them but with bugs like this it worries me there are others and we only look to be at the most secure market so we dont have to go through this again everytime a market fail we lose s and sometimes s thousands of this is not something i wish to repeat time and time again well ill be honest with you im not the coder of the market i am just a simple forum mod albert is the one who coded the market if you have any questions about bugs you can ask him on our forums the bugs we have had so far have been corrected within an hour of albert being aware of them albert is currently working on multi sig transactions i dont know a whole lot about it but i believe it protects the users coins against hacking or sezures this is not implimented yet but it is the priority at the moment and will be implimented soon we already have cold storage of coins and all withdraws are processed manually which prevents theft via hacking the market has a whole lot of security features i would also like to note that albert has been hosting onion sites for vendors for a few years and has expirience keeping servers secure hes not a newbie on the scene if you would like to learn more about tba please come to the forums when albert has a minute of free time im sure he would be more than happy to address any of your concerns.
thank you so much jules i knew the customer gives a lot of love but i did not know vendors too we are always here for people because it makes us happy in what we do and we know it is the best way for success i have said before things will get worse before getting better and i am feeling so positive about the future s.
there are a few bugs but nothing albert cant help you with you could pm him on our forums and he could definetly sort you out.
ive been over there for a while and have had nothing but positive experiences alice the administrator does not make many appearances on the forums as he is usually handling tickets proving support on the actual marketplace if not that hes working on site upgrades updates for example he wont show up on the forum for a while but then he posts a big update pandora support is handled mostly on the actual market as opposed to the forum there are support staff who appear on the forum much more often they have direct contact with the admin alice so they can pass on anything that requires admin intervention since he rarely has the time to visit the forums this is at least the way it seems to have been since i joined alices forum account isnt active for a few days and everyone screams scam arrest but then it turns out he was just working on the market relying on the support staff to monitor and forward any necessary information from the forums this literally happens every weeks so please stop creating these where is alice topics just because he doesnt visit the forums for a few days it actually specifically says in his forum profile not to pm him because he does not check his forum pms you must contact him via vendorsupport if youre a vendor or the appropriate support eu us ect both on the actual marketplace not the forum no im not affiliated with the website or being paid to say any of this its just that i started using pandora near its beginning both because my main vendor was here and because of all the drama unfolding on tormarket and sr while i continue to hear all sorts of sketchy shit coming from those markets ive been placing orders for months on pandora by now and have not run into a single problem.
darts on february amive been placing orders for months on pandora by now and have not run into a single problem supe.
on february pmwhat fucking going on with all black markets sr has been hacked i dont believe that bullshit cant register in agora because a problem utopia fallen down maybe can this the begin of the end i dont wanna believe in that but all this subject is very strange only we can still waiting preferent for sr but later of they has been hacked i cant believe this yet not the end friend its just a new beginnin.
nevermind on february amnot the end friend its just a new beginningpeace lov.
what went wrong history repeats anyone recall what went wrong with carders market.
if someone agrees to this you would have to be incredibly naive and ignorant this database has zero relevance it has a lot of information from the bmrv userbase but guess what its gone too this is just a ploy in order to try to get money for something a bit too late should have sold this before utopia was taken down by the dutch feds.
one more great option and i read this and i only can say awesome its perfect that you recieved the btc in the generate adress in less hour even minutes by what i see i like sr really and i readed the new release of defcon and seems be fine at the moment with that plan but if i dont wrong because the first release since sr closes he said that escrows not be trusted and they need another method with multi sig i dont know how works that i hope that in their moment they put a tutorial or something in the home page he said too that the new system of multi sig ill be ready in or months that mean if i stay in the certain i believe yes we cant place orders until then and i dont want wait so much time until then while i can register in more markets trusted and still recieve the orders that i placed and too i look for new markets new alternatives read about that and to test the markets for myself but certainly we need more options not only sr or sr they says anyone market that have escrow isnt trusted i dont believe that i think that is only a common method to dont lose customers i believe that i have the reason on this thought so much people continues make and recieve the placed orders in another markets since sr fell down and i think with almost total security that before of that too i was viewing this site minutes ago one person gave me the info of the existence of this market and the url and with good feedbacks i see in and out of the site with agora are my favourites elections for the moment without sr of course that was my main choice this market has got good prices too in so many things in comparation with sr in others not too of course but this give me good feelings like agora too these markets must be grow increasingly and we can do that possible and whatever still using sr when be possible place orders at same time remember monopolies have never been good we need make grow up these and more markets trusted we can do it and much more things in our hands we got the water the seeds are in the earth and we can makes possible that these markets grow more markets of confidence these are good news guys really good news and personally like i said i dont trust nothing the part when defcon said anyone market that have escrow isnt trusted yes sure good vibes people.
its possible that a hack or some other type of robbery did happen but it happened a while ago i have suspected for some time that sr didnt have all the bitcoins that were supposedly in peoples wallets and were using these bugs to borrow money from vendors when deposits were not enough to fund the withdrawls now that people are losing faith and leaving the site deposits are much less than withdrawls and vendors are requiring customers to finalize early so they cant borrow the money anymore just an idea.
on february pmyoure a fucking piece of shit doctorclu this the neck of dr clu if it was a hack who hacked it not any outside vendor thats for sure how can you have the balls to come on with that account fuck you dr cl.
from what i have read and know of the problem with btc it couldt have been the reason that all the btc was taken i didnt expect to see defcon or any mods post anything again but after reading threw the forums its no wonder theyre back users were still depositing coin after the hack and are over their now ready to throw more coin away no wonder they came back its unbelievable the amount of idiots there the only other thing i can think of is they have a heap of accounts to spread propagand.
mycarneedstint on february amdpr and or staff stole our coin geesh read up no bugs not a btc bug known since simple theft.
on february amsince my earlier post the grand wizard has seen evidence on the sr forums that doctorclu is working to fix the vendor bond issue he appears to have helped several new vendors at least i congratulate him on his efforts and acknowledge his sincerity and his ethics a lot remains to be done but heres credit where credit is due i hope the doctor can keep up the good work and am cautiously optimistic that the road will weather these storms my disagreement may be blunt but my praise is sincere the grand wizard wont piss on your leg but i wont blow sunshine up your ass either im not into that sort of thing nothing against those who are of course thank you for your hard work well played well played.
nick cotton on february pmif it does turn out that the admin are responsible then someone needs to get word to ross or his lawyer tell him to roll on those piece of shits and get a better deal for himself and in the process we will all find out their true identities then we will be able to go get to them time will tell nick hopefully the culprit or culprits will be found amai.
shouldnt be a problem getting the govt to allow him to achieve justice for the reincarnation of the very thing hes behind iron for.
owockeznan on february ama vps however is super useful for i p because you can leave it running i p nodes with very high uptimes dont suffer nearly as much from eepsite timeout errors plus if your node is routing and the vast majority of the traffic it routes is not generated by you it becomes much harder to know when you are online a vps is definitely a good way to go for performance but i really hate the level of visibility the vps provider ends up with and dedicated server is overkill do you know of a way to pin a local i p router instance in hidden mode to specific i p router so your local i p router always uses your vps is always as first hop your local ip isnt advertised and the vps is blind to the content of your traffic since its just relaying i p traffic that seems like pretty much a perfect world from an i p perspective you get the bandwidth of a high bandwidth i p router but dont have to let the vps see the traffic before its encrypted for i p transport obviously there are a million ways to get traffic to a vps i p router ssh tunnel vpn etc but what would be much better is a way to keep the vps instance blind to the content even if the vps admin decides to start stracing processes that would mean that a dirt cheap openvz vps would be a perfectly great way to connect to i p.
hi at last a service that does not advertize stolen credit cards and other nasty stuff just drugs can someone sort me an invite cheer.
making an account for this board and asking for invites on the very first post could potentially dissuade people from offering one may want to mingle a bit and make some friend.
evolution is a very smooth marketplace the sales are still very slow but drugs are kind of a side market for this particular bazaar the vendor backend is very feature rich and functional though i just wish they had vacation mode like so many other markets do.
i think s he means vacation mode when a vendor wants to take a break from sales they can set in a time frame when their sales listings will cut off so that buyers dont load up escrow with coin and wonder why the vendor never shipped or contacted them.
it sure does look good thanks for pointing it out im awaiting vender approval now.
lexdysic on february ami think s he means vacation mode when a vendor wants to take a break from sales they can set in a time frame when their sales listings will cut off so that buyers dont load up escrow with coin and wonder why the vendor never shipped or contacted them  rc every ne on february pmyes this is bascially that for example on agora bsm and sr you can enable vacation mode with a single click and it will automatically hide all of your listings for vendors with lots of listings this is a significant time saver rather than going in and disabling listings one at a time then when your ready to get back to work you simply click disable vacation mode and all of your listings become visible again thanks for the suggestion well look into getting something like this set up in the near future.
verto on february amcan you explain what you mean by vacation mode  on february amit sure does look good thanks for pointing it out im awaiting vender approval now yes this is bascially that for example on agora bsm and sr you can enable vacation mode with a single click and it will automatically hide all of your listings for vendors with lots of listings this is a significant time saver rather than going in and disabling listings one at a time then when your ready to get back to work you simply click disable vacation mode and all of your listings become visible again.
very nice and fast hopefully will turn out wel.
cooked on february amhello am i allowed to be a vendor on evolutioni think you should unban me from tcf regardsyou wont be getting unbanned from tcf you had plenty enough warnings you can join on evolution seeing you werent actually banned on tcf for scamming but given your previous record on all other boards i wont be surprised if you end up getting banned there also.
verto on february amwe have made a few changes to registration based on feedback so hopefully its now a bit more user friendly i just signed up and it went fairly easy would be more helpful if it said that the pin has to be ain all numbers even if you use letters the error message doesnt say to use numbers so i just guessed and finally got in im setting up another store there now.
the plot thickens.
brings back so many great memories bmr was a wonderful i only joined there after sr was siezed but it was a great market and i loved how it was run layout was messy but it always worked perfectly backopy was great and i dont think you could have asked for anyone better to run a black market the original dpr was also great in my opinion as it seemed he genuinly believed in the movement and i think he was a honourable man unlike many of the learders now who are very much in for the money which is sad but i guess quite predictable.
lol the signiture says life goes on no matter what happens duno why but it gave me a good chuckle gusse when we die some thing happens right lo.
i made history there first official purchase on black flag bought a guide to getting nitrous tanks.
by now everyone should be aware tba is referral only here is my referral lin.
the following accounts have received coins to their bazaar accounts for referrals in the past couple of days user nevermind x btcvendor thedoctor btcuser mrsmith missjones btcstaff evilgrin btc not credited pending pls check your bazaar accounts to confirm also there are vendor registration fees pending so am sure when if these vendors complete their signup process many more bonus coins will be passed out i wouldnt be updating this list this is only meant to share the good news bonuses show up in your bitcoin panel in the bazaar account as referral bonus now go people make the make off it.
been trying to sign up for days but keep getting reg failed help.
on february pmbeen trying to sign up for days but keep getting reg failed help same thing here i tried to register about a month ago and my registration still shows as failed i havent been able to log in once if it has bugs that keep registered people from logging in i dont think the rest of the site could be very promising not trying to hate on pirate just sharing that ive had a common experience i hope for their sake they get it sorted out.
this article answers some of your questions.
it here.
i asked if i could sell someones information because i just so happened to be the only one with a high value tarkets info frim who isnt exactly a high value target but you probably get what i mean there has also been some speculation about that being the person the admins were hiring an assassin for in which case i was a fool not pming an admin and selling it to them directly anyhow i find the admins choice to condone this action very unprofessional and dangerous despite the fact i was rooting for a yes at the time.

sorrymario on february pmif you were not in on the theft and yet still defend them you are a gullible fool interesting  s lkyw y on february the fact is that they can pop up anywhere anytime under a different name and identity and we probably wouldnt know a thing about it.
its incredibly frustrating to read here and on the clearnet that sr was hacked it wasnt the theft was an inside job no bugs as far as a cashout feature is concerned no btc mal problem as first told to us some mysterious frenchy didnt break in it was a greedy admin stealing maybe the admin defcon is french and he was projecting idk the myth will go on lies will be believed and yet again more btc will be stolen its a damn shame i will never use that site again and will steer others away as well for the ones who still believe dr clu defcon and the rest of the con artists i do feel sorry for you.
bstring on february pmclu stop saying this shit is yours none of this is yours you did not make any of it  mycarneedstint on february amdefcon definetly a con jo.
ratting to the cops is never acceptible they are the lowest form of scum.
hi anything you needany options for mac i cant run tails inside vmware fusion and ubuntu gives me a lot of errors in virtual box.
haha that is quality stuf.
all these extraditian treaties are bullshit a country should protect its own citizens as usual these piss weak career politicians roll over to any demands from the us howard gillard rudd abbot are all the same traitors to the australian people.
i remember when people kept trying to decide if ssbd was a girl or not one more casualty either way thank you ozfreelancer for being our battlefield journalist.
reading it again now its sad whats happening to our courts and the nonsense well hand over a citizen for remember this tempted to barge into the court with a bunch of tractor paper and computer file on some old laptop and say a travesty of justice is about to occur here i am ssbd and i can prove it then wave the tractor paper around spout a bunch of technobabble about deep packet inspection hand over the computer and see what they all do.
unsure why the article is password protected but i have it from rss and im going to go right ahead and repost it here without the authors permission given this is an onion router hidden site and all cant wait for that book i honestly dont think youre going to hear from enterthematrix scales of injustice silk road s ssbdby all things vicessbd had no role to play in the silk road marketplace where drugs were bought and sold he was a moderator of the silk road discussion forum which had its own url and was hosted on a different server to the marketplace so why is the us so determined to extradite someone who may or may not be him peter philip nash has been sitting in a brisbane jail cell since december he is facing extradition to the united states to face allegations of narcotics conspiracy maximum sentence of life in prison and a mandatory minimum sentence of years conspiracy to commit computer hacking maximum years and money laundering conspiracy which carries a maximum sentence of years in prison scales of to the us indictment nash was known online as better known to silk road members as ssbd ssbd was a well loved moderator of the now defunct silk road discussion forums new forums colloquially known as sr have replaced the old his job was to answer questions explain the rules move posts to their proper forum with over a million posts many were bound to wind up in the wrong place and generally attend to banal administrative tasks in any event nash may or may not be ssbd but even if he is what exactly was ssbd s crime all i have to go on is the indictment i don t know what other information the authorities have but if all they have is what is in the indictment it would be a travesty if australia was to agree to deport him ssbd had no role to play in the silk road marketplace where drugs were bought and sold he was a moderator of the silk road discussion forum which had its own url and was hosted on a different server to the marketplace his job was confined to that site two others who were arrested concurrently andrew jones aka inigo and gary davis libertas were immediately released on bail under the laws of the usa and ireland respectively according to the indictment inigo and libertas did have roles on the marketplace as well as the forums the indictment differentiates the two where it says inigo worked as a site administrator on silk road libertas worked as a site administrator on silk road worked as the primary moderator on the silk road discussion forums my emphasis nash was not granted bail because under the australian extradition act a magistrate or eligible federal circuit court judge shall not remand a person on bail under this section unless there are special circumstances justifying such remand it seems nash could not fulfil the special circumstances requirement next wednesday nash is due back in court for a magistrate to determine whether he is eligible for surrender to the us if so nash will be remanded in custody until the next phase of the proceedings surrender or review or he can consent to extradition under s of the act he will be eligible for surrender to us authorities if the magistrate is satisfied a the supporting documents in relation to the offence have been produced to the magistrate or judge b any additional requirements imposed by the us australia extradition treaty are satisfied c the conduct would have constituted an extradition offence if it had occurred in australia and d there are no substantial grounds for believing that there is an extradition objection in relation to the offencenow a disclaimer although i was a lawyer in my deep dark past i have zero experience with either crime or extradition law so i don t know any more than anyone else these are simply my uninformed opinions after looking at the act and extradition treaty and knowing from two years of investigating silk road what ssbd s role consisted of b any additional requirements imposed by the us australia extradition treaty are vi of the treaty says extradition shall be granted only if the evidence is found sufficient according to the laws in the territory where the person whose extradition is requested is found either to justify his trial or committal for trial if the offence with which he is charged or its equivalent had been committed in that territory like i said i don t know what evidence they have so i can only go on the indictment it seems to me evidence is pretty lacking in that document first i have no idea what evidence the us authorities have that nash is ssbd they may have found some correspondence on the silk road servers between he and the site s owner dread pirate roberts or perhaps ross ulbricht the man accused of being dread pirate roberts provided his details in an attempt at a plea bargain ulbricht it should be noted has denied being dpr and has denied all charges so this seems unlikely the indictment claims ssbd was paid around per year this presumably was paid in bitcoin it is possible though again unlikely that the bitcoin trail was followed to nash s bank account most likely the evidence is an email from an anonymous email account or a message through an anonymous private claiming that ssbd s real name is peter nash not too compelling this requirement for evidence is also relevant to the next two stipulations c the conduct would have constituted an extradition offence if it had occurred in australiathe wording says conduct not crimes of which the person is accused the only conduct i could find attributed to ssbd in the indictment was in relation to the narcotics charge sent a message to dread pirate roberts owner of silk road summarising the actions he had taken during the previous week in his capacity as the primary forum moderator on the silk road discussion forums i doubt that sending a message from one anonymous online account to another anonymous online account constitutes an extradition offence the narcotics charge is the only charge to have any overt acts which sounds similar to conduct to me listed underneath the charges attributable to ssbd in relation to the hacking charge intentionally accessed computers without authorisation for commercial advantage and private financial gain and in furtherance of criminal and tortious acts no overt acts were listed under this charge the above was a general accusation aimed at all three defendants this does not sound like it could be considered conduct of the person constituting the offence which is what the act requires i would be interested to see what evidence they have that ssbd accessed computers without authorisation there would certainly be no need to do so in order to carry out his functions of moderating a discussion forum he would have carried out his duties on his own computer logging in to the silk road administration panel at least the small part he had access to completely authorised to do so in relation to the money laundering charge conduct and attempt to conduct such financial transactions which in fact involved the proceeds of specified unlawful activity to wit narcotics trafficking and computer hacking no overt acts were listed under this charge the above was a general accusation aimed at all three defendants this does not sound like it could be considered conduct of the person constituting the offence which is what the act requires again i would be interested to see what evidence they have that ssbd conducted or attempted to conduct illegal financial transactions especially as conducting any transactions whatsoever was explicitly banned on the silk road forums the only site ssbd had access to in any sort of administrative capacity not surprisingly dread pirate roberts wanted to keep all financial transactions on the marketplace where he received a commission for each one d there are no substantial grounds for believing that there is an extradition objection in relation to the offence extradition objections s include b the surrender of the person in so far as it purports to be sought for the extradition offence is actually sought for the purpose of prosecuting or punishing the person on account of his or her race sex sexual orientation religion nationality or political opinions or c on surrender to the extradition country in respect of the extradition offence the person may be prejudiced at his or her trial or punished detained or restricted in his or her personal liberty by reason of his or her race sex sexual orientation religion nationality or political opinions my emphasis this probably isn t much of a legal argument but in the real world this whole extradition attempt smacks of politics it s all show so that politicians can trumpet a win on their long doomed war on drugs spending this sort of taxpayers money to extradite a man who may or may not have been paid a paltry k a year to perform mundane administration tasks on what was purely a website for discussions there is no suggestion that nash sold drugs himself hell there s not even a suggestion that he bought drugs just these trumped up charges so conservatives can parade him in front of the media claiming they ve brought down some sort of evil drug cartel according to the attorney general s department annual reports most extradition requests are to return ex pats not australian citizens they tend to be for fugitives that have escaped with hundreds of millions of fraudulently obtained funds or child sex predators of the most heinous kind the united states requests extradition of two to four people from australia a year should peter nash really be one of the.
amazing how your attitude toward me changes once my market takes a hit you couldnt stay online for a week without getting taken down yet you espouse your security expertise like an invalid limp dicked version of astor read my post with your big boy glasses and show me where i said i understood transaction malleability show me where i claimed technical expertise i rebuked a journalist for painting my whole community and team with a single brush i was insulted and i said so you sir are a prick i offered you a home on our forums and immediately put a stop to all the shit our users were talking about utopia the day you were seized we exchanged pms and you were oh so thankful amazing how you react to me when i take a hit karma not the forum kind either is going to get to you one of these days stealt.
hey ed there are some honest people on that silk road team in fact my wajor would be that the majority of them are if it is just now dawning on you that law enforcement monitors the messageboards then you are clearly not cut out for executing the human thought process i respected you until you just blanket fucked the entire community and staff and i take offense especially after i have just given every coin i had to those who lost out go back to writing on that site of yours that nobody reads while the rest of us move on with our lives if you took that in stride then pm me i would like to speak with you one on one disturbed stealt.
fiddlestix on february pmthe incendiary insults directed at the community are uncalled forquote from on february pmits makes me realize i should have gone into coding a long long time ago lolquote from albert on february pmthe stage now set just right for a dpr to come sailing along the high winds  honeyray on february pmmaybe even analysing decentralised option.
stealth on february pminvalid limp dicked version of astor xdare those rumors about you being astor true quoteshow me where i said i understood transaction malleability show me where i claimed technical expertise anyone can read your pronouncement in its sha bit signed glory where you spew this howler our initial investigations indicate that a vendor exploited a recently discovered vulnerability in the bitcoin protocol known as transaction malleability to repeatedly withdraw coins from our system until it was completely empty despite our hardening and pentesting procedures this attack vector was outside of penetration testing scope due to being rooted in the bitcoin protocol itself so were you just talking out of your ass then or are you lying now when you say you dont know nothing about no transaction malleability quoteyou sir are a prick name calling oh my my my someone has his feathers ruffled enjoy fleecing the remaining rubes a second third time anyone who cant see through your scam now is hopelessly blind.
thats why i love the hub this place gives us a platform to openly discuss what is going on without being influenced by the market in question this place can help us all from losing money and other things.
link in sigi want easy money too.
evilgrin on february ami want easy money too hehe.
i would also like to say thank you to the hub for giving us a subforum and for starting the hub in the first place when it was first introduced i didnt really know if i liked the idea but now i see it is a very useful tool to keep in contact with people between markets especially when a market goes down.
nevermind on february amnice to see tba having a subforum on the hub very nice market active support and a awesome refferal action hope more will join soon thi.
pandora is smooth indeed i must say using the site since october.
is anyone else getting this http error on pandora every time i tryn log in boom error seriously frustrating.
yes but they not help you proamfetamin.
dude its sad but honestly this is the best way it couldve happened their opsec was not even close to par it wouldve been worse fallout as time went on more lesson.
welcome to the hub dee.
agreed all valid points the hub should make a stick thread warning about sr.
i have opened the discussion of this policy up to everyone on the hub in its own separate thread please contribute here.
alfred on february pmalso anything other than the official story as confirmed by defcon is just speculation and we will not condemn an established marketplace like sr based on speculation the problem is what is becoming known as the official story is completely implausible i swear its like listening to obama or bush spew their bullshit on wars or spying the whole thing is oozing with disnifo misinfo misdirection and pure unadulterated crap that will only work on those who are ignorant about bitcoin and want to believe i can appreciate the hubs desire to appear impartial but remember silk road is not an established market it is a market that took on the name and look of a previously established market which unfortunately got pwned by us narcos and feds sr reeks of a con and even worse a honeypot so far sr insiders have been able to loot over btc on top of the atrocious commission now they are promoting the most insecure possible transaction arrangement in terms of traceability in the blockchain anyone who sticks around for that sideshow will find themselves quickly busted as the low hanging fruit that they are.
alfred on february pmthe hub is impartial what that means is we give you the facts which we have done by telling you sr was hacked and you decide what do with it you can decide to never use sr again or you can decide to go back and use the marketplace which is now fe only it is entirely up to you also anything other than the official story as confirmed by defcon is just speculation and we will not condemn an established marketplace like sr based on speculation it would be the same way with any of the established marketplaces if anyone has any hard evidence that sr was indeed an inside job and that the current administration is responsible please pm me with it thanks for the reply i think you are missing my point i think it is probably an inside job however my point is that even if it was not an inside job then it means that the administrators know nothing about coding and nothing about doing business that means that sr is certainly a financial risk to users confirmed and not speculation and possibly a security risk speculation there is no reason to equivocate million dollars worth of user funds were stolen under their administration.
alfred on february pmi would like for someone to come up with a list of qualifications for what you consider to be an established market for instance should we have treated utopia as an established market i will answer your question first no you should not have treated utopia as an established market and yes i say that as one of the utopia forum moderators i am actually quite surprised that utopia has its own section here utopia should have been under the new marketplaces subforum for at least a month or two while it was in its infancy and let me go a step further and say that if someone created a new utopia market it would be even further down the list of possibly established markets trying to cash in on a formerly reputable name is a big red flag a market should be considered established once it has been in operation for at least months has had no strange ripoffs or changes in admin and has a significant enough market share that admins could have but did not run off with several million dollars in bitcoin.
on february pmagree with these but sr was compromised for what months before the takedown true however some things really cant be predicted all we can hope is that new markets learn from the mistakes of previous markets and do not enter the game if they have been lackadaisical about opsec.
ripsnorta on february pmthe whole thing just stinks to high heaven and is riddled with a host of unanswered questions i was always taught that if it looks like a duck walks like a duck and quacks like a duck then its a duck absolutely there is no point in treating sr as a normal market site anymore than we would treat sheep marketplace as a normal market site if they came back sr represents a financial risk and probably also a security risk the hub should make that clear to its users.
sorrymario on february pmi can appreciate the hubs desire to appear impartial but remember silk road is not an established market it is a market that took on the name and look of a previously established market which unfortunately got pwned by us narcos and feds this sr has no relationship with the original silk road if anything the owners of sr are guilty of trademark fraud and why would they do this to trade on the good reputation of the original silk road sr has far less credibility than any other current market because it has proven unwilling or unable to protect user funds an impartial stance would be a warning to use at your own risk.
sorrymario on february pmquote from alfred on february pmi would like for someone to come up with a list of qualifications for what you consider to be an established market for instance should we have treated utopia as an established market i will answer your question first no you should not have treated utopia as an established market and yes i say that as one of the utopia forum moderators i am actually quite surprised that utopia has its own section here utopia should have been under the new marketplaces subforum for at least a month or two while it was in its infancy and let me go a step further and say that if someone created a new utopia market it would be even further down the list of possibly established markets trying to cash in on a formerly reputable name is a big red flag a market should be considered established once it has been in operation for at least months has had no strange ripoffs or changes in admin and has a significant enough market share that admins could have but did not run off with several million dollars in bitcoin agree with these but sr was compromised for what months before the takedown alfred i agree one cant spoonfeed new people who shouldnt be on darknet but helpfulness to the naive is greatly appreciated its probably fair speculation that naive newbies will more likely go to sr because the name makes them think its safer sooner than going to the marketplace which needs that extra technical step for computer illiterates even getting on darknet is a tough process not saying that admins necessarilly have duty to buyers but getting accurate histories of marketplaces or personalities can be difficul.
tyrone on february pm an impartial stance would be a warning to use at your own risk all of the markets listed and discused here are use at your own risk i have made that clear from the beginning here would like for someone to come up with a list of qualifications for what you consider to be an established market for instance should we have treated utopia as an established market also all i am saying is that anyone coming to this subforum is hopefully going to read all of the posts here and make their own conclusions if we have to tell them that they could potentially lose money on sr after reading what they have seen here or on any of the other marketplace subforums then they probably should not be on the darknet full stop this is just my opinion though and i would certainly love to hear arguments as long as it is meaningful i always appreciate discourse.
sr has recently had incidents in which funds in escrow were stolen here are the facts as we know them in the latest theft over bitcoins were stolen more than double the amount that sr staff has admitted to being stolen sr staff have blamed the theft on hackers many people knowledgeable about the bitcoin protocol find the theft of all the coins held by sr through transaction malleability to be implausible if hackers did in fact manage to steal from sr users then the sr administration is incompetent sr moderators on the forum have been deceptively stating that only of sr users had their funds stolen in fact only of total users had funds in their sr bitcoin wallets or in escrow and of those funds were stolen sr should be deemed a suspicious site and the hub community deserves a warning at a minimum a warning saying use at your own risk.
the hub is impartial what that means is we give you the facts which we have done by telling you sr was hacked and you decide what do with it you can decide to never use sr again or you can decide to go back and use the marketplace which is now fe only it is entirely up to you also anything other than the official story as confirmed by defcon is just speculation and we will not condemn an established marketplace like sr based on speculation it would be the same way with any of the established marketplaces if anyone has any hard evidence that sr was indeed an inside job and that the current administration is responsible please pm me with it.
the only way they can save themselves is to repay all the coins back someone made a lot of coins there the last couple months it doesnt matter what happened being a scam or legit theft the management is responsible without repayment they should be avoided if they dont repay they should be put on the scammers list periodthey made a statement few days ago saying they were gonna repay the coins ok anyone get refunded yet.
this is why you totally kick ass you are doing something positive and sparking meaningful debate and you like long walks on the beach awesome lol thanks alfred my new fav mo.
or so claims defcon onto your hats were off again.
time for a new f key.
lol cooked has karma kids are butthurt here i see.
on february amjust enjoyed a thread about why you shouldnt use counterfeit s to pay hookers priceless a nice break from the drama and bs abounding elsewhere ha ya i read that thread a few weeks back when i joined evolution the forums are fairly tame over there its nice but i just dont have the time to maintain different forum presences so i mainly check this one and the markets i work on.
rc every ne on february pmok so i really like evo its a good market that functions quite well with fast page loads and a host of cool feature for the vendor lets make suggest here so they can make it more better vacation mode one click to disable hide all current listings for when we need to take break clone listing for many we list same product in different quantity and being able to one click copy the listing and edit the price and quantity is very helpful buyer feedback having stats on our buyers helps to know when your dealing with someone positive or potential scammer thats all i can think of right now please chime in with your suggestion great ideas another good thing about agora is that they have implemented everything on your list may i suggest posting this on the evolution forum forum link great to see other venders focused on improving and streamlining so we can serve our customers better i like your style r.
help me get high.
evilgrin on february pmi would also like to say thank you to the hub for giving us a subforum and for starting the hub in the first place when it was first introduced i didnt really know if i liked the idea but now i see it is a very useful tool to keep in contact with people between markets especially when a market goes down seems to be more of a tool for your trolling fuck off will check out your market albert.
mary on february amwill check out your market albert sure do mary we still getting off the blocks and a lil messy here n there with updates and constant changes but swing by and check some stuff out let me know your thoughts cheers.
i have been receiving this error all morning.
its been problematic recently probably due to the vps servers arent load balanced correctly the influx of sr s refugees is overwhelming their infrastructure purely speculatio.
yep only been able to get on twice today must be traffic load from sr my guess.
hello kwikeemart we are really happy to see that a vendor enjoy our market since the beginning we keep working on improvement and new features greeting.
we need a more security conscious web developers with an understanding that youll make more btc running a security tight site than vending and or scamming utopia was already under investigation from its inception you cannot vend and admin and also be successful with freedom its all too much to handle run a secure site always updating and being aware admin doesnt vend and only deals with site business escrow locking out scammers resolutions forum issues ect that should be the site owners admins only job make the website hum and sing sweetly enjoy your freedom you cannot be a greedy troll you always make more being honest look at ross vs defcon honest ross had million on site and million in his wallet he lacked website security greedy troll fuckwad defcon scammed lied with a shitty site and only i say only ugh stole million huge sums true but look at the big picture is more than the mob doesnt kill you if you owe them money not right away as long as you pay you live the mob bleeds you slowly if youre dead they make if you pay over time the mob makes a lot more utopia was also run out of someones home ugh no good.
don forget that the first time coins disappeared cold storage issue they were all returned within a few weeks after dpr contacted the new admins how does that fit in with your scam theory why would they return all the money once and then stage an elaborate scam only a month later thanks alfred for keeping this discussion leveled fuckrobertb fuck off you trolling cunt.
anyone else not able to get to sr page says cant connect to server problem loading page.
does that mean they are going to repay the funds they stole or is it just round of a scam.
server overloa.
for the record the hub is currently funded only by alfred and the few donations we have received from individual forum members.
im moving this to the silk road subforum its more of a concept than breaking news i think the input of the silk road community would certainly be a useful indicator as to whether your opinion holds weight and i look forward to reading the discussion to come.
until decon repays users shouldnt sr be considered a scam marketplace or do they get a pass because they help fund this forum.

on february amquote from neferti on february amdon forget that the first time coins disappeared cold storage issue they were all returned within a few weeksnot taking sides here but the only proof of the coins being returned was the sr admins saying so they seem to have a record of not being truthful to their community they could have been returned or they could have just used the money in escrow i dont think anyone will ever know at this point why is this point so difficult for so many sr devotees to understand is it genuine stupidity outright denial or blatant dishonesty my brain hurts anytime i see one of these idiots asking people why they returned the cold storage coins if they were scammers anyway as for the sticky i am defintiely in favour of it deepdotweb has them in the dead scam category on their site and a big majority of the darknet community seems to believe it is a scam why should the hub treat it any differently.

hours ago i was sweating as i owe some nasty individuals a great deal of money these are the people who make you disapear many will know i was preparing my goodbyes from the forums however defcon stood up and showed the true sr spirit in defiance of all the doubters he paid me the full amount and saved my bacon this is what the sr community is all about we are all family and we all help each other out long live srdefcons message to me be safe when you repay we will put the balance directly into paying a vendor back this came out of our staff pay reserves thank you for your support and patience get those people paid and happy and get back to serving drinks in the green camel captains orders defco.
glad youre not in any trouble i am starting to be swayed by the stories im hearing maybe its the years buying om the street that has me so critical the minute something like that happens i will wait and see im not owed much just a few quid change really not enough for my usual order so when that goes back ill know for sure im deliberately not making much noise with my buyers account so i see if all goes back automatically if that happens i will have no doubts at all but until then i wont be ordering anything i can afford to loss it so i will either get some of the street shit till then im not stuck at all but its no consistency on the street its either good and really small or shit and little bigger not like what i was getting on s.
if sr pays everyone back great if they dont they suck that is my opinion on this matter.

this sounds just like what the sheep market admin did for all their vocal forum members before they stole everything just ask jack n hoff he backed sheep market until the very last day why because unlike everyone else they let him withdraw a limited amount of funds so he would publicly called bs on any scam talk so does this post sound familiar.
we all can see wallet decons wallet supposedly has been posted you have no credability imo go back to your drinking establishment thread all you are doing is spreading fud making a big sh t sandwich yuck.

we liked the vacation mode idea so we have now implemented that buyers dont have a feedback rating as such but they do have searchable statistics so vendors can make informed choices about who to deal with.
yep i see that just so people know how to find it its called holiday mode evo and its located on the store tab of your vendor dashboard thanks a million for that i had to take a break last week and it was a bit annoying to do it one at a time thanks for the speedy implementaiton.

smuggling out sex offenders good read thank you.
g damn it thank you for the information im digging too when we find him game ove.
here is the original post looks like defcon started this scam in december slowly moving btc to his wallet several times a day read below for the details appears sr had an arrangement with a group of uk vendors to not steal from them but anyone else was free game copy pasted bbmc is a full member of the british tor vendors association btva ever get the feeling youve been swindled been moving our bitcoins out of the sites fac wallet since the end of january its only btcmore interesting is all the s ive been finding associated with silk road from this wallet payment marks a massive cashpile there are of them the wallet has been busy again today feb i believe the thief uses this wallet i was worried that this info could compromise dpr s trial if it is bitcoin earned by him ive even tried to make myself known to the wallet owner by firing in the numbers for v e n d o r b b m c using to but ross cant be moving that money around hes in custody when defcon claimed to be unable to find the escrow funds in december i felt sorry for him so i found as many sr system wallets as i could for him marked them from the ah wallet on dec th then messaged support to let them know where dpr kept the money thursday th feb my escrow went missing again at about uk time along with those of other uk vendors silk road support had been specifically asked not to steal from any of the british tor vendors association members i was contacted by the btva and asked to find our missing funds it was very easy and easier because i already had wallets such as on dec and decthe irony that a thief was using small bitcoin payments to mark his own swag piles wasnt lost on me the ing wallet now has a in itjust go and add up a few of those hundreds of fat wallets all filled then marked with wallet close succession i havent added it all up but it looks around half a billion dollars move and marked in february most of that must be unspent historical silk road and sr earnings whoever owns the android phone with bitcoin wallet nxd is the thief i believe my money is on defcon and some of my money is with him about btc if the thief hadnt it from the brotherhood of british meth chemists none of this need have happened incidentally this isnt a real listing dont try to buy it feel free to make a small payment to any of those wallets it will let the thief or thieves know that you know have a great week everybody its only bbmc tea.
on february amwhoever the bbmc and the btva are they are as much to blame as dpr assuming this is all true of course i agree in the fact that they didnt warn everyone at the time but regardless this is another red flag regarding the whole sr saga the sr admin cannot and should not be trusted at this point.
xandz on february amthe stupidity some people exhibit sometimes really saddens me good for a laugh though no.
