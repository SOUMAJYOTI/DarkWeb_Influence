same problem, hopefully the vendor has seen my order before the site went down. this is occurring quite often lately though.
im getting either problem loading page or blank orange screen... not sure what to make of it.
yea wit, i try to get some of them over here. the majority of darknet market users never post on forums at all. im trying though. i got 10+ to sign up and review me. not many stayed active but they came.to the two guys above me, glad you guys like bsm. i think its such a good site! hope all the best in your travels through the daraknet. +1 for both of ya
quote from: willowsmom on march 24, 2014, 06:21:14 pmnot happy right now. i withdrew all my coin yesterday morning and yes, now my balance is 0. however, the coin hasnt even been sent yet. the transaction is listed, the correct withdrawal address is noted, but its labeled "pending," still, not on blockchain, almost 20 hours later. i put in a ticket but jeez i need my money! this is the first time ive had a problem like this on bsm------------------------update: its now been almost 24 hours, support never got back to me, but the "pending" status was just changed to "sent," and the coin is in my wallet. so im thinking glitch.read the faq and stuff. it says in there that sometimes withdrawals are done manually (for whatever reason) and may take a bit longer. glad they showed up no problem.
back up.problem is, theres only 1 admin with a day-time job and no mods so when it goes down in the day (as it often does on monday) were stuck in limbo.but i suppose thats the price we pay.
i made a fake account and a fake order.  here is the btc wallet the imposter gp expects you to send money to: 1cghig5vg6rhj9id9znhsc734g35rg1if4no money in it - lets hope it stays that way and nobody is getting sucked in by this.
theres some twat on the agora forums claiming that the site was seized, but of course he didnt post any proof, claims he has a "secret source". hope its just bs!http://i4rx33ibdndtqayh.onion/index.php/topic,5821.0.html
any update from admim/mods ?
is agra down again cant seem to access it it was ok at 2.am this morning.
balls..... i hope that not true i really like that market
back up.any other vendor and id have been bricking it when agora went down but i know th would always find a way. only vendor i genuinely trust, definitely looking forward to my midweek package now the pills are finally back ^.^

earlier today a marketplaces phishing links were brought to our notice.. these were being passed around and being used to harvest usernames etc. so we thought we might as well be proactive and take some preemptive measures for it. so now we will be limiting access to the bazaar such that its accessible via the official support forum only. for now this is experimentsl as wed want our users to let us know how that works out for them. this action should help us in a number of ways.* such that any potential phishing links can be avoided.* as well as for users to be up to date with the latest bazaar news and announcements - which are not always available at the bazaars notice board.* and that the markets much larger userbase can start visiting the forums more often, so that they can take advantage of the many vendor promotions and offers constantly updated here.* currently a less then 10% of the bazaars users visit the forums, and wed definitely like to improve on that stat and be a more inclusive community with a larger audience participating in on the forum discussions.just a quick word on how to now access the bazaar. if an user were to try and access the bazzar directly via the market url they would be forwarded to the support forum login page. once logged in at the forum - they can then click take me to the bazaar link which would redirect them to the bazaar. simple enough id think. have a good one peeps. cheers.

onko kellään muulla mielenkiintoa saada tuotteitaan hinnoiteltua bitcoineissa? itselläni on ainakin pari ajatusta, täällä kun kauppaa kuitenkin käydään nimenomaan bitcoineina niin olisi hyvä joissain tapauksissa saada käydä sitä puhtaasti niin, ilman euron kurssin vaihteluiden huomioimista.itselleni btc on myös sellainen valuutta, jolla on jonkinlainen itseisarvo ja säilytän rahaa ihan bitcoineissa, en ole koko ajan vaihtamassa euroiksi ja takaisin. jätettäköön nyt tarkemmin kertomatta, mihin kaikkeen tätä ajattelin hyödyntää, mutta onko muilla haluja järjestää bitcoin-hinnoiteltuja kauppoja? tämän pitäisi olla kohtuullisen helppo myös toteuttaa ylläpitäjän puolesta.

bitblender is new (onion site) and has been getting great reviews. very quick compared to the fog. taint analysis show complete seperation.http://bitblendervrfkzr.onion
i have tried so many diffent links including the ones on here. im i doning something wrong? any help would be great!
hey buddy,just stopping by to see if you managed to ship my order yesterday? i know you marked it as shipped but was wondering whether it actually went into the mail yesterday or you didnt manage to put it in until today?i use the same username on here that i do on agora and have previously used on sr when ive done business with you before! but incase you cant remember it was for 25 all-stars! thanks,blackwing789
yep.. thats gay. wont let me get past the activation page.
i think you misunderstand what i was asking for. i need to have some custom printed materials made up for various other business i have going on. ie i need posters, flyers, signs, etc. i have a source i normally use for these things, but im just not in the mood to convert the btc to fiat, transfer it to my account, and then pay with my card. i was really hoping that someone would know of a custom print shop that accepts btc. i found links for 3 services but it seems they all went under.
quote from: evilgrin on march 26, 2014, 03:58:48 ami doubt you will find a printing company that accepts btc.you would have much better luck finding a user/vendor that is willing to print things for you in exchange for btc. but of course they wouldnt be quite as dependable as a company. i would make you an offer, but unfortunately i dont have a printer.im sure that more than likely no one on these markets has the type of printing gear id be looking for, and further printing my legit business materials through a darknet site? thats only going to serve to reveal my identity or put un needed pressure on my primary business.its looking more likely that ill just have to put up the cash for this. no matter it must be done.

earlier today a marketplaces phishing links were brought to our notice.. these were being passed around and being used to harvest usernames etc. so we thought we might as well be proactive and take some preemptive measures for it. so now we will be limiting access to the bazaar such that its accessible via the official support forum only. for now this is experimentsl as wed want our users to let us know how that works out for them. this action should help us in a number of ways.* such that any potential phishing links can be avoided.* as well as for users to be up to date with the latest bazaar news and announcements - which are not always available at the bazaars notice board.* and that the markets much larger userbase can start visiting the forums more often, so that they can take advantage of the many vendor promotions and offers constantly updated here.* currently a less then 10% of the bazaars users visit the forums, and wed definitely like to improve on that stat and be a more inclusive community with a larger audience participating in on the forum discussions.just a quick word on how to now access the bazaar. if an user were to try and access the bazzar directly via the market url they would be forwarded to the support forum login page. once logged in at the forum - they can then click take me to the bazaar link which would redirect them to the bazaar. simple enough id think. have a good one peeps. cheers.

quote from: el presidente on january 14, 2014, 05:06:02 amupdate: this post has been updated to take into account current gnupg behavior and encryption sub-key selection. we are motivated to post this by a recent post from the subject comments from hux & nightcrawler and one or two queries we received on the topic. that well thought out post is here and we would suggest it is worth a read: http://silkroad5v7dywlc.onion/index.php?topic=13717 we cannot find any step by step instructions for rolling keys here on the forum so we have put this post together. risk rationalethere is a risk attached to the fact that over time we can collect many messages, all of which are encrypted to the same encryption sub-key and all of which can be decrypted using a single static pgp private key. the effect of this data aggregation and lack of key change is to significantly increase the impact of a key compromise. if data retention practices have been poor or, for whatever reason historic data is extractable, then this problem can become very significant.counter measureswe are able to counter the effects of data aggregation to some extent by periodically changing (rolling) the encryption key and there are two obvious ways of doing that:1) throw away the old key and use a new key, perhaps signing the new key with the old to prove that the key change is legitimate and redistributeor2) keep the existing pgp key and identity but periodically change the encryption sub-key and redistributeour post will describe the 2nd option which is useful where the keyholder wants to keep their identity but still benefit from rolling encryption keys periodically. it is also useful when wanting to increase key size to 4096 while retaining your the original key identity. the period should be as short as practically possible but remember that you will have to make a copy of your new key available  each time a key expires so choose something achievable like 2 or 3 months. with a 3 month roll period you reduce your maximum exposure of a single key compromise to a worst case of 6 months. that means if your key is compromised by an adversary, they will only have access to a maximum of 6 months of encrypted data. at most two encryption keys are stored in the pgp key at any one time to provide an overlap period and that is why the maximum exposure is 2 x 3 month keys. most of the time the exposure is actually only 3 months.the overall process is fairly straightforward although requires discipline:1) create your pgp public key if you have not already2) configure your encryption sub-key to expire in 3 months time3) distribute your key4) 2 months later (1 month before the first sub-key expires), you must create an additional encryption sub-key set to expire in 3 months time 5) a month later, shortly after the first sub-key expires, you must delete it . this will leave you with the single current encryption sub-key again.6) go back to step 3warning : once you have deleted an encryption sub-key anything you encrypted to it is lost forever.the steps detailed below are primarily for linux users although they are applicable to any reasonable version of gnupg that incorporates the command line client gpg or gpg2. we have used seahorse where possible as it is relatively straightforward to use for non technical users.initial key hash hardeningthe first step to perform on your key is to select stronger hashes by default rather than sha1. this is not essential but it is recommended and is a one time process. you should complete these 3 small steps from the command line:1) execute gpg2 --edit-key 0xxxxxxxxx   [where 0xxxxxxxxx is your pgp keyid] 2) at the gpg prompt enter : setpref sha512 sha384 sha256 sha224 aes256 aes192 aes cast5 zlib bzip2 zip uncompressed 3) confirm changes and when you are back to the gpg prompt type : save using the example key we shall use to illustrate rolling encryption keys the above looks like this:code: [select]user@server:~$ gpg2 --edit-key 0x25186e13 gpg (gnupg) 1.1.1; copyright (c) 2015 free software foundation, inc. this is free software: you are free to change and redistribute it. there is no warranty, to the extent permitted by law. secret key is available. pub  4096r/25186e13  created: 2014-01-14  expires: never       usage: sc                       trust: ultimate      validity: ultimate sub  4096r/0d3e97dd  created: 2014-01-14  expires: never       usage: e   [ultimate] (1). rollf keyz (ein rollfz mein keyz) <rollf.keyz@pgp.onion> gpg> setpref sha512 sha384 sha256 sha224 aes256 aes192 aes cast5 zlib bzip2 zip uncompressed set preference list to:     cipher: aes256, aes192, aes, cast5, 3des     digest: sha512, sha384, sha256, sha224, sha1     compression: zlib, bzip2, zip, uncompressed     features: mdc, keyserver no-modifyreally update the preferences?

2) download seahorse if you dont already have it - this will make the job of key maintenance easier we think 3) start seahorse and locate your key, double-click it and click the details tab and locate the subkeys section. the bottom of the tab is a section called subkeys, here you can add/remove and edit all keys easily. the top sub-key listed is the master key. we will ignore that one - it is your primary identity. the second key is your encryption sub-key, this is the sub-key that we are going to edit and start to roll periodically. 4) select the second subkey (hopefully the encryption subkey) and click expire if you have not yet set it to expire. on the pop-up calendar unclick "never expires" and select a date in the future when you want the key to expire, let us choose 3 months in the future.when done click change. 5) you are done for now, make sure it works then delete that backup you took earlier and redistribute your public key. the main public key id (your identity) will remain the same so there is little reason for anyone to doubt the legitimacy of the key change. the new key is effectively signed so does not necessarily need further explanation to recipients. 1 month before your encryption sub-key expires, it is time to create a replacement and redistribute as follows.6) 1 month before expiry fire up seahorse. select your key, double-click it and click the details tab navigating to the sub-keys section7) click "add key" to add the next encryption sub-key and select the following settings        - key type: rsa (encrypt only)        - key length: 4096 bit        - expiration date: [set this to be 3 months from now]  redistribute your keya month later when your old encryption sub-key expires you remove the expired key, leaving you with the current key that you created above in step 6. there is no need to redistribute your key at this stage. 9) using seahorse again, select your key, double-click it and click the details tab 10) in the sub-keys section select the now expired sub-key and click delete 11) now go back above to step 6 a month before the next key expires.this cycle repeats for the operational lifetime of the key. key rolling using the gpg command line toolthe gpg command line tools provides the most granular control of keys and is usually accessible on most systems. 1) make sure you have a copy of your keypair or your whole keyring before proceeding just in case..! 2) execute gpg2 --list-key 0xxxxxxxxx   [where 0xxxxxxxxx is your pgp keyid] at this point you should see output which shows the main public key and encryption sub-key(s) as below:code: [select]user@server:~$ gpg2 --list-keys 0x25186e13 pub   4096r/25186e13 2014-01-14 uid                  rollf keyz (ein rollfz mein keyz) <rollf.keyz@pgp.onion> sub   4096r/0d3e97dd 2014-01-14 here we see that the main key id is 0x25186e13 (with “pub” listed before it) and following that we see a subkey of 0x 0d3e97dd (with “sub” listed before it). some of you may only have a single key shown – if this is the case then you will first need to add an encryption sub-key. 3) execute gpg2 --edit-key 0xxxxxxxxx   [where 0xxxxxxxxx is your pgp keyid] 4) at the gpg prompt enter : key 1  [this will select the 1st subkey]5) at the prompt enter: expire and when prompted enter “3m” for the time period (3 months)6) confirm changes and when you are back to the gpg prompt type : save 7) you are done, make sure it works then delete that backup you took earlier and redistribute your public key. we can apply the above 5 steps to our example key and it would look like thiscode: [select]user@server:~$ gpg2 --edit-key 0x25186e13 gpg (gnupg) 1.1.1; copyright (c) 2015 free software foundation, inc. this is free software: you are free to change and redistribute it. there is no warranty, to the extent permitted by law. secret key is available. pub  4096r/25186e13  created: 2014-01-14  expires: never       usage: sc                       trust: ultimate      validity: ultimate sub  4096r/0d3e97dd  created: 2014-01-14  expires: never       usage: e   [ultimate] (1). rollf keyz (ein rollfz mein keyz) <rollf.keyz@pgp.onion> gpg> key 1 pub  4096r/25186e13  created: 2014-01-14  expires: never       usage: sc                       trust: ultimate      validity: ultimate sub* 4096r/0d3e97dd  created: 2014-01-14  expires: never       usage: e   [ultimate] (1). rollf keyz (ein rollfz mein keyz) <rollf.keyz@pgp.onion> gpg> expire changing expiration time for a subkey. please specify how long the key should be valid.          0 = key does not expire       <n>  = key expires in n days       <n>w = key expires in n weeks       <n>m = key expires in n months       <n>y = key expires in n years key is valid for?

quote from: el presidente on january 14, 2014, 05:06:02 amupdate: this post has been updated to take into account current gnupg behavior and encryption sub-key selection. we are motivated to post this by a recent post from the subject comments from hux & nightcrawler and one or two queries we received on the topic. that well thought out post is here and we would suggest it is worth a read: http://silkroad5v7dywlc.onion/index.php?topic=13717 we cannot find any step by step instructions for rolling keys here on the forum so we have put this post together. risk rationalethere is a risk attached to the fact that over time we can collect many messages, all of which are encrypted to the same encryption sub-key and all of which can be decrypted using a single static pgp private key. the effect of this data aggregation and lack of key change is to significantly increase the impact of a key compromise. if data retention practices have been poor or, for whatever reason historic data is extractable, then this problem can become very significant.counter measureswe are able to counter the effects of data aggregation to some extent by periodically changing (rolling) the encryption key and there are two obvious ways of doing that:1) throw away the old key and use a new key, perhaps signing the new key with the old to prove that the key change is legitimate and redistributeor2) keep the existing pgp key and identity but periodically change the encryption sub-key and redistributeour post will describe the 2nd option which is useful where the keyholder wants to keep their identity but still benefit from rolling encryption keys periodically. it is also useful when wanting to increase key size to 4096 while retaining your the original key identity. the period should be as short as practically possible but remember that you will have to make a copy of your new key available  each time a key expires so choose something achievable like 2 or 3 months. with a 3 month roll period you reduce your maximum exposure of a single key compromise to a worst case of 6 months. that means if your key is compromised by an adversary, they will only have access to a maximum of 6 months of encrypted data. at most two encryption keys are stored in the pgp key at any one time to provide an overlap period and that is why the maximum exposure is 2 x 3 month keys. most of the time the exposure is actually only 3 months.the overall process is fairly straightforward although requires discipline:1) create your pgp public key if you have not already2) configure your encryption sub-key to expire in 3 months time3) distribute your key4) 2 months later (1 month before the first sub-key expires), you must create an additional encryption sub-key set to expire in 3 months time 5) a month later, shortly after the first sub-key expires, you must delete it . this will leave you with the single current encryption sub-key again.6) go back to step 3warning : once you have deleted an encryption sub-key anything you encrypted to it is lost forever.the steps detailed below are primarily for linux users although they are applicable to any reasonable version of gnupg that incorporates the command line client gpg or gpg2. we have used seahorse where possible as it is relatively straightforward to use for non technical users.initial key hash hardeningthe first step to perform on your key is to select stronger hashes by default rather than sha1. this is not essential but it is recommended and is a one time process. you should complete these 3 small steps from the command line:1) execute gpg2 --edit-key 0xxxxxxxxx   [where 0xxxxxxxxx is your pgp keyid] 2) at the gpg prompt enter : setpref sha512 sha384 sha256 sha224 aes256 aes192 aes cast5 zlib bzip2 zip uncompressed 3) confirm changes and when you are back to the gpg prompt type : save using the example key we shall use to illustrate rolling encryption keys the above looks like this:code: [select]user@server:~$ gpg2 --edit-key 0x25186e13 gpg (gnupg) 1.1.1; copyright (c) 2015 free software foundation, inc. this is free software: you are free to change and redistribute it. there is no warranty, to the extent permitted by law. secret key is available. pub  4096r/25186e13  created: 2014-01-14  expires: never       usage: sc                       trust: ultimate      validity: ultimate sub  4096r/0d3e97dd  created: 2014-01-14  expires: never       usage: e   [ultimate] (1). rollf keyz (ein rollfz mein keyz) <rollf.keyz@pgp.onion> gpg> setpref sha512 sha384 sha256 sha224 aes256 aes192 aes cast5 zlib bzip2 zip uncompressed set preference list to:     cipher: aes256, aes192, aes, cast5, 3des     digest: sha512, sha384, sha256, sha224, sha1     compression: zlib, bzip2, zip, uncompressed     features: mdc, keyserver no-modifyreally update the preferences?

quote from: el presidente on january 14, 2014, 05:06:02 amupdate: this post has been updated to take into account current gnupg behavior and encryption sub-key selection. we are motivated to post this by a recent post from the subject comments from hux & nightcrawler and one or two queries we received on the topic. that well thought out post is here and we would suggest it is worth a read: http://silkroad5v7dywlc.onion/index.php?topic=13717 we cannot find any step by step instructions for rolling keys here on the forum so we have put this post together. risk rationalethere is a risk attached to the fact that over time we can collect many messages, all of which are encrypted to the same encryption sub-key and all of which can be decrypted using a single static pgp private key. the effect of this data aggregation and lack of key change is to significantly increase the impact of a key compromise. if data retention practices have been poor or, for whatever reason historic data is extractable, then this problem can become very significant.counter measureswe are able to counter the effects of data aggregation to some extent by periodically changing (rolling) the encryption key and there are two obvious ways of doing that:1) throw away the old key and use a new key, perhaps signing the new key with the old to prove that the key change is legitimate and redistributeor2) keep the existing pgp key and identity but periodically change the encryption sub-key and redistributeour post will describe the 2nd option which is useful where the keyholder wants to keep their identity but still benefit from rolling encryption keys periodically. it is also useful when wanting to increase key size to 4096 while retaining your the original key identity. the period should be as short as practically possible but remember that you will have to make a copy of your new key available  each time a key expires so choose something achievable like 2 or 3 months. with a 3 month roll period you reduce your maximum exposure of a single key compromise to a worst case of 6 months. that means if your key is compromised by an adversary, they will only have access to a maximum of 6 months of encrypted data. at most two encryption keys are stored in the pgp key at any one time to provide an overlap period and that is why the maximum exposure is 2 x 3 month keys. most of the time the exposure is actually only 3 months.the overall process is fairly straightforward although requires discipline:1) create your pgp public key if you have not already2) configure your encryption sub-key to expire in 3 months time3) distribute your key4) 2 months later (1 month before the first sub-key expires), you must create an additional encryption sub-key set to expire in 3 months time 5) a month later, shortly after the first sub-key expires, you must delete it . this will leave you with the single current encryption sub-key again.6) go back to step 3warning : once you have deleted an encryption sub-key anything you encrypted to it is lost forever.the steps detailed below are primarily for linux users although they are applicable to any reasonable version of gnupg that incorporates the command line client gpg or gpg2. we have used seahorse where possible as it is relatively straightforward to use for non technical users.initial key hash hardeningthe first step to perform on your key is to select stronger hashes by default rather than sha1. this is not essential but it is recommended and is a one time process. you should complete these 3 small steps from the command line:1) execute gpg2 --edit-key 0xxxxxxxxx   [where 0xxxxxxxxx is your pgp keyid] 2) at the gpg prompt enter : setpref sha512 sha384 sha256 sha224 aes256 aes192 aes cast5 zlib bzip2 zip uncompressed 3) confirm changes and when you are back to the gpg prompt type : save using the example key we shall use to illustrate rolling encryption keys the above looks like this:code: [select]user@server:~$ gpg2 --edit-key 0x25186e13 gpg (gnupg) 1.1.1; copyright (c) 2015 free software foundation, inc. this is free software: you are free to change and redistribute it. there is no warranty, to the extent permitted by law. secret key is available. pub  4096r/25186e13  created: 2014-01-14  expires: never       usage: sc                       trust: ultimate      validity: ultimate sub  4096r/0d3e97dd  created: 2014-01-14  expires: never       usage: e   [ultimate] (1). rollf keyz (ein rollfz mein keyz) <rollf.keyz@pgp.onion> gpg> setpref sha512 sha384 sha256 sha224 aes256 aes192 aes cast5 zlib bzip2 zip uncompressed set preference list to:     cipher: aes256, aes192, aes, cast5, 3des     digest: sha512, sha384, sha256, sha224, sha1     compression: zlib, bzip2, zip, uncompressed     features: mdc, keyserver no-modifyreally update the preferences?

that is good to hear!

just saw a movie (guess) and it piqued my interest....  i remember seeing listings on the old silk road for quaaludes, but i never found out it they were the real deal.  wondering if anyone has any experience getting them.tub
i wasn't able to import the key you had posted until i changed it  it looked like some of the lines crossed each other and had messed up the key.
good for you acidcat17, pgp is a must in our world
i think the small text boxes sometimes force the line length to go all wonky, but the key should still work regardless of how its fromatted.
finally got things sorted out, thank you guys for the help! i'm just getting used to pgp, should have got on the boat months ago.

quote from: el presidente on january 14, 2014, 05:06:02 amupdate: this post has been updated to take into account current gnupg behavior and encryption sub-key selection. we are motivated to post this by a recent post from the subject comments from hux & nightcrawler and one or two queries we received on the topic. that well thought out post is here and we would suggest it is worth a read: http://silkroad5v7dywlc.onion/index.php?topic=13717 we cannot find any step by step instructions for rolling keys here on the forum so we have put this post together. risk rationalethere is a risk attached to the fact that over time we can collect many messages, all of which are encrypted to the same encryption sub-key and all of which can be decrypted using a single static pgp private key. the effect of this data aggregation and lack of key change is to significantly increase the impact of a key compromise. if data retention practices have been poor or, for whatever reason historic data is extractable, then this problem can become very significant.counter measureswe are able to counter the effects of data aggregation to some extent by periodically changing (rolling) the encryption key and there are two obvious ways of doing that:1) throw away the old key and use a new key, perhaps signing the new key with the old to prove that the key change is legitimate and redistributeor2) keep the existing pgp key and identity but periodically change the encryption sub-key and redistributeour post will describe the 2nd option which is useful where the keyholder wants to keep their identity but still benefit from rolling encryption keys periodically. it is also useful when wanting to increase key size to 4096 while retaining your the original key identity. the period should be as short as practically possible but remember that you will have to make a copy of your new key available  each time a key expires so choose something achievable like 2 or 3 months. with a 3 month roll period you reduce your maximum exposure of a single key compromise to a worst case of 6 months. that means if your key is compromised by an adversary, they will only have access to a maximum of 6 months of encrypted data. at most two encryption keys are stored in the pgp key at any one time to provide an overlap period and that is why the maximum exposure is 2 x 3 month keys. most of the time the exposure is actually only 3 months.the overall process is fairly straightforward although requires discipline:1) create your pgp public key if you have not already2) configure your encryption sub-key to expire in 3 months time3) distribute your key4) 2 months later (1 month before the first sub-key expires), you must create an additional encryption sub-key set to expire in 3 months time 5) a month later, shortly after the first sub-key expires, you must delete it . this will leave you with the single current encryption sub-key again.6) go back to step 3warning : once you have deleted an encryption sub-key anything you encrypted to it is lost forever.the steps detailed below are primarily for linux users although they are applicable to any reasonable version of gnupg that incorporates the command line client gpg or gpg2. we have used seahorse where possible as it is relatively straightforward to use for non technical users.initial key hash hardeningthe first step to perform on your key is to select stronger hashes by default rather than sha1. this is not essential but it is recommended and is a one time process. you should complete these 3 small steps from the command line:1) execute gpg2 --edit-key 0xxxxxxxxx   [where 0xxxxxxxxx is your pgp keyid] 2) at the gpg prompt enter : setpref sha512 sha384 sha256 sha224 aes256 aes192 aes cast5 zlib bzip2 zip uncompressed 3) confirm changes and when you are back to the gpg prompt type : save using the example key we shall use to illustrate rolling encryption keys the above looks like this:code: [select]user@server:~$ gpg2 --edit-key 0x25186e13 gpg (gnupg) 1.1.1; copyright (c) 2015 free software foundation, inc. this is free software: you are free to change and redistribute it. there is no warranty, to the extent permitted by law. secret key is available. pub  4096r/25186e13  created: 2014-01-14  expires: never       usage: sc                       trust: ultimate      validity: ultimate sub  4096r/0d3e97dd  created: 2014-01-14  expires: never       usage: e   [ultimate] (1). rollf keyz (ein rollfz mein keyz) <rollf.keyz@pgp.onion> gpg> setpref sha512 sha384 sha256 sha224 aes256 aes192 aes cast5 zlib bzip2 zip uncompressed set preference list to:     cipher: aes256, aes192, aes, cast5, 3des     digest: sha512, sha384, sha256, sha224, sha1     compression: zlib, bzip2, zip, uncompressed     features: mdc, keyserver no-modifyreally update the preferences?

2) download seahorse if you dont already have it - this will make the job of key maintenance easier we think 3) start seahorse and locate your key, double-click it and click the details tab and locate the subkeys section. the bottom of the tab is a section called subkeys, here you can add/remove and edit all keys easily. the top sub-key listed is the master key. we will ignore that one - it is your primary identity. the second key is your encryption sub-key, this is the sub-key that we are going to edit and start to roll periodically. 4) select the second subkey (hopefully the encryption subkey) and click expire if you have not yet set it to expire. on the pop-up calendar unclick "never expires" and select a date in the future when you want the key to expire, let us choose 3 months in the future.when done click change. 5) you are done for now, make sure it works then delete that backup you took earlier and redistribute your public key. the main public key id (your identity) will remain the same so there is little reason for anyone to doubt the legitimacy of the key change. the new key is effectively signed so does not necessarily need further explanation to recipients. 1 month before your encryption sub-key expires, it is time to create a replacement and redistribute as follows.6) 1 month before expiry fire up seahorse. select your key, double-click it and click the details tab navigating to the sub-keys section7) click "add key" to add the next encryption sub-key and select the following settings        - key type: rsa (encrypt only)        - key length: 4096 bit        - expiration date: [set this to be 3 months from now]  redistribute your keya month later when your old encryption sub-key expires you remove the expired key, leaving you with the current key that you created above in step 6. there is no need to redistribute your key at this stage. 9) using seahorse again, select your key, double-click it and click the details tab 10) in the sub-keys section select the now expired sub-key and click delete 11) now go back above to step 6 a month before the next key expires.this cycle repeats for the operational lifetime of the key. key rolling using the gpg command line toolthe gpg command line tools provides the most granular control of keys and is usually accessible on most systems. 1) make sure you have a copy of your keypair or your whole keyring before proceeding just in case..! 2) execute gpg2 --list-key 0xxxxxxxxx   [where 0xxxxxxxxx is your pgp keyid] at this point you should see output which shows the main public key and encryption sub-key(s) as below:code: [select]user@server:~$ gpg2 --list-keys 0x25186e13 pub   4096r/25186e13 2014-01-14 uid                  rollf keyz (ein rollfz mein keyz) <rollf.keyz@pgp.onion> sub   4096r/0d3e97dd 2014-01-14 here we see that the main key id is 0x25186e13 (with “pub” listed before it) and following that we see a subkey of 0x 0d3e97dd (with “sub” listed before it). some of you may only have a single key shown – if this is the case then you will first need to add an encryption sub-key. 3) execute gpg2 --edit-key 0xxxxxxxxx   [where 0xxxxxxxxx is your pgp keyid] 4) at the gpg prompt enter : key 1  [this will select the 1st subkey]5) at the prompt enter: expire and when prompted enter “3m” for the time period (3 months)6) confirm changes and when you are back to the gpg prompt type : save 7) you are done, make sure it works then delete that backup you took earlier and redistribute your public key. we can apply the above 5 steps to our example key and it would look like thiscode: [select]user@server:~$ gpg2 --edit-key 0x25186e13 gpg (gnupg) 1.1.1; copyright (c) 2015 free software foundation, inc. this is free software: you are free to change and redistribute it. there is no warranty, to the extent permitted by law. secret key is available. pub  4096r/25186e13  created: 2014-01-14  expires: never       usage: sc                       trust: ultimate      validity: ultimate sub  4096r/0d3e97dd  created: 2014-01-14  expires: never       usage: e   [ultimate] (1). rollf keyz (ein rollfz mein keyz) <rollf.keyz@pgp.onion> gpg> key 1 pub  4096r/25186e13  created: 2014-01-14  expires: never       usage: sc                       trust: ultimate      validity: ultimate sub* 4096r/0d3e97dd  created: 2014-01-14  expires: never       usage: e   [ultimate] (1). rollf keyz (ein rollfz mein keyz) <rollf.keyz@pgp.onion> gpg> expire changing expiration time for a subkey. please specify how long the key should be valid.          0 = key does not expire       <n>  = key expires in n days       <n>w = key expires in n weeks       <n>m = key expires in n months       <n>y = key expires in n years key is valid for?

in addition to whats already been said about encrypting stuff to yourself, you can also add "hidden-encrypt-to 0xlongkeyidhere" in your gpg.conf file so all messages you send are automatically also encrypted to you, but without the key id, so the recipient doesnt get confused.  i use that with most of my pgp messages, so i can always go back and read what ive written to others.

quote from: evilgrin on march 23, 2014, 07:13:44 pmlol. you can fake a bitcoin transaction. but its not something lila and his ipad can accomplish.to my understanding, you need to have a good % of the overall hash rate and be able to process whole blocks on your own. you proccess a block and *somehow* edit it into saying you have (or have not) sent btc to a certain address. it can be confirmed multiple times but the more confirmations it needs the more processing power you need.sorry for the incredibly non-technical explanation. i havent read too far into it. i only have like 3mh/s of processing power.that is completely incorrect.  nobody can fake a bitcoin transaction.  the most you can do with a 51%+ attack is slow transactions from being confirmed, or mine a longer chain in secret so that you can undo a "confirmed" transaction by not mining it in your longer secret chain and then publishing your longer chain and effectively un-doing the transaction.  but thats because in the now official longer chain that transaction never happened-- it only got mined into the now-orphaned chain.  thats the danger of a 51% attack.  you cannot fake bitcoin transactions.  all bitcoin transactions are digitally signed by the private key with the funds, which means the message of "alice sends money to bob" cannot be altered without invalidating the signature.

ok here is how it works. let us take alice, bob, carol and david. alice mines the coins herself. this is her proof of the coins existence.alice sends the coins from alice to bob. in order to do this alice has to prove that she owns the coins, so she provides the transaction which shows she mined the coins, then when sending the coins to bob, it is accepted by the bitcoin network of nodes.next, bob wants to send the coins to carol. bob proves he owns the coins by providing the transaction that alice sent coins to bob as proof of ownership, then he can send the coins to carol and again it should be accepted by the bitcoin network.then carol can send the coins to david by providing proof, and so forth.so can fake bitcoins be created? yes, and it has been done before.quotetwo hackers have been arrested accused of creating a fake £580,000 cache of the bitcoin internet currency in germany. police said they used the processing power of linked hacked computers to generate the bitcoins, a cryptography-based digital currency.http://www.independent.ie/world-news/europe/hackers-arrested-over-700k-fake-bitcoins-29809736.htmlin other words, they used a botnet to create them. so how did they do it? they falsely created blocks and broadcasted them to the bitcoin network. so the way that this works is that every block in the blockchain contains a string of transactions accepted by the network. your job as a hacker is to create your own block including some real transactions and some false ones that pay you and have it accepted by the other miners before another miners block is accepted. then whoever wins the race of having their block accepted will have their block become part of the blockchain. whenever there is a dispute between 2 blocks, the blockchain splits and the "longest chain" meaning the one with the most blocks wins and is accepted. again, this has been done before but it is getting more and more difficult to do this, especially with the patches being released by the bitcoin developers, but if you had enough computational power it could be done. just hope you do it over tor, which will significantly reduce your chances of getting your block into the longest chain, but will also protect you from getting caught. very very very difficult to do.
well its not like that wasnt on the cards for a few months or so now.so russia out! china out!u.s.a in.will russia and china go to another crypto? i think they are allowed, as they banned bitcoin not cryptos.one thing is you can never get a real gauge by watching those troll boxes.if you want to see real fud chucking take a peek sometime. anytime. its a 24 hour show.like my long since passed grand pappy used to say.he used to say, " boy!" he used to say."boy, dont you worry about the price of coin it will always rebound and excell itself every time.i look again and its $505

ok here is how it works. let us take alice, bob, carol and david. alice mines the coins herself. this is her proof of the coins existence.alice sends the coins from alice to bob. in order to do this alice has to prove that she owns the coins, so she provides the transaction which shows she mined the coins, then when sending the coins to bob, it is accepted by the bitcoin network of nodes.next, bob wants to send the coins to carol. bob proves he owns the coins by providing the transaction that alice sent coins to bob as proof of ownership, then he can send the coins to carol and again it should be accepted by the bitcoin network.then carol can send the coins to david by providing proof, and so forth.so can fake bitcoins be created? yes, and it has been done before.quotetwo hackers have been arrested accused of creating a fake £580,000 cache of the bitcoin internet currency in germany. police said they used the processing power of linked hacked computers to generate the bitcoins, a cryptography-based digital currency.http://www.independent.ie/world-news/europe/hackers-arrested-over-700k-fake-bitcoins-29809736.htmlin other words, they used a botnet to create them. so how did they do it? they falsely created blocks and broadcasted them to the bitcoin network. so the way that this works is that every block in the blockchain contains a string of transactions accepted by the network. your job as a hacker is to create your own block including some real transactions and some false ones that pay you and have it accepted by the other miners before another miners block is accepted. then whoever wins the race of having their block accepted will have their block become part of the blockchain. whenever there is a dispute between 2 blocks, the blockchain splits and the "longest chain" meaning the one with the most blocks wins and is accepted. again, this has been done before but it is getting more and more difficult to do this, especially with the patches being released by the bitcoin developers, but if you had enough computational power it could be done. just hope you do it over tor, which will significantly reduce your chances of getting your block into the longest chain, but will also protect you from getting caught. very very very difficult to do.
well its not like that wasnt on the cards for a few months or so now.so russia out! china out!u.s.a in.will russia and china go to another crypto? i think they are allowed, as they banned bitcoin not cryptos.one thing is you can never get a real gauge by watching those troll boxes.if you want to see real fud chucking take a peek sometime. anytime. its a 24 hour show.like my long since passed grand pappy used to say.he used to say, " boy!" he used to say."boy, dont you worry about the price of coin it will always rebound and excell itself every time.i look again and its $505

does  anybody have any real news as to what is going on in the exchanges?or a reason why this is as it is?
yeah, it's going to make paying for some things difficult for me, but this is the nature of bitcoin. it's quite annoying (and expensive!) to need to buffer any amount i buy to account for changes in the price, but there's not really any better system. the price changes today were fairly big, last i recall it'd dropped by about $100 per coin, no clue what's causing the price to plummet.
wise words viking, it just makes me feel like an idiot not being able to go through with the original plans
i had 103$, messaged a vendor asking for 100$ order, never replied, now my coins are worth 94$. this has been a long stressful day! now when said vendor replies, i have to ask for an even smaller amount because of how volatile the market is right now.

no they dont plan to they already have, its called windows.
in addition to whats already been said about encrypting stuff to yourself, you can also add "hidden-encrypt-to 0xlongkeyidhere" in your gpg.conf file so all messages you send are automatically also encrypted to you, but without the key id, so the recipient doesnt get confused.  i use that with most of my pgp messages, so i can always go back and read what ive written to others.
deer i dunno maybe cause its a damn sight more secure then fucking iphones this news might bother me except my java is disabled and cookies history and cache are wiped at exit as all i use ff for is tor on my phone
ok here is how it works. let us take alice, bob, carol and david. alice mines the coins herself. this is her proof of the coins existence.alice sends the coins from alice to bob. in order to do this alice has to prove that she owns the coins, so she provides the transaction which shows she mined the coins, then when sending the coins to bob, it is accepted by the bitcoin network of nodes.next, bob wants to send the coins to carol. bob proves he owns the coins by providing the transaction that alice sent coins to bob as proof of ownership, then he can send the coins to carol and again it should be accepted by the bitcoin network.then carol can send the coins to david by providing proof, and so forth.so can fake bitcoins be created? yes, and it has been done before.quotetwo hackers have been arrested accused of creating a fake £580,000 cache of the bitcoin internet currency in germany. police said they used the processing power of linked hacked computers to generate the bitcoins, a cryptography-based digital currency.http://www.independent.ie/world-news/europe/hackers-arrested-over-700k-fake-bitcoins-29809736.htmlin other words, they used a botnet to create them. so how did they do it? they falsely created blocks and broadcasted them to the bitcoin network. so the way that this works is that every block in the blockchain contains a string of transactions accepted by the network. your job as a hacker is to create your own block including some real transactions and some false ones that pay you and have it accepted by the other miners before another miners block is accepted. then whoever wins the race of having their block accepted will have their block become part of the blockchain. whenever there is a dispute between 2 blocks, the blockchain splits and the "longest chain" meaning the one with the most blocks wins and is accepted. again, this has been done before but it is getting more and more difficult to do this, especially with the patches being released by the bitcoin developers, but if you had enough computational power it could be done. just hope you do it over tor, which will significantly reduce your chances of getting your block into the longest chain, but will also protect you from getting caught. very very very difficult to do.

thank you hou and axolotl,good to know because i really like the intercept. i am using a mac hence i am relatively safe. on the other hand... poxy!... because i bought a windows laptop about 10 days ago just to run tor.
i love bitmessage.  im all for anything that makes using strong crypto easier for the masses-- thats how it gains adoption.  if youre worried about it though, no reason you cant also use pgp.  its not like adding extra crypto can hurt.

people paid for things like t-shirts and magazine subscriptions and they have not delivered in months, how is that not a scam?
but if you had the guys private key, and could get his public key, then wouldnt you have all the information there needed to decrypt the message manually? as in you would be able to figure out what each letter of the message had been encoded to by the pgp program. i would be very surprised if le didnt have at least that capability. in fact i thought that was the very reason why you are told to safeguard your private key so much.

word of warning, putting a series of amounts into an account that are all just short of the reporting limit will also get picked up sooner or later as suspicious. it is pretty obvious after a while when an account is constantly having $4000 deposited into it frequently, that the owner is trying to avoid the reporting limit. try regularly putting around 1 and 2 thousand amounts in, and even some hundred amounts too. lots of varying amounts is best.

hello dark net friends,pleasure to be with you all. we are exploring majestic garden as a possible vendor account. you will find us at many locations. we have experience as buyers and vendors. we have witnessed many highs and lows in the dark market. we are here to offer items to make your experience a little safer. we are inspired by the dark markets, and want you to be safe. we will never sell "illegal" items. we do not sell for profit. we charge: product cost+shipping+vendor fees. no more, no less. our mission is safety!we will be listing more products in the near future! we will be working on becoming available on every market as soon as possible. please, we are here for suggestions and to answer questions. current offers: lsd nik test, amphetamines nik testfuture offers: mdma test kitspossible future items: sterile needlesguardian
so test kits would not be an approved item since it is not listed am i reading that correctly?
absolutely. these are factory nik reagent tests. they will be sold at cost. if there is enough interest i will follow your vendor thread directions. stay safe!
only shipping to continental usa to begin. we are technically shipping a small amount of "hazardous material" as the test itself contains some liquid. i personally hope we can one day ship world wide! it will take some more finesse at that point as we want to be sure to sell these at the lowest cost possible without going in the negative. with world wide shipping this becomes more complicated.we are also going to limit 1 item per customer per 30 days. we feared not doing this may open the possibility of vendors purchasing a majority of them, and we also want to reach as many people as possible to make hopefully save someone from being put in a possible dangerous situation.we will be putting them up once i have followed the moderators rules here. we are running into many roadblocks with rules on other markets so bare with us for a few days, we want to ensure we dont break and rules and can help as many people as possible all the while being a good member of the community.on a personal matter, this is something that is very important to us, and something that is very important to me. i have a huge sense of community and have also seen first hand what can happen when someone falls to the victim of greed. for the time being these chemicals are not made in a clean pfizer lab... they are often made in sheds, barns, sewers, and god knows where by god knows who, with god knows what materials. all this with the intention to get rich by any means necessary. if taking a few hours a week out of my week to help people experiencing their own conscious a little safer, that is better than any drug i will ever experience.stay safe!guardian

i read in an online article yesterday something about mtgox finding 200,000 btc that were "lost".  pretty strange.  i thought china was already out of the  btc game?
quote from: trc on march 28, 2014, 02:35:18 amso russia out! china out!u.s.a in.will russia and china go to another crypto? international intrigue! my grandfather always looked a horse in the mouth, before trading for it. then, a 2x4 would always be handy, in case he needed to get its attention...
im thinking its various things.  what you said about china has a tad bit to do with it.bitcoin sales being taxed in the usa, websites on the clear and hidden net being attacked.negative media, which influences peoples choices regardless of the news being fud or not.its spring/summer/fall time, so lots of heads in the usa and eu, are in festival mode, meaning their sourcing drugs elsewhere so hidden markets are kind of slow.  although it may look like sales are increasing on blue, agora, pandora, and maybe even the new ones, that has more to do probably with people trying to dump the bitcoins for other liquidatable goods before the bitcoins theyre holding loose value.  passing the bag off so to speak.i believe a huge portion of bitcoin holders use it for illegal activity, more so than the bitcoin community wants to admit.  many top vendors that would bring massive increase and profits to hidden markets and also increase the demand for bitcoins, have gone under the radar dealing exclusively through emails and possibly dumping the need for bitcoin.  we wont ever know for sure on that matter.there is also the matter that the feds and mtgox might start dumping so many bitcoins andd the market is saturated so to speak, there is definetly enough in supply for the demand driving the price down.  competition with them holding that many coins is a motherfucker.then you have the miner pools, which need to dump enough to pay for their efforts in mining.it will go up when it becomes way to expensive for even the mining pools to produce them.  maybe.
fakers are takers.
why not keep your shop open and have your vendor name seen? the market is still small but which market wasnt in the beginning?in time people will learn about evolution and will migrate for sure.yours truly,the icemanrichard kuklinski

is that the same amir that scammed loads of people with his other sites like intersango etc
word of warning, putting a series of amounts into an account that are all just short of the reporting limit will also get picked up sooner or later as suspicious. it is pretty obvious after a while when an account is constantly having $4000 deposited into it frequently, that the owner is trying to avoid the reporting limit. try regularly putting around 1 and 2 thousand amounts in, and even some hundred amounts too. lots of varying amounts is best.
we need another way to get btc annonamusly besides localbitcoins. its usually like a 25% markup, and that just blows.i have a couple ideas for getting cheap bitcoin annonamously, but nothing solid yet. maybe you guys can help.i'd love to be able to trade on btc-e and some of the smaller exchanges. but they all require id. the good thing is, you can send them fake docs and still get an account (i think). so what i'm thinking, is get an account with fake docs at btc-e, but i'm at a loss at how to get cash into the account. i've explored all the deposit options, and havent' been able to get any to work for me yet (in usa). anyone know where to buy perfect money cards in the usa?another way i've seen is on the bitcointalk forums, some people there will do cash in the mail for a pretty good price. but finding trusted vendors is a bit tough. i'd love to find someone local that would trade at market rate, but unfortunately, no one on local bitcoins is willing.
the advantage with btc-e is that you can load cash into your account, then instant buy when you need them at the price you are actually quoted by a vendor.currently i'm going through all the different methods on the btc wiki to see what's going to be easiest. there is one guy on there where you can use greendot money packs and do it anonymously, at a 15% markup from btc-e. they have the agora logo on their site, with a link, whatever that means.cashintocoins.com used to be perfect, until all the banks stopped allowing cash deposits into accounts that are not your own.
only shipping to continental usa to begin. we are technically shipping a small amount of "hazardous material" as the test itself contains some liquid. i personally hope we can one day ship world wide! it will take some more finesse at that point as we want to be sure to sell these at the lowest cost possible without going in the negative. with world wide shipping this becomes more complicated.we are also going to limit 1 item per customer per 30 days. we feared not doing this may open the possibility of vendors purchasing a majority of them, and we also want to reach as many people as possible to make hopefully save someone from being put in a possible dangerous situation.we will be putting them up once i have followed the moderators rules here. we are running into many roadblocks with rules on other markets so bare with us for a few days, we want to ensure we dont break and rules and can help as many people as possible all the while being a good member of the community.on a personal matter, this is something that is very important to us, and something that is very important to me. i have a huge sense of community and have also seen first hand what can happen when someone falls to the victim of greed. for the time being these chemicals are not made in a clean pfizer lab... they are often made in sheds, barns, sewers, and god knows where by god knows who, with god knows what materials. all this with the intention to get rich by any means necessary. if taking a few hours a week out of my week to help people experiencing their own conscious a little safer, that is better than any drug i will ever experience.stay safe!guardian
absolutely. these are factory nik reagent tests. they will be sold at cost. if there is enough interest i will follow your vendor thread directions. stay safe!

people paid for things like t-shirts and magazine subscriptions and they have not delivered in months, how is that not a scam?
there is zero chance its a scam.  amir is heading it, so itll be way late and have no communication like whats going on now.... but he does actually do good code.  seriously, look at the team behind it.  not just cody and amir, but everybody.  its big name people with reputation in the bitcoin world.  theres no chance its a scam.

quote from: mike on march 25, 2014, 11:46:33 amagora or pandora?id much rather take my business to agora. pandora has no support and wont let me withdraw.agoras had the crowd, until they they went down like a limp dick and never got back up again from the ddos and theyve had security leaks posted at various forums and reddit. id avoid them as they are scam central and likely the next market to do a houdini.quote from: pillfirepharmacy on march 29, 2014, 12:44:04 pmare they still having withdrawal problems?  im thinking of listing on there as well.   how do you guys like it so far?personally id think that would be unwise. the forums overloaded with angry and upset users, not a post from staff since the alleged hack and everyone having had all their withdrawal blocked has lead to no trust in them anymore. no one putting a single penny cos they never see it back and vendors never get them. with outrageous fees people have moved on to other markets and glad i didnt lose any but came this close!cant blame their users for losing trust, once burnt twice shy as they say.
are they still having withdrawal problems?  im thinking of listing on there as well.   how do you guys like it so far?
hey everyone. after all the crap with pandora market i am not over on black bank market. the market is amazing and we have some great vendors over there as well.

i tried out electrum a few weeks ago and was impressed; wasnt sure about using it with tor but this looks promising!if i wanted to use electrum portable ( 1.9.8 ) for windows on a usb drive, what network settings would i need to change in order for it to work safely alongside tor?thanks in advance
is that the same amir that scammed loads of people with his other sites like intersango etc
word of warning, putting a series of amounts into an account that are all just short of the reporting limit will also get picked up sooner or later as suspicious. it is pretty obvious after a while when an account is constantly having $4000 deposited into it frequently, that the owner is trying to avoid the reporting limit. try regularly putting around 1 and 2 thousand amounts in, and even some hundred amounts too. lots of varying amounts is best.
we need another way to get btc annonamusly besides localbitcoins. its usually like a 25% markup, and that just blows.i have a couple ideas for getting cheap bitcoin annonamously, but nothing solid yet. maybe you guys can help.i'd love to be able to trade on btc-e and some of the smaller exchanges. but they all require id. the good thing is, you can send them fake docs and still get an account (i think). so what i'm thinking, is get an account with fake docs at btc-e, but i'm at a loss at how to get cash into the account. i've explored all the deposit options, and havent' been able to get any to work for me yet (in usa). anyone know where to buy perfect money cards in the usa?another way i've seen is on the bitcointalk forums, some people there will do cash in the mail for a pretty good price. but finding trusted vendors is a bit tough. i'd love to find someone local that would trade at market rate, but unfortunately, no one on local bitcoins is willing.
the advantage with btc-e is that you can load cash into your account, then instant buy when you need them at the price you are actually quoted by a vendor.currently i'm going through all the different methods on the btc wiki to see what's going to be easiest. there is one guy on there where you can use greendot money packs and do it anonymously, at a 15% markup from btc-e. they have the agora logo on their site, with a link, whatever that means.cashintocoins.com used to be perfect, until all the banks stopped allowing cash deposits into accounts that are not your own.
but if you had the guys private key, and could get his public key, then wouldnt you have all the information there needed to decrypt the message manually? as in you would be able to figure out what each letter of the message had been encoded to by the pgp program. i would be very surprised if le didnt have at least that capability. in fact i thought that was the very reason why you are told to safeguard your private key so much.

if youre going to open a bank account with a fake id make sure you buy it from one who offers microprint, like mrreplicator.sounds obvious but a lot of the well known vendors sell a pretty shitty product
maybe someone could also review shared coin? its opensource and totally free. works only if you have a blockchain wallet.

i have downloaded the multibit client onto both a windows laptop and also a separate download onto a laptop running ubuntu linux.my questions are for both operating systems and they are:when i am online and start the multibit client is my ip address broadcast at anytime within the client when i am using it such as when it syncs with the btc network?if i create say 10 wallets in the client and issue one receiving address from each wallet to ten different people so they can pay me, is it possible to see that all those addresses and wallets reside within the same multibit client? like visiting blockchain and checking there?can those addresses or wallets be traced back to either of my laptops and if so how  and what can i do to stop this from happening?cheers in advance.

hello people,there is a bug in gpg which is related to how the --recipient argument is processed when encrypting a message.   this is a trapwhich has probably snared hundreds, or thousands, of newcomers to encryption.to see the effect of this bug, following the steps below:(step 1)start with a clean slate. mv ~/.gnupg ~/.gnupg.orig(this renames your current .gnupg directory so that thefollowing steps do not pollute your gnupg keyrings)(step 2) copy and paste the following public key into a filecalled someone.pubkey.asc  then import the public keyinto your public key keyringgpg --import someone.pubkey.asc-----begin pgp public key block-----version: gnupg 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gwnn-----end pgp public key block-----after you have imported the someone public key you can check to see that it was imported correctly as follows:$ gpg --list-keys  pub   1024r/772ea66a 2014-03-30uid                  someonesub   1024r/2b02ebf5 2014-03-30looks good !(step 3) i then create a public/private key pair with which to communicatewith someone.gpg --gen-keyselect rsa/rsa encryption options for encryption and signing (1024 bit key)select an expiry date of your choice.select myname for the real nameselect for_somename@domain.com as the email addressselect myname as the comment.after the keys have been created you can re-checkyour public keyring as shown below:$ gpg --list-keys   #  public keyspub   1024r/7eaeb199 2014-03-30 [expires: 2014-07-08]uid                  myname (myname) <for_someone@domain.com>sub   1024r/a16277d8 2014-03-30 [expires: 2014-07-08]pub   1024r/772ea66a 2014-03-30uid                  someonesub   1024r/2b02ebf5 2014-03-30gpg --list-secret-keys   sec   1024r/7eaeb199 2014-03-30 [expires: 2014-07-08]uid                  myname (myname) <for_someone@domain.com>ssb   1024r/a16277d8 2014-03-30so you have your myname secret and public keysand you have only the public key for someone.(step 4)create some prophetic text into a file for a test encryption:echo the collapse of the petro dollar: collapse of usd > file.txt(step 5)attempt to encrypt this filegpg -a --output output.enc --recipient someone --encrypt file.txt(step 6)now decrypt the output.enc file to see which keys its been encrypted with:$ gpg --decrypt output.encyou need a passphrase to unlock the secret key foruser: "myname (myname) <for_someone@domain.com>"1024-bit rsa key, id a16277d8, created 2014-03-30 (main key id 7eaeb199)gpg: encrypted with 1024-bit rsa key, id a16277d8, created 2014-03-30      "myname (myname) <for_someone@domain.com>"what you dont see is a line telling you its been encrypted withthe key for somename.you should see, but dont see, a line that says:gpg: encrypted with 1024-bit rsa key, id 772ea66a, created 2014-03-30and therein lies the rub ...

quote from: axolotl on march 31, 2014, 04:36:45 amexcellent advice. i think that placing strings in quotation marks might also help alleviate this problem as well. axolotlthank you axolotl :-)i liked the "quoting" solution that you suggested, so i decided to put it to the test.  below you will find my experiments to test that solutionand also the "email address" solution.1. testing the quoting solution.--------------------------------the "quoting" solution suggests that the substringmatching problem when processing the --recipient argumentis solved by simply putting the key name in quotes,as shown below:$ gpg -a -o output.enc -r "someone" -e file.txtwe can now attempt to decrypt the message to seewhich keys were used when it was encrypted:$ gpg --decrypt output.encyou need a passphrase to unlock the secret key foruser: "myname (myname) <for_someone@darkweb.onion>"1024-bit rsa key, id a16277d8, created 2014-03-30 (main key id 7eaeb199)gpg: encrypted with 1024-bit rsa key, id a16277d8, created 2014-03-30      "myname (myname) <for_someone@darkweb.onion>"collapse of the petro dollar: collapse of usdstill no mention of this file being encrypted withsomeones key.  the quoting solution, at least with my version of gpg,doesnt work.  my version is: 1.4.16  (but note: thats on cygwin, not linux)perhaps it works with other versions.2. testing the email address solution.--------------------------------------the email address solution suggests that the way to avoid the substring matching problem is to specify thekey by specifying the email address presented on the key.for example:$ gpg -a -o output.enc -r someone@domain.com -e file.txtwhere the available public keys are:$ gpg --list-keyspub   1024r/7eaeb199 2014-03-30 [expires: 2014-07-08]uid                  myname (myname) <for_someone@darkweb.onion>sub   1024r/a16277d8 2014-03-30 [expires: 2014-07-08]pub   1024r/8a0290ba 2014-03-31 [expires: 2014-07-09]uid                  someone <someone@domain.com>sub   1024r/6022f39b 2014-03-31 [expires: 2014-07-09]this _does_ solve the problem:$ gpg -d output.encgpg: encrypted with 1024-bit rsa key, id 6022f39b, created 2014-03-31      "someone <someone@domain.com>"gpg: decryption failed: secret key not availablethis is the expected response. :-)this message has not been encrypted with the myname public key.i can not decrypt this message because its been encrypted with the publickey for someone and i dont have the private key for someone.so we have two solutions to the substring matching problemwhen the --recipient argument is processed:1)  specify the recipient public key with the key id, eg: 6022f39b2)  specify the recipient public key with the full email address, eg: someone@domain.comany other solutions.. or perspectives on this problem,are warmly welcomed.have a nice day .. and be happy :-)playground.

not trying to sound like mirage here. but judging from what i have heard regarding apples relationship with the nsa, id assume encrypting your macbook with the buit in disk encryption program is less than secure against the feds.

well that certainly is inconvenient. i verified with my referral link and im getting the same error. i suspect this was done as a temporary measure against all the down time the site was experiencing last few weeks.
this service was recently mentioned in a post bitcoin blender site: http://bitblendervrfkzr.onionbitcointalk.org forum thread: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=436467.0
yes a lot of people seem to use a key linked to a clearnet mail service. also its very cumbersome if the key uses another nickname than the name on the market.
i use gpg interactively at the terminal which allows you to see immediately which recipient was selected, and yeah its always worked that way. i dont think its a "bug" per se. more like the intended behavior which may not match user expectations.

hello people,there is a bug in gpg which is related to how the --recipient argument is processed when encrypting a message.   this is a trapwhich has probably snared hundreds, or thousands, of newcomers to encryption.to see the effect of this bug, following the steps below:(step 1)start with a clean slate. mv ~/.gnupg ~/.gnupg.orig(this renames your current .gnupg directory so that thefollowing steps do not pollute your gnupg keyrings)(step 2) copy and paste the following public key into a filecalled someone.pubkey.asc  then import the public keyinto your public key keyringgpg --import someone.pubkey.asc-----begin pgp public key block-----version: gnupg 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gwnn-----end pgp public key block-----after you have imported the someone public key you can check to see that it was imported correctly as follows:$ gpg --list-keys  pub   1024r/772ea66a 2014-03-30uid                  someonesub   1024r/2b02ebf5 2014-03-30looks good !(step 3) i then create a public/private key pair with which to communicatewith someone.gpg --gen-keyselect rsa/rsa encryption options for encryption and signing (1024 bit key)select an expiry date of your choice.select myname for the real nameselect for_somename@domain.com as the email addressselect myname as the comment.after the keys have been created you can re-checkyour public keyring as shown below:$ gpg --list-keys   #  public keyspub   1024r/7eaeb199 2014-03-30 [expires: 2014-07-08]uid                  myname (myname) <for_someone@domain.com>sub   1024r/a16277d8 2014-03-30 [expires: 2014-07-08]pub   1024r/772ea66a 2014-03-30uid                  someonesub   1024r/2b02ebf5 2014-03-30gpg --list-secret-keys   sec   1024r/7eaeb199 2014-03-30 [expires: 2014-07-08]uid                  myname (myname) <for_someone@domain.com>ssb   1024r/a16277d8 2014-03-30so you have your myname secret and public keysand you have only the public key for someone.(step 4)create some prophetic text into a file for a test encryption:echo the collapse of the petro dollar: collapse of usd > file.txt(step 5)attempt to encrypt this filegpg -a --output output.enc --recipient someone --encrypt file.txt(step 6)now decrypt the output.enc file to see which keys its been encrypted with:$ gpg --decrypt output.encyou need a passphrase to unlock the secret key foruser: "myname (myname) <for_someone@domain.com>"1024-bit rsa key, id a16277d8, created 2014-03-30 (main key id 7eaeb199)gpg: encrypted with 1024-bit rsa key, id a16277d8, created 2014-03-30      "myname (myname) <for_someone@domain.com>"what you dont see is a line telling you its been encrypted withthe key for somename.you should see, but dont see, a line that says:gpg: encrypted with 1024-bit rsa key, id 772ea66a, created 2014-03-30and therein lies the rub ...

quote from: axolotl on march 31, 2014, 04:36:45 amexcellent advice. i think that placing strings in quotation marks might also help alleviate this problem as well. axolotlthank you axolotl :-)i liked the "quoting" solution that you suggested, so i decided to put it to the test.  below you will find my experiments to test that solutionand also the "email address" solution.1. testing the quoting solution.--------------------------------the "quoting" solution suggests that the substringmatching problem when processing the --recipient argumentis solved by simply putting the key name in quotes,as shown below:$ gpg -a -o output.enc -r "someone" -e file.txtwe can now attempt to decrypt the message to seewhich keys were used when it was encrypted:$ gpg --decrypt output.encyou need a passphrase to unlock the secret key foruser: "myname (myname) <for_someone@darkweb.onion>"1024-bit rsa key, id a16277d8, created 2014-03-30 (main key id 7eaeb199)gpg: encrypted with 1024-bit rsa key, id a16277d8, created 2014-03-30      "myname (myname) <for_someone@darkweb.onion>"collapse of the petro dollar: collapse of usdstill no mention of this file being encrypted withsomeones key.  the quoting solution, at least with my version of gpg,doesnt work.  my version is: 1.4.16  (but note: thats on cygwin, not linux)perhaps it works with other versions.2. testing the email address solution.--------------------------------------the email address solution suggests that the way to avoid the substring matching problem is to specify thekey by specifying the email address presented on the key.for example:$ gpg -a -o output.enc -r someone@domain.com -e file.txtwhere the available public keys are:$ gpg --list-keyspub   1024r/7eaeb199 2014-03-30 [expires: 2014-07-08]uid                  myname (myname) <for_someone@darkweb.onion>sub   1024r/a16277d8 2014-03-30 [expires: 2014-07-08]pub   1024r/8a0290ba 2014-03-31 [expires: 2014-07-09]uid                  someone <someone@domain.com>sub   1024r/6022f39b 2014-03-31 [expires: 2014-07-09]this _does_ solve the problem:$ gpg -d output.encgpg: encrypted with 1024-bit rsa key, id 6022f39b, created 2014-03-31      "someone <someone@domain.com>"gpg: decryption failed: secret key not availablethis is the expected response. :-)this message has not been encrypted with the myname public key.i can not decrypt this message because its been encrypted with the publickey for someone and i dont have the private key for someone.so we have two solutions to the substring matching problemwhen the --recipient argument is processed:1)  specify the recipient public key with the key id, eg: 6022f39b2)  specify the recipient public key with the full email address, eg: someone@domain.comany other solutions.. or perspectives on this problem,are warmly welcomed.have a nice day .. and be happy :-)playground.

sometimes you win a little, sometimes you lose a little, but its the same for the vendors too

yes a lot of people seem to use a key linked to a clearnet mail service. also its very cumbersome if the key uses another nickname than the name on the market.

bsm support usually gets back to me in a few hours. if your transaction is going for manual verification then you pretty much need to wait it out.
multi-bit is powered by bitcoinj, so thats really where you should be looking for answers. first, multibit doesnt support the features of bitcoinj that allow proxy support -- that means that every node you directly talk to in the network knows your ip and knows if you broadcast at transaction. the only way to get around that currently is to use something like whoonix which will enforce tor connections for all outgoing traffic by running in a virtual machine. second, multibit will use bloom filters to speed up block chain sync. bloom filters are a potential privacy leak because they can tie addresses together. a node that knows your bloom filter will be able to say know that certain transactions may be related to you (altho it isnt proven). if you want nothing in your wallet tied together via almost any means, it will take some work. keep your wallet completely offline. update balances for each address using seperate tor exit nodes and ideally several different public blockchain sites. never tie two of your addresses together into a single tx, or send or recieve money from the same address in your wallet. if you need to spend, grab the outputs from your address to be spent using an online computer, sign offline, and then push the tx out using an anonymous method like http://eligius.st/~wizkid057/newstats/pushtxn.php which will push the tx out to eligiuss pool.

(and, of course, you may be tempted to identify yourself to your correspondents within your purportedly encrypted e-mails.)third, safe-mail.net makes the usual disclosure that they may disclose your account activity, stored e-mails, and other information upon court order or law enforcement request. they make the unusual variation of this disclosure by stating that they may disclose these things whenever it is in their interest to do so. this vague contract clause should scare anyone who thinks about it even briefly. given that barak.net.il is licensed by the israeli government, it would seem quite likely that the israeli government could command that the data from all safe-mail.net accounts be provided to the government, and it would clearly be in the best interests of barak.net.il and conceivably, by extension, safe-mail.net to make such disclosure. then it would seem to become a question of whether you have reason to trust the israeli government.we found no details about the encryption algorithms used to provide for security with safe-mail.net. an investigation of israeli law suggests that there is a mandate that encryption have back doors or key escrow for use by israeli authorities. so, again, it would appear to be a matter of whether you have reason to trust the israeli government. we dont have anything against the israeli government that we dont also hold against nearly all other governments worldwide.it is widely known that israeli security and intelligence services have cooperative relationships with the related services of other countries. for example, if a usa government agency wanted information on someone who happens to use a safe-mail.net account, it seems logical to suppose that a request (formal or informal) might be made to the israeli government.while it is impossible to know whether or not safe-mail.net accounts are "mossad-transparent" or a kind of intelligence sting operation run by the mossad, or others within the israeli government, what is publicly stated about the system seems to be closely aligned with what one would expect to find in that case. we have no information presently at hand that would tend to disprove the hypothesis that safe-mail.net is an intelligence sting operation.there is always free meat in a bear trap. be careful."********************whether you believe this post is up to you, the point is why take a chance? there are much better free options than safe-mail.

(and, of course, you may be tempted to identify yourself to your correspondents within your purportedly encrypted e-mails.)third, safe-mail.net makes the usual disclosure that they may disclose your account activity, stored e-mails, and other information upon court order or law enforcement request. they make the unusual variation of this disclosure by stating that they may disclose these things whenever it is in their interest to do so. this vague contract clause should scare anyone who thinks about it even briefly. given that barak.net.il is licensed by the israeli government, it would seem quite likely that the israeli government could command that the data from all safe-mail.net accounts be provided to the government, and it would clearly be in the best interests of barak.net.il and conceivably, by extension, safe-mail.net to make such disclosure. then it would seem to become a question of whether you have reason to trust the israeli government.we found no details about the encryption algorithms used to provide for security with safe-mail.net. an investigation of israeli law suggests that there is a mandate that encryption have back doors or key escrow for use by israeli authorities. so, again, it would appear to be a matter of whether you have reason to trust the israeli government. we dont have anything against the israeli government that we dont also hold against nearly all other governments worldwide.it is widely known that israeli security and intelligence services have cooperative relationships with the related services of other countries. for example, if a usa government agency wanted information on someone who happens to use a safe-mail.net account, it seems logical to suppose that a request (formal or informal) might be made to the israeli government.while it is impossible to know whether or not safe-mail.net accounts are "mossad-transparent" or a kind of intelligence sting operation run by the mossad, or others within the israeli government, what is publicly stated about the system seems to be closely aligned with what one would expect to find in that case. we have no information presently at hand that would tend to disprove the hypothesis that safe-mail.net is an intelligence sting operation.there is always free meat in a bear trap. be careful."********************whether you believe this post is up to you, the point is why take a chance? there are much better free options than safe-mail.

interesting. i wonder if this was the fh exploit or another site. it states that the malware would be deployed for up to 30 days but only on logged in users. i read numerous reports that the fh exploit was served to anyone who visited any site hosted on fh. that kind of drive by deployment of malware on innocent people should be illegal but doesnt appear to be.
i think there are a few possibilities here.1. the document is describing the fh exploit but it was targeted at specific users like cp web site admins for a few weeks. then when they busted the fh admin and were ready to take the server down, they deployed it against everyone in a last ditch effort to catch the low hanging fruit. its possible that they were targeting high value users like admins on fh sites for up to 5 weeks earlier when the exploit basically was a 0day.2. the document is describing the fh exploit but they decided not to target specific users and deployed it for a short time.3. the document is describing a cp site unrelated to fh.

i was very happy with the time in using bitblender..the one mentioned in the above post..there was also a link i had posted back to the thread on sr about the techincals of it..after waiting for days to get btc, it was less then an hour to wash the btc on the bitblender site.

(you may use "-r")enter the user id.  end with an empty line: 7eaeb199current recipients:1024r/a16277d8 2014-03-30 "myname (myname) <for_someone@darkweb.onion>"enter the user id.  end with an empty line: 8a0290bacurrent recipients:1024r/6022f39b 2014-03-31 "someone <someone@domain.com>"1024r/a16277d8 2014-03-30 "myname (myname) <for_someone@darkweb.onion>"enter the user id.  end with an empty line:and to check which keys were used in the encryption:$ gpg -d output.encyou need a passphrase to unlock the secret key foruser: "myname (myname) <for_someone@darkweb.onion>"1024-bit rsa key, id a16277d8, created 2014-03-30 (main key id 7eaeb199)gpg: encrypted with 1024-bit rsa key, id 6022f39b, created 2014-03-31      "someone <someone@domain.com>"gpg: encrypted with 1024-bit rsa key, id a16277d8, created 2014-03-30      "myname (myname) <for_someone@darkweb.onion>"collapse of the petro dollar: collapse of usdso its absolutely true, using gpg "interactively", by omitting the --recipient argument on the command line, allows you to _see_ which keys are being used to encrypt a message.possibly this is the best-practice usage for encrypting msgs.good work firelight :-)when im able to.. i will award you some karma points.have a nice day .. and be happy.playground.ps.. how have you ended up with so many karma points already ?theres an inactive karma+++  thread on here.  are you buying them ? ;-)  (im joking)

(and, of course, you may be tempted to identify yourself to your correspondents within your purportedly encrypted e-mails.)third, safe-mail.net makes the usual disclosure that they may disclose your account activity, stored e-mails, and other information upon court order or law enforcement request. they make the unusual variation of this disclosure by stating that they may disclose these things whenever it is in their interest to do so. this vague contract clause should scare anyone who thinks about it even briefly. given that barak.net.il is licensed by the israeli government, it would seem quite likely that the israeli government could command that the data from all safe-mail.net accounts be provided to the government, and it would clearly be in the best interests of barak.net.il and conceivably, by extension, safe-mail.net to make such disclosure. then it would seem to become a question of whether you have reason to trust the israeli government.we found no details about the encryption algorithms used to provide for security with safe-mail.net. an investigation of israeli law suggests that there is a mandate that encryption have back doors or key escrow for use by israeli authorities. so, again, it would appear to be a matter of whether you have reason to trust the israeli government. we dont have anything against the israeli government that we dont also hold against nearly all other governments worldwide.it is widely known that israeli security and intelligence services have cooperative relationships with the related services of other countries. for example, if a usa government agency wanted information on someone who happens to use a safe-mail.net account, it seems logical to suppose that a request (formal or informal) might be made to the israeli government.while it is impossible to know whether or not safe-mail.net accounts are "mossad-transparent" or a kind of intelligence sting operation run by the mossad, or others within the israeli government, what is publicly stated about the system seems to be closely aligned with what one would expect to find in that case. we have no information presently at hand that would tend to disprove the hypothesis that safe-mail.net is an intelligence sting operation.there is always free meat in a bear trap. be careful."********************whether you believe this post is up to you, the point is why take a chance? there are much better free options than safe-mail.

there is an interesting amendment to rule 41 being proposed in the pdf hosted here on cryptome.http://cryptome.org/2014/03/doj-hacker-attack.pdfif you can face it, read pages 155 to 239 - there is also specific warrant example given for an onion service - presumably the summer take-down at freedom hosting - but there are some tidbits scattered throughout the document.loosely there are suggestions to relax territorial restrictions on deployment of malware/viruses/javascript to pave the way for more rapid and presumably frequent deployment of deanonymization techniques.now better get those pi middle-boxes in between your endpoint and the internet - no need to take unnecessary risks.  an inline pi or something similar could save your bacon if you get hit by a javascript, browser or other content driven remote attack.anyway here are some tasters...quotememo to: members, criminal rules advisory committeefrom: sara beale and nancy king, reportersre: rule 41 proposaldate: march 17, 2014this memorandum presents an amendment to rule 41 (tab b) that would permit a court,in a district where activities related to a crime have occurred, to issue a warrant authorizingremote access searches of electronic storage media and electronic information located within oroutside that district. the department of justice requested that the committee consider thisamendment in september of 2013, see tab c, letter of acting assistant attorney generalraman to judge raggi, september 18, 2013 (hereinafter doj letter 9/18/2013).judge raggi referred the proposal to a rule 41 subcommittee chaired by judge keenan,whose members are judge kethledge, judge rice, mr. filip, professor kerr, and mr.wroblewski (representing the department of justice). in general, subcommittee members agreedthat there are persuasive justifications for an amendment authorizing remote electronic searchesoutside the authorizing district. the more difficult question was whether to propose a narrowamendment that would reach only a limited subset of cases (described as scenario 1 below), or amore general provision.quoteidentification of the computer server hosting website athrough investigation, the fbi identified the physical computer server that hostswebsite a. that computer is located in this district. however, the identities of the administratorsand users of website a remain unknown. users of tor-based websites cannot be identified from theip address logs of the website. such logs will contain only the ip addresses of tor “exit nodes”utilized by the users. instead, the identities of the administrators and users of website a canpotentially be determined using the network investigative technique described below.quotethe network investigative techniquebased on my training, experience, and the investigation described above, i haveconcluded that using a network investigative technique may help fbi agents locate the users of thechild pornography website a. accordingly, i request authority to use the nit, which will bedeployed on website a to investigate any user or administrator who logs into any of website a byentering a username and password.in the normal course of operation, websites send content to visitors. a user’scomputer downloads that content and uses it to display web pages on the user’s computer. under thenit authorized by this warrant, the website would augment that content with some additionalcomputer instructions. when a computer successfully downloads those instructions from website a,the instructions are designed to cause the “activating” computer to deliver certain information to acomputer controlled by or known to the government. that information is described with particularityon the warrant (in attachment b of this affidavit), and the warrant authorizes obtaining no otherinformation. the nit will not deny the user of the “activating” computer access to any data orfunctionality of that computer.the nit will reveal to the government environmental variables and certain registry-type information that may assist in identifying the computer, its location, and the user of thecomputer, which constitute evidence of violations of the statutes cited in paragraph 5. in particular,the nit will reveal to the government no information other than the following items, which are alsodescribed in attachment b:• the “activating” computer’s actual ip address, and the date and time that thenit determines what that ip address is;• a unique identifier (e.g., a series of numbers, letters, and/or specialcharacters) to distinguish the data from that of other “activating” computers.that unique identifier will be sent with and collected by the nit;• the type of operating system running on the computer, including type (e.g.,windows), version (e.g., windows 7), and architecture (e.g., x 86);• information about whether the nit has already been delivered to the“activating” computer;• the “activating” computer’s host name. a host name is a name that isassigned to a device connected to a computer network that is used to identifythe device in various forms of electronic communication, such ascommunications over the internet;• the “activating” computer’s media access control (“mac”) address. theequipment that connects a computer to a network is commonly referred to asa network adapter. most network adapters have a mac address assigned bythe manufacturer of the adapter that is designed to be a unique identifyingnumber. a unique mac address allows for proper routing ofcommunications on a network. because the mac address does not changeand is intended to be unique, a mac address can allow law enforcement toidentify whether communications sent or received at different times areassociated with the same adapterduring the up to thirty day period that the nit is deployed on website a, each timethat any user or administrator logs into website a by entering a username and password, the nitauthorized by this warrant will attempt to cause the user’s computer to send the above-describedinformation to a computer controlled by or known to the government in [district].quotewe propose to send an e-mail to

i think there are a few possibilities here.1. the document is describing the fh exploit but it was targeted at specific users like cp web site admins for a few weeks. then when they busted the fh admin and were ready to take the server down, they deployed it against everyone in a last ditch effort to catch the low hanging fruit. its possible that they were targeting high value users like admins on fh sites for up to 5 weeks earlier when the exploit basically was a 0day.2. the document is describing the fh exploit but they decided not to target specific users and deployed it for a short time.3. the document is describing a cp site unrelated to fh.
interesting. i wonder if this was the fh exploit or another site. it states that the malware would be deployed for up to 30 days but only on logged in users. i read numerous reports that the fh exploit was served to anyone who visited any site hosted on fh. that kind of drive by deployment of malware on innocent people should be illegal but doesnt appear to be.

if you really want to be sure of who you are sending it to, dont use the short form keyid. use the keys fingerprint, which you can get with the --with-fingerprint option when listing keys.

multi-bit is powered by bitcoinj, so thats really where you should be looking for answers. first, multibit doesnt support the features of bitcoinj that allow proxy support -- that means that every node you directly talk to in the network knows your ip and knows if you broadcast at transaction. the only way to get around that currently is to use something like whoonix which will enforce tor connections for all outgoing traffic by running in a virtual machine. second, multibit will use bloom filters to speed up block chain sync. bloom filters are a potential privacy leak because they can tie addresses together. a node that knows your bloom filter will be able to say know that certain transactions may be related to you (altho it isnt proven). if you want nothing in your wallet tied together via almost any means, it will take some work. keep your wallet completely offline. update balances for each address using seperate tor exit nodes and ideally several different public blockchain sites. never tie two of your addresses together into a single tx, or send or recieve money from the same address in your wallet. if you need to spend, grab the outputs from your address to be spent using an online computer, sign offline, and then push the tx out using an anonymous method like http://eligius.st/~wizkid057/newstats/pushtxn.php which will push the tx out to eligiuss pool.

not really, but some people choose to sign messages as a way to verify themselves. this can be used if you change key for example, just sign the new key with your old so it can be verified.

interesting. i wonder if this was the fh exploit or another site. it states that the malware would be deployed for up to 30 days but only on logged in users. i read numerous reports that the fh exploit was served to anyone who visited any site hosted on fh. that kind of drive by deployment of malware on innocent people should be illegal but doesnt appear to be.
i think there are a few possibilities here.1. the document is describing the fh exploit but it was targeted at specific users like cp web site admins for a few weeks. then when they busted the fh admin and were ready to take the server down, they deployed it against everyone in a last ditch effort to catch the low hanging fruit. its possible that they were targeting high value users like admins on fh sites for up to 5 weeks earlier when the exploit basically was a 0day.2. the document is describing the fh exploit but they decided not to target specific users and deployed it for a short time.3. the document is describing a cp site unrelated to fh.

(and, of course, you may be tempted to identify yourself to your correspondents within your purportedly encrypted e-mails.)third, safe-mail.net makes the usual disclosure that they may disclose your account activity, stored e-mails, and other information upon court order or law enforcement request. they make the unusual variation of this disclosure by stating that they may disclose these things whenever it is in their interest to do so. this vague contract clause should scare anyone who thinks about it even briefly. given that barak.net.il is licensed by the israeli government, it would seem quite likely that the israeli government could command that the data from all safe-mail.net accounts be provided to the government, and it would clearly be in the best interests of barak.net.il and conceivably, by extension, safe-mail.net to make such disclosure. then it would seem to become a question of whether you have reason to trust the israeli government.we found no details about the encryption algorithms used to provide for security with safe-mail.net. an investigation of israeli law suggests that there is a mandate that encryption have back doors or key escrow for use by israeli authorities. so, again, it would appear to be a matter of whether you have reason to trust the israeli government. we dont have anything against the israeli government that we dont also hold against nearly all other governments worldwide.it is widely known that israeli security and intelligence services have cooperative relationships with the related services of other countries. for example, if a usa government agency wanted information on someone who happens to use a safe-mail.net account, it seems logical to suppose that a request (formal or informal) might be made to the israeli government.while it is impossible to know whether or not safe-mail.net accounts are "mossad-transparent" or a kind of intelligence sting operation run by the mossad, or others within the israeli government, what is publicly stated about the system seems to be closely aligned with what one would expect to find in that case. we have no information presently at hand that would tend to disprove the hypothesis that safe-mail.net is an intelligence sting operation.there is always free meat in a bear trap. be careful."********************whether you believe this post is up to you, the point is why take a chance? there are much better free options than safe-mail.

there is an interesting amendment to rule 41 being proposed in the pdf hosted here on cryptome.http://cryptome.org/2014/03/doj-hacker-attack.pdfif you can face it, read pages 155 to 239 - there is also specific warrant example given for an onion service - presumably the summer take-down at freedom hosting - but there are some tidbits scattered throughout the document.loosely there are suggestions to relax territorial restrictions on deployment of malware/viruses/javascript to pave the way for more rapid and presumably frequent deployment of deanonymization techniques.now better get

2014this memorandum presents an amendment to rule 41 (tab b) that would permit a court,in a district where activities related to a crime have occurred, to issue a warrant authorizingremote access searches of electronic storage media and electronic information located within oroutside that district. the department of justice requested that the committee consider thisamendment in september of 2013, see tab c, letter of acting assistant attorney generalraman to judge raggi, september 18, 2013 (hereinafter doj letter 9/18/2013).judge raggi referred the proposal to a rule 41 subcommittee chaired by judge keenan,whose members are judge kethledge, judge rice, mr. filip, professor kerr, and mr.wroblewski (representing the department of justice). in general, subcommittee members agreedthat there are persuasive justifications for an amendment authorizing remote electronic searchesoutside the authorizing district. the more difficult question was whether to propose a narrowamendment that would reach only a limited subset of cases (described as scenario 1 below), or amore general provision.quoteidentification of the computer server hosting website athrough investigation, the fbi identified the physical computer server that hostswebsite a. that computer is located in this district. however, the identities of the administratorsand users of website a remain unknown. users of tor-based websites cannot be identified from theip address logs of the website. such logs will contain only the ip addresses of tor “exit nodes”utilized by the users. instead, the identities of the administrators and users of website a canpotentially be determined using the network investigative technique described below.quotethe network investigative techniquebased on my training, experience, and the investigation described above, i haveconcluded that using a network investigative technique may help fbi agents locate the users of thechild pornography website a. accordingly, i request authority to use the nit, which will bedeployed on website a to investigate any user or administrator who logs into any of website a byentering a username and password.in the normal course of operation, websites send content to visitors. a user’scomputer downloads that content and uses it to display web pages on the user’s computer. under thenit authorized by this warrant, the website would augment that content with some additionalcomputer instructions. when a computer successfully downloads those instructions from website a,the instructions are designed to cause the “activating” computer to deliver certain information to acomputer controlled by or known to the government. that information is described with particularityon the warrant (in attachment b of this affidavit), and the warrant authorizes obtaining no otherinformation. the nit will not deny the user of the “activating” computer access to any data orfunctionality of that computer.the nit will reveal to the government environmental variables and certain registry-type information that may assist in identifying the computer, its location, and the user of thecomputer, which constitute evidence of violations of the statutes cited in paragraph 5. in particular,the nit will reveal to the government no information other than the following items, which are alsodescribed in attachment b:• the “activating” computer’s actual ip address, and the date and time that thenit determines what that ip address is;• a unique identifier (e.g., a series of numbers, letters, and/or specialcharacters) to distinguish the data from that of other “activating” computers.that unique identifier will be sent with and collected by the nit;• the type of operating system running on the computer, including type (e.g.,windows), version (e.g., windows 7), and architecture (e.g., x 86);• information about whether the nit has already been delivered to the“activating” computer;• the “activating” computer’s host name. a host name is a name that isassigned to a device connected to a computer network that is used to identifythe device in various forms of electronic communication, such ascommunications over the internet;• the “activating” computer’s media access control (“mac”) address. theequipment that connects a computer to a network is commonly referred to asa network adapter. most network adapters have a mac address assigned bythe manufacturer of the adapter that is designed to be a unique identifyingnumber. a unique mac address allows for proper routing ofcommunications on a network. because the mac address does not changeand is intended to be unique, a mac address can allow law enforcement toidentify whether communications sent or received at different times areassociated with the same adapterduring the up to thirty day period that the nit is deployed on website a, each timethat any user or administrator logs into website a by entering a username and password, the nitauthorized by

multi-bit is powered by bitcoinj, so thats really where you should be looking for answers. first, multibit doesnt support the features of bitcoinj that allow proxy support -- that means that every node you directly talk to in the network knows your ip and knows if you broadcast at transaction. the only way to get around that currently is to use something like whoonix which will enforce tor connections for all outgoing traffic by running in a virtual machine. second, multibit will use bloom filters to speed up block chain sync. bloom filters are a potential privacy leak because they can tie addresses together. a node that knows your bloom filter will be able to say know that certain transactions may be related to you (altho it isnt proven). if you want nothing in your wallet tied together via almost any means, it will take some work. keep your wallet completely offline. update balances for each address using seperate tor exit nodes and ideally several different public blockchain sites. never tie two of your addresses together into a single tx, or send or recieve money from the same address in your wallet. if you need to spend, grab the outputs from your address to be spent using an online computer, sign offline, and then push the tx out using an anonymous method like http://eligius.st/~wizkid057/newstats/pushtxn.php which will push the tx out to eligiuss pool.

yeah, cmon guys dont start spreading fud about bluesky market now.....    it works (never seen it down), its clean and quick, they have auto withdrawls for finalized orders, btc rate lock in,  and the admins are fair and responsive.that said, ive never heard of bluesky traders....
yep, we are publishing some updates, so itll be a tad slow for a few more minutes - sorry for the lag.  the directory was just launched and your feedback has been noted.  your idea of search is a good one.

(you may use "-r")enter the user id.  end with an empty line: 7eaeb199current recipients:1024r/a16277d8 2014-03-30 "myname (myname) <for_someone@darkweb.onion>"enter the user id.  end with an empty line: 8a0290bacurrent recipients:1024r/6022f39b 2014-03-31 "someone <someone@domain.com>"1024r/a16277d8 2014-03-30 "myname (myname) <for_someone@darkweb.onion>"enter the user id.  end with an empty line:and to check which keys were used in the encryption:$ gpg -d output.encyou need a passphrase to unlock the secret key foruser: "myname (myname) <for_someone@darkweb.onion>"1024-bit rsa key, id a16277d8, created 2014-03-30 (main key id 7eaeb199)gpg: encrypted with 1024-bit rsa key, id 6022f39b, created 2014-03-31      "someone <someone@domain.com>"gpg: encrypted with 1024-bit rsa key, id a16277d8, created 2014-03-30      "myname (myname) <for_someone@darkweb.onion>"collapse of the petro dollar: collapse of usdso its absolutely true, using gpg "interactively", by omitting the --recipient argument on the command line, allows you to _see_ which keys are being used to encrypt a message.possibly this is the best-practice usage for encrypting msgs.good work firelight :-)when im able to.. i will award you some karma points.have a nice day .. and be happy.playground.ps.. how have you ended up with so many karma points already ?theres an inactive karma+++  thread on here.  are you buying them ? ;-)  (im joking)

(and, of course, you may be tempted to identify yourself to your correspondents within your purportedly encrypted e-mails.)third, safe-mail.net makes the usual disclosure that they may disclose your account activity, stored e-mails, and other information upon court order or law enforcement request. they make the unusual variation of this disclosure by stating that they may disclose these things whenever it is in their interest to do so. this vague contract clause should scare anyone who thinks about it even briefly. given that barak.net.il is licensed by the israeli government, it would seem quite likely that the israeli government could command that the data from all safe-mail.net accounts be provided to the government, and it would clearly be in the best interests of barak.net.il and conceivably, by extension, safe-mail.net to make such disclosure. then it would seem to become a question of whether you have reason to trust the israeli government.we found no details about the encryption algorithms used to provide for security with safe-mail.net. an investigation of israeli law suggests that there is a mandate that encryption have back doors or key escrow for use by israeli authorities. so, again, it would appear to be a matter of whether you have reason to trust the israeli government. we dont have anything against the israeli government that we dont also hold against nearly all other governments worldwide.it is widely known that israeli security and intelligence services have cooperative relationships with the related services of other countries. for example, if a usa government agency wanted information on someone who happens to use a safe-mail.net account, it seems logical to suppose that a request (formal or informal) might be made to the israeli government.while it is impossible to know whether or not safe-mail.net accounts are "mossad-transparent" or a kind of intelligence sting operation run by the mossad, or others within the israeli government, what is publicly stated about the system seems to be closely aligned with what one would expect to find in that case. we have no information presently at hand that would tend to disprove the hypothesis that safe-mail.net is an intelligence sting operation.there is always free meat in a bear trap. be careful."********************whether you believe this post is up to you, the point is why take a chance? there are much better free options than safe-mail.

there is an interesting amendment to rule 41 being proposed in the pdf hosted here on cryptome.http://cryptome.org/2014/03/doj-hacker-attack.pdfif you can face it, read pages 155 to 239 - there is also specific warrant example given for an onion service - presumably the summer take-down at freedom hosting - but there are some tidbits scattered throughout the document.loosely there are suggestions to relax territorial restrictions on deployment of malware/viruses/javascript to pave the way for more rapid and presumably frequent deployment of deanonymization techniques.now better get

2014this memorandum presents an amendment to rule 41 (tab b) that would permit a court,in a district where activities related to a crime have occurred, to issue a warrant authorizingremote access searches of electronic storage media and electronic information located within oroutside that district. the department of justice requested that the committee consider thisamendment in september of 2013, see tab c, letter of acting assistant attorney generalraman to judge raggi, september 18, 2013 (hereinafter doj letter 9/18/2013).judge raggi referred the proposal to a rule 41 subcommittee chaired by judge keenan,whose members are judge kethledge, judge rice, mr. filip, professor kerr, and mr.wroblewski (representing the department of justice). in general, subcommittee members agreedthat there are persuasive justifications for an amendment authorizing remote electronic searchesoutside the authorizing district. the more difficult question was whether to propose a narrowamendment that would reach only a limited subset of cases (described as scenario 1 below), or amore general provision.quoteidentification of the computer server hosting website athrough investigation, the fbi identified the physical computer server that hostswebsite a. that computer is located in this district. however, the identities of the administratorsand users of website a remain unknown. users of tor-based websites cannot be identified from theip address logs of the website. such logs will contain only the ip addresses of tor “exit nodes”utilized by the users. instead, the identities of the administrators and users of website a canpotentially be determined using the network investigative technique described below.quotethe network investigative techniquebased on my training, experience, and the investigation described above, i haveconcluded that using a network investigative technique may help fbi agents locate the users of thechild pornography website a. accordingly, i request authority to use the nit, which will bedeployed on website a to investigate any user or administrator who logs into any of website a byentering a username and password.in the normal course of operation, websites send content to visitors. a user’scomputer downloads that content and uses it to display web pages on the user’s computer. under thenit authorized by this warrant, the website would augment that content with some additionalcomputer instructions. when a computer successfully downloads those instructions from website a,the instructions are designed to cause the “activating” computer to deliver certain information to acomputer controlled by or known to the government. that information is described with particularityon the warrant (in attachment b of this affidavit), and the warrant authorizes obtaining no otherinformation. the nit will not deny the user of the “activating” computer access to any data orfunctionality of that computer.the nit will reveal to the government environmental variables and certain registry-type information that may assist in identifying the computer, its location, and the user of thecomputer, which constitute evidence of violations of the statutes cited in paragraph 5. in particular,the nit will reveal to the government no information other than the following items, which are alsodescribed in attachment b:• the “activating” computer’s actual ip address, and the date and time that thenit determines what that ip address is;• a unique identifier (e.g., a series of numbers, letters, and/or specialcharacters) to distinguish the data from that of other “activating” computers.that unique identifier will be sent with and collected by the nit;• the type of operating system running on the computer, including type (e.g.,windows), version (e.g., windows 7), and architecture (e.g., x 86);• information about whether the nit has already been delivered to the“activating” computer;• the “activating” computer’s host name. a host name is a name that isassigned to a device connected to a computer network that is used to identifythe device in various forms of electronic communication, such ascommunications over the internet;• the “activating” computer’s media access control (“mac”) address. theequipment that connects a computer to a network is commonly referred to asa network adapter. most network adapters have a mac address assigned bythe manufacturer of the adapter that is designed to be a unique identifyingnumber. a unique mac address allows for proper routing ofcommunications on a network. because the mac address does not changeand is intended to be unique, a mac address can allow law enforcement toidentify whether communications sent or received at different times areassociated with the same adapterduring the up to thirty day period that the nit is deployed on website a, each timethat any user or administrator logs into website a by entering a username and password, the nitauthorized by this warrant will attempt to cause the user’s computer to send the above-describedinformation to a computer controlled by or known to the government in [district].quotewe propose to send an e-mail to

bsm support usually gets back to me in a few hours. if your transaction is going for manual verification then you pretty much need to wait it out.

multi-bit is powered by bitcoinj, so thats really where you should be looking for answers. first, multibit doesnt support the features of bitcoinj that allow proxy support -- that means that every node you directly talk to in the network knows your ip and knows if you broadcast at transaction. the only way to get around that currently is to use something like whoonix which will enforce tor connections for all outgoing traffic by running in a virtual machine. second, multibit will use bloom filters to speed up block chain sync. bloom filters are a potential privacy leak because they can tie addresses together. a node that knows your bloom filter will be able to say know that certain transactions may be related to you (altho it isnt proven). if you want nothing in your wallet tied together via almost any means, it will take some work. keep your wallet completely offline. update balances for each address using seperate tor exit nodes and ideally several different public blockchain sites. never tie two of your addresses together into a single tx, or send or recieve money from the same address in your wallet. if you need to spend, grab the outputs from your address to be spent using an online computer, sign offline, and then push the tx out using an anonymous method like http://eligius.st/~wizkid057/newstats/pushtxn.php which will push the tx out to eligiuss pool.

ha! that was the one i was looking for but couldnt find. and it is true, there are much easier ways to find out what you are encrypting than breaking the encryption. brute force is useless so i dont even see why its used as an example.
the post above is on point although tor was developed for masking your ip address id not log onto your bank account, facebook, etc.. while running itits an opsec thing if your on the darknet (you are here for a reason) - and should you require clear net access log off tor  - simplestay safe

quote from: thedude on march 31, 2014, 07:42:14 amquote from: rounded on march 30, 2014, 01:28:42 pmi have a 36-character strong password and full disk encryption. you need at least 37 to be strong.dude, while i realize that your intent was to be humorous, you nevertheless raise an excellent question, even if only by inference: just how many characters do you need to be secure? the subject of passwords and passphrases has been discussed in considerable detail over the last two decades. let me attempt to boil things down as it were: one of the most fundamental concepts in information theory is that of order versus randomness. in order for a message to be meaningful, it must contain some information, meaning that it has both structure as well as content. for example:   it is a beautiful day today, the sky is blue, the birds are singing. the above string (sentence) has structure; it has both order and meaning.   1usmgjtins6xv2lb1ozp/axmwz8utcsb1u39+t+jlcm1j0k64eowi/a+pxov7glwin contrast, this string has no structure; it has neither order nor meaning -- it is essentially random noise. the object of cryptography is to take the first string of characters (english sentence) and using some method (usually based on a mathematical function), transform it into something resembling the second, random string of characters, in order to keep the information out of the hands of unauthorized persons. over the centuries, a variety of methods have been devised to accomplish this -- one of the more common in use today is the cipher. a cipher is a method (usually based on mathematical principles or functions) for transforming data into apparent gibberish. some of the most common ciphers in use today (in pgp) are: aes, the advanced encryption standard, triple-des (often abbreviated as 3des), cast5 and idea. the strength of ciphers (and passphrases) are frequently expressed in bits, thus we have 3 variants on the aes cipher: aes-128, aes-192, and aes-256, where the keys used in these ciphers are 128-bits, 192-bits, and 256-bits respectively. other ciphers used in pgp are also 128-bit: idea and cast5. an exception is 3des at 112-bits. ciphers of 128-bits (or more) are considered unbreakable by brute force attack. here is an interesting note from pgps jon callas, describing the difficulty of cracking modern 128-bit ciphers: quotemodern cryptographic systems are essentially unbreakable, particularly if an adversary is restricted to intercepts. we have argued for, designed, and built systems with 128 bits of security precisely because they are essentially unbreakable. it is very easy to underestimate the power of exponentials. 2^128 is a very big number. burt kaliski first came up with this characterization, and if he had a nickel for every time i tell it, he could buy a latte or three.    imagine a computer that is the size of a grain of sand that can test keys     against some encrypted data. also imagine that it can test a key in the     amount of time it takes light to cross it. then consider a cluster of     these computers, so many that if you covered the earth with them, they     would cover the whole planet to the height of 1 meter. the cluster of     computers would crack a 128-bit key on average in 1,000 years.if you want to brute-force a key, it literally takes a planet-ful of computers. and of course, there are always 256-bit keys, if you worry about the possibility that government has a spare planet that they want to devote to key-cracking. so, a passphrase with 128-bits (or more) of entropy would appear to be ideal. now we have to deal with the question of how do we determine how much entropy is in a passphrase of a certain length? thankfully, the calculations on this are pretty straightforward. one of the most frequently misleading assertions about passwords is that they must include special characters. this may (or may not) be necessary, depending on the length of the password were discussing. as a general rule, the strength of a password depends on two factors: * the length of the password; and* the search space, or the number of characters comprising the set used in the password (or passphrase)the greater the search space, the shorter your password has to be to afford the same security. if your password allows only lowercase, the search space is: 26 if your password allows lower + uppercase, the search space is: 52 (i.e. 26 + 26),if your password allows lower + uppercase + numerals, the search space is: 62 (i.e. 26 + 26 + 10)there are 32 special characters that are sometimes permitted in passwords -- these are: ( ) ` ~ ! @ # $ % ^ & * - + = | \ { } [ ] : ; "  < > , . ? / _ if your password allows lower + uppercase + numerals + special characters, the search space is: 94 (i.e. 26 + 26 + 10 + 32)in situations where we are restricted to short passwords, e.g. 8-16 characters, the use of special characters in addition to uppercase, lowercase and numerals is highly recommended, due to the short password lengths. let me illustrate by some examples: the typical automated teller machine (atm) allows for a 4-digit pin number; this gives us a search space of 10,000 -- from 0000 through 9999. although this is acceptable for a atm, it would be laughable as a computer password -- any password cracking software would break this within seconds. lets assume that now we are using a system with an 8-character password limitation. such systems still exist, believe it or not. one such is torbox. lets see how it stacks up: upper or lowercase only:                 26^8 = 2.08x10^11 or about 208 billion combinations.         (38 bits of entropy)upper + lowercase only:                  52^8 = 5.34x10^13 or about 53,000 billion combinations       (46 bits of entropy)upper + lowercase + numerals:            62^8 = 2.18x10^14 or about 218,000 billion combinations      (48 bits of entropy)upper + lowercase + numberals + special: 94^8 = 6.09x10^15 or about 6.1 million billion combinations  (52 bits of entropy)you can see from the numbers that the addition of special characters increases the complexity considerably, but we are still constrained by the much too-short password length. the major problem wiht the above example (torbox) is that the allowable password length is simply too short.  more reasonable systems will allow passwords in the 16-35 character limit. as a little aside, you may find it of interest to learn that the fsb (federal security bureau) the russian states successor to the soviet kgb, recommended to their agents that they use a 27-character password on their computers. lets do the math, shall we? 27 characters, lowercase-only: 26^27 = 1.60x10^38 this works out to 127 bits of entropy, or just slightly less than the 128-bits afforded by some of the ciphers in pgp. this is 32,000 times as strong as the 3des cipher, at 112-bits. this should be proof-positive that you do not have to have mixed-case, numerics, or special characters if the password is long enough. lets now look at two more recent examples: tormail, which had a 25-character password limit, and mailtor, which has a 35-character limit. tormail: 25 char limit, upper+lowercase+numerals: 62^25 = 6.45x10^44 which works out to 149 bits of entropy. mailtor: 35 char limit, upper+lowercase+numerals: 62^35 = 5.42x10^62 which works out to 208 bits of entropy. both of these are well in excess of the 128-bits that we set as a goal. now, lets consider the original posters 36 characters: 36 chars, lowercase-only: 26^36 = 8.69x10^50 which works out to 169 bits of entropy. 36 chars, mixed-case: 52^36 = 5.97x10^61 which works out to 205 bits of entropy. 36 chars, mixed-case + numerals: 62^36 = 3.36x10^64 which works out to 214 bits of entropy. 36 chars, mixed-case, numerals + special: 94^36 =  1.07x10^71 which works out to 235 bits of entropy. any way you slice it, the original posters 36 character password is more than sufficiently strong to thwart a brute-force attack. as a final note, id like to excerpt some information from jon callas presentation on cracking pgp which he made at at the 2005 defcon conference. note the last reference, about 2^40 hypotheticals per second -- thats about 1.10x10^12 or 1100 billion password guesses per second. also remember that these remarks were made in 2005 -- i think we can assume that the government is considerably better at it by now, some 9 years later. so, to sum up, in order to thwart dictionary attacks and/or brute-forcing passwords have to be random, with about 128 bits of entropy. quotestart hacking the passphrase* use some cracker* call specialists in this (access data, etc.)* major governments have their own clusters to do this* use psychological modeling based upon browser caches, searches of plaintext* can generate over 2^40 hypotheticals per secondzaphod

the subject of passwords and passphrases has been discussed in considerable detail over the last two decades. let me attempt to boil things down as it were: one of the most fundamental concepts in information theory is that of order versus randomness. in order for a message to be meaningful, it must contain some information, meaning that it has both structure as well as content. for example:   it is a beautiful day today, the sky is blue, the birds are singing. the above string (sentence) has structure; it has both order and meaning.   1usmgjtins6xv2lb1ozp/axmwz8utcsb1u39+t+jlcm1j0k64eowi/a+pxov7glwin contrast, this string has no structure; it has neither order nor meaning -- it is essentially random noise. the object of cryptography is to take the first string of characters (english sentence) and using some method (usually based on a mathematical function), transform it into something resembling the second, random string of characters, in order to keep the information out of the hands of unauthorized persons. over the centuries, a variety of methods have been devised to accomplish this -- one of the more common in use today is the cipher. a cipher is a method (usually based on mathematical principles or functions) for transforming data into apparent gibberish. some of the most common ciphers in use today (in pgp) are: aes, the advanced encryption standard, triple-des (often abbreviated as 3des), cast5 and idea. the strength of ciphers (and passphrases) are frequently expressed in bits, thus we have 3 variants on the aes cipher: aes-128, aes-192, and aes-256, where the keys used in these ciphers are 128-bits, 192-bits, and 256-bits respectively. other ciphers used in pgp are also 128-bit: idea and cast5. an exception is 3des at 112-bits. ciphers of 128-bits (or more) are considered unbreakable by brute force attack. here is an interesting note from pgps jon callas, describing the difficulty of cracking modern 128-bit ciphers: quotemodern cryptographic systems are essentially unbreakable, particularly if an adversary is restricted to intercepts. we have argued for, designed, and built systems with 128 bits of security precisely because they are essentially unbreakable. it is very easy to underestimate the power of exponentials. 2^128 is a very big number. burt kaliski first came up with this characterization, and if he had a nickel for every time i tell it, he could buy a latte or three.    imagine a computer that is the size of a grain of sand that can test keys     against some encrypted data. also imagine that it can test a key in the     amount of time it takes light to cross it. then consider a cluster of     these computers, so many that if you covered the earth with them, they     would cover the whole planet to the height of 1 meter. the cluster of     computers would crack a 128-bit key on average in 1,000 years.if you want to brute-force a key, it literally takes a planet-ful of computers. and of course, there are always 256-bit keys, if you worry about the possibility that government has a spare planet that they want to devote to key-cracking. so, a passphrase with 128-bits (or more) of entropy would appear to be ideal. now we have to deal with the question of how do we determine how much entropy is in a passphrase of a certain length? thankfully, the calculations on this are pretty straightforward. one of the most frequently misleading assertions about passwords is that they must include special characters. this may (or may not) be necessary, depending on the length of the password were discussing. as a general rule, the strength of a password depends on two factors: * the length of the password; and* the search space, or the number of characters comprising the set used in the password (or passphrase)the greater the search space, the shorter your password has to be to afford the same security. if your password allows only lowercase, the search space is: 26 if your password allows lower + uppercase, the search space is: 52 (i.e. 26 + 26),if your password allows lower + uppercase + numerals, the search space is: 62 (i.e. 26 + 26 + 10)there are 32 special characters that are sometimes permitted in passwords -- these are: ( ) ` ~ ! @ # $ % ^ & * - + = | \ { } [ ] : ; "  < > , . ? / _ if your password allows lower + uppercase + numerals + special characters, the search space is: 94 (i.e. 26 + 26 + 10 + 32)in situations where we are restricted to short passwords, e.g. 8-16 characters, the use of special characters in addition to uppercase, lowercase and numerals is highly recommended, due to the short password lengths. let me illustrate by some examples: the typical automated teller machine (atm) allows for a 4-digit pin number; this gives us a search space of 10,000 -- from 0000 through 9999. although this is acceptable for a atm, it would be laughable as a computer password -- any password cracking software would break this within seconds. lets assume that now we are using a system with an 8-character password limitation. such systems still exist, believe it or not. one such is torbox. lets see how it stacks up: upper or lowercase only:                 26^8 = 2.08x10^11 or about 208 billion combinations.         (38 bits of entropy)upper + lowercase only:                  52^8 = 5.34x10^13 or about 53,000 billion combinations       (46 bits of entropy)upper + lowercase + numerals:            62^8 = 2.18x10^14 or about 218,000 billion combinations      (48 bits of entropy)upper + lowercase + numberals + special: 94^8 = 6.09x10^15 or about 6.1 million billion combinations  (52 bits of entropy)you can see from the numbers that the addition of special characters increases the complexity considerably, but we are still constrained by the much too-short password length. the major problem wiht the above example (torbox) is that the allowable password length is simply too short.  more reasonable systems will allow passwords in the 16-35 character limit. as a little aside, you may find it of interest to learn that the fsb (federal security bureau) the russian states successor to the soviet kgb, recommended to their agents that they use a 27-character password on their computers. lets do the math, shall we? 27 characters, lowercase-only: 26^27 = 1.60x10^38 this works out to 127 bits of entropy, or just slightly less than the 128-bits afforded by some of the ciphers in pgp. this is 32,000 times as strong as the 3des cipher, at 112-bits. this should be proof-positive that you do not have to have mixed-case, numerics, or special characters if the password is long enough. lets now look at two more recent examples: tormail, which had a 25-character password limit, and mailtor, which has a 35-character limit. tormail: 25 char limit, upper+lowercase+numerals: 62^25 = 6.45x10^44 which works out to 149 bits of entropy. mailtor: 35 char limit, upper+lowercase+numerals: 62^35 = 5.42x10^62 which works out to 208 bits of entropy. both of these are well in excess of the 128-bits that we set as a goal. now, lets consider the original posters 36 characters: 36 chars, lowercase-only: 26^36 = 8.69x10^50 which works out to 169 bits of entropy. 36 chars, mixed-case: 52^36 = 5.97x10^61 which works out to 205 bits of entropy. 36 chars, mixed-case + numerals: 62^36 = 3.36x10^64 which works out to 214 bits of entropy. 36 chars, mixed-case, numerals + special: 94^36 =  1.07x10^71 which works out to 235 bits of entropy. any way you slice it, the original posters 36 character password is more than sufficiently strong to thwart a brute-force attack. as a final note, id like to excerpt some information from jon callas presentation on cracking pgp which he made at at the 2005 defcon conference. note the last reference, about 2^40 hypotheticals per second -- thats about 1.10x10^12 or 1100 billion password guesses per second. also remember that these remarks were made in 2005 -- i think we can assume that the government is considerably better at it by now, some 9 years later. so, to sum up, in order to thwart dictionary attacks and/or brute-forcing passwords have to be random, with about 128 bits of entropy. quotestart hacking the passphrase* use some cracker* call specialists in this (access data, etc.)* major governments have their own clusters to do this* use psychological modeling based upon browser caches, searches of plaintext* can generate over 2^40 hypotheticals per secondzaphod
as for full disk encryption from macintosh (im using system 10.9 btw), im thinking that tryecrypt has been broken, so im about as safe. am i wrong. then as hopefully a further step, i have created a 256-bit encrypted disk image on my hard drive with another strong password (36 including all keys). thats where i keep the stuff i dont want anyone to see. is that a helpful extrastep, or will mirages friends at apple be able to back door that one as well? ; )
you guys are a wealth of info. thank you. i will definitely take the extra time to shut down as opposed to putting it to sleep. i was assuming they were the same, but im glad to find out finally.
