from cicada february pmplease elaborate the hypervisor use case possible references detailed example documentation most appreciated. 
safe assume the torvm comprised barebones installation with iptables dropping everything but tor traffic dont know off the shelf play play set documentation for virtual isolation hidden services. 
the simplest method probably using whonix gateway and servicevm either whonix workstation bare install linux bsd behind all running under virtualbox. 
probably the best method would involve configuring xen using not hvm theres less attack surface the hypervisor provide bridge interface from the ethernet adapter the outside virtual interface thetorvm then using separate virtual interface between the inside the torvm and the servicevm. 
yes the middlebox torvm should pretty much just have tor instance and properly configured iptables etc firewall ruleset. 
the tor instance will host the onion service. 
the overall picture looks like this enduser tor hops hidden service tor instance torvm the only traffic the servervm should seeing from the torvm inbound http requests assuming web server what were talking about. 
therefore the only legitimate traffic that the firewall rule the inside interface the torvm should have allow that interface are responses http requests. 
you could track state traffic leaving the torvm for the servervm and only allow established connections come back. 
you lock down this far literally nothing with syn bit should allowed out from the servervm. 
once you think its good you should least use nmap something similar make sure you cant get traffic out past the torvm. 
youll have have way manage the servervm you will need allow appropriate management traffic. 
your management happens over tor recommend least considering the use client authorization for hidden management services. 
that scenario your tor client needs hidservauth entry get the management onion address and the torvm will need host separate management onion address service with access controlled via the directive. 
was going build one xen disassemble qubes and steal much possible. 
they already solve most these problems theyre just doing from client perspective instead server one. 
have pending balance and pendin escrow. 
both orders from before the shutdown neither marked shipped before. 
one marked shipped after. 
the one marked shipped hasnt auto finalized and the one with the cancel option hasnt been automatically cancelled for now sticking the old escrow system until the goods arrive and the vendor isnt receiving funds even pending when people finalize want sure they have that worked out before otherwise balance now zero just the pending balance and pending escrow balance.

from cxm february ami would expect this post have advice buying your coins anonymous fashion. 
that order for leo convict you they need all the pieces the following person purchased btc with method same person then transfered said purchased btc and transferred for illegal purposes person was taken into custody with evidence the illegal activities. 
steps and are the ones most thought about and are dealt with coin washing and pgp encryption address among other things ensuring safe delivery. 
think this post should emphasize point and the options for buying btc here are mostly ones that can trace the purchase directly back individual. 
credit card bank account. 
endorse finding ways purchase the btc using cash transfer the most anonymous fashion possible. 
for instance have seen listings localbitcoin. 
com for cash the mail transfers however one must have high level trust said vendor for this viable option. 
another localbitcoin trick the other online payment optioin where you purchase something like greendot card cash grocery store convenience store and then upload images said card and reciept showing was purchased cash. 
you choose this option vital that you know the metadata the images you will sending not send images taken cell phone sure there accurate time location data retrievable from the image. 
this can accomplished through function tails you could upload the images imgur and then use those images for the transfer. 
since most vendors who work this way request image the receipt well highly suggest using pen marker remove all location time identification from the receirpt. 
fold hide the label the store you purchased from write over the letters and numbers that could used identifiable information. 
finally when you purchase the cash coin intermediary. 
vanilla reload card suggest you wear heavy clothing such that images your face can taken while you purchase the card. 
hoddie and sun glasses and something cover your chin gloves dont hurt either. 
also suggest you purchase cards from more than one location this makes more difficult isolate where the purchases are taking place. 
remember always act you are already compromised leo. 
extra step precautions would suggest parking your car little ways aways from the purchase location that cameras could get picture you entering your car and getting your license plate number. 
the only better way buy coin buy cash from friend yours with decent stock pile then there are traces whatsoever. 
this way leo ever does hit you with scenario being caught with evidence illegal activity they will not able add extra charges that would possible they can trace the purchase all the way back the purchase the btc. 
washing your coins important early and alot but there another step before washing the coins that can just important washing the coins and that anonymous purchase the coins. 
please anyone give feedback this post identify ways improve the anonymity purchasing coins anonymously. 
also you have some spare coin donate alfred. 
this site awesome and want stick around just much erowid. 
orgmost folks already realize that using bitcoin mixing service essential and recommended for security even you purchase bitcoin locally with cash. 
becoming more difficult purchase bitcoin without providing identity information which will taint your coins and make possible track the use back you keep separate bitcoin wallet for clean coins. 
send all your newly purchased bitcoin through bitcoin fog with delivery your clean wallet and you are good.

cyprus has long been attractive offshore financial hub. 
their economy based the finance sector and tourism but the gfc did come knockin unfortunately with the citizens left involuntarily foot the bill. 
bailout agreement reached with meant that the countrys second biggest bank froze accounts that the gov could take out the money from all uninsured accounts well other measures hostile the interests the people. 
this was the catalyst for bail bitcoin due people wanting protect their wealth from their own government. 
the bitcoin price shot drastically from highs before were all course. 
cyprus have long been well educated when comes finance surprise see many cypriots calling for cyprus become the worlds first bitcoin hub. 
they realize that there are huge advantages for the country that jumps first. 
the initial meteoric rise the price bitcoin that they would holding the time just one tantalizing prospect for country become hub for bitcoin would also huge win for bitcoin not just for the initial rise value there also the perceived legitimacy that comes with entire country getting behind. 
and once bitcoin has country and their banks heavily invested the exchange bitcoins for fiat will much easier there would host new exchanges popping out cyprus without the banking limits the current exchanges are plagued with. 
cyprus also has the first university accept bitcoin for fee payments and offer course cryptocurrency. 
recently the worlds first bitcoin bank was opened cyprus. 
this will help foster widespread adoption country where people are little more openminded when comes bitcoin.

think defcunt saw the coins vanishing and shutdown bitcoind. 
after this think realized his database was total mess and could not fix decided steal all the coins and blamed the hacker for everything. 
you havent noticed peoples balances are fucked and there are people who have pending balance. 
thats very good theory. 
were thinking the same thing but wanted post all our physical evidence first. 
but that good point because lot users including have had their entire wallet stolen after having nothing escrow. 
very possible that defon someone else behind the scene dpr stexo realised what was going with the hack knew that their coding was totally fucked since they cloned from. 
gox and just decided take the rest for themselves. 
there very strong possibility that that occured and our investigation will likely head that direction later. 
but for now want try and stay impartial hard that just providing the physical evidence have obtained far. 
people can decide for themselves. 
but that seems pretty good conclusion. 
have pending balance and pendin escrow. 
both orders from before the shutdown neither marked shipped before.

the one marked shipped hasnt auto finalized and the one with the cancel option hasnt been automatically cancelled for now sticking the old escrow system until the goods arrive and the vendor isnt receiving funds even pending when people finalize want sure they have that worked out before otherwise balance now zero just the pending balance and pending escrow balance.

just joined here. 
tried posting this forum but ended with karma couple hours. 
hopefully people will more receptive constructive here. 
love but some customers suck dick suggest using expresscoin cashforcoin. 
they offer several methods for acquiring coins one which sending usps money order. 
buy money order does not require and costs less than like for every money order. 
this means you can purchase several thousand dollars worth money orders different post offices very short period and keep returning them. 
benefits using money orders are that banks not see large transactions. 
you can take your money from selling and turn right into bitcoins. 
intermediary bank involved. 
also your name not the money order. 
now these sites require you send picture with the money order. 
this does not seem like the largest deal though. 
most resourceful people should able come with valid from several different people not themself. 
mean jesus just pay some junkies piece for pictures their and hour you will have ids. 
just take picture print that shit and mail off with your money order. 
you also need email them copy pictures and money order. 
wipe exif data and you are bueno. 
they will keep this file they are money transfer service but will never get that far. 
why you ask because you arent dumbass and you mixed your coins course fallbacks are necessary though. 
suggest tumbling mixing whatever twice before depositing into any market wallet. 
this redundancy will cost only very small percentage and the time you are done possible get money into your marketplace wallet for only more than market value quantities. 
here how this all looks expresscoin wallet mixing wallet mixing marketplacebad scenario they track coins wallet. 
worse scenario they track coins wallet. 
they track back wallet entirely your fault. 
but say this happens. 
now sees comes from expresscoin and subpoenas them. 
finds record with that isnt you but they will follow that person. 
what does this mean well for means lot work. 
they now need prove ownership each wallet the person whose. 
apocalypse scenario they are able prove ownership each wallet the same person. 
dont know how this apocalypse scenario would happen but not the most savvy person either. 
this happens the person whose could get visit from police but most likely not. 
say this point the person drops your name. 
certainly seems short grounds for warrant think they would probably knock and talk police stop without warrant try get you say something that grounds for warrant. 
police show your door. 
hey muttley have you linked illegal purchases online. 
need talk you about this downtown. 
sorry officer wouldnt know anything about that. 
sounds like some crazy shit though. 
hope you officers have good day. 
bye bye now. 
and that where ends. 
the only downside your person with the compromised you can never again use your own address receive anything and will need use someone catch packages for you from then. 
impossible get the level police ever showing you mix coins properly. 
there are sufficient number failsafes though for use this method with regularity and large amounts. 
certain steps need taken though prevent expresscoin similar services from getting suspicious though not order from multiple ids and send them all the same time from the same location. 
stagger few days possible. 
make sure the ids are not all from the same location you live small town. 
orders for two thousand bucks piece within week from the middle kansas will raise eyebrows. 
vary amounts slightly. 
time think this isnt huge deal. 
any input suggestions. 
would expect this post have advice buying your coins anonymous fashion.

think this post should emphasize point and the options for buying btc here are mostly ones that can trace the purchase directly back individual. 
credit card bank account. 
endorse finding ways purchase the btc using cash transfer the most anonymous fashion possible. 
for instance have seen listings localbitcoin. 
com for cash the mail transfers however one must have high level trust said vendor for this viable option. 
another localbitcoin trick the other online payment optioin where you purchase something like greendot card cash grocery store convenience store and then upload images said card and reciept showing was purchased cash. 
you choose this option vital that you know the metadata the images you will sending not send images taken cell phone sure there accurate time location data retrievable from the image. 
this can accomplished through function tails you could upload the images imgur and then use those images for the transfer. 
since most vendors who work this way request image the receipt well highly suggest using pen marker remove all location time identification from the receirpt. 
fold hide the label the store you purchased from write over the letters and numbers that could used identifiable information. 
finally when you purchase the cash coin intermediary. 
vanilla reload card suggest you wear heavy clothing such that images your face can taken while you purchase the card. 
hoddie and sun glasses and something cover your chin gloves dont hurt either. 
also suggest you purchase cards from more than one location this makes more difficult isolate where the purchases are taking place. 
remember always act you are already compromised leo. 
extra step precautions would suggest parking your car little ways aways from the purchase location that cameras could get picture you entering your car and getting your license plate number. 
the only better way buy coin buy cash from friend yours with decent stock pile then there are traces whatsoever. 
this way leo ever does hit you with scenario being caught with evidence illegal activity they will not able add extra charges that would possible they can trace the purchase all the way back the purchase the btc. 
washing your coins important early and alot but there another step before washing the coins that can just important washing the coins and that anonymous purchase the coins. 
please anyone give feedback this post identify ways improve the anonymity purchasing coins anonymously. 
also you have some spare coin donate alfred.

from cicada february pmplease elaborate the hypervisor use case possible references detailed example documentation most appreciated. 
safe assume the torvm comprised barebones installation with iptables dropping everything but tor traffic dont know off the shelf play play set documentation for virtual isolation hidden services. 
the simplest method probably using whonix gateway and servicevm either whonix workstation bare install linux bsd behind all running under virtualbox. 
probably the best method would involve configuring xen using not hvm theres less attack surface the hypervisor provide bridge interface from the ethernet adapter the outside virtual interface thetorvm then using separate virtual interface between the inside the torvm and the servicevm. 
yes the middlebox torvm should pretty much just have tor instance and properly configured iptables etc firewall ruleset. 
the tor instance will host the onion service. 
the overall picture looks like this enduser tor hops hidden service tor instance torvm the only traffic the servervm should seeing from the torvm inbound http requests assuming web server what were talking about. 
therefore the only legitimate traffic that the firewall rule the inside interface the torvm should have allow that interface are responses http requests. 
you could track state traffic leaving the torvm for the servervm and only allow established connections come back. 
you lock down this far literally nothing with syn bit should allowed out from the servervm. 
once you think its good you should least use nmap something similar make sure you cant get traffic out past the torvm. 
youll have have way manage the servervm you will need allow appropriate management traffic. 
your management happens over tor recommend least considering the use client authorization for hidden management services. 
that scenario your tor client needs hidservauth entry get the management onion address and the torvm will need host separate management onion address service with access controlled via the directive. 
was going build one xen disassemble qubes and steal much possible. 
they already solve most these problems theyre just doing from client perspective instead server one.

from angel eyes february xsposer can you explain how you identified particular bitcoin wallet from the transactions just curious because though the only way tell addresses belonged single wallet was tracing movements coins aggregated from set addresses. 
was team effort largely lead the bbmc and the btva. 
they had the funds the knowledge and the ability study the taint analysis and follow fragments btc they were firing known wallets importance. 
following these coins lead the wallet above which has been transferring steady stream btc every few hours since dec. 
further investigation has revealed that this fact the hackers wallet likely the former dev pritel although still unclear what role defcon stexo and libertas had all this. 
here the updated stolen wallet thread including all bbmcs evidence and redacted dox the suspect hacker former developer pritel. 
msg msg that dox info along with the info bbmc supplied makes this saga pretty conclusive. 
the only questions left what part the scam did defcon stexo libertas play and also who this narco because defcon still calling for his head yet hearing its dropshipper account very strange. 
something site wallet asked support and the told becasue its below the minimum.

from ronin february pmquote from ueoc february pmwhy everybody making this complicated make sure you guys visit these clearnet site before continuing. 
they have free open sourced software that facilitates multi signature transaction. 
comalso theres great article deepdotweb with mini tutorial how its done. 
com bitrated bitcoin arbitration marketplace like the coinb. 
way allows for more flexibility. 
the first thing must all agree the correct terminology. 
multi signature transaction outlined bitcoin improvement protocol not escrow. 
when using multi sig point does anybody have the ability run off with the funds. 
multi sig more like lock that takes predetermined number keys unlock and have access the funds. 
most cases this done using multi sig transaction. 
its really very simple and anyone should able figure out. 
javascript required too much effort verify the script each and everytime you use. 
well yea but the application designed for you use locally your own machine. 
right click save page etc. 
you also imply that javascript bad but recommend using electrum bitcoind too much effort like saying its too much effort use pgp its never too much effort verify your funds but were glad you didnt imply that there arent free open sourced solutions available. 
from blackstar february yea partial escrow excellent option give vedors the piece mind that they wont lose their ass escrow hack happens. 
bsm has gretly impressed over the last few months. 
and juelz you are running that ship blackstallion thanks you. 
that what partial escrow for finalized order recently and was bewildered this novel option. 
its not for buyer after receiving product release some the funds and possiby dispute the rest its that right after placing order can release some the funds the vendor with intent release the remainder delivery. 
thats cool shit love this.

they have free open sourced software that facilitates multi signature transaction. 
comalso theres great article deepdotweb with mini tutorial how its done. 
com bitrated bitcoin arbitration marketplace like the coinb. 
way allows for more flexibility. 
the first thing must all agree the correct terminology. 
multi signature transaction outlined bitcoin improvement protocol not escrow. 
when using multi sig point does anybody have the ability run off with the funds. 
multi sig more like lock that takes predetermined number keys unlock and have access the funds. 
most cases this done using multi sig transaction. 
its really very simple and anyone should able figure out. 
javascript required too much effort verify the script each and everytime you use. 
well yea but the application designed for you use locally your own machine. 
right click save page etc. 
you also imply that javascript bad but recommend using electrum bitcoind too much effort like saying its too much effort use pgp its never too much effort verify your funds but were glad you didnt imply that there arent free open sourced solutions available.

yeah that prague dude. 
further investigation has revealed that this fact the hackers wallet likely the former dev pritel know that has the money did the heist made. 
gox loose million usd you want know how did this read the following fits well you mentioned oracle whats with his post where stated that has found out who did and how was able mods please not delete this don give fuck about anti policies and worked very hard paid out pocket and have open myself exposure put this thieving fuck blasteveryone else and take screen shot immediately incase this gets taken down censored real name censored czech republic hey censored hows feel reading this panicky won ask you enter dialogue censored but going insist you contact defcon one the moderators and arrange pay back the money. 
ask them for address and magic the funds show you probably live out the rest your life relatively healthy. 
there people who money you taken who will probably make you wish you were hell. 
understood censored fuck you and your ratfuck thievery. 
going keep this short. 
stexo had given laundering advice some czechs during who were also shopping around code they claimed have breached obtained from gox and btc. 
don know they legitimate devs just malicious fucks and irrelevant this point. 
initial back end and engine was coded one these guys contract censored. 
libby had thought would useful farm out some the initial development one the czech devs and asked fucking stexo make introduction. 
lib introduced censored defcon october and did whatever initial development was paid for. 
before the site went live his contract was and defcon and party took control the admin stuff. 
most likely this the reason for the initial spotty site access the initial days def just didn understand lot the code and kept fucking around with. 
very reliable source has confirmed unequivocally that censored censored has been bragging that hit bitstamp and gox with ddos flooded them with mutated transactions and even made fortune. 
czech former contractor used the transaction malleability media hoopla which can not used steal coins cloak break and steal. 
his initial development work probably worked advantage kept clone the security methods don know but censored now thousands btc richer then was week ago. 
libertas should not have recommended this piece shit solely because they were previous clients stexo. 
and stexo not authority developers computer security just because once advised him and his merry band czech bottom feeders how launder their btc. 
all this initial incompetence brings hack heist millions dollars. 
fucking believable and fucking acceptable.

how you feel buddy didn expect this huh anybody prague around this area. 
can advise you what but. 
use your imagination. 
oracle they said that only the admins have access the escrow wallet only they couldve done. 
but their behaviour after that theft doesnt fit scammers one. 
they wouldve vanished would abandoned and they wouldve taken all funds from every wallet connected. 
and payback plan the last thing thief does. 
but they didnt fit suspects who does and how did get access the system they needed coder for security features and hired this czech someone who has atleast slightly criminal mind otherwise wouldnt coding anything for drug marketplace. 
coded what was asked for certainly has the source code from part srs security features couldve coded backdoor atleast some attackable code.

yes perhaps ive gone around the bend and not claiming that any this true but wanted share thoughts and see what you think. 
all really just goddamned scam very very interesting. 
wish could give you you definately deserve. 
weve also noticed the similarities certain major accounts. 
and even have screenshots some posts which show obvious correlation writing styles between the main players. 
but wanted restrain from adding own speculations this saga not bias any the impartial evidence have posted above. 
that being said. 
will comment the hiniguel situation just clear things many people have been asking this forum and others and have been kind skeptical answer. 
but what can say this much respect hiniguel for his monetary help the community and extent his forum moderation will say that provided helpful information whatsoever regarding this whole investigation. 
has obviously been helping the community lot ways and defcon stealth clu have all agreed. 
not mention other members personally know have confirmed that hes helped them out. 
but every reply did receive not many was extremely vague and absent fact even when presented evidence him and simply asked for his input. 
initially put this down his busy schedule because that point had already offered his millions help out the community was geting bombarded with emails pms. 
but weeks after the fact have still received nothing significance from him which weird because got personal thankyou from defcon and team for his investigative help again respect hiniguel for his help the community but dispite our best efforts has not contribted this investigation. 
where bbmc btva and extent oracle went above and beyond their requirements and were more than professional their cooperation. 
oracle providing some very interesting speculation about account sharing similar what suspects above the thought that this whole operation could man show while not that outragous unless ive been too late and have gone round the bend with you lol not consistant with our findings. 
seems more likely couple very experienced old school players acting together operating vendors mods admin vocal forum members. 
will try and clear the whos who all this some point but whatever outcome arrive will obviosly speculation based evidence course but none the less speculation. 
but can state that evident that dpr stexo hux are the same. 
more come later. 
also pointed out there are more familliar faces. 
this clear sign that something isnt right. 
when all the original and experienced members clear out and leave nothing but tumbleweed and kiss ass noobs its time leave aswell. 
have made several buys and money went very fast. 
shrugthere the refresh buttons which makes the money show. 
further investigation has revealed that this fact the hackers wallet likely the former dev pritel know that has the money did the heist made. 
gox loose million usd you want know how did this read the following fits well you mentioned oracle whats with his post where stated that has found out who did and how was able mods please not delete this don give fuck about anti policies and worked very hard paid out pocket and have open myself exposure put this thieving fuck blasteveryone else and take screen shot immediately incase this gets taken down censored real name censored czech republic hey censored hows feel reading this panicky won ask you enter dialogue censored but going insist you contact defcon one the moderators and arrange pay back the money. 
ask them for address and magic the funds show you probably live out the rest your life relatively healthy. 
there people who money you taken who will probably make you wish you were hell. 
understood censored fuck you and your ratfuck thievery. 
going keep this short. 
stexo had given laundering advice some czechs during who were also shopping around code they claimed have breached obtained from gox and btc. 
don know they legitimate devs just malicious fucks and irrelevant this point. 
initial back end and engine was coded one these guys contract censored. 
libby had thought would useful farm out some the initial development one the czech devs and asked fucking stexo make introduction. 
lib introduced censored defcon october and did whatever initial development was paid for. 
before the site went live his contract was and defcon and party took control the admin stuff. 
most likely this the reason for the initial spotty site access the initial days def just didn understand lot the code and kept fucking around with. 
very reliable source has confirmed unequivocally that censored censored has been bragging that hit bitstamp and gox with ddos flooded them with mutated transactions and even made fortune. 
czech former contractor used the transaction malleability media hoopla which can not used steal coins cloak break and steal. 
his initial development work probably worked advantage kept clone the security methods don know but censored now thousands btc richer then was week ago. 
libertas should not have recommended this piece shit solely because they were previous clients stexo. 
and stexo not authority developers computer security just because once advised him and his merry band czech bottom feeders how launder their btc. 
all this initial incompetence brings hack heist millions dollars. 
fucking believable and fucking acceptable. 
tried best present much facts could obtain and believe have spent own time energy and funds getting this information and putting the pieces together. 
this post deleted will repost from different accounts every hour every day nauseum. 
how you feel buddy didn expect this huh anybody prague around this area. 
can advise you what but. 
use your imagination. 
oracle they said that only the admins have access the escrow wallet only they couldve done. 
but their behaviour after that theft doesnt fit scammers one. 
they wouldve vanished would abandoned and they wouldve taken all funds from every wallet connected. 
and payback plan the last thing thief does. 
but they didnt fit suspects who does and how did get access the system they needed coder for security features and hired this czech someone who has atleast slightly criminal mind otherwise wouldnt coding anything for drug marketplace. 
coded what was asked for certainly has the source code from part srs security features couldve coded backdoor atleast some attackable code. 
with the source code knowledge about possible weak spots the security system and the mutant transaction method was able get access the funds the escrow wallet. 
used the mutant transaction bug the bitcoin protocol attack. 
choosed the far biggest and less used wallet. 
gox the coldest wallet. 
this bug inside the bitcoin protocol made possible double spend bitcoins. 
you cant course doubel spend something that exists just once. 
gox raised shortage million usd over time. 
was able create high damage. 
gox but was not able steal from them. 
cant verify oracles statements but they link all those similar attacks even explained where the money went how did etc. 
aslong there better explanation with this. 
the czech did. 
from february pmquote from sunwu february amquote from red february amsunwu dont think just speculation. 
you have the leaders thier industry making statement public regarding thembeing insolvent read their corporate plan looks very legit. 
com doc mtgox situation crisis strategy drafti agree very much looks that way that crisis draft shows signs authenticity all though with regard mtgox being liable under law for the bitcoins. 
its very new subject sure might possible reclaim some which will undoubtedly take very long time more likely they will declare sorry derail but where might find you vending others see sunwu has not logged for bit anyone can answer this would think you very kind indeed.

defcon stole the money and sold defcon defcon woman she not programmer. 
programmer has been stealing from since opened with missing coin and negative balance tricks. 
defcon fired programmer locked him out sight when she discovered the thefts. 
defcon was pissed his programmer was fired hasnt given defcon the keys promised. 
defcon created new key but hasnt used public. 
defcon trying find programmers she can trust close the backdoors programmer put the sight. 
programmer trying get rehired under new can steal morethere are programmers working the sight now. 
from ktvstudio march amcan anyone explain what happen before the. 
million usd heist your speaking from december what happend back then took break after the seizure and returned few days ago. 
you look the btc transfer dates the stolen wallet above you can see that hack scam actually started mid december. 
steady stream btc were being systematically transferred from the suspect wallet above every few hours every day. 
the hack scam was going for long time before defcon figured out decided announced being the incompetent thief that from honeyray march amthat the most believable all the options surprised that bigger deal hasnt been made. 
now pretty conclusive that aka pritel was largely involved this but are unsure acted alone. 
but have posted all the evidence have including all the data provided the bbmc and btva along with oracles dox pritel this thread here. 
must say that all the evidence seen together with oracles dox paints pretty compelling picture. 
and doesnt look good for pritel. 
although think stexo and dpr might have played bigger role this than previously suspected. 
will try update both threads equally future. 
thanks for this one. 
didnt snowden say all pgp software was backdoored the nsa saw the news that criminals and terrorists use mmorpg games communicate and carry out illegal transactions with the game money.

feel obligated post this here javascript cryptography considered harmful. 
com articles javascript cryptography and course rebuttal thoughts critiques javascript cryptography. 
this why dislike solutions like coinb. 
yes they are attractive cross platform solution help out people with issues with crypto programs not working. 
have personally read through the entire electrum codebase the best ability know that there are obvious backdoors. 
cannot say the same for that site altho think its likely not any way malicious. 
could poorly implemented however. 
think better solution may implement mozilla compatable javascript add. 
this would able vetted and verified and work across large number systems. 
org webcryptoapi standardized and implemented would make much much easier this task well. 
perhaps one these days will work such task. 
from ueoc march pmjavascript required. 
well yea but the application designed for you use locally your own machine. 
right click save page etc. 
you also imply that javascript bad but recommend using electrum bitcoind too much effort like saying its too much effort use pgp its never too much effort verify your funds but were glad you didnt imply that there arent free open sourced solutions availablei walked away soon saw. 
will test more secure machine later. 
works then great leaving aside the issues raised owockeznans links. 
probably being dense but dont really get your point here you also imply that javascript bad but recommend using electrum bitcoind imply very common attack vector used against people. 
not sure what that has with electrum bitcoind. 
pretty lame wait that long actually make that statement nothing worry about working filing for bankruptcy. 
multibit works for. 
how about you. 
nope but hangn. 
but longer drink the green camel yep pending bal paid mar. 
thank you for these helpful responses. 
confess looked mailtor based upon only one thing the recommendation nightcrawler forums. 
since then nightcrawler who seemed security tech guru most knowledgeable and helpful has abruptly disappeared. 
which may mean something may mean nothing.

surely there way this could work.

like said would work. 
but who would download even with limewire you have legal uses with file sharingbut for the market its sole use would use market that sells drugs. 
who would take the risk load this onto their computer could develop and doesnt matter how much customers would trust would advise them not trust someone much hahawell people use the idea people arent stupid enough use obviously false. 
but youre talking about the possibility contains virus guess would have trusted just like the markets are trusted not rob everyone.

understand correctly gox have been letting coins out the hackers over many years this will have caused inflation the actual btc circulation would the surface things those coins stolen will have undoubtedly been sold other exchanges bringing the prices down does this mean now see those coins are gone the long run there actually much less coins circulation that people first perceived.

torescrow planning huge theft all vendors bitcoins. 
they have been very shady from the very beginning. 
they ban anyone who even mentions finalizing early anywhere. 
they will ban you from their market their forum and their subreddit and then post lies about you try discredit you. 
many people have asked some very serious and very innocent questions about. 
torescrow gives bullshit excuses about protecting cutomers how are customers protected the option them. 
then they quietly censor their forums and subreddits. 
lots things being deleted. 
very shady market. 
way too insistent using their non multi sig escrow. 
this not safe market. 
have reputation all markets and never made single transaction torescrow. 
and yet torescrow trying paint scammer their reason for banning from forum subreddit and market. 
when reality only because asked too many questions about their market and pointed out some very curious behavior from their admins. 
stay away from torescrow can see you are already they also pay oldmandrugs act user and promote them all over the internet. 
also some sort informant for them pointing out anyone that tries tell the truth about torescrow they can banned. 
have gotten word recently that bsm close being done testing and releasing hedge option for vendors purchase. 
think with the btc fluctuation bsm will one very few.

thats cool shit love this.

what know that the best functioning market have ever used. 
pgp depends the generated keys random. 
they arent random its simple pie for someone decrypt your shit. 
opensourse the only way like mirage said. 
feel obligated post this here javascript cryptography considered harmful. 
com articles javascript cryptography and course rebuttal thoughts critiques javascript cryptography. 
this why dislike solutions like coinb. 
yes they are attractive cross platform solution help out people with issues with crypto programs not working. 
have personally read through the entire electrum codebase the best ability know that there are obvious backdoors. 
cannot say the same for that site altho think its likely not any way malicious. 
could poorly implemented however. 
think better solution may implement mozilla compatable javascript add. 
this would able vetted and verified and work across large number systems. 
org webcryptoapi standardized and implemented would make much much easier this task well. 
perhaps one these days will work such task. 
from ueoc march pmjavascript required. 
well yea but the application designed for you use locally your own machine. 
right click save page etc. 
you also imply that javascript bad but recommend using electrum bitcoind too much effort like saying its too much effort use pgp its never too much effort verify your funds but were glad you didnt imply that there arent free open sourced solutions availablei walked away soon saw. 
will test more secure machine later. 
works then great leaving aside the issues raised owockeznans links. 
probably being dense but dont really get your point here you also imply that javascript bad but recommend using electrum bitcoind imply very common attack vector used against people. 
not sure what that has with electrum bitcoind.

saying the nsa has cracked pgp may help them people dont bother use use something else that can cracked. 
its bit odd but why not. 
also tell the public that the nsa having diffculty with tor you keep using and they can gather intel. 
tor was developed the navy. 
that doesnt throw big red flag dont know what will. 
open source the way you can peer reviewed and not trust xyz the right thing. 
just look the enigma code and the fact that facilities like cern exist not long shot super power has vast amounts computer power available them. 
you encrypt with xyz sure the nsa kgb and whatever chinas intel agency dept can decrypt quite easily. 
really doubt its beyond them. 
doubt anything available the public and has been for some time hasnt been cracked various intel agencies.

from mycarneedstint march pmeither way scam. 
new owners not. 
why bother anymore cut your losses. 
learn hard lesson and move. 
not return indeed. 
the current scenario follows when buyer builds order and hits proceed with order post which theyre taken page where they see the breakdown the fees shipping total order price and then they enter their address which gets encrypted for the vendor. 
right here where the proposed changes would implemented the buyer will then need enter public key their portion the multi sig transaction. 
the vendor would have choice enter multiple public keys advance otherwise theyll asked enter one after receiving the order when they choose finalize early escrow during the process sale. 
once the vendor has provided public key the public key will automatically generated and the final multisig address and the trasaction details will sent everyone the address the amount that needs sent the redeemscript they can verify encodes all the correct details double check regardless whether the payment finalize early escrow the will then poll blockchain. 
info for payments that address. 
once the full amount paid then the order marked paid all users are messaged link page that shows the generated transaction paying the vendor the full amount minus the fees raw transaction spending all the transactions sent the multisg address and sent the vendor one output. 
everyone will shown the transaction paying the vendor. 
the buyer for some reason choses raise dispute then all involved users will start multi party discussion the order and the admin will then generate new transaction based the outcome the the dispute will pay both either parties the appropriate amount for the order. 
but all successful with the order which should most the time then one the buyer will sign the transaction and paste the partially signed transaction. 
after which the user party will then sign the transaction and broadcast where will identified when makes into the blockchain network via the blockchain api. 
break down the vendor and buyer both have supply their public keys for that transaction either advance when their action needed during order this would involve entering address selecting escrow. 
they need add the multisig address their client using bitcoinqt using one command and then sign using another. 
they can also verify the redeemscript transaction hex that the details are correct using their client else online using. 
inso buyers vendors will need enter their public keys manually advance. 
they can generate them their browsers using. 
multisig though will suggesting people download offline copy this site codes because means once funds are sent the multisig address the two users can add the signature transactions the browser without having use any other desktop client. 
its really that simple folks could use. 
organyway having users supplying them the browser probably the best thing until bip supported most clients which currently not bitcoin and electrum are definitely going use bip the foreseeable future thats for then. 
but thats another milestone long after multisig goes soon and will worked separate update. 
how does this sound does the process sound like something you folks can easily adapt think becomes pretty there are only actions the buyers vendors need. 
would one less step when automate key generation during registration. 
guess small inconvinience but thats small price pay for absolute security for all coins. 
more worrying about markets heists all transactions occur the blockchain and are only considered valid when broadcasted into blockchain. 
which means even the site run down attacker they simply cant run off with any coins. 
also there unexpected downtime the admin goes awol the buyer and vendor have their own public keys can try negotiate another channel sort out their funds themselves. 
now all goes good with the last few implementation tests should have this implemented another week two and see things work out. 
hello our market now available english german and french language. 
this conversation few weeks old but think needs revisiting since nonsensical. 
most obviously signing new identity with old one the suggests renders the change useless. 
you have linked the two proving continuity character important concept this anonymous world. 
perhaps the only people buyers can place some trust are the vendors who supply them with goods and services. 
finding acceptable vendor can take many tries and involves the greatest exposure the entire process. 
sending your name and address multiple strangers hopes inconspicuous package arriving risky. 
finding vendor you trust whatever extent valuable and convienent. 
the aim changing identities would break continuity character and distance ones self from past transactions. 
thus reputation must built from the ground frusturating buyers and the seller. 
the utility minimal. 
sizeable operation will matter weeks have shipped enough drugs put them jail for life just the same operation that has been continuous for years. 
unless seller changes identity near monthly basis and disregards reputation and customer loyalty alltogether business suicide changing keys useless. 
barring any material comprimise security venders have their best interest maintain continuity character for years. 
locked out too just placed order too est.

well the conspiracy theorists keep banging about the nwo illumanti etc and the one world currency. 
weve already seen the shortcommings gold gold backed fiat fiat. 
the world reserve currency the usd and well thats only backed trust and opec already tried and failed switch the euro. 
could bitcoin the world currency its interesting that governments the world have not outright banned yet and just see another commodity. 
bitcoin veiled way get them their own world currency and then sell chip put your body you have the most secure method store bitcoin wallet youd use rfid communicate with the chip. 
makes you think tho your finances could drained etc unscruplous parties. 
guess can only hope that the cts hack the chip and publish that its not trusted. 
and their results can easily repeated. 
the end near once google paypal etc legitmise bitcoin for the mainstream the wider majority are happy give their liberties for facebook and google gmail why not put rfid bitcoin wallet your body.

well the conspiracy theorists keep banging about the nwo illumanti etc and the one world currency. 
weve already seen the shortcommings gold gold backed fiat fiat. 
the world reserve currency the usd and well thats only backed trust and opec already tried and failed switch the euro. 
could bitcoin the world currency its interesting that governments the world have not outright banned yet and just see another commodity. 
bitcoin veiled way get them their own world currency and then sell chip put your body you have the most secure method store bitcoin wallet youd use rfid communicate with the chip. 
makes you think tho your finances could drained etc unscruplous parties. 
guess can only hope that the cts hack the chip and publish that its not trusted. 
and their results can easily repeated. 
the end near once google paypal etc legitmise bitcoin for the mainstream the wider majority are happy give their liberties for facebook and google gmail why not put rfid bitcoin wallet your body. 
just cents guess. 
even though have nfi joing the dots with crazy conspiracy theories.

cool thanks for the info. 
wonder the buyers option blue sky lock order the current bitcoin rate could also hedged for example btc place and order and lock and the time deposit btc theyre worth. 
assuming the vendor only gets the rate with hedging that word beginning when the btc are escrowed. 
the current scenario follows when buyer builds order and hits proceed with order post which theyre taken page where they see the breakdown the fees shipping total order price and then they enter their address which gets encrypted for the vendor. 
right here where the proposed changes would implemented the buyer will then need enter public key their portion the multi sig transaction. 
the vendor would have choice enter multiple public keys advance otherwise theyll asked enter one after receiving the order when they choose finalize early escrow during the process sale. 
once the vendor has provided public key the public key will automatically generated and the final multisig address and the trasaction details will sent everyone the address the amount that needs sent the redeemscript they can verify encodes all the correct details double check regardless whether the payment finalize early escrow the will then poll blockchain. 
info for payments that address. 
once the full amount paid then the order marked paid all users are messaged link page that shows the generated transaction paying the vendor the full amount minus the fees raw transaction spending all the transactions sent the multisg address and sent the vendor one output. 
everyone will shown the transaction paying the vendor. 
the buyer for some reason choses raise dispute then all involved users will start multi party discussion the order and the admin will then generate new transaction based the outcome the the dispute will pay both either parties the appropriate amount for the order. 
but all successful with the order which should most the time then one the buyer will sign the transaction and paste the partially signed transaction. 
after which the user party will then sign the transaction and broadcast where will identified when makes into the blockchain network via the blockchain api. 
break down the vendor and buyer both have supply their public keys for that transaction either advance when their action needed during order this would involve entering address selecting escrow. 
they need add the multisig address their client using bitcoinqt using one command and then sign using another. 
they can also verify the redeemscript transaction hex that the details are correct using their client else online using. 
inso buyers vendors will need enter their public keys manually advance. 
they can generate them their browsers using. 
multisig though will suggesting people download offline copy this site codes because means once funds are sent the multisig address the two users can add the signature transactions the browser without having use any other desktop client. 
its really that simple folks could use. 
organyway having users supplying them the browser probably the best thing until bip supported most clients which currently not bitcoin and electrum are definitely going use bip the foreseeable future thats for then. 
but thats another milestone long after multisig goes soon and will worked separate update. 
how does this sound does the process sound like something you folks can easily adapt think becomes pretty there are only actions the buyers vendors need. 
would one less step when automate key generation during registration. 
guess small inconvinience but thats small price pay for absolute security for all coins. 
more worrying about markets heists all transactions occur the blockchain and are only considered valid when broadcasted into blockchain. 
which means even the site run down attacker they simply cant run off with any coins. 
also there unexpected downtime the admin goes awol the buyer and vendor have their own public keys can try negotiate another channel sort out their funds themselves. 
now all goes good with the last few implementation tests should have this implemented another week two and see things work out. 
haven't seen this before but like lot. 
thanks for the link.

from blackstar march amquote from damiel march pmquote from blackstar february yea partial escrow excellent option give vedors the piece mind that they wont lose their ass escrow hack happens. 
bsm has gretly impressed over the last few months. 
and juelz you are running that ship blackstallion thanks you. 
that what partial escrow for finalized order recently and was bewildered this novel option. 
its not for buyer after receiving product release some the funds and possiby dispute the rest its that right after placing order can release some the funds the vendor with intent release the remainder delivery. 
thats cool shit love this. 
there bluesky guide anywhere cheers allhaha yea well guess you could release some then try the product and release the rest. 
but think its more for the sake making vendors and buyers comfortable and not require complete like lots other sites. 
the support bsm has recently told that they will chirp from time time the hub needed but will remain independent any forum identities for the most part. 
but that may change they grow who knows. 
what know that the best functioning market have ever used. 
thanks appreciate the explanation. 
wonder some vendors will require partial blue sky market buyer firmly entrenched the never ever ever camp. 
but given the inherent risks vendors escrow based markets can see partial policy pretty fair for everyone.

welcome jor please. 
verified the hub. 
fact youre idiot for using begin with. 
any one else having problems getting pandora. 
just transferred over coins too. 
think the kgb would manage what snowden releases the public. 
saying the nsa has cracked pgp may help them people dont bother use use something else that can cracked. 
its bit odd but why not. 
also tell the public that the nsa having diffculty with tor you keep using and they can gather intel. 
tor was developed the navy. 
that doesnt throw big red flag dont know what will. 
open source the way you can peer reviewed and not trust xyz the right thing. 
just look the enigma code and the fact that facilities like cern exist not long shot super power has vast amounts computer power available them. 
you encrypt with xyz sure the nsa kgb and whatever chinas intel agency dept can decrypt quite easily. 
really doubt its beyond them. 
doubt anything available the public and has been for some time hasnt been cracked various intel agencies. 
you are truely paranoid use temp. 
and use the best level pgp your message. 
you cant just install truecrypt the and create encrypted file are you trying whole disk encryption dont think that will work. 
make sure you are trying this with truecrypt for not truecrypt for osx. 
what ever happened ddw last checked the site was also there updated list all markets. 
dont know was yesterday the day before but seemed like every time tried was. 
was trying links for lists markets pgp guides bunch things. 
could access anything all day. 
looked your subreddit see there was any news but none. 
from deepdotweb march amfirst time hear this.

same shit have been getting for days. 
you blocking exit nodes something. 
comto change this page upload new index. 
html your private html folder. 
this conversation few weeks old but think needs revisiting since nonsensical. 
most obviously signing new identity with old one the suggests renders the change useless. 
you have linked the two proving continuity character important concept this anonymous world. 
perhaps the only people buyers can place some trust are the vendors who supply them with goods and services. 
finding acceptable vendor can take many tries and involves the greatest exposure the entire process. 
sending your name and address multiple strangers hopes inconspicuous package arriving risky. 
finding vendor you trust whatever extent valuable and convienent. 
the aim changing identities would break continuity character and distance ones self from past transactions. 
thus reputation must built from the ground frusturating buyers and the seller. 
the utility minimal. 
sizeable operation will matter weeks have shipped enough drugs put them jail for life just the same operation that has been continuous for years. 
unless seller changes identity near monthly basis and disregards reputation and customer loyalty alltogether business suicide changing keys useless. 
barring any material comprimise security venders have their best interest maintain continuity character for years. 
had started this thread before and its gone now. 
anyway heres link again. 
php register party. 
what batcomputer cant even figure this shit out dude. 
make more sense. 
looks like some graphic from dhs webinar like how identify cyber terrorists. 
these desperate people hide behind the anonymity their computers and plot acts lunatic violence that threaten peace justice and the american way. 
they must stopped for our childrens sake think better logo would something bit more aquarian they say tank girl. 
like some nice geometry something. 
pandora down wont load for. 
believe not the nsa definitely data mining the blockchain and using connect your called anonymity you. 
perhaps could that they are worried about being able use sets repeated data for user able crack your private key.

its not for buyer after receiving product release some the funds and possiby dispute the rest its that right after placing order can release some the funds the vendor with intent release the remainder delivery. 
thats cool shit love this.

when you step back and look the vendor should the one you trust you are ingesting his drugs you better have some sort trust about the person.

when you step back and look the vendor should the one you trust you are ingesting his drugs you better have some sort trust about the person. 
the site hosting the escrow the same shadowy figure you have never met any vendor. 
but the difference that you can build trusting working relationship with vendor and narrow down the risks substantially where with escrow host you simply cannot.

and equally sure that lim knows least some the current administration. 
suspect they all met uni but thats another story altogether. 
whats more sure that everybody involved going sing when not they get picked. 
and youre likely see the scammers getting reduced sentences while the useful idiots for decades because they have nothing useful trade and nobody sell out. 
compromised admins should pack toothbrushes and lubricant everyone else should stay away.

good know support knows what they are talking about proof will the pudding. 
sure many others will say just patient. 
just the other day had rather large withdrawl say was finished hours ago but none the addresses even showed the blockchian. 
few hours later there they were. 
all else fails contact their support but would wait atleast day two before. 
looks like its just major delays. 
deposited little over hours ago with nothing the fog. 
were running towards days attempted deposit fog action yet its complete via the chain had confirmations hrs ago. 
reply from support hrs. 
has anyoe seen worse hope fogs now. 
for some reason lately cannot get any obfs obfs bridges tor network work all tails bridge mode. 
ive collected alot bridge addresses boot tails bridge mode and enter them one time. 
from here the directions say they should allow access tor. 
but addresses are working and ive tried over. 
the strength tors anonynomity would increase greatly many more opsec minded interested people started hosting obfs bridges. 
looking into that too anyone has tips for that. 
whatever happened that shard you were hyped about. 
thought would log today. 
cannot log this account. 
sorry evolution market but you have sweet fuck all impress far. 
you are currently still the box marked yet another jonny come lately asshat market ran clowns hoping for quick coin. 
nice proved otherwise. 
what you guys think using sites like bitcoinfog. 
com and safepostage. 
com obscure your tracks not sure like the idea sending money bitcoinfog giving details shipments safepostage. 
com but people use them all the time just that each site has such great reputation that one questions their motives asked this the silk road forums but the thread was deleted for. 
discussing other marketplaces. 
has anyone used these sites any advice for dealing with them. 
sorry youve having trouble with evolution seems like otherwise very promising marketplace. 
hope you are able resolve your login issues far just perusing this topic and the evolution forums the administration seems highly responsive complaints and feedback and swift implement adjustments make for easier user experience. 
faced similar problem with registering then later being unable login agora. 
this really put damper our ability get back business soon possible after the clusterfuck most other markets were interested required vendor deposit fee which could not afford and agora one the few marketplaces that offered waiver the fee vendors difficult positions after taking one loss after another between smp etc. 
but have idea where direct our plea for assistance agora since cant log access the support system far can tell theres other way reach support. 
the only thing can think the agora staff the forums but imagine they are very busy and they explicitly state not the forum account regarding support issues. 
its quite frustrating knowing every day arent agora day that costing dearly but cant let our frustration get the way our need persevere plus our issue hardly reason condemn agora whole not that could really afford with the exposure stake. 
still think evolution seems promising. 
your services are definitely asset any marketplace community wish you better luck and hopefully well see you evolution sooner later. 
all longtime lurker here vendors may recognize handle bulk buyer. 
organization has longstanding issue that dont know how resolve. 
would like turn the community now see anyone has any insight our problem. 
any help even pointer the right direction would immensely appreciated. 
without getting into too much detail our operation decentralized the business end receiving and selling our product our clientele one part the. 
and the buying btc connecting with vendors and ordering the product various markets takes place another. 
sends cash deposits through teller transactions buys untraceable btc and places orders orders are shipped. 
some you may know under the bank secrecy act banks are required report transactions more than currency transaction report ctr. 
like avoid this. 
our orders are usually more than. 
thus hypothetical transaction get the money without triggering ctr even worse suspicious acitivy report sar generally involves depositing around into one account and into unrelated burn account that never use again. 
find friends the area that know burn their account once with big deposit collect the cash from them and never use their account again. 
the problem weve burned many accounts that are now having hard time finding people still able and willing. 
cant back accounts weve already burned because believe repeat the large cash deposits into the same account just under may trigger sar due structuring fears the bank. 
question there any way get around this that have not thought yet any and all comments questions are appreciated. 
let know what you guys think. 
thanks for the reply versace. 
thats something well definitely have look into. 
minimize risk with the burn accounts only ever using them once and the people use never know what its actually for. 
theres also trail from per since its anonymous cash deposit but youre right that complicates things and implicates other people perhaps unnecesarily. 
this happens quite often. 
itll time out and wont able load the site. 
usually just give few hours and try later and can always get back. 
the meantime appears that the balances have begun show. 
and not alone this according multiple other vendors received full pending balance and when withdrawing showed the blockchain seconds. 
well done those responsible. 
also there any way change vote these are steps the right direction. 
down for couldnt access yesterday either. 
from march amquote from march pmquote from february pmjust add this admin are preparing status update the situation over the next couple days which should add clarity the situation. 
keep eye the main board over the latter half the weekend. 
just looked over the boards and the latter half the weekend has passed. 
let guess something more important came and itll another few days trying really hard believe yall but youre making increasingly difficult. 
community minded person heart and will from time time step away from the background order gain perspective from community point view and develop empathy opposed just sympathy. 
such can not only assume but can also see for myself that the vivid lack information being promised but not followed indeed deep frustration. 
when said expect announcement meant because one was certainly planned without doubt. 
but for reasons beyond control this was pushed back further and probably the reason admin was reluctant state that announcement was its way the first place. 
took upon myself reassure people that announcement was due. 
that announcement still due and defcon working speak. 
but not want give revised expectation when will materialize for example should tell you that expected the announcement published this very day would only cause further disappointment should fail appear. 
also frustrated the amount time taking bring our community speed but have spoken defcon since the expected announcement date and progress still being made this front. 
vthank you for the response. 
the meantime appears that the balances have begun show. 
and not alone this according multiple other vendors received full pending balance and when withdrawing showed the blockchain seconds. 
well done those responsible. 
also there any way change vote these are steps the right direction. 
have started the mixer called bitcoin blender that you mentioned your post. 
have not seen anyone post any review yet though. 
hope will happen soon. 
posted this explanation how the mixer works another forum copy the same text here when you register account you get your own deposit address. 
deposit coins your address and you should see them incoming within one minute just refresh the deposit page. 
now you will see new button that was hidden before get new deposit address. 
soon you have deposited coins your current address you can get new one. 
after three network confirms the coins will added your balance and you can withdraw. 
coins will sent immediately there waiting time. 
the mixer uses coin control make sure send you other coins than the coins you deposited. 
keeps track all your old deposited coins and will not send you. 
the test send button will through and select coins just like when doing normal withdraw but instead get back you with answer there are enough coins the mixer not. 
you deposited large amount coins and you get negative response test send what you can leave the coins the mixer let mix with other users and withdraw small amount every day different addresses each time. 
you still want withdraw just normal send and will. 
the automatic withdraw feature like coinkites auto forwarding will automatically send coins the address you set your automatic withdraw address whenever coins are deposited your account. 
will however not automatically send coins there not enough coins the mixer but will keep trying until there. 
override this just log and turn off the automatic withdraw and will immediately send you the coins even means you will receive parts your own old deposited coins. 
down for too eastern time. 
intermittent sever over load best guess. 
its been happening every few days round the peak times during the day and evening. 
just patient and try again after you wait mins. 
usually you will get after few refreshes. 
yep ships from canada and you have sign for. 
hands down the best vendor anywhere. 
shows everytime like clockwork. 
tracking provided through pgp. 
best dope anywhere. 
what more could you ask for. 
did say fast shipping. 
once through customs days your house. 
should keep this shit myself but word going get out with top notch vendor like this. 
wide selection choose from too. 
this happens quite often. 
itll time out and wont able load the site. 
usually just give few hours and try later and can always get back. 
lot new users guess but worked fine today. 
what you guys think using sites like bitcoinfog. 
com and safepostage. 
com obscure your tracks not sure like the idea sending money bitcoinfog giving details shipments safepostage. 
com but people use them all the time just that each site has such great reputation that one questions their motives asked this the silk road forums but the thread was deleted for. 
discussing other marketplaces. 
has anyone used these sites any advice for dealing with them. 
sounds like you are complicating your operation and leaving massive paper trail that implicates many your friends and other people who know you the people whos accounts you are burning. 
these people could flip they are arrested and investigation all related transactions the bank could give the police valuable evidence about the size and scope your operation. 
have you considered stealthily packaging the money wash with isopropyl remove any drug residue other smell vacuum seal and then disguise inside something and then sending viamail through private courier with their fastest delivery option privete courier priority services virtually never lose packages you choose their more expensive insured delivery options. 
somethinggoes wrong you can only ever implicated single cash transferal through the mail not serious bank transactions that could lead extra charges. 
have moved very large sums money through the mail many occasions and never had single problem have even sent many sums cash. 
dogs cant smell and can behidden inside many objects many clever ways. 
never fuck around with banks when have the option working with cash bitcoins. 
the fog having delays and not showing any deposits that are showing completed the blockchain. 
hope its just simple delay. 
however were not feeling like donating any more until the problems are sorted out. 
the meantime what are some safe and viable alternative ive seen bitlaunder but heard bad things about them. 
also recently saw blurb forum about bitblender. 
anyone have any experience with this site blockchain. 
info seems having capcha issues cannot used. 
can anyone else suggest reliable mixing obscuring service love hear from other venders about some viable options for moving coins off markets. 
think that the fog will sort out but were not going risk any more our clients money until those funds appear. 
promise ship all our customers orders when they even the event site seizure theft etc. 
will honor that promise the end until the fog gets sorted how else can obscure btc movements off markets spamming well please under the bridge.

this happens quite often. 
itll time out and wont able load the site. 
usually just give few hours and try later and can always get back. 
the fog having delays and not showing any deposits that are showing completed the blockchain. 
hope its just simple delay. 
however were not feeling like donating any more until the problems are sorted out. 
the meantime what are some safe and viable alternative ive seen bitlaunder but heard bad things about them. 
also recently saw blurb forum about bitblender. 
anyone have any experience with this site blockchain. 
info seems having capcha issues cannot used. 
can anyone else suggest reliable mixing obscuring service love hear from other venders about some viable options for moving coins off markets. 
think that the fog will sort out but were not going risk any more our clients money until those funds appear. 
promise ship all our customers orders when they even the event site seizure theft etc. 
will honor that promise the end until the fog gets sorted how else can obscure btc movements off markets spamming well please under the bridge. 
grown folks trying business here. 
thank you advance for taking the time reply. 
down for too. 
any word the problem. 
just come over here see could find anything there doesnt seem anything agora forums. 
had trouble getting earlier this afternoon but after about half hour managed get. 
now wont load again. 
think this probably down lot traffic and hopefully nothing worry about. 
really like agora now and have started get settled. 
would such shame turned out like sheep did. 
lot new users guess but worked fine today. 
just managed log. 
the strength tors anonynomity would increase greatly many more opsec minded interested people started hosting obfs bridges. 
looking into that too anyone has tips for that. 
for some reason lately cannot get any obfs obfs bridges tor network work all tails bridge mode. 
ive collected alot bridge addresses boot tails bridge mode and enter them one time. 
from here the directions say they should allow access tor. 
but addresses are working and ive tried over.

business usual never doubted these guys. 
all longtime lurker here vendors may recognize handle bulk buyer. 
organization has longstanding issue that dont know how resolve. 
would like turn the community now see anyone has any insight our problem. 
any help even pointer the right direction would immensely appreciated. 
without getting into too much detail our operation decentralized the business end receiving and selling our product our clientele one part the. 
and the buying btc connecting with vendors and ordering the product various markets takes place another. 
sends cash deposits through teller transactions buys untraceable btc and places orders orders are shipped. 
some you may know under the bank secrecy act banks are required report transactions more than currency transaction report ctr. 
like avoid this. 
our orders are usually more than. 
thus hypothetical transaction get the money without triggering ctr even worse suspicious acitivy report sar generally involves depositing around into one account and into unrelated burn account that never use again. 
find friends the area that know burn their account once with big deposit collect the cash from them and never use their account again. 
the problem weve burned many accounts that are now having hard time finding people still able and willing. 
cant back accounts weve already burned because believe repeat the large cash deposits into the same account just under may trigger sar due structuring fears the bank. 
question there any way get around this that have not thought yet any and all comments questions are appreciated. 
let know what you guys think. 
thanks for the reply versace. 
thats something well definitely have look into. 
minimize risk with the burn accounts only ever using them once and the people use never know what its actually for. 
theres also trail from per since its anonymous cash deposit but youre right that complicates things and implicates other people perhaps unnecesarily. 
are not advertise goods link your marketplace before you are verified vendor. 
sounds like you are complicating your operation and leaving massive paper trail that implicates many your friends and other people who know you the people whos accounts you are burning. 
these people could flip they are arrested and investigation all related transactions the bank could give the police valuable evidence about the size and scope your operation. 
have you considered stealthily packaging the money wash with isopropyl remove any drug residue other smell vacuum seal and then disguise inside something and then sending viamail through private courier with their fastest delivery option privete courier priority services virtually never lose packages you choose their more expensive insured delivery options. 
somethinggoes wrong you can only ever implicated single cash transferal through the mail not serious bank transactions that could lead extra charges. 
have moved very large sums money through the mail many occasions and never had single problem have even sent many sums cash. 
dogs cant smell and can behidden inside many objects many clever ways. 
never fuck around with banks when have the option working with cash bitcoins. 
what you guys think using sites like bitcoinfog. 
com and safepostage. 
com obscure your tracks not sure like the idea sending money bitcoinfog giving details shipments safepostage. 
com but people use them all the time just that each site has such great reputation that one questions their motives asked this the silk road forums but the thread was deleted for. 
discussing other marketplaces. 
has anyone used these sites any advice for dealing with them. 
whatever happened that shard you were hyped about. 
welcome you can put links your vendor page please get verified the vendor verification thread. 
yep ships from canada and you have sign for.

decon gave lame implausible excuse about losing our btc. 
better said the coin was stolen. 
defcon the logical answer. 
was his watch. 
clusterfuck from its relaunch support ever the forums are censored way much. 
and way many obvious afoot. 
better obvious than not. 
for all intense and purposes honeypot trap. 
enter and jail. 
anyone who supports ignorant working build for scam and expects cut that robbery. 
the ship will never upright nor honorable ship ever again. 
the mods are shit the only thing they delete posts. 
not support the people. 
there help found. 
sincerely hope you security advice better than your marketplace advice. 
this not troll post pick new marketplace and steer that new ship into the horizon and towards freedom and liberty for all people. 
above just wondered what happened the guy and would like get back touch. 
and now many people both vendors and buyers are reporting withdrawal issues.

and now many people both vendors and buyers are reporting withdrawal issues. 
chop your bitcoin take your satoshis. 
withdrawal from fog was marked finished day hours ago but has still not shown the receving account. 
this point worried. 
finalized another order the vendors problem now. 
sounds like you are complicating your operation and leaving massive paper trail that implicates many your friends and other people who know you the people whos accounts you are burning. 
these people could flip they are arrested and investigation all related transactions the bank could give the police valuable evidence about the size and scope your operation. 
have you considered stealthily packaging the money wash with isopropyl remove any drug residue other smell vacuum seal and then disguise inside something and then sending viamail through private courier with their fastest delivery option privete courier priority services virtually never lose packages you choose their more expensive insured delivery options. 
somethinggoes wrong you can only ever implicated single cash transferal through the mail not serious bank transactions that could lead extra charges. 
have moved very large sums money through the mail many occasions and never had single problem have even sent many sums cash. 
dogs cant smell and can behidden inside many objects many clever ways. 
never fuck around with banks when have the option working with cash bitcoins. 
fixed and now. 
will apologies for blowing fuses. 
with all the stress and drama the constant fear and mistrust being spread. 
ready kill some fucker these days. 
watching our world slowly being destroyed has pissed off. 
overall the interface and general set seems very good. 
lets hope they can stick around. 
sure many others will say just patient. 
just the other day had rather large withdrawl say was finished hours ago but none the addresses even showed the blockchian. 
few hours later there they were. 
all else fails contact their support but would wait atleast day two before. 
looks like its just major delays. 
deposited little over hours ago with nothing the fog. 
were running towards days attempted deposit fog action yet its complete via the chain had confirmations hrs ago. 
reply from support hrs. 
has anyoe seen worse hope fogs now. 
from march amquote from march pmquote from february pmjust add this admin are preparing status update the situation over the next couple days which should add clarity the situation. 
keep eye the main board over the latter half the weekend. 
just looked over the boards and the latter half the weekend has passed. 
let guess something more important came and itll another few days trying really hard believe yall but youre making increasingly difficult. 
community minded person heart and will from time time step away from the background order gain perspective from community point view and develop empathy opposed just sympathy. 
such can not only assume but can also see for myself that the vivid lack information being promised but not followed indeed deep frustration. 
when said expect announcement meant because one was certainly planned without doubt. 
but for reasons beyond control this was pushed back further and probably the reason admin was reluctant state that announcement was its way the first place. 
took upon myself reassure people that announcement was due. 
that announcement still due and defcon working speak. 
but not want give revised expectation when will materialize for example should tell you that expected the announcement published this very day would only cause further disappointment should fail appear. 
also frustrated the amount time taking bring our community speed but have spoken defcon since the expected announcement date and progress still being made this front. 
vthank you for the response. 
the meantime appears that the balances have begun show. 
and not alone this according multiple other vendors received full pending balance and when withdrawing showed the blockchain seconds. 
well done those responsible. 
also there any way change vote these are steps the right direction.

sorry youve having trouble with evolution seems like otherwise very promising marketplace. 
hope you are able resolve your login issues far just perusing this topic and the evolution forums the administration seems highly responsive complaints and feedback and swift implement adjustments make for easier user experience. 
faced similar problem with registering then later being unable login agora. 
this really put damper our ability get back business soon possible after the clusterfuck most other markets were interested required vendor deposit fee which could not afford and agora one the few marketplaces that offered waiver the fee vendors difficult positions after taking one loss after another between smp etc. 
but have idea where direct our plea for assistance agora since cant log access the support system far can tell theres other way reach support. 
the only thing can think the agora staff the forums but imagine they are very busy and they explicitly state not the forum account regarding support issues. 
its quite frustrating knowing every day arent agora day that costing dearly but cant let our frustration get the way our need persevere plus our issue hardly reason condemn agora whole not that could really afford with the exposure stake. 
still think evolution seems promising. 
your services are definitely asset any marketplace community wish you better luck and hopefully well see you evolution sooner later. 
thought would log today. 
cannot log this account. 
sorry evolution market but you have sweet fuck all impress far. 
you are currently still the box marked yet another jonny come lately asshat market ran clowns hoping for quick coin. 
nice proved otherwise.

and now many people both vendors and buyers are reporting withdrawal issues. 
chop your bitcoin take your satoshis. 
all longtime lurker here vendors may recognize handle bulk buyer. 
organization has longstanding issue that dont know how resolve. 
would like turn the community now see anyone has any insight our problem. 
any help even pointer the right direction would immensely appreciated. 
without getting into too much detail our operation decentralized the business end receiving and selling our product our clientele one part the. 
and the buying btc connecting with vendors and ordering the product various markets takes place another. 
sends cash deposits through teller transactions buys untraceable btc and places orders orders are shipped. 
some you may know under the bank secrecy act banks are required report transactions more than currency transaction report ctr. 
like avoid this. 
our orders are usually more than. 
thus hypothetical transaction get the money without triggering ctr even worse suspicious acitivy report sar generally involves depositing around into one account and into unrelated burn account that never use again. 
find friends the area that know burn their account once with big deposit collect the cash from them and never use their account again. 
the problem weve burned many accounts that are now having hard time finding people still able and willing. 
cant back accounts weve already burned because believe repeat the large cash deposits into the same account just under may trigger sar due structuring fears the bank. 
question there any way get around this that have not thought yet any and all comments questions are appreciated. 
let know what you guys think. 
thanks for the reply versace. 
thats something well definitely have look into. 
minimize risk with the burn accounts only ever using them once and the people use never know what its actually for. 
theres also trail from per since its anonymous cash deposit but youre right that complicates things and implicates other people perhaps unnecesarily. 
yep ships from canada and you have sign for. 
hands down the best vendor anywhere. 
shows everytime like clockwork. 
tracking provided through pgp. 
best dope anywhere. 
what more could you ask for. 
did say fast shipping. 
once through customs days your house. 
should keep this shit myself but word going get out with top notch vendor like this. 
wide selection choose from too.

have started the mixer called bitcoin blender that you mentioned your post. 
have not seen anyone post any review yet though. 
hope will happen soon. 
posted this explanation how the mixer works another forum copy the same text here when you register account you get your own deposit address. 
deposit coins your address and you should see them incoming within one minute just refresh the deposit page. 
now you will see new button that was hidden before get new deposit address. 
soon you have deposited coins your current address you can get new one. 
after three network confirms the coins will added your balance and you can withdraw. 
coins will sent immediately there waiting time. 
the mixer uses coin control make sure send you other coins than the coins you deposited. 
keeps track all your old deposited coins and will not send you. 
the test send button will through and select coins just like when doing normal withdraw but instead get back you with answer there are enough coins the mixer not. 
you deposited large amount coins and you get negative response test send what you can leave the coins the mixer let mix with other users and withdraw small amount every day different addresses each time. 
you still want withdraw just normal send and will. 
the automatic withdraw feature like coinkites auto forwarding will automatically send coins the address you set your automatic withdraw address whenever coins are deposited your account. 
will however not automatically send coins there not enough coins the mixer but will keep trying until there. 
override this just log and turn off the automatic withdraw and will immediately send you the coins even means you will receive parts your own old deposited coins. 
looks like its just major delays. 
deposited little over hours ago with nothing the fog. 
withdrawal from fog was marked finished day hours ago but has still not shown the receving account. 
this point worried. 
whatever happened that shard you were hyped about. 
what you guys think using sites like bitcoinfog. 
com and safepostage. 
com obscure your tracks not sure like the idea sending money bitcoinfog giving details shipments safepostage. 
com but people use them all the time just that each site has such great reputation that one questions their motives asked this the silk road forums but the thread was deleted for. 
discussing other marketplaces. 
has anyone used these sites any advice for dealing with them. 
sounds like you are complicating your operation and leaving massive paper trail that implicates many your friends and other people who know you the people whos accounts you are burning. 
these people could flip they are arrested and investigation all related transactions the bank could give the police valuable evidence about the size and scope your operation. 
have you considered stealthily packaging the money wash with isopropyl remove any drug residue other smell vacuum seal and then disguise inside something and then sending viamail through private courier with their fastest delivery option privete courier priority services virtually never lose packages you choose their more expensive insured delivery options. 
somethinggoes wrong you can only ever implicated single cash transferal through the mail not serious bank transactions that could lead extra charges. 
have moved very large sums money through the mail many occasions and never had single problem have even sent many sums cash. 
dogs cant smell and can behidden inside many objects many clever ways. 
never fuck around with banks when have the option working with cash bitcoins.

let guess something more important came and itll another few days trying really hard believe yall but youre making increasingly difficult. 
community minded person heart and will from time time step away from the background order gain perspective from community point view and develop empathy opposed just sympathy. 
such can not only assume but can also see for myself that the vivid lack information being promised but not followed indeed deep frustration. 
when said expect announcement meant because one was certainly planned without doubt. 
but for reasons beyond control this was pushed back further and probably the reason admin was reluctant state that announcement was its way the first place. 
took upon myself reassure people that announcement was due. 
that announcement still due and defcon working speak. 
but not want give revised expectation when will materialize for example should tell you that expected the announcement published this very day would only cause further disappointment should fail appear. 
also frustrated the amount time taking bring our community speed but have spoken defcon since the expected announcement date and progress still being made this front. 
vthank you for the response. 
the meantime appears that the balances have begun show.

advertise the pirate market somewhere. 
create image and upload anony. 
send private message with your username the pirate market image link and link the advertisment. 
bmr favorite marketplace all time. 
even the glory days the original silkroad favored this market will support back anything does ever returns the community. 
just thinking about bmr seems warrant the phrase the good days though was operating only few months ago. 
think will always favorite marketplace altogether. 
very good security with backopy the site was just painfully slow. 
when the new one and running any inside info. 
how about big lotus flower the login screne.

but boot tails normally can connect without issue. 
says something about the system clock not sync the messages. 
problem fixed just had set system clock utc which tails uses.

the agora forum there full list all users. 
many users both buyers and vendors use the same username for both market and forum anyone could copy the entire list users. 
hope this just the case and that nothing more sinister info was obtained. 
this list should removed completely. 
thats kind stupid having list any kind. 
agora has pretty much top notch hope comes. 
from march pmi havent been its forums quite long time but one thing noticed and really didnt like was their shady little practice moving important relevant topics sections one will ever see them. 
one the last posts had there was asking for mod answer why the scammer was still vending there. 
got moved customer support where one would see. 
mod could move thread. 
but not answer. 
far know still vending there. 
there reason for that. 
admin the second phase the scam. 
the scam using fake feedback vendor accounts that admin mods control. 
they collect the money and send product. 
reports missing btc deposits are usually from impatient newbies who panic and not report back when the money shows. 
agora rocks its new home. 
from sorrymario march pmquote from turtletime march pmi have been scammed them. 
many people this tread have been scammed them. 
maybe people all over the internet have been scammed them. 
you are retard and troll. 
please leave the darknet. 
the stench coming from you incredible. 
think all know who the troll. 
the moment the face evidence support his theory its looking like turtle the troll here unless you can substantiate your claims theres evidence anyone being scammed this thread and please dont deface thread started with slurs this isnt the thread the forum for that. 
you have verifiable evidence then people will listen. 
otherwise return your sub bridge residence and live your life peace please. 
yeah told you that. 
awful curious huh have. 
org wiki comparison shopping cart software. 
org wiki comparison web application give you idea. 
everything has php the front and mysql the back. 
youre planning setting marketplace let know. 
hello hub many you may interested hiding the use tor from your isp. 
some isps are already under federal orders maintain databases addresses connecting tor nodes and this point you should expect the collecting that data. 
there nice solution other than vpn services which can prove not helpful depending how you configure your pathway into tor you choose bad vpn service called pluggable transports that give you bridge connect tor. 
bridge address that connects you tor possibly unknown tor bridge. 
using these will hide that you are using known tor node. 
obfs bridge bridge that has data packets disguised normal data hides the surface that you are using tor. 
vulnerable dpi deep packet inspection capability the fbi nsa. 
roughly exist understand using them can pool you into smaller group. 
solution host your own vps the tor cloud serviceobfs resistent dpi ultimately the safest bridge completely masks your data packets. 
the only problem that they are few number thus pooling you into yet smaller group. 
the more people host the infinitely stronger tor becomes torproject and look some bridges obfs and obfs bridges the more you have the better. 
now boot tails bridge mode. 
wait til the menu for live live failsafe comes.
