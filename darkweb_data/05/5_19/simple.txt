into the investigation of data surrounding the attacks, and it there is absolutely zero evidence of any staff member being involved. we will publish more information as we determine its accuracy, thank you to all who have contributed tips on the attackers identities.after much self-reflection and deliberation with community members we value highly, it is clear that there is only one way forward.this leadership and this community will not stop until you are completely repaid.we know you feel defenseless right now. you are naked. many of you are convinced there is no logical reason any darknet admin would ever fight to get your coins back.i can stand here and reiterate that all i want to do is defend you, to steer this community towards incrementally safer operation. but my words are no comfort, and i understand that. you will never meet me. we are all anonymous.i gave a similar speech in december when we met our first impossible situation. you have no reason to trust my words. my actions will prove you wrong.here is the current plan. thank you to the dedicated vendors and buyers who helped draft this approach. this is not necessarily a final plan, we are open to suggestions on how to improve this and want your feedback.the plan for moving forward as of feb 151. this administration will not earn any commissions until everyone is completely paid back, and will be very transparent about the progress towards this goal.2. the marketplace will relaunch as no-escrow. we will not re-implement escrow unless it is multi-signature and decentralized to multiple escrow providers (trusted mediators with feedback just like vendors). never buy from a market which uses centralized escrow again. you will only get hurt no matter how honest the team is.3. all items will be priced at a flat 5% commission which will go directly into victims balances upon purchase.4. vendors who lost funds: commissions from your items will go directly into your wallet until you are completely repaid, then will be distributed to other vendors until they are repaid. vendor bonds are considered lost funds, and we also commit to paying these back.5. all vendors can opt-in to give a higher percentage back on their listings, and all buyers will be presented with a "donate" box on the shopping cart. vendors donation percentage will be publicly visible.6. we will launch the support system immediately. resubmit any open support requests you had which are still applicable. all previous messages will be ignored due to our inbound message volume. i have received over 1000 private messages over the past 24 hours, for example. this fresh start will allow us to stay on top of the support queue, rather than paying down a large debt incurred by previous administrators.7. we will still handle dispute resolution for existing escrow orders until all balances site-wide are in "pending balance" category. your stolen balances and escrows will display as "pending balance" and "pending escrow". yes, like christmas. i hoped to never have to take this approach again. all unshipped orders have been cancelled. to the vendors who have shipped orders despite no access to the portal: you are beautiful people. try to resolve with your buyer directly, and file a support ticket if you do not receive a refund to your pending escrow balance within a month.the plans above are subject to change as we consider your input.the statistics are humbling:26% of our monthly active users have lost their entire sr funds. that represents 47% of users who have purchased or sold items since launch.our inbound traffic has been growing at a rapid pace. the first ten days of february saw as many purchases as the entire month of january. by feb 13, we surpassed januarys total user registrations.we strongly believe that we can work together and make this right.silk road is not a name easily forgotten, and how we pull through this struggle will only solidify our name as the strongest community in the darknet.buyers and vendors: we are committed to getting everyone repaid even if it takes a year. do not forget to check your sr accounts frequently for balances repaid, and withdraw them when you see them.vendors:\xc2\xa0 you are welcomed and encouraged to vend on multiple markets. i only trust myself, and will not endorse any of them. but i have failed you. wherever you vend, may you prosper.buyers: do not purchase using centralized escrow. use markets which have implemented multi-signature, or only purchase with no-escrow (fe) from very trusted vendors. this is not an ideal climate, but it is the reality of the darknet today. i cannot emphasize strongly enough that every market which uses centralized escrow will fail. centralization makes a market a huge target for attackers, and a huge target for dishonest administrators.again, we welcome your feedback on this approach to moving forward, and will continue to refine it throughout the year based on sales data.i dont care how long it takes or how expensive it is, we will fight to get this community repaid.', ['None'])

and it must be on a different computer?2) in order for the second client (the cold storage one) to be able to store the coins i have to create an address on it (which never sees the light of internet); yet from the first client, i must "send" the coins to that other address, but so that the blockchain records the transaction, i must do it while connected, and the blockchain will show the coins moving from one address (my bitcoin-qt client) to another address (my cold storage client, be it electrum or whatever)?is that how it works?i dont suppose i can just put my wallet.dat and the other file, whats it called?, the one that stores the addresses. i say i can just transfer those two files to another computer with another bitcoin client, and just have those addresses be now part of a cold storage system, leaving my old, connected client, with just new addresses and an empty wallet? can this be done?goblinbitcoin cold storage means keeping your wallets private keys on an offline computer. there is no more secure way to store your bitcoin, and bitcoin cold storage absolutely protects your bitcoin from loss, theft or seizure. online wallets like blockchain.info are convenient but should be considered your bitcoin checking account and used for only a few bitcoin, because online wallets can be hacked (remember instawallet?) for your bitcoin savings account you need maximum security and that means using a bitcoin client on your home computer, one that supports cold storage.which bitcoin wallets offer cold storage?only the armory and electrum bitcoin wallets allow you to split your wallet into an offline cold storage wallet which contains your private keys and an online watching only wallet that only contains your public keys. any hacker who is able to access your online wallet cannot steal your bitcoin, which are protected by your private keys in the offline wallet on a separate computer that never connects to the outside world.the online watching only wallet can give out receiving addresses and generate transactions. when you spend bitcoin from your online wallet the wallet generates an unsigned transaction file that you take to your offline computer on a usb key. you import the unsigned transaction into your offline wallet and sign with your private key, then take the signed transaction back to your online wallet and broadcast the signed transaction. because your offline wallet never connects to the internet your bitcoins are as secure as possible.armory and electrum are both deterministic wallets and only need to be backed up once. in a deterministic wallet all the bitcoin addresses your wallet will ever generate are derived from a long series of numbers or letters called a seed. as long as you have your seed backed up, you can recreate the wallet at will.hardware requirements for bitcoin cold storagearmorys online watching only wallet now runs on either 32 bit or 64 bit computer with 1-2 gb ram. you can download armory 0.90-beta at\xc2\xa0(https://bitcoinarmory.com/download/)the computer you use for your offline wallet does not need to be 64 bit. any computer made in the last ten years should work for your armory offline wallet. however, for maximum security your offline wallet should be used on a computer with full disk encryption to protect your private keys in case the computer is stolen.electrum is a lightweight bitcoin wallet and will run on any computer with no special requirements for memory. if the operating system on your offline computer does not offer full disk encryption consider replacing the os with a free linux distribution which does.\xc2\xa0 using linux for your offline wallet laptop also protects you from the risk of transmitting windows malware through the usb drive.recommendationsmake several small transactions with armory or electrum until you are comfortable signing transactions with your offline wallet. even delete your offline wallet and restore from backup to prove to yourself that your wallet can be recovered and your bitcoin are secure.armory guide to using offline (cold storage) wallets (https://wordpress.bitcoinarmory.com/about/using-our-wallet/#offlinewallet) \xe2\x80\x93 the gold standard for bitcoin wallets providing easy cold storage for everyoneelectrum offline (cold storage) wallets (https://electrum.org/tutorials.html#offline-mpk) - worthy lightweight runner up and available in a portable version that will run from a usb drivehope this helps!', ['hacking tools'])

(as of 4/2/14, i am shipping only dmt internationally. this is subject to change at any time.)3. i package orders one time per day at around 1pm pst. if you do not get your order in by then, it will be shipped the next day.4. use a name associated with the address!!! this is the number one most common reason for mail not reaching a residence.5. do not ship to an abandoned business or house. they do not deliver to a location in which they know has no apparent residence.addresses should look like this:firstname lastname12345 jackson circle apt. 14nowhere, ny 12345if your address does not look like this, i will not ship until i have a correct address! i will not be held responsible for your mistakes.-----------escrow and refunds-----------i no longer work in escrow. all orders must be finalized early before i will ship. i only offer tracking on my products. if something goes wrong with your order and it appears that it is my fault, you will get a full refund or reship (there will only be a 50% refund/reship for the buds). i do not offer reships or refunds for international orders. i also will not help you if you come to me over a month after shipping your product. i do not keep shipping info for longer than one month for security measures.-----------ways to smoke dmt-----------1. the best way (and my personal favorite) is through a volcano vaporizer.2. the most popular way of doing it is the sandwich method. this is where you pack a layer of ash (cigarette ash will work but weed ash is the best) in the bottom of the bowl, sprinkle about 30-35mg of dmt per person on top of that ash, then pack another layer of ash on top of the dmt. the reason for this is because dmt degrades when hit with direct heat. it needs to be vaporized.3. build a dmt smoking machine. this is the internets favorite method because it is almost as effective as a volcano and can be built very cheap. you can google around on how to make these, there are many different kinds.tips for smoking dmt:1. do not drink. this will essentially kill or heavily deteriorate your trip.2. do not take benzos. this will also essentially kill or heavily deteriorate your trip.3. do not smoke out of a light bulb. the glass is too thin and burns most of your dmt.4. i love to smoke cannabis but i find that i never remember much if i am stoned when i do my dmt. so if you want to remember your trip very well, try to do it without cannabis (even though it does seem to make the trip better).', ['hacking tools'])

andrew jones (aka inigo) and gary davis (libertas) ? were immediately released on bail under the laws of the usa and ireland respectively. according to the indictment, inigo and libertas did have roles on the marketplace as well as the forums. the indictment differentiates the two where it says:?inigo?? worked as a site administrator on silk road?libertas? ?? worked as a site administrator on silk road?samesamebutdifferent?? worked as the primary moderator on the silk road discussion forums (my emphasis)nash was not granted bail because under the australian extradition act 1988, ?a magistrate or eligible federal circuit court judge shall not remand a person on bail under this section unless there are special circumstances justifying such remand?. it seems nash could not fulfil the ?special circumstances? requirement.next wednesday, nash is due back in court for a magistrate to determine whether he is ?eligible for surrender? to the us. if so, nash will be remanded in custody until the next phase of the proceedings ? surrender or review (or he can consent to extradition).under s.19 of the act, he will be eligible for surrender to us authorities if the magistrate is satisfied:(a)\xc2\xa0 the supporting documents in relation to the offence have been produced to the magistrate or judge;(b)\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0any additional requirements imposed by the us-australia extradition treaty are satisfied(c)\xc2\xa0 the conduct would have constituted an extradition offence if it had occurred in australia, and(d)\xc2\xa0 there are no substantial grounds for believing that there is an extradition objection in relation to the offencenow, a disclaimer. although i was a lawyer in my deep dark past, i have zero experience with either crime or extradition law. so i don?t know any more than anyone else. these are simply my uninformed opinions after looking at the act and extradition treaty, and knowing from two years of investigating silk road what ssbd?s role consisted of.19(b) ? any additional requirements imposed by the us-australia extradition treaty are satisfiedarticle vi of the treaty says: ?extradition shall be granted only if the evidence is found sufficient, according to the laws in the territory where the person whose extradition is requested is found, either to justify his trial or committal for trial if the offence with which he is charged or its equivalent had been committed in that territory?like i said, i don?t know what evidence they have, so i can only go on the indictment. it seems to me ?evidence? is pretty lacking in that document.first, i have no idea what evidence the us authorities have that nash is ssbd. they may have found some correspondence on the silk road servers between he and the site?s owner, dread pirate roberts. or perhaps ross ulbricht, the man accused of being dread pirate roberts, provided his details in an attempt at a plea bargain. ulbricht, it should be noted, has denied being dpr, and has denied all charges, so this seems unlikely. the indictment claims ssbd was paid around $50,000 per year. this presumably was paid in bitcoin. it is possible, though again unlikely, that the bitcoin trail was followed to nash?s bank account.most likely, the ?evidence? is an email from an anonymous email account or a message through an anonymous private claiming that ssbd?s real name is peter nash. not too compelling.this requirement for evidence is also relevant to the next two stipulations.19(c) ? the conduct would have constituted an extradition offence if it had occurred in australiathe wording says ?conduct? not ?crimes of which the person is accused?. the only conduct i could find attributed to ssbd in the indictment was:(1)\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0in relation to the narcotics charge: sent a message to dread pirate roberts, owner of silk road, summarising the actions he had taken during the previous week in his capacity as the primary forum moderator on the silk road discussion forums.-\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 i doubt that sending a message from one anonymous online account to another anonymous online account constitutes an extradition offence-\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 the narcotics charge is the only charge to have any ?overt acts? (which sounds similar to ?conduct? to me) listed underneath the charges attributable to ssbd(2)\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0in relation to the hacking charge: intentionally accessed computers without authorisation for commercial advantage and private financial gain, and in furtherance of criminal and tortious acts-\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 no ?overt acts? were listed under this charge; the above was a general accusation aimed at all three defendants; this does not sound like it could be considered ?conduct of the person constituting the offence,? which is what the act requires-\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 i would be interested to see what evidence they have that ssbd accessed computers without authorisation. there would certainly be no need to do so in order to carry out his functions of moderating a discussion forum. he would have carried out his duties on his own computer, logging in to the silk road administration panel (at least the small part he had access to), completely authorised to do so.(3)\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0in relation to the money laundering charge: conduct and attempt to conduct such financial transactions which in fact involved the proceeds of specified unlawful activity, to wit, narcotics trafficking and computer hacking-\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 no ?overt acts? were listed under this charge; the above was a general accusation aimed at all three defendants; this does not sound like it could be considered ?conduct of the person constituting the offence,? which is what the act requires-\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 again, i would be interested to see what evidence they have that ssbd conducted or attempted to conduct illegal financial transactions ? especially as conducting any transactions whatsoever was explicitly banned on the silk road forums, the only site ssbd had access to in any sort of administrative capacity. not surprisingly, dread pirate roberts wanted to keep all financial transactions on the marketplace, where he received a commission for each one19(d)\xc2\xa0 there are no substantial grounds for believing that there is an extradition objection in relation to the offence?extradition objections? (s.7) include:?(b)\xc2\xa0 the surrender of the person, in so far as it purports to be sought for the extradition offence, is actually sought for the purpose of prosecuting or punishing the person on account of his or her race, sex, sexual orientation, religion, nationality or political opinions ?; or(c)\xc2\xa0 on surrender to the extradition country in respect of the extradition offence, the person may be prejudiced at his or her trial, or punished, detained or restricted in his or her personal liberty, by reason of his or her race, sex, sexual orientation, religion, nationality or political opinions;?(my emphasis)this probably isn?t much of a legal argument, but in the real world, this whole extradition attempt smacks of politics. it?s all show so that politicians can trumpet a win on their long-doomed war on drugs. spending this sort of taxpayers? money to extradite a man who may or may not have been paid a paltry $50k a year to perform mundane administration tasks on what was purely a website for discussions? there is no suggestion that nash sold drugs himself. hell, there?s not even a suggestion that he bought drugs. just these trumped-up charges so conservatives can parade him in front of the media, claiming they?ve brought down some sort of evil drug cartel.according to the attorney-general?s department annual reports, most extradition requests are to return ex-pats, not australian citizens. they tend to be for fugitives that have escaped with hundreds of millions of fraudulently-obtained funds, or child sex predators of the most heinous kind.the united states requests extradition of two to four people from australia a year. should peter nash really be one of them', ['None'])

(as of 4/2/14, i am shipping only dmt internationally. this is subject to change at any time.)3. i package orders one time per day at around 1pm pst. if you do not get your order in by then, it will be shipped the next day.4. use a name associated with the address!!! this is the number one most common reason for mail not reaching a residence.5. do not ship to an abandoned business or house. they do not deliver to a location in which they know has no apparent residence.addresses should look like this:firstname lastname12345 jackson circle apt. 14nowhere, ny 12345if your address does not look like this, i will not ship until i have a correct address! i will not be held responsible for your mistakes.-----------escrow and refunds-----------i no longer work in escrow. all orders must be finalized early before i will ship. i only offer tracking on my products. if something goes wrong with your order and it appears that it is my fault, you will get a full refund or reship (there will only be a 50% refund/reship for the buds). i do not offer reships or refunds for international orders. i also will not help you if you come to me over a month after shipping your product. i do not keep shipping info for longer than one month for security measures.-----------ways to smoke dmt-----------1. the best way (and my personal favorite) is through a volcano vaporizer.2. the most popular way of doing it is the sandwich method. this is where you pack a layer of ash (cigarette ash will work but weed ash is the best) in the bottom of the bowl, sprinkle about 30-35mg of dmt per person on top of that ash, then pack another layer of ash on top of the dmt. the reason for this is because dmt degrades when hit with direct heat. it needs to be vaporized.3. build a dmt smoking machine. this is the internets favorite method because it is almost as effective as a volcano and can be built very cheap. you can google around on how to make these, there are many different kinds.tips for smoking dmt:1. do not drink. this will essentially kill or heavily deteriorate your trip.2. do not take benzos. this will also essentially kill or heavily deteriorate your trip.3. do not smoke out of a light bulb. the glass is too thin and burns most of your dmt.4. i love to smoke cannabis but i find that i never remember much if i am stoned when i do my dmt. so if you want to remember your trip very well, try to do it without cannabis (even though it does seem to make the trip better).', ['None'])

information in this thread was generously provided by chinacat72, a member of mycotopia forum, in 2005."i will discuss lsd crystal and what happens with it. this info is from my experiences a long time ago.i can safely offer it because i have retired from this line of work and stay far away from it. first i will briefly discuss the people or family as there called so you can get an appreciation for what they do and have done. the family is motivated to spread lsd because we believe that lsd is a key givin to us from above. lsd was givin to man from god to help him see the error of his ways. why do you think it was discovered during the most horrible time in history. it is the antidote for the atomic bomb. it`s doesn`t matter if you beleive this or not ,because what i`m trying to express is how deeply important the family feels about the sacred value of lsd. those who are at the upper level`s of the family will gladly sacrifice there lifes and freedom to do this work. ok now down to the crystal. i have little knowlege about lsd manufacture so i`m going to talk about the final product the crystal. on tour crystal came in brown glass bottles with 1-10 grams in them. the bottles were sealed and contained co2 and crystal. you can`t just buy crystal from family. first you have to be taught how to lay it ,which i`ll cover in a little bit. also you have to do a thumbprint(eat it) there are no exeptions to this rule.the reason is to make sure your karma is clean enough to handle this sacred work. types of crystal needlepoint -very pure(95% ) white powerdery crystal,was available in small amount`s. the best of the best white fluff -very pure(95% ) white light flakes of crystal. still around and the most sought after. very pure silver -good and clean(85-90% )-light greyish crystal. was an unbelievable amount of this around in the late eighty`s and early nineties. very good stuff. my first thumbprint was this kind. if you ate acid in the 80-90`s you probably sampled some silver. amber -decent(70%?) this crystal varied from a light amber color to an almost dark brown color.was always available.one batch called quadricept amber was the color of light honey and was very good.lot`s a people worked with this crystal but i always would use silver instead since it was better and the same price. lavender -(60-70%?) light purple to almost black colored crystal. like amber it varied batch to batch. tj (tornado juice) - purity unknown. i seen this shit in about four different colors and it always scared me. no experiance with it. champagne -(50-60% ) black crystal, nasty stuff imho. i worked with it once and swore to never touch it again. ok so you got some crystal and need to get it on blotter. it`s a pretty amazing feeling holding a jar in your hands that has 10 grams of crystal in it. that`s 100,000 doses in the palm of your hand. for dealing with laying we`ll say we got 1 gram. acid is always layed 1 gram=10 tenpacks. a tenpack is tensheets. 1gram=10,000doses. if your laying needlpoint your doses will be 95mcg, because your crystal is 95% pure. if your laying amber your shit will be 70mcg, because it`s 70% pure. got it now you get a glass pyrex pan to dip your tenpacks in. your crystal is dissovled into 110ml. of everclear per gram.the purer crystals dissolve instantly with a little stirring. the not so pure take a little shaking. champange is damn near impossible to get to dissolve evenly. paper-for white blotter standard watercolor paper#14 or equivalent is used. it`s critical you get the right paper. if you don`t it won`t absorb right and you`ll fuck it all up.print`s are made up ahead of time and perferated.ok so you got your crystal dissolved and your paper cut and ready. there are 2 schools when it comes to putting it on the paper. first dump the solution in the pan and dip each tenpack into it then lift it up and let any excess solution run off into the pan. second method is to put the tenpack into the pan and squirt the solution on it with a baby syringe(the ones they give little kids medicine with). i have done both and prefer dipping them just because its quicker .then the tenpacks are layed out to dry which doesn`t take long since alcohol evaporates quickly. if you did it right there will be very little residue left in the bottom of the pan.this redidue is extremely potent and is either soaked up with a piece of paper(called mop up) or made into potent liquid(called wash). whatever you choose this is saved for your personal use. while your doing all this you get very,very high. as soon as you open the jar of crystal it intoxicates the air. most people were rubber gloves when doing this some don`t. just don`t have any plans afterwards. there might be slightly different methods used when laying, but this is how the dead family does it. after the tenpacks are dryed there distibuted and eaten up. since the end of the grateful dead the massive distribution network that used to get rid of so much acid has been broken up badly. never fear acid is still out there" lsd is still around though it seems that a majority of the labs are inactive at the moment. this is normal as they don`t produce all the time. most like the silver family only produce about every 5 years. though they usually produce enough to last that long. when the grateful dead toured massive amount`s of lsd were distributed around the country. on a typical east coast tour 100-150grams could easily be sold. thats a million to a million and a half doses. this flooded these citys and the lsd trickled down to every nook and cranny of america. by the time it was dry again another tour would roll through the region and resupply it. plus we would meet people on tour from certain area`s of the country and keep them supplied with the help of the good ole usps. sadly when the dead stopped touring this network went into shambles. people fell out of touch and with no shows ,there wasn`t the marketplace for distibution.in turn parts of the country arn`t getting saturated anymore. lsd isn`t moved and sold like the cartel`s move coke and such. it`s handled by a brotherhood of people who truly believe there doing the work of god(or whatever name you call creation). we believe that lsd crystal has to be handled by the right people who are totally committed to the movement. when we moved crystal there was always the feeling that we were protected by a higher power. i can`t tell you how many times i have had crystal or acid on me or my brothers and have been in situation`s where we should have gotten busted and something always protected us. so many times that coincidence is not an option. why do i think we were protected. because the family does it for mankind not money. we viewed lsd as the only hope for the radical change in conciousness that would save us. so in effect we viewed are work as the work of god. you know why they never busted a family lab? because we would never betray lsd. just as jesus was nailed to the cross we were willing to spend the rest of our lives in jail or die to protect what we viewed as the salvation of are species. sound`s a little dramatic doesn`t it, but i`m trying to give you an understanding of the faith in lsd that the family has. by the way the kansas bust was not a family lab incase anybody is wondering. the point i`m trying to make is the family believes lsd has to move through the right hands. this is why you can`t go down to the corner and get a gram of crystal. sorry to ramble. as some of the cooks retire i rest assure you that they pass there recipes and secret`s down to those chosen to continue to fight the good fight. i don`t think it will ever be as readily available all over the country as it once was due to the break up of the distribution cycle of tour. i could be wrong and hope i am. alot of old family have moved on and including myself retired, feeling we served our time. the family does hear your cry`s for more acid and they don`t plan on giving up on mankind. nows a good time for labs to be inactive. the current government administration is viewed as a bad storm that needs to pass as jerry sang "all good things in all good time" keep the faith""for me and the rest of the people on tour it was just a matter of spending year after year on tour. the elder`s that are on top keep in a eye on everybody that help`s move there stuff. they also know the intentions of those people. if they know your true and a total believer in the work they start letting you hang around. many hour`s are spent in hotel rooms watching them work. they make sure you know every detail. also they make sure that you know the importance of being honest and laying your product correctly. every hit you lay has the potential to change somebody`s life and bring them into the light. it`s taught like an apprenticeship. my first thumbprint was silver. before my print i thought i was pretty experienced with acid. i had been puddled many times with strong liquid. i wasn`t near as experienced as i thought as i walked into the room and everybody had a huge grin on there face, and i saw what i was about to take. thumbprint`s arn`t weighed out on a scale. it`s more of "that`s a nice little chunk ,that should do" your talking several sheet`s or more when you do a print. fluff and needlpoint are damn pure and i don`t imagine bears was any purer. i have heard of batches of needlepoint being as high as 98% white fluff is gorgous crystal. we would eat this crystal like crazy. when i first met the main guy in charge of this crystal he was snorting it!!!! after i did a fluff print i never did any other kind except needlepoint. when you eat crystal you definatly can tell the differences between them. purity does matter at that level." isnt a thumbprint dangerous? youd think a persons mind would be changed forever after doing that amount. "a thumbprint isn`t even close to the largest doses people have done. dangerous? lsd is physiologicaly one of the safest drugs there are. there`s not one valid death that can be attributed to physiological complications from taking lsd. i didn`t know all this when i was taking it though. psychologically it could be very negative if the wrong person does it. that`s why we didn`t just walk around the parking lot handing out thumbprint`s. as far as high doses go, it totally opens you up. for about a week afterwards your first print you need some babysitting. hell you`ve just been reborn! after awhile it`s less tramatic. as for after effects. i am middle aged and healthy. i have 3 bright healthy children. and i`m just getting my bachelor`s degree with a 3.5gpa i do feel high very often though, but i don`t mind. the man that gave me my first print still does crystal once in awhile and he`s in his mid sixties."you mention the purity varying on alot of the crystal. how are they checking purity? just roughly with how long it takes to dissolve in a solvent? "i can tell by color. how crystallin it is and what color it is. you can inspect the crystal once you know what good clean crystal looks like. and then you can compare. i have a moto "if its white its all right". of course the jugement on my end is not scientific . i examin it like jewelers do jewels. the only real way to get a very accurate reading on how pure it is comes from the lab. most decent labs have a gc/ms and can get a decent purity reading from that. needlepoint and white fluff are the only ones that are reliably consistant. silver varies a little. lavender and amber vary greatly in appearance from batch to batch. indicating a difference in purity. if i was buying amber or lavender i would want to see it first. they have a tendancy every once in awhile to skimp on the last part of manufacture. the rinse and recrysitazation at the end is crucial in determing purity. if this isnt done enough your product is less pure.some of you may have heard owsley say he lost 20% of his product making sure its pure. thats because he rised it a ton of times. thats why his shit was said to be better than sandoz. amber and lavender if they dont due this good there crystal looks more dirty. also the purer you make your crystal the less it weighs and its sold by weight." how long does lsd "stay good"? i mean if i was to take it, put it in a zippylock and then put it in the pages of a book (someplace with unchanging air and no light) "i find that exact method perfect. i took two sheets of needlepoint and wraped them in plastic wrap then a. foil and put them in the middle of a book on a bookshelf. there going on 3 years old and last time somebody tried them they were very potent. they get no light ,air ,and are in a cool enviroment. as for crystal its stored in brown glass vials that are filled with co2 and sealed." you said the family was always on tour with the dead. do you know offhand if any of them ever had the occasion to hang with jerry and the guys? "a lot of the older guys did. hell the family started with the dead and bear. its all connected from the band, crew to the fans and faithful. as for hanging with jerry myself , no. i got backstage several times, but that doesnt mean anything. theres backstage and then there is the bands backstage ,thats off limits. i would much rather be in the crowd. the closest i ever got to jerry was ten feet as he walked by me and a bunch of other people. i just smiled. i had nothing to say. he had a lot of pressure with all the people who clung to him and thought he was a god. it was really hard for him to deal with and one of the reasons he turned to smack imho. i had nothing to say to him ,except mabye "play st. stephen!" i was just curious what kind of sheets were going around when you were into it, was there always different sheets or was there stockpiles of certain kinds? "over the 8 years i was on tour i saw more prints than i possibly could remember or list. i wouldnt even know were to begin. hundreds and hundreds of different kinds. my favorite was plain white unperferated paper. the reason for this was alot of cops dont know what a tenpack of white unperfed blotter looks like. once on a greyhound bus from floridia to baltimore our bus was stopped and a bunch of feds got on it. they searched everybodys bags. they were looking for guns or coke since we were coming from floridia. ill never forget the feeling of watching a federal agent (fbi i believe) go through my bag and pull stuff out. i had a gram(ten- tenpacks or 10,000 doses) of white paper. he pulled it out and had no clue what it was . it looked like just a bunch of ten inch square pieces of paper to him. had it be perferated and had a print on it he probably would have known. after that i was a true believer in white unperfed paper. prints are usually made in mass amounts and then sold to the different familys. so one kind of print can actually have several different kinds of crystal on them. this happened years ago with the jesus christ prints. the first ones were made of very pure white fluff and they were dipped to contain a little over 100mcg. people went nuts over them and the were the talk of the summer. then the lavender family got hold of the same print and put there dirty ass crystal on them and they were about half the strength as the original white fluff batch. people should know the truth about lsd. the internet is the perfect medium to transfer this knowlege. just enough info can be given to paint a general picture of how things work, without giving specifics that would endanger this important work. i am in the perfect position to do so. i am long enough removed from the active scene to offer information without endangering anyone including myself. my friends that still live in the old world are very supportive. now it seams lifetimes ago. i was just a tool in a very large tool box. the family was around long before i came around. luckily it was in a time when a lot of the older folks were around to help with the scene. for me lsd is a gift and tool given to man from the heavens. i truly believe it is here to point us back towards the light. these values are the same with almost all the family. after you get a glimpse of eternity you cant help ,but want to share it with others who need it." sand, scully, and owsely were the original chemists working for the family? "yes, all 3 were family. owsely was the original chemist of the dead scene/family. he set many of the standards and ethics still held today. he also got sand and scully involved and doing this work for the people not money. sand and scully were in the "brotherhood of eternal love". back then it was basically all one big network or family. after the feds broke up the bel in the 70s is when people split off and ran smaller labs,networks and were known by there product. i would also like to note that when all 3 were busted they were all threatend with huge sentences. they kept there mouth shut and served very little time in comparison to how much they could have served. pickard was family many years ago. he has been busted for manufacturing 3 times. on his second bust he ran his mouth to the feds about other drug activity within the scene resulting in several people getting prison time. after that he was shunned and nobody in the family would work for him. that is why he had to work with such shady people in kansas. had he been working with family he wouldnt be going to serve a lifetime prison sentence, he wouldnt have been busted at all. on his second bust instead of biting the bullet and keeping his mouth shut like sand, scully, and owsely, he chose to make a deal. many years later now he is going to prison for life because he was betrayed in the same way. i do hope that pickard can get out of prison before his life ends. he has a new kid that was just born and a new wife. he has done a great service to man by making lsd. i would hope that after a few years he can get released and live his remaining years with his new family. i doubt he will be so lucky though. many of us who have been graced by lsd owe a great debt to these 3 pioneer chemists and the ones that still remain active and unknown today." -continued', ['hacking tools'])

(802552, 115456, 'i was intrigued by psychedelics since my first psilocybin trip just as i turned into an adult - officially. i had become disillusioned with alcohol and marijuana; as it was consumed by the general populace, but within these fungi i found such pleasure and clarity. truly a satisfying and rewarding substance.psilocybin piqued my interest and soon there-after, i gave lsd a try. before trying anything else, or even more lsd - i approached the subject very cautiously. substance, source, and purity were absolutely of incredible importance. in the meantime i did a lot of reading, becoming very knowledgeable about alexander shulgin and erowid. then i found gracie & zarkov, the following passage moved me. leading to my first experiments with mda & 2c-b a few years later. recently (about 1.5 years ago) i re-experienced this article and i feel like i truly integrated the knowledge & wisdom contained within.i was originally very suspicious & careful about consuming drugs/psychedelics more than 1-2 times/year. however, recently ive made come to a conclusion that i have dedicated so much to the pursuit of knowledge behind these substances that they truly are my allies. i still dont consume them more than maybe 1/month, but i just follow my feelings on that one. my primary allies are as follows:mescaline, dom, psilocybin, mda, 4-aco-dmt, dmt, 2c-b, dob, 2c-e, 2c-d, 2c-i, and sativa cannabis (although usually not in-combination with psychedelics, as i believe it defeats the headspace i am trying to achieve .. increases the visuals, but deteriorates the mental clarity). harmala-alkaloids also, but never in combination with anything but tryptamines.ive also tried & loved 2c-t-7, dxm, d-amphetamine, and mdpv. i respect the destructive power of stimulants immensely and can count on one hand the number of times ive used d-amphetamine/mdpv in the past 10 years. also rarely use dissociatives, few times a year at most.tried & am neutral: mdma, 5-meo-mipt, 2c-p, ketamine (although ive had some great experiences in combination with 2c-b), mxetried & dislike: 5-meo-dipt, doc, butt plugslist of things id like to try: doi, dpt, bufotenine (5-oh-dmt), tma-series, mmda, aleph-series, and ganesha. things ive decided to avoid: nbome-series, most very recently developed rcs (especially stimulants), methylone~~~let us restate our position clearly: psychedelic drugs give the shaman reliable means of entering alternative reality tunnels that are at least as real as our everyday reality. the shamans task, therefore, is to become familiar with their effect and applications. psychedelic drugs are powerful tools, and powerful tools, like heavy construction equipment, can cause fatalities when operated by untrained personnel.naive or recreational use of psychedelic drugs does not make one either a shaman or a saint. if this were true, the bay area would have been overrun by saints and shamans in 1967. in traditional shamanic societies, there exist speci\xef\xac\x81c traditions, histories, rituals and practices which provide a stable, long-term set and setting by which the drug experiences is interpreted and controlled. even then, the use of the substances is severely limited either to certain festival occasions or to certain individuals. we have none of this cultural support or control. the requisite cosmology, epistemology, eschatology and ethics that are absolute requirements for effective sacred use of the hallucinogens are not given to us by our society. even such things as the nitty gritty technical details about drug preparation, dosage and use are generally unavailable.anyone who uses these drugs at high doses without this knowledgerisks madness and personal destructionfortunately, as post-moderns we offer you a simple solution: do the research, educate yourself, and then make it up as you go along!the accumulated knowledge of all of humanity is available to you in the library or in the bookstores along telegraph avenue. read history, philosophy, anthropology, psychology and religion along with mythology, science \xef\xac\x81ction and fantasy. create your own mythology or religion. make it historic-scienti\xef\xac\x81c in foundation and science \xef\xac\x81ction-fantasy in style. sign on your best friend for the journey (the buddy system is a safety net). start with the works in the accompanying bibliography. they contain enough information to make you a world class expert in the psychedelics? engage in twice monthly psychedelic training sessions with your buddy.in three or four years you will have a shamanistic starship capable of reliably taking you to worlds of beauty and religious depth that have been available heretofore only to humanitys great geniuses, artists and mystics (no shit).what does it take? about the amount of effort dedication that it takes to get a phd in the humanities. if you arent willing to put in this level of effort, choose another path.we cant tell you the details of your shamanistic starship. it could be furnished as a monastic cell or as a plush pleasure dome or anything in between. the design is up to you. each shaman must find his or her own way. certainly we wouldnt even dream of suggesting a destination once you have built it. the possibilities are endless.just remember: dont buy anyones bullshit along the way (especially ours) and dont go the guru route. and for goddess sake, have fun along the way.one final warning: you must remember this - those who know dont speak and those who speak dont know. to loosely quote terrence mckenna "the mysteries stand revealed. they are no longer exclusively the province of yogins and adepts but are open to all those who truly seek."welcome to the neopaleolithic where we poor monkeys get back to the unfinished business of re-creating ourselves as angels and going to the stars.good luck! stay high and stay free!gracie and zarkov~~~in discussion of the darknet as a source of drugs. this idea is absolutely compatible with my ethics. in fact even if drugs were legalized; my preferred method of distribution would be through the darknet. vendors are held to a higher standard than corporations. it also keeps people from being persecuted for publicy buying drugs. discreet packages that blend in with the mail. its a genius idea, and i truly hope we as a community continue to be successful in jumping these hurdles.know your source. know your substance.ps.if youve tried mescaline; whether as a cactus, or extracted material. give dom a try. its an absolutely brilliant psychedelic. if you havent tried mescaline, i suggest you try mescaline - then give dom a try. theyre both brilliant in their own ways, and neither is "superior."', ['hacking tools'])

adequately express how deeply honored i was by your unconditional support of my staff.i do not expect the same reaction to todays revelations. this movement is built on integrity, and i feel obligated to be forthright with you.i held myself to a high standard as your leader, yet now i must utter words all too familiar to this scarred community:we have been hacked.nobody is in danger, no information has been leaked, and server access was never obtained by the attacker.our initial investigations indicate that a vendor exploited a recently discovered vulnerability in the bitcoin protocol known as "transaction malleability" to repeatedly withdraw coins from our system until it was completely empty.despite our hardening and pentesting procedures, this attack vector was outside of penetration testing scope due to being rooted in the bitcoin protocol itself.this attack hit us at the worst possible time. we were planning on re-launching the new auto-finalize and dispute center this past weekend, and our projections of order finalization volume indicated that we would need the communitys full balance in hot storage.in retrospect this was incredibly foolish, and i take full responsibility for this decision.i have failed you as a leader, and am completely devastated by todays discoveries. i should have taken mtgox and bitstamps lead and disabled withdrawals as soon as the malleability issue was reported. i was slow to respond and too skeptical of the possible issue at hand. it is a crushing blow. i cannot find the words to express how deeply i want this movement to be safe from the very threats i just watched materialize during my watch.ive included transaction logs at the bottom of this message. review the vendors dishonest actions and use whatever means you deem necessary to bring this person to justice. more details will emerge as we continue to investigate.given the right flavor of influence from our community, we can only hope that he will decide to return the coins with integrity as opposed to hiding like a coward.it takes the integrity of all of us to push this movement forward. whoever you are, you still have a chance to act in the interest of helping this community. keep a percentage, return the rest. dont walk away with your fellow freedom fighters coins. dpr2 returned the cold storage. i didnt run with the gold. but two people alone cannot move us forward. it takes an entire community committing to integrity - and though this crushing blow will not stop us, it sure is a testament to how greedy some bastards truly are.being a part of this movement might be the most defining thing you do with your entire life.dont trade that for greed, comrades.i will fight here by your side, even the greedy bastards amongst us.this community has suffered great financial loss over and over again, and i am devastated that it has happened again under my watch.hindsight is already suggesting dozens of ways this could have been prevented, but we must march onward.the only way to reverse a communitys greed is through generosity. our true character is revealed during trying times.if this financial hardship places you at risk of physical harm, contact me directly and i will do my best to help you with my remaining personal funds.- ----------------now what.- ----------------never again store your escrow bitcoins on a server.silk road will never again be a centralized escrow storage.this week has shown the collateral damage we can cause by being a huge target and failing in just one unforeseen area.i am now fully convinced that no hosted escrow service is safe.if i cannot trust myself to keep a hosted escrow solution safe, i cannot trust anyone.multi-signature transactions are the only way this community will be protected long-term.i am aggressively tasking our devs on building out multi-sig support for commonly-used bitcoin clients. expect a generous bounty if you have the skill to implement this.-

while we regroup.3. all listings on silk road are now no-escrow (finalize-early) for 1-2 months while we implement multi-signature transactions and lobby for mainstream bitcoin client multi-sig support.4. all unshipped orders have been cancelled.5. vendors may link to other marketplaces on a trail basis until we launch multi-sig, then we will re-evaluate based on community input. we do not want to be a centralized point of failure, but we also do not want to lead our buyers into dangerous waters.6. from this point forward do not trust markets with centralized escrow. use multi-signature transactions whenever possible, with trusted third parties as escrow providers.everything will be offline for 24-48 hours to minimize variables as we continue to investigate. the evidence we have below will be expanded based on our findings.- ------------------no marketplace is perfect. expect any centralized market to fail at some point. this is precisely why we must unite in the decision to decentralize.we are relieved that our security procedures protected user identities, and that no servers were compromised. this was not a worst-case scenario: nobody will be getting arrested from

(804113, 115617, 'cleannet?? https://www.simonsfoundation.org/quanta/20130917-a-jewel-at-the-heart-of-quantum-physics/physicists have discovered a jewel-like geometric object that dramatically simplifies calculations of particle interactions and challenges the notion that space and time are fundamental components of reality.\xc2\x93this is completely new and very much simpler than anything that has been done before,\xc2\x94 said andrew hodges, a mathematical physicist at oxford university who has been following the work.the revelation that particle interactions, the most basic events in nature, may be consequences of geometry significantly advances a decades-long effort to reformulate quantum field theory, the body of laws describing elementary particles and their interactions. interactions that were previously calculated with mathematical formulas thousands of terms long can now be described by computing the volume of the corresponding jewel-like \xc2\x93amplituhedron,\xc2\x94 which yields an equivalent one-term expression.\xc2\x93the degree of efficiency is mind-boggling,\xc2\x94 said jacob bourjaily, a theoretical physicist at harvard university and one of the researchers who developed the new idea. \xc2\x93you can easily do, on paper, computations that were infeasible even with a computer before.\xc2\x94the new geometric version of quantum field theory could also facilitate the search for a theory of quantum gravity that would seamlessly connect the large- and small-scale pictures of the universe. attempts thus far to incorporate gravity into the laws of physics at the quantum scale have run up against nonsensical infinities and deep paradoxes. the amplituhedron, or a similar geometric object, could help by removing two deeply rooted principles of physics: locality and unitarity.\xc2\x93both are hard-wired in the usual way we think about things,\xc2\x94 said nima arkani-hamed, a professor of physics at the institute for advanced study in princeton, n.j., and the lead author of the new work, which he is presenting in talks and in a forthcoming paper. \xc2\x93both are suspect.\xc2\x94locality is the notion that particles can interact only from adjoining positions in space and time. and unitarity holds that the probabilities of all possible outcomes of a quantum mechanical interaction must add up to one. the concepts are the central pillars of quantum field theory in its original form, but in certain situations involving gravity, both break down, suggesting neither is a fundamental aspect of nature.in keeping with this idea, the new geometric approach to particle interactions removes locality and unitarity from its starting assumptions. the amplituhedron is not built out of space-time and probabilities; these properties merely arise as consequences of the jewel\xc2\x92s geometry. the usual picture of space and time, and particles moving around in them, is a construct.\xc2\x93it\xc2\x92s a better formulation that makes you think about everything in a completely different way,\xc2\x94 said david skinner, a theoretical physicist at cambridge university.the amplituhedron itself does not describe gravity. but arkani-hamed and his collaborators think there might be a related geometric object that does. its properties would make it clear why particles appear to exist, and why they appear to move in three dimensions of space and to change over time.because \xc2\x93we know that ultimately, we need to find a theory that doesn\xc2\x92t have\xc2\x94 unitarity and locality, bourjaily said, \xc2\x93it\xc2\x92s a starting point to ultimately describing a quantum theory of gravity.\xc2\x94clunky machinerythe amplituhedron looks like an intricate, multifaceted jewel in higher dimensions. encoded in its volume are the most basic features of reality that can be calculated, \xc2\x93scattering amplitudes,\xc2\x94 which represent the likelihood that a certain set of particles will turn into certain other particles upon colliding. these numbers are what particle physicists calculate and test to high precision at particle accelerators like the large hadron collider in switzerland.the iconic 20th century physicist richard feynman invented a method for calculating probabilities of particle interactions using depictions of all the different ways an interaction could occur. examples of \xc2\x93feynman diagrams\xc2\x94 were included on a 2005 postage stamp honoring feynman.united states postal servicethe iconic 20th century physicist richard feynman invented a method for calculating probabilities of particle interactions using depictions of all the different ways an interaction could occur. examples of \xc2\x93feynman diagrams\xc2\x94 were included on a 2005 postage stamp honoring feynman.the 60-year-old method for calculating scattering amplitudes \xc2\x97 a major innovation at the time \xc2\x97 was pioneered by the nobel prize-winning physicist richard feynman. he sketched line drawings of all the ways a scattering process could occur and then summed the likelihoods of the different drawings. the simplest feynman diagrams look like trees: the particles involved in a collision come together like roots, and the particles that result shoot out like branches. more complicated diagrams have loops, where colliding particles turn into unobservable \xc2\x93virtual particles\xc2\x94 that interact with each other before branching out as real final products. there are diagrams with one loop, two loops, three loops and so on \xc2\x97 increasingly baroque iterations of the scattering process that contribute progressively less to its total amplitude. virtual particles are never observed in nature, but they were considered mathematically necessary for unitarity \xc2\x97 the requirement that probabilities sum to one.\xc2\x93the number of feynman diagrams is so explosively large that even computations of really simple processes weren\xc2\x92t done until the age of computers,\xc2\x94 bourjaily said. a seemingly simple event, such as two subatomic particles called gluons colliding to produce four less energetic gluons (which happens billions of times a second during collisions at the large hadron collider), involves 220 diagrams, which collectively contribute thousands of terms to the calculation of the scattering amplitude.in 1986, it became apparent that feynman\xc2\x92s apparatus was a rube goldberg machine.to prepare for the construction of the superconducting super collider in texas (a project that was later canceled), theorists wanted to calculate the scattering amplitudes of known particle interactions to establish a background against which interesting or exotic signals would stand out. but even 2-gluon to 4-gluon processes were so complex, a group of physicists had written two years earlier, \xc2\x93that they may not be evaluated in the foreseeable future.\xc2\x94stephen parke and tomasz taylor, theorists at fermi national accelerator laboratory in illinois, took that statement as a challenge. using a few mathematical tricks, they managed to simplify the 2-gluon to 4-gluon amplitude calculation from several billion terms to a 9-page-long formula, which a 1980s supercomputer could handle. then, based on a pattern they observed in the scattering amplitudes of other gluon interactions, parke and taylor guessed a simple one-term expression for the amplitude. it was, the computer verified, equivalent to the 9-page formula. in other words, the traditional machinery of quantum field theory, involving hundreds of feynman diagrams worth thousands of mathematical terms, was obfuscating something much simpler. as bourjaily put it: \xc2\x93why are you summing up millions of things when the answer is just one function?\xc2\x94\xc2\x93we knew at the time that we had an important result,\xc2\x94 parke said. \xc2\x93we knew it instantly. but what to do with it?\xc2\x94the amplituhedronthe message of parke and taylor\xc2\x92s single-term result took decades to interpret. \xc2\x93that one-term, beautiful little function was like a beacon for the next 30 years,\xc2\x94 bourjaily said. it \xc2\x93really started this revolution.\xc2\x94twistor diagrams depicting an interaction between six gluons, in the cases where two (left) and four (right) of the particles have negative helicity, a property similar to spin. the diagrams can be used to derive a simple formula for the 6-gluon scattering amplitude.arkani-hamed et al.twistor diagrams depicting an interaction between six gluons, in the cases where two (left) and four (right) of the particles have negative helicity, a property similar to spin. the diagrams can be used to derive a simple formula for the 6-gluon scattering amplitude.in the mid-2000s, more patterns emerged in the scattering amplitudes of particle interactions, repeatedly hinting at an underlying, coherent mathematical structure behind quantum field theory. most important was a set of formulas called the bcfw recursion relations, named for ruth britto, freddy cachazo, bo feng and edward witten. instead of describing scattering processes in terms of familiar variables like position and time and depicting them in thousands of feynman diagrams, the bcfw relations are best couched in terms of strange variables called \xc2\x93twistors,\xc2\x94 and particle interactions can be captured in a handful of associated twistor diagrams. the relations gained rapid adoption as tools for computing scattering amplitudes relevant to experiments, such as collisions at the large hadron collider. but their simplicity was mysterious.\xc2\x93the terms in these bcfw relations were coming from a different world, and we wanted to understand what that world was,\xc2\x94 arkani-hamed said. \xc2\x93that\xc2\x92s what drew me into the subject five years ago.\xc2\x94with the help of leading mathematicians such as pierre deligne, arkani-hamed and his collaborators discovered that the recursion relations and associated twistor diagrams corresponded to a well-known geometric object. in fact, as detailed in a paper posted to arxiv.org in december by arkani-hamed, bourjaily, cachazo, alexander goncharov, alexander postnikov and jaroslav trnka, the twistor diagrams gave instructions for calculating the volume of pieces of this object, called the positive grassmannian.named for hermann grassmann, a 19th-century german linguist and mathematician who studied its properties, \xc2\x93the positive grassmannian is the slightly more grown-up cousin of the inside of a triangle,\xc2\x94 arkani-hamed explained. just as the inside of a triangle is a region in a two-dimensional space bounded by intersecting lines, the simplest case of the positive grassmannian is a region in an n-dimensional space bounded by intersecting planes. (n is the number of particles involved in a scattering process.)it was a geometric representation of real particle data, such as the likelihood that two colliding gluons will turn into four gluons. but something was still missing.the physicists hoped that the amplitude of a scattering process would emerge purely and inevitably from geometry, but locality and unitarity were dictating which pieces of the positive grassmannian to add together to get it. they wondered whether the amplitude was \xc2\x93the answer to some particular mathematical question,\xc2\x94 said trnka, a post-doctoral researcher at the california institute of technology. \xc2\x93and it is,\xc2\x94 he said.a sketch of the amplituhedron representing an 8-gluon particle interaction. using feynman diagrams, the same calculation would take roughly 500 pages of algebra.nima arkani-hameda sketch of the amplituhedron representing an 8-gluon particle interaction. using feynman diagrams, the same calculation would take roughly 500 pages of algebra.arkani-hamed and trnka discovered that the scattering amplitude equals the volume of a brand-new mathematical object \xc2\x97 the amplituhedron. the details of a particular scattering process dictate the dimensionality and facets of the corresponding amplituhedron. the pieces of the positive grassmannian that were being calculated with twistor diagrams and then added together by hand were building blocks that fit together inside this jewel, just as triangles fit together to form a polygon.like the twistor diagrams, the feynman diagrams are another way of computing the volume of the amplituhedron piece by piece, but they are much less efficient. \xc2\x93they are local and unitary in space-time, but they are not necessarily very convenient or well-adapted to the shape of this jewel itself,\xc2\x94 skinner said. \xc2\x93using feynman diagrams is like taking a ming vase and smashing it on the floor.\xc2\x94arkani-hamed and trnka have been able to calculate the volume of the amplituhedron directly in some cases, without using twistor diagrams to compute the volumes of its pieces. they have also found a \xc2\x93master amplituhedron\xc2\x94 with an infinite number of facets, analogous to a circle in 2-d, which has an infinite number of sides. its volume represents, in theory, the total amplitude of all physical processes. lower-dimensional amplituhedra, which correspond to interactions between finite numbers of particles, live on the faces of this master structure.\xc2\x93they are very powerful calculational techniques, but they are also incredibly suggestive,\xc2\x94 skinner said. \xc2\x93they suggest that thinking in terms of space-time was not the right way of going about this.\xc2\x94quest for quantum gravitythe seemingly irreconcilable conflict between gravity and quantum field theory enters crisis mode in black holes. black holes pack a huge amount of mass into an extremely small space, making gravity a major player at the quantum scale, where it can usually be ignored. inevitably, either locality or unitarity is the source of the conflict.\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 puzzling thoughts\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 locality and unitarity are the central pillars of quantum field theory, but as the following thought experiments show, both break down in certain situations involving gravity. this suggests physics should be formulated without either principle.\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 locality says that particles interact at points in space-time. but suppose you want to inspect space-time very closely. probing smaller and smaller distance scales requires ever higher energies, but at a certain scale, called the planck length, the picture gets blurry: so much energy must be concentrated into such a small region that the energy collapses the region into a black hole, making it impossible to inspect. \xc2\x93there\xc2\x92s no way of measuring space and time separations once they are smaller than the planck length,\xc2\x94 said arkani-hamed. \xc2\x93so we imagine space-time is a continuous thing, but because it\xc2\x92s impossible to talk sharply about that thing, then that suggests it must not be fundamental \xc2\x97 it must be emergent.\xc2\x94\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 unitarity says the quantum mechanical probabilities of all possible outcomes of a particle interaction must sum to one. to prove it, one would have to observe the same interaction over and over and count the frequencies of the different outcomes. doing this to perfect accuracy would require an infinite number of observations using an infinitely large measuring apparatus, but the latter would again cause gravitational collapse into a black hole. in finite regions of the universe, unitarity can therefore only be approximately known.\xc2\x93we have indications that both ideas have got to go,\xc2\x94 arkani-hamed said. \xc2\x93they can\xc2\x92t be fundamental features of the next description,\xc2\x94 such as a theory of quantum gravity.string theory, a framework that treats particles as invisibly small, vibrating strings, is one candidate for a theory of quantum gravity that seems to hold up in black hole situations, but its relationship to reality is unproven \xc2\x97 or at least confusing. recently, a strange duality has been found between string theory and quantum field theory, indicating that the former (which includes gravity) is mathematically equivalent to the latter (which does not) when the two theories describe the same event as if it is taking place in different numbers of dimensions. no one knows quite what to make of this discovery. but the new amplituhedron research suggests space-time, and therefore dimensions, may be illusory anyway.\xc2\x93we can\xc2\x92t rely on the usual familiar quantum mechanical space-time pictures of describing physics,\xc2\x94 arkani-hamed said. \xc2\x93we have to learn new ways of talking about it. this work is a baby step in that direction.\xc2\x94even without unitarity and locality, the amplituhedron formulation of quantum field theory does not yet incorporate gravity. but researchers are working on it. they say scattering processes that include gravity particles may be possible to describe with the amplituhedron, or with a similar geometric object. \xc2\x93it might be closely related but slightly different and harder to find,\xc2\x94 skinner said.nima arkani-hamed, a professor at the institute for advanced study, and his former student and co-author jaroslav trnka, who finished his ph.d. at princeton university in july and is now a

jaroslav trnka, who finished his ph.d. at princeton university in july and is now a post-doctoral researcher at the california institute of technology.physicists must also prove that the new geometric formulation applies to the exact particles that are known to exist in the universe, rather than to the idealized quantum field theory they used to develop it, called maximally supersymmetric yang-mills theory. this model, which includes a \xc2\x93superpartner\xc2\x94 particle for every known particle and treats space-time as flat, \xc2\x93just happens to be the simplest test case for these new tools,\xc2\x94 bourjaily said. \xc2\x93the way to generalize these new tools to [other] theories is understood.\xc2\x94beyond making calculations easier or possibly leading the way to quantum gravity, the discovery of the amplituhedron could cause an even more profound shift, arkani-hamed said. that is, giving up space and time as fundamental constituents of nature and figuring out how the big bang and cosmological evolution of the universe arose out of pure geometry.\xc2\x93in a sense, we would see that change arises from the structure of the object,\xc2\x94 he said. \xc2\x93but it\xc2\x92s not from the object changing. the object is basically timeless.\xc2\x94while more work is needed, many theoretical physicists are paying close attention to the new ideas.the work is \xc2\x93very unexpected from several points of view,\xc2\x94 said witten, a theoretical physicist at the institute for advanced study. \xc2\x93the field is still developing very fast, and it is difficult to guess what will happen or what the lessons will turn out to be.\xc2\x94', ['hacking tools'])

since youre basically having to agree to route traffic for everyone else (and theyre agreeing to route traffic for you), its closer to "pay as you go", but youre paying with your own bandwidth.2. plausible deniability - just because traffic is coming from my i2p router instance, that doesnt necessarily mean its *my* traffic.\xc2\xa0 could be one of my peers traffic that im just routing.there are also some disadvantages (everything in life has a cost):1. i2p isnt "fire and forget".\xc2\xa0 you cant just connect, expect to get good bandwidth (as with tor) for free, then disconnect.\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0it really is built around the model that youre connected 24/7 (or at least, for hours on end) and always routing traffic for everyone.\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0the farther you stray from that model, the worse the performance gets.\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0you *can* connect to i2p in a hidden mode, where youre similar to a tor client, but performance is going to take a hit.\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0why would other i2p participants want to haul your traffic for you if youre not contributing to them?\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0i2p might take a few hours or a day to speed up to decent performance levels after you fire it up, and most complaints about its performance are from people who arent using it the way it was intended.2. i2p cant hide the real ips of its clients as well, because theyre relays too.\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0if everyone is a relay, everyone needs a way to know who all the relays are, and the net result is that its much easier to build a list of *all* i2p relays at any given time.\xc2\xa0 this opens up some attacks, where an adversary harvests lists of *all* i2p relays on a regular basis (i.e. who all is using i2p right now?), then works that into an intersection attack.\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0basically, "whom posted at times x, y, and z.\xc2\xa0 which i2p relays were all online at those three times?".\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0over time, intersection attacks get very effective.\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0one criticism that has been argued to hell and back at srfv2 is that in a marketplace scenario, if an adversary already knows a rough geographic location for an i2p user (i.e. they received a package from a vendor located in seattle), that intersection attack gets much easier.\xc2\xa0 not going to rehash it here.3. its hasnt received as much scrutiny.\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0academics have been beating on the tor network for a decade.\xc2\xa0 very few analyses of i2p have occurred, and that doesnt mean its problem-free.. it just means that nobodys looked at it closely.the third, rarely-mentioned network is freenet, which is a high-latency network that works much differently from tor and i2p.\xc2\xa0 wont bore you with that description here.hope that helps a little.\xc2\xa0 it gets complicated quick, and everybody ends up getting into religious battles over this versus that.\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0theyre both pretty interesting technologies, and neither one really stands up well to adversaries like nsa over the long haul, but theyre really all everyone has to work with right now.does a vpn running with i2p increases the security?', ['None'])

(581725, 83612, 'nice schuldig! really good overview of lsd doses! i concur entirely! i always enjoy threads like this with everyones two cents on dosage compiled. ill work my way through posting dose guides for: mescaline, 4-aco-dmt, 2c-b, dmt, & mda. ill start with psilocybin mushrooms.its unclear to me whether 2c-e & 2c-d are prohibited substances, but i can also comment on those. i might also comment on ghb, i was originally skeptical of this substance, but have since found its an incredible companion for psychedelics - and following some research is not nearly as harmful as its reputation suggests.psilocybinthis is incredibly variable. different species of mushroom have wildly different dosages -- for "average" commercial mushrooms (psilocybe cubensis), even the dose can be really hard to pinpoint based on strain, freshness, etc.strain & quality of mushroom seems to effect the psychedelic high; with certain species feeling more stimulating and others more dreamy. yawning is a very common effect with psilocybin & its relatives (4-aco-dmt, etc.) -- but doesnt necessarily indicated tiredness.some individuals find psilocybin makes them feel sluggish and uncoordinated, while others are embodied by the spirit of absolute grace. ~~~0.2 - 0.8 grams this is a very light dosage, ranging from a "microdose" to a really good companion dosage to a phenethylamine or just with several good cups of tea plus a good hike where you want to stay functional. very few visuals (if any), but a nicely altered headspace. some people like to avoid any dosage which will be "underwhelming," but i personally really appreciate intentionally mild doses. taking such doses has created an awareness in me of many effects of psychedelics which were very much overshadowed when consuming a full or high dose. also it can be a really nice alternative to smoking marijuana or alcohol in social situations; personality dependent. 1 - 2.5 grams (4 hours; +3 hours afterglow)solid psychedelic effects begin. oev are usually very mild, but cev definitely begin to occur vividly at this level. **with specially potent shrooms (or if consuming fresh shrooms; read: 10 - 25 grams - fresh) this can be very intense if theyre great shrooms. if average this is a solid "average dose."2 - 4 grams (5-6 hours; +3 hours afterglow)visuals begin in earnest - with oev becoming much more common. headspace can become very confused & paranoid - or absolutely brilliant & clear; it just depends on what you bring, psychologically speaking, to the experience. in combination with a great set & setting, doses in this range can be absolutely transcendent.3 - 5 grams (6 hours; +3 hours afterglow, may feel strange 1-2 days afterwards depending on trip)visuals smash you in the face; mental processes can feel like a rollercoaster. depending on the individual, and the space & headspace they choose to trip; the universe can appear to be synchronized into perfect harmony -- or absolute chaos.5 grams+\xc2\xa0 (6 hours; +3 hours afterglow, may feel strange for several days or months afterwards depending on trip)breakthrough: this is a massive dose unless you have tolerance, or a very low sensitivity to psychedelics this will lead to an incredibly intense experience. the mushrooms could also be incredibly weak, but ive personally never encountered "commercial" magic mushrooms with such a low quality (even degraded by very poor storage) ...it can almost feel like a dmt peak for many hours. visuals will be abundant, enthralling & detailed, both oev & cev. this dose is prone to causing sudden psychological changes for better or worse. personally i feel such a dose is unnecessary and its better to take a lower dose and potentiate it with other substances, or methods of enhancing psychedelic experiences like: setting intention, meditation, breathing, yoga, sex, tantra, mantra, or whatever method (however you might have learned it) which works for you.', ['None'])

information is on how the dead/rainbow/origanal family handle lsd.when lsd crystal is bought it comes in little glass viles. it's a dense crystal and a gram of it looks alot smaller than a gram of coke or flour(or other powder). ten grams can fit in a vile small enough to hold in your hand and clentch your fist and conceal.anyway as i said in my other thread [http://mycotopia.net...lotter-lsd.html when you first buy crystal from the family their's 2 requirement's. 1. you have to be taught how to lay it properly and be trusted to do so on your own. 2. you have to do a thumbprint. the family believes lsd crystal should only be handled by those with the proper energy or karma to do so. there's no better way to test somebodys faith of lsd than give them a thumbprint.originaly thumprints were given by taking the glass vile and puting your thumb overthe top of the vile and turning it and fliping it upside down real quick. this put a coating of crystal on your thumb which was pessed into the palm of the person ,leaving your crystal imbedded thumbrint in there palm(hence the term thumprint) where it would absorb(or they might lick it off.). this was your certification nowadays thumbprints are eaten. any time someone eats crystal it's refered to as a print. this way was adopted because it's more efficiant.as for the experiance itself. all reviever's are experianced with lsd(at least they think so until there printed ) you feel it almost instantly. lsd crystal has an energy to it. having a jar of it my pocket is enough to alter my conciousness. as soon as it touches your skin or goes in your mouth you can feel it. alot of folks will throw up within minutes. this is an exorcism of sorts. like all the negative energy being cast out of your body. then you lay down and learn. as for the experiance i just couldn't do it justice to describe it. your never the same again.a thumprint doesn't open the door of perception it blows it off the hinges.you melt into eternety. you let go and die into the moment which is all. there is no you anymore only all. the intensity of this can't be described, but you realize as your sliping away that it's familar.this is because it become quite clear this is exactlly what happens when you die. after an eternity you slowly start to come back in pieces. you feel reborn and a completely different person. you don't ever come completely down or back. this isn't a bad thing ,but it's very scary at first.i won't try to describe it any more because i can't. also after your experianced with eating crystal its a little less tramatic. your first one is spent on the ground. after awhile i could eat crystal at shows and whatnot.i have only seen one print go bad and i described this in my other thread. the guy says it's the most important event of his life and now lives happily so i guess it wasn't bad. his reaction at the time was.i think psychedelics are safer in large doses(i'm not talking about thumbprint sizes though) as far as bad trips go. they override your ego's defenses in large enough doses. you can't think your having a bad trip because you can't think at all beacause there is no you. :dterrance mckenna and andrew weil md have said this also.it is hard to describe a thumbprint. human language cannot describe an experiance that is encompasses all of life. every cell of every creature or living thing that ever lived or will live is connected by the energy or light. when we die are body and our ego is gone. we become one with eternity or the light or god or whatever name you wish to call it. a thumbprint allows this to happen and rerturn to our physical body. my first print i layed down and quickly realized that this was my actual death. you watch the whole process unfold with complete awareness.i didn't cling to my body i just realized my life had passed. as i was spiraling up or out i saw my life evolve through the years i lived. the happiness, the sadness,the people i loved and the people i didn't. the joy that i gave and the pain that i caused. i saw the true nature of reality and why things were the way they were. as i got higher i saw the nature of reality on the cosmic scale and saw that the reason for our evolution was to experiance love. to love is to have experianced the finest of life. then came the moment were it was time to let go. as i did it came for me and i sobbed uncontrolabley for i realized that the light or energy we call god or creation was perfect. it was pure unconditional love.what else could god have been i realized. that glint of innocent perfection in a baby's eye. the light was pure as the heart of jesus christ. i dissolved into it and died. since there was no me only the all ,i cannot remember the rest because there was no me to remember. after forever i slowly decended into my body.i spent days awake afterwards talking to myself. i vowed to god to spread lsd so others could see the light. i vowed to look at every person as the lord and treat them as such.i was reborn and continue to live by the values i learned. i became as active as i could spreading lsd. year after year in hotel rooms with a pyrex pan and watercolor paper. hoping excitedly that some of these hit's will help guide my brothers and sisters back towards the light. lsd is a direct message from god. period. i don't think we get another chance. we can love each other or we can kill each other ,but it is up to us. as i always say in my threads as a reminder, my work with lsd ended years ago.as for eating and going to the bathroom. i don't think i ate for a week afterwards. as for going to the bathroom i hadn't eaten before hand at my guides advise so it wasn't a problem. i remember letting go as it got dark and coming back a lttle before sunrise. i was high for along time afterwards and as i said earlier you never fully return. i feel high all the time still and its been years.also i did many, many prints after that. i have eaten a lot of crystal but it was never like that first time.i must stress that i was in the company of very evolved and older people that made sure my experiances were optimal. these were kind old spirits that had been were i was going many years before and many times. they held me as a baby every inch of the way.you have heard of near death experiances right. a thumbprint is a beyond death experiance.i have a rich life now thats full of good fortune. a wonderful wife and 3 children who are completely wonderful. every day is complete joy. i couldn't ask for more, but i know it will end one day for good. i await this day with no fear ,but the knowlege that that most rewarding and enlightening experiance of life is death....ok i'll tell you about the one that went bad.this finds me in oakland in the early 90's. between tour's i would sit out in san francisco and keep things flowing. friends from the east coast would need shit so i would lay it and mail it or others would come out to get a lower price and i would lay it and send them on there way. well a real good friend came out to get 4 or 5 grams.with him he had a few people. i told him he could help me lay it and to have his friends hang out in the city till were done. he says this friend of his is ready to come with us. now i had talked to the guy before and knew he was connected to the rainbow family, but his energy seamed weird. trusting my friends judgement i said alright.so we decide to drive over to oakland to lay it in a hotel. we get to some sleazy hotel out by the freeway and get ready. now i'm a little edgy about this newbie watching, but as long as he stays out of the way it's fine. so we get to work and it takes quite awhile to lay 5 grams of acid. thats 50 tenpack or 50,000 doses. were done and cleanin up and he say my friend is ready for a print. i'm like are you sure and he says i think so. i look at his friend and he's like just give it to me i can handle it. so i get out my jar of silver crystal and knock some out on the nightstand because my friend wants to take some with him to do in the mountains.well this fuckin dude sticks his finger right in my pile of crystal and then licks it. i'm like thats a pretty hefty dose there soldier. he's like ya whatever now what do we do. then i started to realize it was going to get weird. within 2 minutes he's saying man my fuckin stomach hurt's that was poison. i'm like go in the bathroom your going to puke. he goes in there and and we hear him cussin and puking. meanwhile i'm askin my friend what the hell he's got us into. then the bathroom door opens and he comes out butt naked saying i'm gettin the fuck out of here.were like no man just chill your not going to be able to get far. we put him in the back bedroom and turn the lights out and figure thats best for him. i close the door and tell him if he needs me were there. i figure he's got some things to sort out with god. now this hotel is right on the freeway. in fact you can jump out the window onto it. were also on the second floor. well were sitting there and i'm making some phone calls telling people i'm going to be hung up for awhile and i hear cars on the freeway honking. we go back into the bedroom and he's halfway out the window, getting ready to jump onto the oakland freeway naked as the day he was born.we pull him back into the room and he's starting to realize he's dying.he thinks i'm causing him to die and i'm the devil. now shit gets ugly. he's screaming at us that he's dieing and trying to get out of the hotel. since i just layed 5 grams i'm high also as is my friend. we call some other friends to come over. were holding him down on the bed trying to cover his mouth. we have 50,000 doses of freshly layed lsd in the room and i don't need the cops coming. i take the pan and all the supplies i used to lay with and throw them out the window onto the freeway.my other friends get there and we tell the girls take the acid and get out of hear quick. this guy's screaming at the top of his lungs that he's dying and i know the other hotel guest's can here him. it's got to be any minute that the oakland police show up. i'm telling him to let go ,don't fight it. he thinks i'm satan so he's not listening to anything i say. also as we have been wrestling him he has lost control of his bodily fluids. there's puke ,shit and piss all over. i can't imagine what the cops are going to think when they come in and see a couple hippies on some guy covered in puke and shit screaming i'm dying as we tell him it's ok he'll like it.after awhile he stops moving. he was sucked into eternity. he was gone. as he layed there motionless we cleaned him up. and my friend sang amazing grace over and over to him. after an hour passed i realized the cops hadn't came. i contribute this to 2 things. the protection of god and the fact we were in a nasty part of oakland and people mind there own buisness.my girl comes by and brings us clean shirts and pants. itake a shower and clean up as they watch him and then we take turns. my nerves are frazzled. i'm high and this guys bad trip has really wigged me out. me and my girl decide to go for a walk since my friends with him and he's not moving. we get out side and realize that going for a walk at 3 am in oakland isn't going to be good. she senses my tension and we go to the side of the hotel in some bushes were she layes me down and sets my mind at ease with that magic only a woman can perform.as dawn breaks he's coming around. talking incoherantly ,but i can see a sparkle in his eye. we all part ways and me and my girl head back to sf to get some sleep.a day or two later my friend calls and says there heading home and to come say goodbye. i get there and this guy comes up to me and gives me a big hug and says he's sorry. i tell him don't worry about it. he then tells me that he met god and was a different person now. this makes me happy.this man hasn't taken lsd since and lives in oregon and owns a organic farm.he's happy with a family and at peace.he says that night was the most important and best thing that ever happened to him. i see him at the oregon county fair every year and we always have a big hug.he's turned into somebody i really admire and love.after this incedent i became very carefull of who i printed.", ['hacking tools'])

(61886, 14961, 'i was intrigued by psychedelics since my first psilocybin trip just as i turned into an adult - officially. i had become disillusioned with alcohol and marijuana; as it was consumed by the general populace, but within these fungi i found such pleasure and clarity. truly a satisfying and rewarding substance.psilocybin piqued my interest and soon there-after, i gave lsd a try. before trying anything else, or even more lsd - i approached the subject very cautiously. substance, source, and purity were absolutely of incredible importance. in the meantime i did a lot of reading, becoming very knowledgeable about alexander shulgin and erowid. then i found gracie & zarkov, the following passage moved me. leading to my first experiments with mda & 2c-b a few years later. recently (about 1.5 years ago) i re-experienced this article and i feel like i truly integrated the knowledge & wisdom contained within.i was originally very suspicious & careful about consuming drugs/psychedelics more than 1-2 times/year. however, recently i\'ve made come to a conclusion that i have dedicated so much to the pursuit of knowledge behind these substances that they truly are my allies. i still don\'t consume them more than maybe 1/month, but i just follow my feelings on that one. my primary allies are as follows:mescaline, dom, psilocybin, mda, 4-aco-dmt, dmt, 2c-b, dob, 2c-e, 2c-d, 2c-i, and sativa cannabis (although usually not in-combination with psychedelics, as i believe it defeats the headspace i am trying to achieve .. increases the visuals, but deteriorates the mental clarity). harmala-alkaloids also, but never in combination with anything but tryptamines.i\'ve also tried & loved 2c-t-7, dxm, d-amphetamine, and mdpv. i respect the destructive power of stimulants immensely and can count on one hand the number of times i\'ve used d-amphetamine/mdpv in the past 10 years. also rarely use dissociatives, few times a year at most.tried & am neutral: mdma, 5-meo-mipt, 2c-p, ketamine (although i\'ve had some great experiences in combination with 2c-b), mxetried & dislike: 5-meo-dipt, doc, butt plugslist of things i\'d like to try: doi, dpt, bufotenine (5-oh-dmt), tma-series, mmda, aleph-series, and ganesha. things i\'ve decided to avoid: nbome-series, most very recently developed rc\'s (especially stimulants), methylone~~~let us restate our position clearly: psychedelic drugs give the shaman reliable means of entering alternative reality tunnels that are at least as real as our everyday reality. the shaman\'s task, therefore, is to become familiar with their effect and applications. psychedelic drugs are powerful tools, and powerful tools, like heavy construction equipment, can cause fatalities when operated by untrained personnel.naive or recreational use of psychedelic drugs does not make one either a shaman or a saint. if this were true, the bay area would have been overrun by saints and shamans in 1967. in traditional shamanic societies, there exist speci\xef\xac\x81c traditions, histories, rituals and practices which provide a stable, long-term set and setting by which the drug experiences is interpreted and controlled. even then, the use of the substances is severely limited either to certain festival occasions or to certain individuals. we have none of this cultural support or control. the requisite cosmology, epistemology, eschatology and ethics that are absolute requirements for effective sacred use of the hallucinogens are not given to us by our society. even such things as the nitty gritty technical details about drug preparation, dosage and use are generally unavailable.anyone who uses these drugs at high doses without this knowledgerisks madness and personal destructionfortunately, as post-moderns we offer you a simple solution: do the research, educate yourself, and then make it up as you go along!the accumulated knowledge of all of humanity is available to you in the library or in the bookstores along telegraph avenue. read history, philosophy, anthropology, psychology and religion along with mythology, science \xef\xac\x81ction and fantasy. create your own mythology or religion. make it historic-scienti\xef\xac\x81c in foundation and science \xef\xac\x81ction-fantasy in style. sign on your best friend for the journey (the buddy system is a safety net). start with the works in the accompanying bibliography. they contain enough information to make you a world class expert in the psychedelics? engage in twice monthly psychedelic training sessions with your buddy.in three or four years you will have a shamanistic starship capable of reliably taking you to worlds of beauty and religious depth that have been available heretofore only to humanity\'s great geniuses, artists and mystics (no shit).what does it take? about the amount of effort dedication that it takes to get a phd in the humanities. if you aren\'t willing to put in this level of effort, choose another path.we can\'t tell you the details of your shamanistic starship. it could be furnished as a monastic cell or as a plush pleasure dome or anything in between. the design is up to you. each shaman must find his or her own way. certainly we wouldn\'t even dream of suggesting a destination once you have built it. the possibilities are endless.just remember: don\'t buy anyone\'s bullshit along the way (especially ours) and don\'t go the guru route. and for goddess\' sake, have fun along the way.one final warning: you must remember this - those who know don\'t speak and those who speak don\'t know. to loosely quote terrence mckenna "the mysteries stand revealed. they are no longer exclusively the province of yogins and adepts but are open to all those who truly seek."welcome to the neopaleolithic where we poor monkeys get back to the unfinished business of re-creating ourselves as angels and going to the stars.good luck! stay high and stay free!gracie and zarkov~~~in discussion of the darknet as a source of drugs. this idea is absolutely compatible with my ethics. in fact even if drugs were legalized; my preferred method of distribution would be through the darknet. vendors are held to a higher standard than corporations. it also keeps people from being persecuted for publicy buying drugs. discreet packages that blend in with the mail. it\'s a genius idea, and i truly hope we as a community continue to be successful in jumping these hurdles.know your source. know your substance.ps.if you\'ve tried mescaline; whether as a cactus, or extracted material. give dom a try. it\'s an absolutely brilliant psychedelic. if you haven\'t tried mescaline, i suggest you try mescaline - then give dom a try. they\'re both brilliant in their own ways, and neither is "superior."', ['hacking tools'])

(65217, 15366, 'this guide was originally written as a harm reduction guide to mda, but the guidelines outlined here also apply to mdma. i hope that this information reaches you all and better informs you of how to approach mdxx use. protect your minds, my friends. it is the most valuable thing you possess. mda (methylenedioxyamphetamine) has been shown to have a neurotoxic effect on the 5-ht (serotonin) axons when abused. many users will state that mda is completely safe to use often, but this is a false preconception based on nothing more than anecdotal claims that have zero scientific backing. there have been hundreds of studies throughout the years that outline both mda\'s, and it\'s methylated cousin mdma\'s, neurotoxicity, and not taking the time to value the information they have uncovered is altogether unwise.with this in mind, mda can be used safely with no backlash assuming a set of precautions are followed when using it.1) do not roll more than once a month at least, with emphasis on trying to allow 2-3 months between use.2) a safe dosing guideline for mda is typically 1.0-1.5mg/kg. for instance, if you weigh 80kg, your dosage will be between 80-120mg depending on desired intensity. 80mg will be a light and sociable dose and 120mg will be a much heavier dose.3) keep your body temperature low and stay hydrated! this is perhaps the most important guideline in preventing neurotoxicity. ensure above all else that you are not overexerting yourself.4) antioxidants such as alpha lipoic acid, vitamin c, vitamin e, green tea extract (egcg), and magnesium glycinate will heavily aid in alleviating neurotoxicity, protecting your brain, and improving your roll.a more explanation on each of these points...- moderation is absolutely pivotal when using mda. mda releases serotonin in vast amounts and inhibits the enzyme tryptophan hydroxalyse (tph), which is responsible for creating more serotonin. because this inhibition is permanent, the body must compensate by creating more tph, and this restoration period typically takes between 1-3 months depending on the user\'s diet and exercise patterns. with this in mind, the healthier you are, the quicker the process is. exercise is phenomenal for speeding up this process as exercise stimulates a release of bdnf which encourages the growth of new serotonin axons. the bottom line is this: spread out your use. depending on your health and exercise habits, wait at least one month between use, with a strong emphasis on waiting a preferred 2-3 months.- dosing and redosing are also two very large components of mda neurotoxicity. the higher you dose, the more prone you are to mda\'s neurotoxic effects. a general guideline for safely dosing mda is 1.0-1.5mg/kg. for example, if you weigh 80kg, the optimal dosage for mda is between 80-120mg. whether you choose 80mg or 120mg depends on how intense you want the experience to be and is entirely dependant on your choice. subjectively speaking on the intensity of effects,, 80mg will be a light, sociable dose, 100mg a moderate dose, and 120mg a high dose. because many users will choose to dose higher in search of a more intense experience, i will offer two critical insights: mda is much more potent than mdma, so try to avoid dosing too high, and more importantly, do not redose! redosing is highly unwise, entirely pointless, and plays a huge role in neurotoxicity and will lead to a terrible comedown.for a better representation of why this is bad, let me put it into a rough and incredibly oversimplified analogy. think of your serotonin transport system (sert) as a dam. this dam moderates your serotonin levels by slowly releasing it to control everything from mood, appetite, sleep, heart rate, libido, and so forth. when you ingest mda, it essentially takes control of the floodgates of this dam, opens them up to full capacity, and releases all the serotonin available behind it. what happens when you release all of the serotonin behind this dam? you must wait a while for the levels to return to normal. opening the floodgates to a dam with no water behind it makes absolutely no sense, and this is essentially what redosing mda does. you will not roll harder or longer by taking more; instead, you are simply making your comedown exponentially worse and increasing mda induced neurotoxicity.- keep your body temperature low! do not overexert yourself when dancing as hyperthermia is the leading cause of mda induced neurotoxicity due to a rise in oxidative stress. when your body temperature rises, you body\'s natural process for preventing oxidative stress (antioxidants) becomes less efficient. that lowering of efficiency is exponential. the higher your body temperature gets, the faster reactive oxygen species are created, which damage your brain. a fantastic way to keep your body temperature low is thc (yes, smoking marijuana helps mda neurotoxicity too!), ensuring you dance in moderation, and making sure that you stay properly hydrated. in that breath, do not over-hydrate. depending on the amount of physical activity you are undergoing, 16-24oz of water every hour is optimal for staying hydrated. also, did i mention to keep your body temperature low?- preloading and postloading are two staples for enriching the mda experience and almost entirely negating the potential for neurotoxic damage. not only do they alleviate neurotoxicity, but you will find your roll to be much more smooth and grant you with a beautiful afterglow instead of a hangover. here are a few essential supplements that are key to a proper regimen. if you are unable to purchase these supplements or take them as advised, i will recommend that green tea, orange juice, or emergen-c packets as they will lightly aide in providing antioxidants. however, these two should not be considered an all inclusive replacement. they come recommended on a "better than nothing" basis and pressure should be placed on picking up the appropriate supplements.* na-r-ala (alpha lipoic acid): this is a powerful antioxidant that eliminates free roaming reactive oxygen and nitrogen particles, in turn reducing neurotoxicity. dose 100mg of na-r-ala 30 minutes prior to rolling and 2 hours into the roll. ensure that you purchase the na-r-ala isomer form of ala. while racemic ala is okay, na-r-ala is much more efficient.* magnesium glycinate: magnesium is a phenomenal substance that will alleviate the bruxism (jaw clenching) and fasciculations (muscle twitches) commonly experienced when taking mda. dose 400mg elemental magnesium glycinate 6 hours prior to rolling, again 30 minutes prior, and finally 2 hours into the roll. be sure you purchase either magnesium glycinate (preferred) or magnesium citrate. the most common form, magnesium oxide, is not readily absorbed, so completely avoid it.* vitamin c: the most common antioxidant out there and has been shown to mitigate mda induced hepatotoxicity and neurotoxicity. dose 1,000mg of vitamin c 30 minutes prior to rolling.* vitamin e: a powerful antioxidant that will seek out free radicals. dose 400 iu 30 minutes prior to rolling.* green tea extract (egcg): egcg is a potent antioxidant and diuretic. it will help with the urinary retention arising from mda induced vasopressin release. dose 400mg 30 minutes prior, and 2 hours into the roll.* 5-htp: 5-htp is the direct precursor to serotonin. supplementing 100mg of 5-htp with 400mg of egcg (egcg will help 5-htp cross the blood-brain barrier more efficiently) at bedtime for 5-7 days after rolling will aid your body in restoring serotonin to their proper levels. warning: 5-htp can cause cardiac fibrosis when used in high doses over extended periods of time, so avoid taking 5-htp in high doses for more than 5-7 days.* melatonin: melatonin is created from serotonin, and since your serotonin levels will be low, taking a melatonin supplement will help you fall asleep. melatonin is also a powerful antioxidant. take 5-10mg of melatonin prior to falling asleep after rolling.in the end, the best advice that can be offered is to simply be smart. know your limits, follow common sense, and remember exactly why you\'re taking mda. cherish and value the experience; don\'t tarnish it by abusing it and harming your mind and body.sources (clearnet)* supplements:http://www.geronova.com/sites/default/files/alt_med_rev_2008_0.pdfhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/s1044576584710128http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15212815http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11931860http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14740000* neurotoxicity:http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7582557http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2457659http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1784586http://www.maps.org/publications/1987_stone_3.pdf', ['hacking tools'])
(65229, 15366, "none of the above supplements have provided me with any stomach discomfort in my experience, but obviously all of our bodies are different and react to things differently. your best bet is to simply have a test run without mdma and see how you feel when taking the supplements. also, i typically eat a decently sized meal 2-3 hours prior to rolling and taking supplements with food in your belly always helps. i know most people like to fast before, but i like to get my nutrition in prior to launching. also, this guide obviously errs on the extreme side of caution and was written to be a helpful resource on what to take. this pre-load/post-load regimen is what i recommend for instances where you will be exerting yourself a lot (dancing at a festival in the heat, for instance) and need as much protection as possible. if you are going to be rolling at home on the couch under the a/c with easy access to cold water, you really probably only need one dose of ala, and vitamin c for antioxidant purposes, and magnesium glycinate for alleviating jaw discomfort. the big keys to mitigating neurotoxicity are to take a reasonable dose and to keep your body temperature low. if you can do that, you're off to a great start!", ['hacking tools'])

information in this thread was generously provided by chinacat72, a member of mycotopia forum, in 2005."i will discuss lsd crystal and what happens with it. this info is from my experiences a long time ago.i can safely offer it because i have retired from this line of work and stay far away from it. first i will briefly discuss the people or family as there called so you can get an appreciation for what they do and have done. the family is motivated to spread lsd because we believe that lsd is a key givin to us from above. lsd was givin to man from god to help him see the error of his ways. why do you think it was discovered during the most horrible time in history. it is the antidote for the atomic bomb. it`s doesn`t matter if you beleive this or not ,because what i`m trying to express is how deeply important the family feels about the sacred value of lsd. those who are at the upper level`s of the family will gladly sacrifice there lifes and freedom to do this work. ok now down to the crystal. i have little knowlege about lsd manufacture so i`m going to talk about the final product the crystal. on tour crystal came in brown glass bottles with 1-10 grams in them. the bottles were sealed and contained co2 and crystal. you can`t just buy crystal from family. first you have to be taught how to lay it ,which i`ll cover in a little bit. also you have to do a thumbprint(eat it) there are no exeptions to this rule.the reason is to make sure your karma is clean enough to handle this sacred work. types of crystal needlepoint -very pure(95% ) white powerdery crystal,was available in small amount`s. the best of the best white fluff -very pure(95% ) white light flakes of crystal. still around and the most sought after. very pure silver -good and clean(85-90% )-light greyish crystal. was an unbelievable amount of this around in the late eighty`s and early nineties. very good stuff. my first thumbprint was this kind. if you ate acid in the 80-90`s you probably sampled some silver. amber -decent(70%?) this crystal varied from a light amber color to an almost dark brown color.was always available.one batch called quadricept amber was the color of light honey and was very good.lot`s a people worked with this crystal but i always would use silver instead since it was better and the same price. lavender -(60-70%?) light purple to almost black colored crystal. like amber it varied batch to batch. tj (tornado juice) - purity unknown. i seen this shit in about four different colors and it always scared me. no experiance with it. champagne -(50-60% ) black crystal, nasty stuff imho. i worked with it once and swore to never touch it again. ok so you got some crystal and need to get it on blotter. it`s a pretty amazing feeling holding a jar in your hands that has 10 grams of crystal in it. that`s 100,000 doses in the palm of your hand. for dealing with laying we`ll say we got 1 gram. acid is always layed 1 gram=10 tenpacks. a tenpack is tensheets. 1gram=10,000doses. if your laying needlpoint your doses will be 95mcg, because your crystal is 95% pure. if your laying amber your shit will be 70mcg, because it`s 70% pure. got it now you get a glass pyrex pan to dip your tenpacks in. your crystal is dissovled into 110ml. of everclear per gram.the purer crystals dissolve instantly with a little stirring. the not so pure take a little shaking. champange is damn near impossible to get to dissolve evenly. paper-for white blotter standard watercolor paper#14 or equivalent is used. it`s critical you get the right paper. if you don`t it won`t absorb right and you`ll fuck it all up.print`s are made up ahead of time and perferated.ok so you got your crystal dissolved and your paper cut and ready. there are 2 schools when it comes to putting it on the paper. first dump the solution in the pan and dip each tenpack into it then lift it up and let any excess solution run off into the pan. second method is to put the tenpack into the pan and squirt the solution on it with a baby syringe(the ones they give little kids medicine with). i have done both and prefer dipping them just because its quicker .then the tenpacks are layed out to dry which doesn`t take long since alcohol evaporates quickly. if you did it right there will be very little residue left in the bottom of the pan.this redidue is extremely potent and is either soaked up with a piece of paper(called mop up) or made into potent liquid(called wash). whatever you choose this is saved for your personal use. while your doing all this you get very,very high. as soon as you open the jar of crystal it intoxicates the air. most people were rubber gloves when doing this some don`t. just don`t have any plans afterwards. there might be slightly different methods used when laying, but this is how the dead family does it. after the tenpacks are dryed there distibuted and eaten up. since the end of the grateful dead the massive distribution network that used to get rid of so much acid has been broken up badly. never fear acid is still out there" lsd is still around though it seems that a majority of the labs are inactive at the moment. this is normal as they don`t produce all the time. most like the silver family only produce about every 5 years. though they usually produce enough to last that long. when the grateful dead toured massive amount`s of lsd were distributed around the country. on a typical east coast tour 100-150grams could easily be sold. thats a million to a million and a half doses. this flooded these citys and the lsd trickled down to every nook and cranny of america. by the time it was dry again another tour would roll through the region and resupply it. plus we would meet people on tour from certain area`s of the country and keep them supplied with the help of the good ole usps. sadly when the dead stopped touring this network went into shambles. people fell out of touch and with no shows ,there wasn`t the marketplace for distibution.in turn parts of the country arn`t getting saturated anymore. lsd isn`t moved and sold like the cartel`s move coke and such. it`s handled by a brotherhood of people who truly believe there doing the work of god(or whatever name you call creation). we believe that lsd crystal has to be handled by the right people who are totally committed to the movement. when we moved crystal there was always the feeling that we were protected by a higher power. i can`t tell you how many times i have had crystal or acid on me or my brothers and have been in situation`s where we should have gotten busted and something always protected us. so many times that coincidence is not an option. why do i think we were protected. because the family does it for mankind not money. we viewed lsd as the only hope for the radical change in conciousness that would save us. so in effect we viewed are work as the work of god. you know why they never busted a family lab? because we would never betray lsd. just as jesus was nailed to the cross we were willing to spend the rest of our lives in jail or die to protect what we viewed as the salvation of are species. sound`s a little dramatic doesn`t it, but i`m trying to give you an understanding of the faith in lsd that the family has. by the way the kansas bust was not a family lab incase anybody is wondering. the point i`m trying to make is the family believes lsd has to move through the right hands. this is why you can`t go down to the corner and get a gram of crystal. sorry to ramble. as some of the cooks retire i rest assure you that they pass there recipes and secret`s down to those chosen to continue to fight the good fight. i don`t think it will ever be as readily available all over the country as it once was due to the break up of the distribution cycle of tour. i could be wrong and hope i am. alot of old family have moved on and including myself retired, feeling we served our time. the family does hear your cry`s for more acid and they don`t plan on giving up on mankind. now\'s a good time for labs to be inactive. the current government administration is viewed as a bad storm that needs to pass as jerry sang "all good things in all good time" keep the faith""for me and the rest of the people on tour it was just a matter of spending year after year on tour. the elder`s that are on top keep in a eye on everybody that help`s move there stuff. they also know the intentions of those people. if they know your true and a total believer in the work they start letting you hang around. many hour`s are spent in hotel rooms watching them work. they make sure you know every detail. also they make sure that you know the importance of being honest and laying your product correctly. every hit you lay has the potential to change somebody`s life and bring them into the light. it`s taught like an apprenticeship. my first thumbprint was silver. before my print i thought i was pretty experienced with acid. i had been puddled many times with strong liquid. i wasn`t near as experienced as i thought as i walked into the room and everybody had a huge grin on there face, and i saw what i was about to take. thumbprint`s arn`t weighed out on a scale. it`s more of "that`s a nice little chunk ,that should do" your talking several sheet`s or more when you do a print. fluff and needlpoint are damn pure and i don`t imagine bears was any purer. i have heard of batches of needlepoint being as high as 98% white fluff is gorgous crystal. we would eat this crystal like crazy. when i first met the main guy in charge of this crystal he was snorting it!!!! after i did a fluff print i never did any other kind except needlepoint. when you eat crystal you definatly can tell the differences between them. purity does matter at that level." isn\'t a thumbprint dangerous? you\'d think a persons mind would be changed forever after doing that amount. "a thumbprint isn`t even close to the largest doses people have done. dangerous? lsd is physiologicaly one of the safest drugs there are. there`s not one valid death that can be attributed to physiological complications from taking lsd. i didn`t know all this when i was taking it though. psychologically it could be very negative if the wrong person does it. that`s why we didn`t just walk around the parking lot handing out thumbprint`s. as far as high doses go, it totally opens you up. for about a week afterwards your first print you need some babysitting. hell you`ve just been reborn! after awhile it`s less tramatic. as for after effects. i am middle aged and healthy. i have 3 bright healthy children. and i`m just getting my bachelor`s degree with a 3.5gpa i do feel high very often though, but i don`t mind. the man that gave me my first print still does crystal once in awhile and he`s in his mid sixties."you mention the purity varying on alot of the crystal. how are they checking purity? just roughly with how long it takes to dissolve in a solvent? "i can tell by color. how crystallin it is and what color it is. you can inspect the crystal once you know what good clean crystal looks like. and then you can compare. i have a moto "if it\'s white it\'s all right". of course the jugement on my end is not scientific . i examin it like jewelers do jewels. the only real way to get a very accurate reading on how pure it is comes from the lab. most decent lab\'s have a gc/ms and can get a decent purity reading from that. needlepoint and white fluff are the only one\'s that are reliably consistant. silver varies a little. lavender and amber vary greatly in appearance from batch to batch. indicating a difference in purity. if i was buying amber or lavender i would want to see it first. they have a tendancy every once in awhile to skimp on the last part of manufacture. the rinse and recrysitazation at the end is crucial in determing purity. if this isn\'t done enough your product is less pure.some of you may have heard owsley say he lost 20% of his product making sure its pure. thats because he rised it a ton of times. thats why his shit was said to be better than sandoz. amber and lavender if they don\'t due this good there crystal looks more dirty. also the purer you make your crystal the less it weighs and it\'s sold by weight." how long does lsd "stay good"? i mean if i was to take it, put it in a zippylock and then put it in the pages of a book (someplace with unchanging air and no light) "i find that exact method perfect. i took two sheets of needlepoint and wraped them in plastic wrap then a. foil and put them in the middle of a book on a bookshelf. there going on 3 years old and last time somebody tried them they were very potent. they get no light ,air ,and are in a cool enviroment. as for crystal it\'s stored in brown glass vial\'s that are filled with co2 and sealed." you said the family was always on tour with the dead. do you know offhand if any of them ever had the occasion to hang with jerry and the guys? "a lot of the older guys did. hell the family started with the dead and bear. it\'s all connected from the band, crew to the fans and faithful. as for hanging with jerry myself , no. i got backstage several times, but that doesn\'t mean anything. there\'s backstage and then there is the bands backstage ,thats off limits. i would much rather be in the crowd. the closest i ever got to jerry was ten feet as he walked by me and a bunch of other people. i just smiled. i had nothing to say. he had a lot of pressure with all the people who clung to him and thought he was a god. it was really hard for him to deal with and one of the reasons he turned to smack imho. i had nothing to say to him ,except mabye "play st. stephen!" i was just curious what kind of sheets were going around when you were into it, was there always different sheets or was there stockpiles of certain kinds? "over the 8 years i was on tour i saw more prints than i possibly could remember or list. i wouldn\'t even know were to begin. hundreds and hundreds of different kinds. my favorite was plain white unperferated paper. the reason for this was alot of cops don\'t know what a tenpack of white unperfed blotter looks like. once on a greyhound bus from floridia to baltimore our bus was stopped and a bunch of feds got on it. they searched everybodys bags. they were looking for guns or coke since we were coming from floridia. i\'ll never forget the feeling of watching a federal agent (fbi i believe) go through my bag and pull stuff out. i had a gram(ten- tenpacks or 10,000 doses) of white paper. he pulled it out and had no clue what it was . it looked like just a bunch of ten inch square pieces of paper to him. had it be perferated and had a print on it he probably would have known. after that i was a true believer in white unperfed paper. print\'s are usually made in mass amounts and then sold to the different familys. so one kind of print can actually have several different kinds of crystal on them. this happened years ago with the jesus christ prints. the first ones were made of very pure white fluff and they were dipped to contain a little over 100mcg. people went nuts over them and the were the talk of the summer. then the lavender family got hold of the same print and put there dirty ass crystal on them and they were about half the strength as the original white fluff batch. people should know the truth about lsd. the internet is the perfect medium to transfer this knowlege. just enough info can be given to paint a general picture of how things work, without giving specifics that would endanger this important work. i am in the perfect position to do so. i am long enough removed from the active scene to offer information without endangering anyone including myself. my friends that still live in the old world are very supportive. now it seams lifetimes ago. i was just a tool in a very large tool box. the family was around long before i came around. luckily it was in a time when a lot of the older folks were around to help with the scene. for me lsd is a gift and tool given to man from the heavens. i truly believe it is here to point us back towards the light. these values are the same with almost all the family. after you get a glimpse of eternity you can\'t help ,but want to share it with others who need it." sand, scully, and owsely were the original chemists working for the family? "yes, all 3 were family. owsely was the original chemist of the dead scene/family. he set many of the standards and ethics still held today. he also got sand and scully involved and doing this work for the people not money. sand and scully were in the "brotherhood of eternal love". back then it was basically all one big network or family. after the feds broke up the bel in the 70\'s is when people split off and ran smaller labs,networks and were known by there product. i would also like to note that when all 3 were busted they were all threatend with huge sentences. they kept there mouth shut and served very little time in comparison to how much they could have served. pickard was family many years ago. he has been busted for manufacturing 3 times. on his second bust he ran his mouth to the feds about other drug activity within the scene resulting in several people getting prison time. after that he was shunned and nobody in the family would work for him. that is why he had to work with such shady people in kansas. had he been working with family he wouldn\'t be going to serve a lifetime prison sentence, he wouldn\'t have been busted at all. on his second bust instead of biting the bullet and keeping his mouth shut like sand, scully, and owsely, he chose to make a deal. many years later now he is going to prison for life because he was betrayed in the same way. i do hope that pickard can get out of prison before his life ends. he has a new kid that was just born and a new wife. he has done a great service to man by making lsd. i would hope that after a few years he can get released and live his remaining years with his new family. i doubt he will be so lucky though. many of us who have been graced by lsd owe a great debt to these 3 pioneer chemists and the ones that still remain active and unknown today." -continued', ['hacking tools'])
(68582, 15807, 'continued-"in the days of old tour wasn\'t just a time to flood the country with lsd, but also about making connections. for those of us on the road full time we needed an income when we got back to the bay area. meeting kind people on tour was always nice, but it also provided an chance to spread the juice when we wern\'t traveling. when the dead toured 4 times a year you would meet all sorts of folks from every nook and crany of the us. some of these people were chosen to provide for there community. this is a huge link in the distribution chain. and its also in very, very bad shape. when jerry died there was a lot of folks who quit touring. as people moved around connections were severed. in the old days if you lost track of people you knew you would see them at the next tour. now thats not an option because there is no tour. people have fell out of touch. people have moved on. so as the years have moved on the existing links have been stretched thinner and thinner."i\'m starting to think the brotherhood is just one more lost religion. "i have little faith in the lsd movement ever getting full steam again. i hope i\'m wrong. it will always be around, but the not like it was. the distribution system is in shambles. it seems that a whole new generation of younger people lacking the once highly held ethics are ruining things. on a positive note, the psychedelic movement will continue. things change and may seem dark ,but we must continue. the psychedelic experience and man have been together for thousands of years. it survived christianity,it can survive anything. it goes underground now and then, but is there for those dedicated enough to seek it out. if you feel strongly about the benefits of psychedelics then do something positive about it. you can\'t expect the old generation to carry the torch forever. a new wave of dedicated folks needs to rise up and continue this work. can you think of a more important thing to do? i believe there\'s a large number of us who would love to get into it and help, how is this possible? "it is going to be tough for any new people to get into this work. this summer has shown that poor choices were made in who would spread the love. not saying it can\'t be done, but it will be tough. it usually takes a few years of hanging around. your intentions will be tested. not to worry though, because there are many ways we can all help. first is to become educated and responsible when it comes to psychedelics. know the facts and when debating sceptics be mature and informed. most people have very poor info about lsd. rumors and bullshit plague its myth. the more people we have telling the truth the better. turn people on. you\'ll never make a closer friend than one you turned on. after you get to know the effects of psychedelics you can tell that certain people would benefit from them. talk to them if they\'re willing. don\'t be pushy, but offer them info. then if they want offer them the chance. the more truthful info they have the better off they\'ll be. i am a firm believer that psychedelics can be shown to be useful in mental health. i am in the middle of a 9 year academic voyage to get the proper credentials to help if the chance arises. if we can prove through science and medicine that lsd is benifitial then we make a great step forward. not only will it help expell the nasty rumors around them, but give people the chance touch the healing energy that lsd can open up. studies are under way in the us right now. there for conditions like ocd. even though most of us don\'t have ocd this study is important. it establishes the safety of psychedelics. this opens the doors for further studies that cover other areas. before the scheduling of lsd there was a lot of research being done. alot of it was very promising. lsd and other psychedelics were placed in the schedule one category and access to them was cut off even to legit researchers. this was a total political move that had nothing to do with the saftey or benefits of lsd. it was about trying to get control of a generation that didn\'t want to be under control. theres many researchers in the world very interested in psychedelic research. these are very bright m.d.\'s, phd\'s and scientists. the more help on this front the better. this is were i will spend my remaining years for the movement. supply- there is always a need for psychedelics. if your totally dedicated and willing to risk your freedom to better this planet through providing psychedelics then all the info you need is available at your finger tips. i can think of nothing more important for the survival of our species and those we live with then for us all to have access to the psychedelic experience." to give some closure to this thread, a beautiful prayer: -by innerbeing "let us pray for the brotherhood, for their infinite compassion, and for their understanding of the sufferings of us unawakened individuals. may they realize that there are many who could benefit from their understanding here and now. we could only hope that they will recognize the need amongst us and they will respond out of their compassionate grace to help us in these dark times. we must generate the loving consciousness that has been lost in this decade.....we must develop loving-kindness for all of our brothers and sisters, and we must share these qualities with everyone at all times. the time has come, my dear brothers, for a reawakening of the values, of which you hold so dear, let us continue what you have started. we wait with patience for your response....and we shall continue to wait for as long as it takes. peace be with you all."', ['hacking tools'])

(2 way \xc2\x96 3 way)basically, multi-signature, when used for arbitration, works by creating a 2-of-3 multisig that the payment is deposited to. there are three parties involved \xc2\x96 the buyer, the seller and the arbitrator. two of those three have to cooperate in order to release the payment.to give a more tangible example, lets say bob wants to buy something from alice, and they both trust trent as an arbitrator that can mediate disputes. bob deposits his payment to a 2-of-3 multisig address with thepublic keys of bob, alice and trent. alice can verify the payment was made and that the payment is \xc2\x93locked\xc2\x94 in the multisig deposit, and ships the goods to bob.if bob got the goods and he\xc2\x92s satisfied, he and alice can be the 2-of-3 and release the payment from the multisig to alice\xc2\x92s bitcoin address. in case of dispute, they both contact trent and explain what happened. then, either bob+trent can sign a transaction that issues a refund to bob, or alice+trent can sign a transaction that moves the funds to alice.the process on the website itself looks like that:1. bob goes to the \xc2\x93new transaction\xc2\x94 page, enters the arbitrator (either a username of a registered arbitrator, or any public key) and the terms of the transaction (those are signed digitally by bob and alice, which later proves to trent they both agreed to it)2. bob starts the transaction, and gets a link to share with alice. when alice enters, she confirms the arbitrator/terms by clicking \xc2\x93i agree\xc2\x943. bob and alice now see the transaction page with the multisig address, and bob makes the payment.4. alice see the payment was received (by checking the multisig balance) and ships the product.5. at this point, bob or alice can create a transaction that releases the funds, and ask the other party to approve it. if they get into a dispute, they have a link they can share with trent, where he can be the 2nd party that approves transactions.how it can be used anonymously?bitrated does not require an account or even an email address from buyer/sellers. the only details users provide are the terms of the transaction, which aren\xc2\x92t uploaded to the server and only shared via the url the parties send to eachother.arbitrators can optionally sign up to have a public profile listed on the website, but they don\xc2\x92t have to. they can simply provide their public key to the buyer/seller and have them use it.i saw you mentioned in one of our previous mails it based *mostly* on client side, can you elaborate on this?bitrated was built with a very strong security/privacy model. almost everything happens client-side, with the server not being involved unless its 100% necessary. private keys are created and used client side, transactions are constructed and signed client-side and the transaction data, including the terms, is only saved as part of the url each party has and isn\xc2\x92t stored on the server at all.the server is only involved in order to enable communication between clients. its impossible to communicate between browsers directly, so a websocket server is used to send information between connected clients. the data that is sent via the server isn\xc2\x92t considered sensitive \xc2\x96 just the the public key of the party joining the transaction and the partially-signed transaction request. both of those are sent immediately to the other clients and discarded, with no permanent copy being saved. (in the future, we plan to encrypt that end-to-end too)elaborate on how you don\xc2\x92t touch the private keys and how it can be verified?private keys are created and used client-side, and are never transmitted to the server. each party gets a url with his own private key embedded in the hash portion of the url (after the \xc2\x93#\xc2\x94, which is not part of the httprequest).bitrated is an open-source software that can be audited by anyone. it can be independently verified that the client-side code never sends sensitive information to the server, and it can be verified that the source served bythe webserver matches the code on github.in the future, we plan to provide a browser extension that does this automatically and ensures that the code coming from bitrated.com matches the code published on github.is there a possibility for the arbitrator to collect some fee? fees are possible, but not currently handled specifically in bitrated. there are basically two fees structures that i see people using:fees for every transaction, which is the common model today. in this case, it should be paid as a separate transaction, before starting the multisig. the arbitrator should simply refuse to handle disputes where the fee wasn\xc2\x92t paid in advance.fees for disputed transactions only. because the arbitrator doesn\xc2\x92t have to do anything when there\xc2\x92s no dispute, some of them choose to only charge for disputes. in this case, it can be paid from the multisig balance, where the arbitrator will simply refuse to sign transactions without his fees. bitrated\xc2\x92s interface can be used to create a transaction sending some percentage of the balance as fees to the arbitrator, and the rest to the winning party.most people using tor markets trying to avoid using js, and your service is based on js, how can this work together?i would be very careful about running java and flash, but i think js is relatively safe to execute. most of the web doesn\xc2\x92t function properly without javascript, and its necessary for a service like bitrated thatrelies heavily on client-side technology. also, its open source and can be verified to not contain malicious code.who provides the arbitration?bitrated doesn\xc2\x92t provide the arbitration services themselves \xc2\x96 the goal is to create a marketplace for arbitration services. we allow arbitrators to signup and offer their services for a fee, and let users choose which arbitrator they want to use.why not make a n .onion domain for this service?.onion is good for websites that wants to conceal their identity. bitrated is operated in the open and has a known owner (my name and my company\xc2\x92s name is listed in the about page), so i don\xc2\x92t think it\xc2\x92ll achieve much.service name:\xc2\xa0 bitrated service url: https://www.bitrated.com/feel free to try it out and contact the service admin directly at nadav@bitrated.com if you have any issues, questions or suggestions for improvements.we have also added this solution to the list of hidden marketplaces as a related service", ['hacking tools'])

learned to fight for this community\'s long term security. i\'m focusing on multi-signature transactions as our only safe trading mechanism long term. additionally, i am ready and willing to collaborate with other darknet administrators and utilize our talented penetration testing team to help them to regularly audit their security.and although the tinfoil club will probably hate this and continue to tear me to shreds without regard for my actions in december, and whether you choose to believe them or not, here are the facts:1. i live a very busy and complicated life. i take opsec to extreme levels which consume many of my hours per day. any time you see me here, it means i have completed a checklist which requires over an hour of preparation for me to reposition and reconfigure many things to ensure i leave the most minimal trail possible and can "safely" connect to this place. this job will never be safe, and it is impossible to be perfectly covert. i know what i am facing, both from le and from vendors who do not share my opinions of non-violence.2. all released announcements were my true plans, and all delays were due to unanticipated external factors upon which i cannot elaborate. my staff has been very frustrated at my lack of ability to keep the dev team on time. again, this is completely my fault and something for which i take complete responsibility. i do not trust any developers, so i meticulously review anything the dev team sends to me. many have criticized me for this, and i listened to them. had i reviewed the code even more meticulously and delayed the fix to speed up slow withdrawals last month, transaction malleability would not have affected us at all. this is completely my fault for listening to critics instead of my own sense of caution.3. the public has known that auto-finalize has been disabled for a long time, and has known that the escrow balance is massive.4. any smart person could deduce that re-enabling of auto-finalize requires me to move a vast sum from cold storage to the hot storage wallet to ensure adequate fund availability (which admittedly was too large and one of my biggest failures this month). the attack was surgical and timed perfectly.the reason such a high quantity of coins was stolen was because we were preparing to implement auto-finalization and had therefore moved a huge volume from the cold storage to the hot storage to ensure the coins from all auto-finalized orders could be withdrawn without a hitch.here are as many details on the attack as i can provide. i am still investigating, and do not want to leak anything which could compromise any other markets. transparency in this issue is key, however, you deserve as granular an explanation as possible as to why this happened.sr2 attack investigation results as of feb 151. when withdrawal delays were happening last month, we wrote a custom bitcoin implementation using several available libraries a reference, and built it on a shared infrastructure to load balance across accounts and provide risk mitigation if ever one server was compromised.2. as this implementation was being written by behind-the-scenes dev staff, a lynch mob was getting exponentially worse in the forums. our moderator staff became more and more insistent that it was crucial to fix this problem immediately, relaying to me many concerns, and threats, from the community.3. we cut a corner, deciding to watch transactions. many community members were reporting missing withdrawals, weeks after sending them. we implemented a liberal check to the "refresh deposit balances" link on the account page - in essence, we allowed it to search deeply for any missing coins, rescanning and rescanning. one of our team members was familiar with mtgox\'s procedures and source code and vouched for the idea. our thoughts were that if the largest bitcoin exchange was using this approach to find missing coins, it must be commonplace. (i received her/his permission to publish this.)4. the transaction malleability bug was published last week at a time when i was disconnected from the internet for an extended period for opsec reasons. i did not become aware of the threat until the attack was already occurring. this was a failure on my part to trust more staff with critical access to stop withdrawals. the people who did have access to disable withdrawals were terrified of doing it without my permission, due to how negatively the community reacts when withdrawals are turned off. they knew if they disabled withdrawals, then re-enabled them, there would be a run on the bank and i would need to be online to deposit cold storage into hot storage. in effect, this was my failure to emphasize to staff that it is always okay to lean on the side of caution and hit killswitches as they deem necessary. it was also my failure to communicate expectations to the community that sometimes killswitches will have to be hit, and it just means we\'re playing it safe. this month it is clear we did not play it safe. killswitches are pointless if the only person confident enough to hit them is the boss.5. the attacker used an account first registered in early jan to try exploiting the vulnerability. looking back at the account\'s history indicates that this account has been used to pentest many aspects of our system unsuccessfully. every previous attempt to find an attack vector failed, due to hardening done by our penetration testing team. i had previously seen these attempts in the logs as something to celebrate: "look, our hardening is working, this hacker would have won, but we put security over features!" - several people suggested disabling the hacker\'s accounts, but that is pointless in our business as anyone can simply re-register.6. we are still unclear as to the exact approach used to cause our servers\' perception of transactions to mismatch with reality, because we have largely been focusing on preparing for relaunch and building communication to share with you, the community, over the past day. to the best of our understanding, the attacker deposited increasingly larger amounts of bitcoins, and withdrew them while flooding the blockchain with ddos of similar transactions. 7. our system reflected his withdrawals, and his account showed as zero.8. the attacker rapidly clicked "refresh deposits" link until our code assumed that the transaction failed (all indications point to malleability as the root case). our system re-credited his account with the x btc it judged "unsuccessfully" withdrawn. this, again, due to the liberal rescanning mechanisms added last month (see point 3).9. in reality, our servers perceived the transactions inaccurately and the btc were successfully withdrawn. as a result our system inaccurately represented the user\'s balance as larger than it truly was. this allowed the attacker to withdraw coins again.10. the attacker began depositing larger amounts, such as 50 btc at a time, in order to exploit the vulnerability quickly.11. they then drained our entire hot storage in one bitcoin server shard, and tried the attack from one of their other accounts. the other account was on a different shard, and allowed that hot storage to be drained.12. the attacker continued using different accounts until virtually all of our hot storage shards were drained.due to the type of vulnerability, our accounting system had an inaccurate perception of bitcoins on hand and therefore did not trigger any alerts until real user withdrawals began failing unexpectedly. this was a failure on our part to build a new server alert to check each shard of the new shared bitcoin infrastructure, and another symptom of how rushed we were when implementing the new system during a forum lynch-mob about slow withdrawals.lessons learned so far:1.  more staff should have access to killswitches and should not be afraid to use them. even if it\'s just because of some news post about on clearnet about some "transaction malleability" thing. killswitches should be used liberally and regularly.2. a community needs to be comfortable with regular downtime - especially during periods when community safety and the safety of its money could be threatened. a good staff will be responsibly paranoid and hitting killswitches as they deem necessary, and should not be afraid of their community panicking each time precaution is exercised.3. there\xc2\x92s more to web security than rigorous penetration testing. it also requires the constant review of external services, systems and infrastructures.4. never make assumptions when implementing protocols you did not design. had we not trusted mtgox\'s staff procedures, we would have reviewed our approaches with much more rigor. just because a large company\'s procedures are successful does not make them are safe.5. accept that your community will hate you regardless. in the darknet, you will be crucified by your community if anything ever goes wrong. psychologically prepare for everyone to hate you, because you inevitably will fail at something, and you will need to stay determined no matter what. don\'t let it get to your head, and don\'t let it affect your rigor with security. we cut corners with our deposit/withdrawal speed optimizations because we were afraid of the lynch-mob. we were foolish in this regard. we should have taken the entire site offline for as long as it took to implement a high-volume fault-tolerant bitcoin server in a well-tested, rigorous manner. this cost us an unspeakable amount of trust that we had slaved to build, some of us for years.this is where we\'re at, with as much transparency as this medium allows:the worst that could happen did not happen.the worst thing that could happen for our community\'s finances, however, did.we hate that it occurred under our watch.there is nothing we can do to change this. all we can do is be transparent about where we are at, and move forward.to those who will respond here for dramatic effect, please consider contributing your energy to the reconstruction of our community. if you cannot bring yourself to do this, then please take your negativity elsewhere. this is simple. if you have lost faith in silk road, i don\'t blame you in the least. i also do not want to read about it in perpetuity.trolling is easy. trolling during a disaster is cowardice. choosing to strengthen rather than troll, when trolling is the popular move - that\'s noble. i know that i speak for all silk road staff, seen and unseen, when i speak these words: we are going nowhere. we will remain, rebuild, and move forward toward the greater goal for which we strive by our running of this marketplace: personal freedom and foundational human rights.silk road will always rise again.', ['None'])

into the investigation of data surrounding the attacks, and it there is absolutely zero evidence of any staff member being involved. we will publish more information as we determine its accuracy, thank you to all who have contributed tips on the attackers\' identities.after much self-reflection and deliberation with community members we value highly, it is clear that there is only one way forward.this leadership and this community will not stop until you are completely repaid.we know you feel defenseless right now. you are naked. many of you are convinced there is no logical reason any darknet admin would ever fight to get your coins back.i can stand here and reiterate that all i want to do is defend you, to steer this community towards incrementally safer operation. but my words are no comfort, and i understand that. you will never meet me. we are all anonymous.i gave a similar speech in december when we met our first impossible situation. you have no reason to trust my words. my actions will prove you wrong.here is the current plan. thank you to the dedicated vendors and buyers who helped draft this approach. this is not necessarily a final plan, we are open to suggestions on how to improve this and want your feedback.the plan for moving forward as of feb 151. this administration will not earn any commissions until everyone is completely paid back, and will be very transparent about the progress towards this goal.2. the marketplace will relaunch as no-escrow. we will not re-implement escrow unless it is multi-signature and decentralized to multiple escrow providers (trusted mediators with feedback just like vendors). never buy from a market which uses centralized escrow again. you will only get hurt no matter how honest the team is.3. all items will be priced at a flat 5% commission which will go directly into victims\' balances upon purchase.4. vendors who lost funds: commissions from your items will go directly into your wallet until you are completely repaid, then will be distributed to other vendors until they are repaid. vendor bonds are considered lost funds, and we also commit to paying these back.5. all vendors can opt-in to give a higher percentage back on their listings, and all buyers will be presented with a "donate" box on the shopping cart. vendors\' donation percentage will be publicly visible.6. we will launch the support system immediately. resubmit any open support requests you had which are still applicable. all previous messages will be ignored due to our inbound message volume. i have received over 1000 private messages over the past 24 hours, for example. this fresh start will allow us to stay on top of the support queue, rather than paying down a large debt incurred by previous administrators.7. we will still handle dispute resolution for existing escrow orders until all balances site-wide are in "pending balance" category. your stolen balances and escrows will display as "pending balance" and "pending escrow". yes, like christmas. i hoped to never have to take this approach again. all unshipped orders have been cancelled. to the vendors who have shipped orders despite no access to the portal: you are beautiful people. try to resolve with your buyer directly, and file a support ticket if you do not receive a refund to your pending escrow balance within a month.the plans above are subject to change as we consider your input.the statistics are humbling:26% of our monthly active users have lost their entire sr funds. that represents 47% of users who have purchased or sold items since launch.our inbound traffic has been growing at a rapid pace. the first ten days of february saw as many purchases as the entire month of january. by feb 13, we surpassed january\'s total user registrations.we strongly believe that we can work together and make this right.silk road is not a name easily forgotten, and how we pull through this struggle will only solidify our name as the strongest community in the darknet.buyers and vendors: we are committed to getting everyone repaid even if it takes a year. do not forget to check your sr accounts frequently for balances repaid, and withdraw them when you see them.vendors:\xc2\xa0 you are welcomed and encouraged to vend on multiple markets. i only trust myself, and will not endorse any of them. but i have failed you. wherever you vend, may you prosper.buyers: do not purchase using centralized escrow. use markets which have implemented multi-signature, or only purchase with no-escrow (fe) from very trusted vendors. this is not an ideal climate, but it is the reality of the darknet today. i cannot emphasize strongly enough that every market which uses centralized escrow will fail. centralization makes a market a huge target for attackers, and a huge target for dishonest administrators.again, we welcome your feedback on this approach to moving forward, and will continue to refine it throughout the year based on sales data.i don\'t care how long it takes or how expensive it is, we will fight to get this community repaid.', ['None'])

list exists.\xc2\xa0 you will thank me\xc2\xa0 1.\xc2\xa0 go for a walk.\xc2\xa0 exploring virtually anywhere is an adventure on lsd.\xc2\xa0 nature takes on a new level of beauty on lsd.\xc2\xa0 (go for a hike, or go camping!!!)2. go for a swim!\xc2\xa0 ideally in a heated pool versus the ocean.\xc2\xa0 i have a feeling dark water would trip me out a bit.3. take a shower with your tripping partner in a completely dark shower.\xc2\xa0 (no light whatsoever)\xc2\xa0 it becomes like a sensory deprivation tank and is my favorite thing to do while tripping.\xc2\xa0 absolute darkness is the best, but a solitary blinking light can also be fun.\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa04. watch some live music at a concert or rave.5. try painting or finger-painting!\xc2\xa0 my second favorite thing to do on acid...the amount of color that comes from each brush stroke is beautiful and almost makes me cry.\xc2\xa0 never have you ever seen color like this.\xc2\xa0 painting becomes an emotional experience on acid and finger painting is tops because you get your sense of touch involved in the creativity.\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0i highly recommend it.6.\xc2\xa0 smoking hookah!\xc2\xa0 blowing smoke through soap bubbles or just blowing bubbles is fun.\xc2\xa0 when it pops, a little smoke comes out of the popped bubble and its unbelievably fun to watch.7.\xc2\xa0 massage and be massaged, or have your back scratched.\xc2\xa0 having your head massaged by one of those head massagers that looks like a metallic spider (they sell them in malls, like a ting-ting or something)8.\xc2\xa0 watching the winamp visualizer milkdrop!\xc2\xa0 this is certifiably the best visualizer ever!\xc2\xa0 you haven\xc2\x92t seen a visualizer until you've seen this on a psychedelic.\xc2\xa0 trust me on this one!!! google search \xc2\x93bltc winamp presets\xc2\x94 and download the bltc preset package.\xc2\xa0 (it will make the visualizer even better!)9. eat some fruit or veg.!\xc2\xa0 there's something very primal and rewarding about biting into a strawberry or blueberry or peach while tripping.\xc2\xa0 green beans, and juicy things taste very good.\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0meats and cheeses usually don\xc2\x92t taste so good.10.\xc2\xa0 go paintballing on acid...i have yet to try this but i hear it's crazy.\xc2\xa0 might be a little too crazy though.11.\xc2\xa0 mirror time!\xc2\xa0 go stare at yourself in the mirror, stare into your eyes in one of those super magnified mirrors...watching them dilate and constrict is nuts!12.\xc2\xa0 listen to music on expensive studio headphones.\xc2\xa0 sennheiser or bose or something that wraps around your entire ear.\xc2\xa0 trust me, this is how music was meant to be listened to.13.\xc2\xa0 have sexual intercourse (punch anyone in the face who says otherwise...they're lying to you.\xc2\xa0 sex on ex or psychedelics is the best and is so worth it.)14.\xc2\xa0 writie on your partner or paint on your partner with paint or black-light paint.\xc2\xa0 15.\xc2\xa0 floating down a river in an inter-tube.16.\xc2\xa0 take a stroll on the beach barefoot.\xc2\xa0 watch the ocean waves crash or go play in the rain.17.\xc2\xa0 star gazing and looking at the stars using google sky maps app on your phone18.\xc2\xa0 smelling extreme smells, preferably good smells...candles, incense, coffee grinds, salt. etc.\xc2\xa0 this can be quite interesting if you\xc2\x92re on a high dose of lsd and synesthesia is happening.\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa019.\xc2\xa0 smoking weed obviously...blunts are my favorite method when tripping.\xc2\xa0 (*roll them before you trip)\xc2\xa0 roll one up and have your sober-sitter go through a drive thru car-wash while you hot-box the blunt. \xef\x81\x8a20. inhale some nitrous oxide\xc2\xa0 this can really can add some trippiness to a trip.\xc2\xa0 it's likely horrible for you, but it is quite fun.\xc2\xa0 i\xc2\x92m told you can take a bong\xc2\x85pull a rip of weed, let it remain in the chamber while you take out the slider and put a balloon of nitrous where the weed was, then take the rip.\xc2\xa0 weed and nitrous at once, you drop at least 4 iq points in one sitting but its fun nonetheless.21.\xc2\xa0 buy the biggest glowsticks you can find online and throw them around with your tripping partners.22.\xc2\xa0 chew or suck on some ice and then make out with your partner or go down on them.\xc2\xa0 that\xc2\x92s great fun.23. go for a bi-cycle ride.\xc2\xa0 (this is how the first lsd experience ever went down.)24. go jump on a trampoline, or moon-bounce if you can find one.\xc2\xa0 (be cautious please)25. go to an amusement park and ride the rides (i don't recommend this to anyone except super experienced trippers.\xc2\xa0 waiting in line sucks, but ipods and earbuds help.)26.\xc2\xa0 go to a water park.\xc2\xa0 (i don't recommend this to anyone except super experienced trippers)26. get into a hot tub or bath tub with food coloring and drop drops into the water and watch the dye move through the water.\xc2\xa0 (this may stain your skin for a couple days if you put a lot of color in.)27. hook up a fog machine in your room and let that thing go off for a while.\xc2\xa0 trippy lights or a strobe will help this.\xc2\xa0 *fog is just cool as fuck while tripping, but be sure to unplug any fire alarms, as they will be set off.28.\xc2\xa0 ask a sober sitter to drive you around town for a little bit.\xc2\xa0 or get a taxi (do not drive while tripping, it never ends well)29. vicks inhalers are quite fun on ecstasy...not too sure about other psychedelics.\xc2\xa0 i remember blowing some in my eyes sober once and it hurt so badly.\xc2\xa0 it was not at all pleasant like when you're rolling.30.\xc2\xa0 buy some poi balls off of a website.\xc2\xa0 they are like 10$ each or so...totally worth it.\xc2\xa0 they are likely led but swinging them around is fun and makes for amazing light shows.\xc2\xa0 also hula hooping is fun.31.\xc2\xa0 go to a planetarium or laser show (pink floyd laser light show is ideal) check your local imax or mosi science theater, they\xc2\x92re fun to go to while tripping.32.\xc2\xa0 play an instrument and make some music!\xc2\xa0 record what you come up with...or play with laser pointers if you have no musical talents.33.\xc2\xa0 get some dry ice and have some fun (try not to burn yourself)35.\xc2\xa0 go to a museum or look at some paintings or pictures you own.\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0paintings become like a little movie on lsd.\xc2\xa0 they can be quite entertaining.36.\xc2\xa0 drink a little wine or beer.\xc2\xa0 stay hydrated though.37.\xc2\xa0 play some visually cool and interactive video games38.\xc2\xa0 watch some classic cartoons (bugs bunny, inspector gadget\xc2\x85)39.\xc2\xa0 gambling is supposedly fun and some say you are better at it whilst tripping.\xc2\xa0 i imagine being in vegas would be the ideal situation on acid.40.\xc2\xa0 go skiing or snowboarding.41.\xc2\xa0 watch a 3-d movie.42.\xc2\xa0 film yourself.\xc2\xa0 set up a camera on a tripod in the room and forget about it.\xc2\xa0 or actively film some or all of your trip.\xc2\xa0 watching the footage when your sober is very entertaining and often will help you keep some of those amazing memories that are almost always forgotten when you trip balls.43.\xc2\xa0 skydiving is said to be intense, i can\xc2\x92t even imagine this though.44.\xc2\xa0 http://new.weavesilk.com/\xc2\xa0 this website is interactive art you make with your mouse and keyboard.\xc2\xa0 pretty cool!!!45.\xc2\xa0 watch planet earth or something similar on a crispy hd flat screen.46.\xc2\xa0 play jenga or double jenga!\xc2\xa0 chess, pinball machines\xc2\x85ping pong, games etc.47.\xc2\xa0 do some stream of consciousness writing!\xc2\xa0 start a sentence on paper, don\xc2\x92t ever lift the pen, and see where that takes you.48.\xc2\xa0 buy some gallium online.\xc2\xa0 gallium is a metal with a\xc2\xa0 melting point of 85degrees fahrenheit.\xc2\xa0 so if you hold it in your hand for a minute, it will melt.\xc2\xa0 gallium is not dangerous either.\xc2\xa0 mercury on the hand is quite toxic, so don\xc2\x92t play with that.\xc2\xa0 you can easily buy some online for about 40$ and i imagine it would be quite mind-bottling to play with while tripping.49.\xc2\xa0 go to a reflexologist (foot massage therapy) or go get a massage.50. go lay on the ground and stare up at the moon and stars.\xc2\xa0 now think about the fact that you are on a rock flying through space and that this rock orbits a star.\xc2\xa0 really try to wrap your mind around what a star is, how big it is, and that every element in the entire universe was once made in one of those things.51.\xc2\xa0 google image search fractals and check those out for a wee bit.52.\xc2\xa0 meditate or stretch.\xc2\xa0 close your eyes and start a journey within.\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa053.\xc2\xa0 pet a cat or throw a ball to your dog.\xc2\xa0 pets are super-fun on lsd.54.\xc2\xa0 do some people-watching.55.\xc2\xa0 go to an aquarium!\xc2\xa0 zoos are said to be kind of sad.\xc2\xa0 (caged lions and monekys etc.)\xc2\xa0 fuck fish though\xc2\x85they\xc2\x92re here for our entertainment.56.\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 close your eyes and think about the fact that you can think.\xc2\xa0 think about the fact that your brain is the only thing on this planet that can name itself.\xc2\xa0 or about how you were once a single cell.\xc2\xa0 google some unanswerable questions or thought provoking questions and try and answer them.\xc2\xa0 who knows you might be the one to finally solve if a tree falls in the forest and there\xc2\x92s no one around to hear it", ['payment services'])

(thats what i get for tripping with people around for the first time in a long while) me and one friend had to talk this guy down for about a half hour.300 mics- your getting into heavy territory. still not considered by most to be a heavy dose, but thats only because they know where most people including themselves draw the line if they are experienced. its alot like 250 mics though.400 mics- most people would never take this much unless they knew the acid they have in their possesion and really wanted to get pretty far out there.this is why you dont see 200+ mic hits around.500 mics- pretty much where even some of the most experienced people draw the line. your vision is almost completely enveloped by fractal patterns, and if you were to stare at some pavement or something, it looks like you can see to the end of eternity. miles and miles of visual depth.700 mics- most people who talk of taking a ten strip usually dont have very potent acid(though it is good), so 550 to 700 is where they end up. this is also where "more acid" becomes less important because the effects are very similar to an even higher dose.1000 mics- most people will never go there. if you had a "two hits and you are floored" type of lsd, or 100 mics and up hits, this is where a ten strip would put you. you basically cant see anything but visuals, your mind as a whole is infinately connected with its self and your external environment. amazing things happen on this dose no matter what. it would scare most people shitless. some people will think they are dieing. many would end up dialing 911 if they were alone and could read the numbers on the phone.1500 mics- is almost exactly like 1700 mics. 1700 mics being the most i have ever done. very few people have used this much lsd.it is very psychologically dangerous for some people to do this. you can no longer really see your own hand in front of your face. your cognition and vision are both bathed in the same light. some people forget to breath frequently, and id imagine alot of people would pass out. you will loose your ego, but you will meet many organizers of human cognition in this egoless place. they are much smarter than human beings. "they" *are self conscious neurology.they are the mathematicians behind consciousness and even the visuals themselves.a dose 700 mics and above will show anyone some very profound things. doses like 500 mics and above have changed many lives in both positive and negative ways. still, it is no more threatening than mushrooms. so dont get me wrong.hope it helps, save trails my friends.', ['None'])

(76791, 16910, 'i was intrigued by psychedelics since my first psilocybin trip just as i turned into an adult - officially. i had become disillusioned with alcohol and marijuana; as it was consumed by the general populace, but within these fungi i found such pleasure and clarity. truly a satisfying and rewarding substance.psilocybin piqued my interest and soon there-after, i gave lsd a try. before trying anything else, or even more lsd - i approached the subject very cautiously. substance, source, and purity were absolutely of incredible importance. in the meantime i did a lot of reading, becoming very knowledgeable about alexander shulgin and erowid. then i found gracie & zarkov, the following passage moved me. leading to my first experiments with mda & 2c-b a few years later. recently (about 1.5 years ago) i re-experienced this article and i feel like i truly integrated the knowledge & wisdom contained within.i was originally very suspicious & careful about consuming drugs/psychedelics more than 1-2 times/year. however, recently i\'ve made come to a conclusion that i have dedicated so much to the pursuit of knowledge behind these substances that they truly are my allies. i still don\'t consume them more than maybe 1/month, but i just follow my feelings on that one. my primary allies are as follows:mescaline, dom, psilocybin, mda, 4-aco-dmt, dmt, 2c-b, dob, 2c-e, 2c-d, 2c-i, and sativa cannabis (although usually not in-combination with psychedelics, as i believe it defeats the headspace i am trying to achieve .. increases the visuals, but deteriorates the mental clarity). harmala-alkaloids also, but never in combination with anything but tryptamines.i\'ve also tried & loved 2c-t-7, dxm, d-amphetamine, and mdpv. i respect the destructive power of stimulants immensely and can count on one hand the number of times i\'ve used d-amphetamine/mdpv in the past 10 years. also rarely use dissociatives, few times a year at most.tried & am neutral: mdma, 5-meo-mipt, 2c-p, ketamine (although i\'ve had some great experiences in combination with 2c-b), mxetried & dislike: 5-meo-dipt, doc, butt plugslist of things i\'d like to try: doi, dpt, bufotenine (5-oh-dmt), tma-series, mmda, aleph-series, and ganesha. things i\'ve decided to avoid: nbome-series, most very recently developed rc\'s (especially stimulants), methylone~~~let us restate our position clearly: psychedelic drugs give the shaman reliable means of entering alternative reality tunnels that are at least as real as our everyday reality. the shaman\'s task, therefore, is to become familiar with their effect and applications. psychedelic drugs are powerful tools, and powerful tools, like heavy construction equipment, can cause fatalities when operated by untrained personnel.naive or recreational use of psychedelic drugs does not make one either a shaman or a saint. if this were true, the bay area would have been overrun by saints and shamans in 1967. in traditional shamanic societies, there exist speci\xef\xac\x81c traditions, histories, rituals and practices which provide a stable, long-term set and setting by which the drug experiences is interpreted and controlled. even then, the use of the substances is severely limited either to certain festival occasions or to certain individuals. we have none of this cultural support or control. the requisite cosmology, epistemology, eschatology and ethics that are absolute requirements for effective sacred use of the hallucinogens are not given to us by our society. even such things as the nitty gritty technical details about drug preparation, dosage and use are generally unavailable.anyone who uses these drugs at high doses without this knowledgerisks madness and personal destructionfortunately, as post-moderns we offer you a simple solution: do the research, educate yourself, and then make it up as you go along!the accumulated knowledge of all of humanity is available to you in the library or in the bookstores along telegraph avenue. read history, philosophy, anthropology, psychology and religion along with mythology, science \xef\xac\x81ction and fantasy. create your own mythology or religion. make it historic-scienti\xef\xac\x81c in foundation and science \xef\xac\x81ction-fantasy in style. sign on your best friend for the journey (the buddy system is a safety net). start with the works in the accompanying bibliography. they contain enough information to make you a world class expert in the psychedelics? engage in twice monthly psychedelic training sessions with your buddy.in three or four years you will have a shamanistic starship capable of reliably taking you to worlds of beauty and religious depth that have been available heretofore only to humanity\'s great geniuses, artists and mystics (no shit).what does it take? about the amount of effort dedication that it takes to get a phd in the humanities. if you aren\'t willing to put in this level of effort, choose another path.we can\'t tell you the details of your shamanistic starship. it could be furnished as a monastic cell or as a plush pleasure dome or anything in between. the design is up to you. each shaman must find his or her own way. certainly we wouldn\'t even dream of suggesting a destination once you have built it. the possibilities are endless.just remember: don\'t buy anyone\'s bullshit along the way (especially ours) and don\'t go the guru route. and for goddess\' sake, have fun along the way.one final warning: you must remember this - those who know don\'t speak and those who speak don\'t know. to loosely quote terrence mckenna "the mysteries stand revealed. they are no longer exclusively the province of yogins and adepts but are open to all those who truly seek."welcome to the neopaleolithic where we poor monkeys get back to the unfinished business of re-creating ourselves as angels and going to the stars.good luck! stay high and stay free!gracie and zarkov~~~in discussion of the darknet as a source of drugs. this idea is absolutely compatible with my ethics. in fact even if drugs were legalized; my preferred method of distribution would be through the darknet. vendors are held to a higher standard than corporations. it also keeps people from being persecuted for publicy buying drugs. discreet packages that blend in with the mail. it\'s a genius idea, and i truly hope we as a community continue to be successful in jumping these hurdles.know your source. know your substance.ps.if you\'ve tried mescaline; whether as a cactus, or extracted material. give dom a try. it\'s an absolutely brilliant psychedelic. if you haven\'t tried mescaline, i suggest you try mescaline - then give dom a try. they\'re both brilliant in their own ways, and neither is "superior."', ['hacking tools'])

bitmessage e-mail gateway is a free service located in switzerland that allows users to send and receive email to/from bitmessage addresses and also from/to any other email address. you do not need an email address to register and can access your mail through a webmail interface, thunderbird or outlook. can be accessed over tor. also provides innovative localhost access feature that allows you to hide your ip from the server and sent emails. using the localhost access option you can connnect anonymously to the server without using tor or a vpn, giving you anonymous email cheap and easy right from your browser.vmail.me (https://www.vmail.me/en/) - vmail.me is a free service located in france offering webmail with imap and pop3 access. ips are stripped from mail headers but the service does keep ip logs.mail servers located in middle eastprivat de mail (http://mail.privatdemail.net/en/) - free eu based email service that does not log ip addresses with mail servers in egypt. email to israel is blocked, which also blocks mail to and from safe-mail.net. open registration. uses a self-signed ssl certificate which can cause browser errors; install the skip cert error add-on to correct in firefox or register with internet explorer instead. if using firefox once the skip cert error add-on is installed go to add-ons manager in firefox > extensions > skip cert error 0.3.4 then click on options and add mail.privatdemail.net to the domain whitelist and you should be able to register. promising start upsother privacy aware email startups in order they will probably be available:startmail -

(83816, 17791, 'quite often, there seems to be some confusion on how bitcoin works; it seems there is a general belief that the bitcoins are stored in the wallet, but this is not true.\xc2\xa0 before explaining the purpose of a wallet, it is important to first explain how bitcoin works.the information of all the transactions are kept in the bitcoin block which is computed by and kept by the miners.\xc2\xa0 this is why rewards are given to miners, as they are doing all the number crunching.\xc2\xa0 the rewards also promote more miners so there is a spread and no-single miner with less than around 40% of the mining power can cheat the numbers.so now we have the first part: bitcoin blockchain - the ledgerthe next important thing is how are funds moved around in the bitcoin blockchain, if bitcoins are not moved in and out of the wallet?\xc2\xa0 in a simplified manner, blockchain is actually a big list of addresses and the funds in them.\xc2\xa0 when funds are spent into an address, the blockchain will write that the funds were put into the address or moved out of an address.on to the second part: funding an addresshow does the blockchain know who owns the address?\xc2\xa0 in order to understand this, it is important to first understand what an address is.\xc2\xa0 an address consists of 3 parts (based on version 1 of bitcoin addresses).1. private key2. public key : a hash of the private key3. address : a hash of the public key with a checksum, then convert to base58(source: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/technical_background_of_bitcoin_addresses)now that we know all 3 are actually related and unique to each other, we can see as we go from 1 to 3, there is a layer of security between each.\xc2\xa0 you can use a private key to recreate the public key and address, but not the other way around.\xc2\xa0 now that we know what the keys are, we look at how its used:in the third part: spending1. address: once a fund has been spent into the address, we now have a balance in the address2. public key: the public key is exposed to create a transaction when preparing to send3. private key: now to complete the transaction, the private key is used to sign and identify the rights to send the transaction created with the public keyas can be seen, the private key identifies the right to spend from an address on the blockchain, as the private key is used to derive the public key and address.\xc2\xa0 therefore, the private key just shows permission to move funds in the blockchain for a specific address.finally, we have the last part: the walletif a wallet does not hold bitcoins, what does it hold?\xc2\xa0 a wallet is more similar in analogy to an account book that holds your account #s and passwords.\xc2\xa0 what the native bitcoin-qt wallet client actually does is:1. hold private key/public key/addresses to be used for moving funds in the blockchain2. connects and sends the transaction instructions accordingly3. scan and keeps records of your transactions from the blockchainsome wallets dont even do #3 as they use online sources for information about your account (as having a wallet with the full blockchain can take up quite a bit of space and continue to grow - since it is a copy of all transactions in the ledger).technically, you would not even need a wallet to access your funds.\xc2\xa0 you just need the private key for your address.\xc2\xa0 cold storage is when funds are sent to an address where the private keys are not online or accessible by computer.this could be as simple as printing your public and private key onto a piece of paper, to saving it in a text file in your usb and sticking it in your drawer.\xc2\xa0 without the private key, the address can not be accessed.if there are any questions or feedback in regards to how bitcoin, blockchain, address/public/private keys, and wallets, please feel free to contact me at any time.cheers,mdparityfounder of blackbank', ['None'])
(83821, 17792, 'interesting post, thanks for sharing. as i read your post you are recommending storing a wallet backup inside a truecrypt container, then storing the truecrypt container on a secure offshore server. not a bad idea at all. if i may add some information for consideration, both the armory and electrum wallets support true offline cold storage of your private keys. both wallets allow you to split the wallet into an online watching only copy of the wallet while the wallet with your private keys is stored on an offline computer.\xc2\xa0 the online watching only wallet can receive bitcoin routinely, but if you want to send bitcoin you need to 1) create an unsigned transaction using the online wallet 2) using a usb drive take the unsigned transaction file to the offline wallet and sign it then 3) take the signed transaction file back to your online computer and broadcast it online. both armory and electrum allow you to export a digital backup of your offline wallet with your private keys. it is a simple matter to make a truecrypt container with a strong password in which to store your digital backup. since both armory and electrum are deterministic wallets only one backup is only needed, ever. then just find long term secure storage offshore and upload the truecrypt container and you are good to go. using this method of cold storage your bitcoin can not be stolen because your private keys are on your offline computer (which must be encrypted with fde) with a digital copy kept securely encrypted with truecrypt at the storage location of your choice. and you can still send and receive bitcoin using your online and offline computers.', ['hacking tools'])

entirety:hash: sha512i am sweating as i write this.christmas brought grave news. i cannot adequately express how deeply honored i was by your unconditional support of my staff.i do not expect the same reaction to todays revelations. this movement is built on integrity, and i feel obligated to be forthright with you.i held myself to a high standard as your leader, yet now i must utter words all too familiar to this scarred community:we have been hacked.nobody is in danger, no information has been leaked, and server access was never obtained by the attacker.our initial investigations indicate that a vendor exploited a recently discovered vulnerability in the bitcoin protocol known as "transaction malleability" to repeatedly withdraw coins from our system until it was completely empty.despite our hardening and pentesting procedures, this attack vector was outside of penetration testing scope due to being rooted in the bitcoin protocol itself.this attack hit us at the worst possible time. we were planning on re-launching the new auto-finalize and dispute center this past weekend, and our projections of order finalization volume indicated that we would need the communitys full balance in hot storage.in retrospect this was incredibly foolish, and i take full responsibility for this decision.i have failed you as a leader, and am completely devastated by todays discoveries. i should have taken mtgox and bitstamps lead and disabled withdrawals as soon as the malleability issue was reported. i was slow to respond and too skeptical of the possible issue at hand. it is a crushing blow. i cannot find the words to express how deeply i want this movement to be safe from the very threats i just watched materialize during my watch.ive included transaction logs at the bottom of this message. review the vendors dishonest actions and use whatever means you deem necessary to bring this person to justice. more details will emerge as we continue to investigate.given the right flavor of influence from our community, we can only hope that he will decide to return the coins with integrity as opposed to hiding like a coward.it takes the integrity of all of us to push this movement forward. whoever you are, you still have a chance to act in the interest of helping this community. keep a percentage, return the rest. dont walk away with your fellow freedom fighters coins. dpr2 returned the cold storage. i didnt run with the gold. but two people alone cannot move us forward. it takes an entire community committing to integrity - and though this crushing blow will not stop us, it sure is a testament to how greedy some bastards truly are.being a part of this movement might be the most defining thing you do with your entire life.dont trade that for greed, comrades.i will fight here by your side, even the greedy bastards amongst us.this community has suffered great financial loss over and over again, and i am devastated that it has happened again under my watch.hindsight is already suggesting dozens of ways this could have been prevented, but we must march onward.the only way to reverse a communitys greed is through generosity. our true character is revealed during trying times.if this financial hardship places you at risk of physical harm, contact me directly and i will do my best to help you with my remaining personal funds.- ----------------now what.- ----------------never again store your escrow bitcoins on a server.silk road will never again be a centralized escrow storage.this week has shown the collateral damage we can cause by being a huge target and failing in just one unforeseen area.i am now fully convinced that no hosted escrow service is safe.if i cannot trust myself to keep a hosted escrow solution safe, i cannot trust anyone.multi-signature transactions are the only way this community will be protected long-term.i am aggressively tasking our devs on building out multi-sig support for commonly-used bitcoin clients. expect a generous bounty if you have the skill to implement this.- -----------------until then.- -----------------1. we will never again allow ourselves to be a single point of failure. we will never again host your escrow wallets.2. vendor registration is closed while we regroup.3. all listings on silk road are now no-escrow (finalize-early) for 1-2 months while we implement multi-signature transactions and lobby for mainstream bitcoin client multi-sig support.4. all unshipped orders have been cancelled.5. vendors may link to other marketplaces on a trail basis until we launch multi-sig, then we will re-evaluate based on community input. we do not want to be a centralized point of failure, but we also do not want to lead our buyers into dangerous waters.6. from this point forward do not trust markets with centralized escrow. use multi-signature transactions whenever possible, with trusted third parties as escrow providers.everything will be offline for 24-48 hours to minimize variables as we continue to investigate. the evidence we have below will be expanded based on our findings.- ------------------no marketplace is perfect. expect any centralized market to fail at some point. this is precisely why we must unite in the decision to decentralize.we are relieved that our security procedures protected user identities, and that no servers were compromised. this was not a worst-case scenario: nobody will be getting arrested from this. financial loss is terrible, but will not put all of us behind bars.the details we have on the hacker are below. stop at nothing to bring this person to your own definition of justice.humbled and furious,defcon- ------------------# attacker intel as of 2014-02-13 18:00:00 utcwe normally do not doxx

adequately express how deeply honored i was by your unconditional support of my staff.i do not expect the same reaction to todays revelations. this movement is built on integrity, and i feel obligated to be forthright with you.i held myself to a high standard as your leader, yet now i must utter words all too familiar to this scarred community:we have been hacked.nobody is in danger, no information has been leaked, and server access was never obtained by the attacker.our initial investigations indicate that a vendor exploited a recently discovered vulnerability in the bitcoin protocol known as "transaction malleability" to repeatedly withdraw coins from our system until it was completely empty.despite our hardening and pentesting procedures, this attack vector was outside of penetration testing scope due to being rooted in the bitcoin protocol itself.this attack hit us at the worst possible time. we were planning on re-launching the new auto-finalize and dispute center this past weekend, and our projections of order finalization volume indicated that we would need the communitys full balance in hot storage.in retrospect this was incredibly foolish, and i take full responsibility for this decision.i have failed you as a leader, and am completely devastated by todays discoveries. i should have taken mtgox and bitstamps lead and disabled withdrawals as soon as the malleability issue was reported. i was slow to respond and too skeptical of the possible issue at hand. it is a crushing blow. i cannot find the words to express how deeply i want this movement to be safe from the very threats i just watched materialize during my watch.ive included transaction logs at the bottom of this message. review the vendors dishonest actions and use whatever means you deem necessary to bring this person to justice. more details will emerge as we continue to investigate.given the right flavor of influence from our community, we can only hope that he will decide to return the coins with integrity as opposed to hiding like a coward.it takes the integrity of all of us to push this movement forward. whoever you are, you still have a chance to act in the interest of helping this community. keep a percentage, return the rest. dont walk away with your fellow freedom fighters coins. dpr2 returned the cold storage. i didnt run with the gold. but two people alone cannot move us forward. it takes an entire community committing to integrity - and though this crushing blow will not stop us, it sure is a testament to how greedy some bastards truly are.being a part of this movement might be the most defining thing you do with your entire life.dont trade that for greed, comrades.i will fight here by your side, even the greedy bastards amongst us.this community has suffered great financial loss over and over again, and i am devastated that it has happened again under my watch.hindsight is already suggesting dozens of ways this could have been prevented, but we must march onward.the only way to reverse a communitys greed is through generosity. our true character is revealed during trying times.if this financial hardship places you at risk of physical harm, contact me directly and i will do my best to help you with my remaining personal funds.- ----------------now what.- ----------------never again store your escrow bitcoins on a server.silk road will never again be a centralized escrow storage.this week has shown the collateral damage we can cause by being a huge target and failing in just one unforeseen area.i am now fully convinced that no hosted escrow service is safe.if i cannot trust myself to keep a hosted escrow solution safe, i cannot trust anyone.multi-signature transactions are the only way this community will be protected long-term.i am aggressively tasking our devs on building out multi-sig support for commonly-used bitcoin clients. expect a generous bounty if you have the skill to implement this.- -----------------until then.- -----------------1. we will never again allow ourselves to be a single point of failure. we will never again host your escrow wallets.2. vendor registration is closed while we regroup.3. all listings on silk road are now no-escrow (finalize-early) for 1-2 months while we implement multi-signature transactions and lobby for mainstream bitcoin client multi-sig support.4. all unshipped orders have been cancelled.5. vendors may link to other marketplaces on a trail basis until we launch multi-sig, then we will re-evaluate based on community input. we do not want to be a centralized point of failure, but we also do not want to lead our buyers into dangerous waters.6. from this point forward do not trust markets with centralized escrow. use multi-signature transactions whenever possible, with trusted third parties as escrow providers.everything will be offline for 24-48 hours to minimize variables as we continue to investigate. the evidence we have below will be expanded based on our findings.- ------------------no marketplace is perfect. expect any centralized market to fail at some point. this is precisely why we must unite in the decision to decentralize.we are relieved that our security procedures protected user identities, and that no servers were compromised. this was not a worst-case scenario: nobody will be getting arrested from this. financial loss is terrible, but will not put all of us behind bars.the details we have on the hacker are below. stop at nothing to bring this person to your own definition of justice.humbled and

since youre basically having to agree to route traffic for everyone else (and theyre agreeing to route traffic for you), its closer to "pay as you go", but youre paying with your own bandwidth.2. plausible deniability - just because traffic is coming from my i2p router instance, that doesnt necessarily mean its *my* traffic.\xc2\xa0 could be one of my peers traffic that im just routing.there are also some disadvantages (everything in life has a cost):1. i2p isnt "fire and forget".\xc2\xa0 you cant just connect, expect to get good bandwidth (as with tor) for free, then disconnect.\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0it really is built around the model that youre connected 24/7 (or at least, for hours on end) and always routing traffic for everyone.\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0the farther you stray from that model, the worse the performance gets.\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0you *can* connect to i2p in a hidden mode, where youre similar to a tor client, but performance is going to take a hit.\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0why would other i2p participants want to haul your traffic for you if youre not contributing to them?\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0i2p might take a few hours or a day to speed up to decent performance levels after you fire it up, and most complaints about its performance are from people who arent using it the way it was intended.2. i2p cant hide the real ips of its clients as well, because theyre relays too.\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0if everyone is a relay, everyone needs a way to know who all the relays are, and the net result is that its much easier to build a list of *all* i2p relays at any given time.\xc2\xa0 this opens up some attacks, where an adversary harvests lists of *all* i2p relays on a regular basis (i.e. who all is using i2p right now?), then works that into an intersection attack.\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0basically, "whom posted at times x, y, and z.\xc2\xa0 which i2p relays were all online at those three times?".\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0over time, intersection attacks get very effective.\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0one criticism that has been argued to hell and back at srfv2 is that in a marketplace scenario, if an adversary already knows a rough geographic location for an i2p user (i.e. they received a package from a vendor located in seattle), that intersection attack gets much easier.\xc2\xa0 not going to rehash it here.3. its hasnt received as much scrutiny.\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0academics have been beating on the tor network for a decade.\xc2\xa0 very few analyses of i2p have occurred, and that doesnt mean its problem-free.. it just means that nobodys looked at it closely.the third, rarely-mentioned network is freenet, which is a high-latency network that works much differently from tor and i2p.\xc2\xa0 wont bore you with that description here.hope that helps a little.\xc2\xa0 it gets complicated quick, and everybody ends up getting into religious battles over this versus that.\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0theyre both pretty interesting technologies, and neither one really stands up well to adversaries like nsa over the long haul, but theyre really all everyone has to work with right now.does a vpn running with i2p increases the security?', ['None'])

andrew jones (aka inigo) and gary davis (libertas) ? were immediately released on bail under the laws of the usa and ireland respectively. according to the indictment, inigo and libertas did have roles on the marketplace as well as the forums. the indictment differentiates the two where it says:?inigo?? worked as a site administrator on silk road?libertas? ?? worked as a site administrator on silk road?samesamebutdifferent?? worked as the primary moderator on the silk road discussion forums (my emphasis)nash was not granted bail because under the australian extradition act 1988, ?a magistrate or eligible federal circuit court judge shall not remand a person on bail under this section unless there are special circumstances justifying such remand?. it seems nash could not fulfil the ?special circumstances? requirement.next wednesday, nash is due back in court for a magistrate to determine whether he is ?eligible for surrender? to the us. if so, nash will be remanded in custody until the next phase of the proceedings ? surrender or review (or he can consent to extradition).under s.19 of the act, he will be eligible for surrender to us authorities if the magistrate is satisfied:(a)\xc2\xa0 the supporting documents in relation to the offence have been produced to the magistrate or judge;(b)\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0any additional requirements imposed by the us-australia extradition treaty are satisfied(c)\xc2\xa0 the conduct would have constituted an extradition offence if it had occurred in australia, and(d)\xc2\xa0 there are no substantial grounds for believing that there is an extradition objection in relation to the offencenow, a disclaimer. although i was a lawyer in my deep dark past, i have zero experience with either crime or extradition law. so i don?t know any more than anyone else. these are simply my uninformed opinions after looking at the act and extradition treaty, and knowing from two years of investigating silk road what ssbd?s role consisted of.19(b) ? any additional requirements imposed by the us-australia extradition treaty are satisfiedarticle vi of the treaty says: ?extradition shall be granted only if the evidence is found sufficient, according to the laws in the territory where the person whose extradition is requested is found, either to justify his trial or committal for trial if the offence with which he is charged or its equivalent had been committed in that territory?like i said, i don?t know what evidence they have, so i can only go on the indictment. it seems to me ?evidence? is pretty lacking in that document.first, i have no idea what evidence the us authorities have that nash is ssbd. they may have found some correspondence on the silk road servers between he and the site?s owner, dread pirate roberts. or perhaps ross ulbricht, the man accused of being dread pirate roberts, provided his details in an attempt at a plea bargain. ulbricht, it should be noted, has denied being dpr, and has denied all charges, so this seems unlikely. the indictment claims ssbd was paid around $50,000 per year. this presumably was paid in bitcoin. it is possible, though again unlikely, that the bitcoin trail was followed to nash?s bank account.most likely, the ?evidence? is an email from an anonymous email account or a message through an anonymous private claiming that ssbd?s real name is peter nash. not too compelling.this requirement for evidence is also relevant to the next two stipulations.19(c) ? the conduct would have constituted an extradition offence if it had occurred in australiathe wording says ?conduct? not ?crimes of which the person is accused?. the only conduct i could find attributed to ssbd in the indictment was:(1)\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0in relation to the narcotics charge: sent a message to dread pirate roberts, owner of silk road, summarising the actions he had taken during the previous week in his capacity as the primary forum moderator on the silk road discussion forums.-\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 i doubt that sending a message from one anonymous online account to another anonymous online account constitutes an extradition offence-\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 the narcotics charge is the only charge to have any ?overt acts? (which sounds similar to ?conduct? to me) listed underneath the charges attributable to ssbd(2)\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0in relation to the hacking charge: intentionally accessed computers without authorisation for commercial advantage and private financial gain, and in furtherance of criminal and tortious acts-\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 no ?overt acts? were listed under this charge; the above was a general accusation aimed at all three defendants; this does not sound like it could be considered ?conduct of the person constituting the offence,? which is what the act requires-\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 i would be interested to see what evidence they have that ssbd accessed computers without authorisation. there would certainly be no need to do so in order to carry out his functions of moderating a discussion forum. he would have carried out his duties on his own computer, logging in to the silk road administration panel (at least the small part he had access to), completely authorised to do so.(3)\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0in relation to the money laundering charge: conduct and attempt to conduct such financial transactions which in fact involved the proceeds of specified unlawful activity, to wit, narcotics trafficking and computer hacking-\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 no ?overt acts? were listed under this charge; the above was a general accusation aimed at all three defendants; this does not sound like it could be considered ?conduct of the person constituting the offence,? which is what the act requires-\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 again, i would be interested to see what evidence they have that ssbd conducted or attempted to conduct illegal financial transactions ? especially as conducting any transactions whatsoever was explicitly banned on the silk road forums, the only site ssbd had access to in any sort of administrative capacity. not surprisingly, dread pirate roberts wanted to keep all financial transactions on the marketplace, where he received a commission for each one19(d)\xc2\xa0 there are no substantial grounds for believing that there is an extradition objection in relation to the offence?extradition objections? (s.7) include:?(b)\xc2\xa0 the surrender of the person, in so far as it purports to be sought for the extradition offence, is actually sought for the purpose of prosecuting or punishing the person on account of his or her race, sex, sexual orientation, religion, nationality or political opinions ?; or(c)\xc2\xa0 on surrender to the extradition country in respect of the extradition offence, the person may be prejudiced at his or her trial, or punished, detained or restricted in his or her personal liberty, by reason of his or her race, sex, sexual orientation, religion, nationality or political opinions;?(my emphasis)this probably isn?t much of a legal argument, but in the real world, this whole extradition attempt smacks of politics. it?s all show so that politicians can trumpet a win on their long-doomed war on drugs. spending this sort of taxpayers? money to extradite a man who may or may not have been paid a paltry $50k a year to perform mundane administration tasks on what was purely a website for discussions? there is no suggestion that nash sold drugs himself. hell, there?s not even a suggestion that he bought drugs. just these trumped-up charges so conservatives can parade him in front of the media, claiming they?ve brought down some sort of evil drug cartel.according to the attorney-general?s department annual reports, most extradition requests are to return ex-pats, not australian citizens. they tend to be for fugitives that have escaped with hundreds of millions of fraudulently-obtained funds, or child sex predators of the most heinous kind.the united states requests extradition of two to four people from australia a year. should peter nash really be one of them', ['None'])

(579345, 83351, 'most of you all have read this, but for those who havent, it is a gem, definitely a must read...enjoy friends.crystal to blotter [lsd] ________________________________________the information in this thread was generously provided by chinacat72, a member of mycotopia forum, in 2005."i will discuss lsd crystal and what happens with it. this info is from my experiences a long time ago.i can safely offer it because i have retired from this line of work and stay far away from it. first i will briefly discuss the people or family as there called so you can get an appreciation for what they do and have done. the family is motivated to spread lsd because we believe that lsd is a key givin to us from above. lsd was givin to man from god to help him see the error of his ways. why do you think it was discovered during the most horrible time in history. it is the antidote for the atomic bomb. it`s doesn`t matter if you beleive this or not ,because what i`m trying to express is how deeply important the family feels about the sacred value of lsd. those who are at the upper level`s of the family will gladly sacrifice there lifes and freedom to do this work. ok now down to the crystal. i have little knowlege about lsd manufacture so i`m going to talk about the final product the crystal. on tour crystal came in brown glass bottles with 1-10 grams in them. the bottles were sealed and contained co2 and crystal. you can`t just buy crystal from family. first you have to be taught how to lay it ,which i`ll cover in a little bit. also you have to do a thumbprint(eat it) there are no exeptions to this rule.the reason is to make sure your karma is clean enough to handle this sacred work. types of crystal needlepoint -very pure(95% ) white powerdery crystal,was available in small amount`s. the best of the best white fluff -very pure(95% ) white light flakes of crystal. still around and the most sought after. very pure silver -good and clean(85-90% )-light greyish crystal. was an unbelievable amount of this around in the late eighty`s and early nineties. very good stuff. my first thumbprint was this kind. if you ate acid in the 80-90`s you probably sampled some silver. amber -decent(70%?) this crystal varied from a light amber color to an almost dark brown color.was always available.one batch called quadricept amber was the color of light honey and was very good.lot`s a people worked with this crystal but i always would use silver instead since it was better and the same price. lavender -(60-70%?) light purple to almost black colored crystal. like amber it varied batch to batch. tj (tornado juice) - purity unknown. i seen this shit in about four different colors and it always scared me. no experiance with it. champagne -(50-60% ) black crystal, nasty stuff imho. i worked with it once and swore to never touch it again. ok so you got some crystal and need to get it on blotter. it`s a pretty amazing feeling holding a jar in your hands that has 10 grams of crystal in it. that`s 100,000 doses in the palm of your hand. for dealing with laying we`ll say we got 1 gram. acid is always layed 1 gram=10 tenpacks. a tenpack is tensheets. 1gram=10,000doses. if your laying needlpoint your doses will be 95mcg, because your crystal is 95% pure. if your laying amber your shit will be 70mcg, because it`s 70% pure. got it now you get a glass pyrex pan to dip your tenpacks in. your crystal is dissovled into 110ml. of everclear per gram.the purer crystals dissolve instantly with a little stirring. the not so pure take a little shaking. champange is damn near impossible to get to dissolve evenly. paper-for white blotter standard watercolor paper#14 or equivalent is used. it`s critical you get the right paper. if you don`t it won`t absorb right and you`ll fuck it all up.print`s are made up ahead of time and perferated.ok so you got your crystal dissolved and your paper cut and ready. there are 2 schools when it comes to putting it on the paper. first dump the solution in the pan and dip each tenpack into it then lift it up and let any excess solution run off into the pan. second method is to put the tenpack into the pan and squirt the solution on it with a baby syringe(the ones they give little kids medicine with). i have done both and prefer dipping them just because its quicker .then the tenpacks are layed out to dry which doesn`t take long since alcohol evaporates quickly. if you did it right there will be very little residue left in the bottom of the pan.this redidue is extremely potent and is either soaked up with a piece of paper(called mop up) or made into potent liquid(called wash). whatever you choose this is saved for your personal use. while your doing all this you get very,very high. as soon as you open the jar of crystal it intoxicates the air. most people were rubber gloves when doing this some don`t. just don`t have any plans afterwards. there might be slightly different methods used when laying, but this is how the dead family does it. after the tenpacks are dryed there distibuted and eaten up. since the end of the grateful dead the massive distribution network that used to get rid of so much acid has been broken up badly. never fear acid is still out there" lsd is still around though it seems that a majority of the labs are inactive at the moment. this is normal as they don`t produce all the time. most like the silver family only produce about every 5 years. though they usually produce enough to last that long. when the grateful dead toured massive amount`s of lsd were distributed around the country. on a typical east coast tour 100-150grams could easily be sold. thats a million to a million and a half doses. this flooded these citys and the lsd trickled down to every nook and cranny of america. by the time it was dry again another tour would roll through the region and resupply it. plus we would meet people on tour from certain area`s of the country and keep them supplied with the help of the good ole usps. sadly when the dead stopped touring this network went into shambles. people fell out of touch and with no shows ,there wasn`t the marketplace for distibution.in turn parts of the country arn`t getting saturated anymore. lsd isn`t moved and sold like the cartel`s move coke and such. it`s handled by a brotherhood of people who truly believe there doing the work of god(or whatever name you call creation). we believe that lsd crystal has to be handled by the right people who are totally committed to the movement. when we moved crystal there was always the feeling that we were protected by a higher power. i can`t tell you how many times i have had crystal or acid on me or my brothers and have been in situation`s where we should have gotten busted and something always protected us. so many times that coincidence is not an option. why do i think we were protected. because the family does it for mankind not money. we viewed lsd as the only hope for the radical change in conciousness that would save us. so in effect we viewed are work as the work of god. you know why they never busted a family lab? because we would never betray lsd. just as jesus was nailed to the cross we were willing to spend the rest of our lives in jail or die to protect what we viewed as the salvation of are species. sound`s a little dramatic doesn`t it, but i`m trying to give you an understanding of the faith in lsd that the family has. by the way the kansas bust was not a family lab incase anybody is wondering. the point i`m trying to make is the family believes lsd has to move through the right hands. this is why you can`t go down to the corner and get a gram of crystal. sorry to ramble. as some of the cooks retire i rest assure you that they pass there recipes and secret`s down to those chosen to continue to fight the good fight. i don`t think it will ever be as readily available all over the country as it once was due to the break up of the distribution cycle of tour. i could be wrong and hope i am. alot of old family have moved on and including myself retired, feeling we served our time. the family does hear your cry`s for more acid and they don`t plan on giving up on mankind. nows a good time for labs to be inactive. the current government administration is viewed as a bad storm that needs to pass as jerry sang "all good things in all good time" keep the faith""for me and the rest of the people on tour it was just a matter of spending year after year on tour. the elder`s that are on top keep in a eye on everybody that help`s move there stuff. they also know the intentions of those people. if they know your true and a total believer in the work they start letting you hang around. many hour`s are spent in hotel rooms watching them work. they make sure you know every detail. also they make sure that you know the importance of being honest and laying your product correctly. every hit you lay has the potential to change somebody`s life and bring them into the light. it`s taught like an apprenticeship. my first thumbprint was silver. before my print i thought i was pretty experienced with acid. i had been puddled many times with strong liquid. i wasn`t near as experienced as i thought as i walked into the room and everybody had a huge grin on there face, and i saw what i was about to take. thumbprint`s arn`t weighed out on a scale. it`s more of "that`s a nice little chunk ,that should do" your talking several sheet`s or more when you do a print. fluff and needlpoint are damn pure and i don`t imagine bears was any purer. i have heard of batches of needlepoint being as high as 98% white fluff is gorgous crystal. we would eat this crystal like crazy. when i first met the main guy in charge of this crystal he was snorting it!!!! after i did a fluff print i never did any other kind except needlepoint. when you eat crystal you definatly can tell the differences between them. purity does matter at that level." isnt a thumbprint dangerous? youd think a persons mind would be changed forever after doing that amount. "a thumbprint isn`t even close to the largest doses people have done. dangerous? lsd is physiologicaly one of the safest drugs there are. there`s not one valid death that can be attributed to physiological complications from taking lsd. i didn`t know all this when i was taking it though. psychologically it could be very negative if the wrong person does it. that`s why we didn`t just walk around the parking lot handing out thumbprint`s. as far as high doses go, it totally opens you up. for about a week afterwards your first print you need some babysitting. hell you`ve just been reborn! after awhile it`s less tramatic. as for after effects. i am middle aged and healthy. i have 3 bright healthy children. and i`m just getting my bachelor`s degree with a 3.5gpa i do feel high very often though, but i don`t mind. the man that gave me my first print still does crystal once in awhile and he`s in his mid sixties."you mention the purity varying on alot of the crystal. how are they checking purity? just roughly with how long it takes to dissolve in a solvent? "i can tell by color. how crystallin it is and what color it is. you can inspect the crystal once you know what good clean crystal looks like. and then you can compare. i have a moto "if its white its all right". of course the jugement on my end is not scientific . i examin it like jewelers do jewels. the only real way to get a very accurate reading on how pure it is comes from the lab. most decent labs have a gc/ms and can get a decent purity reading from that. needlepoint and white fluff are the only ones that are reliably consistant. silver varies a little. lavender and amber vary greatly in appearance from batch to batch. indicating a difference in purity. if i was buying amber or lavender i would want to see it first. they have a tendancy every once in awhile to skimp on the last part of manufacture. the rinse and recrysitazation at the end is crucial in determing purity. if this isnt done enough your product is less pure.some of you may have heard owsley say he lost 20% of his product making sure its pure. thats because he rised it a ton of times. thats why his shit was said to be better than sandoz. amber and lavender if they dont due this good there crystal looks more dirty. also the purer you make your crystal the less it weighs and its sold by weight." how long does lsd "stay good"? i mean if i was to take it, put it in a zippylock and then put it in the pages of a book (someplace with unchanging air and no light) "i find that exact method perfect. i took two sheets of needlepoint and wraped them in plastic wrap then a. foil and put them in the middle of a book on a bookshelf. there going on 3 years old and last time somebody tried them they were very potent. they get no light ,air ,and are in a cool enviroment. as for crystal its stored in brown glass vials that are filled with co2 and sealed." you said the family was always on tour with the dead. do you know offhand if any of them ever had the occasion to hang with jerry and the guys? "a lot of the older guys did. hell the family started with the dead and bear. its all connected from the band, crew to the fans and faithful. as for hanging with jerry myself , no. i got backstage several times, but that doesnt mean anything. theres backstage and then there is the bands backstage ,thats off limits. i would much rather be in the crowd. the closest i ever got to jerry was ten feet as he walked by me and a bunch of other people. i just smiled. i had nothing to say. he had a lot of pressure with all the people who clung to him and thought he was a god. it was really hard for him to deal with and one of the reasons he turned to smack imho. i had nothing to say to him ,except mabye "play st. stephen!" i was just curious what kind of sheets were going around when you were into it, was there always different sheets or was there stockpiles of certain kinds? "over the 8 years i was on tour i saw more prints than i possibly could remember or list. i wouldnt even know were to begin. hundreds and hundreds of different kinds. my favorite was plain white unperferated paper. the reason for this was alot of cops dont know what a tenpack of white unperfed blotter looks like. once on a greyhound bus from floridia to baltimore our bus was stopped and a bunch of feds got on it. they searched everybodys bags. they were looking for guns or coke since we were coming from floridia. ill never forget the feeling of watching a federal agent (fbi i believe) go through my bag and pull stuff out. i had a gram(ten- tenpacks or 10,000 doses) of white paper. he pulled it out and had no clue what it was . it looked like just a bunch of ten inch square pieces of paper to him. had it be perferated and had a print on it he probably would have known. after that i was a true believer in white unperfed paper. prints are usually made in mass amounts and then sold to the different familys. so one kind of print can actually have several different kinds of crystal on them. this happened years ago with the jesus christ prints. the first ones were made of very pure white fluff and they were dipped to contain a little over 100mcg. people went nuts over them and the were the talk of the summer. then the lavender family got hold of the same print and put there dirty ass crystal on them and they were about half the strength as the original white fluff batch. people should know the truth about lsd. the internet is the perfect medium to transfer this knowlege. just enough info can be given to paint a general picture of how things work, without giving specifics that would endanger this important work. i am in the perfect position to do so. i am long enough removed from the active scene to offer information without endangering anyone including myself. my friends that still live in the old world are very supportive. now it seams lifetimes ago. i was just a tool in a very large tool box. the family was around long before i came around. luckily it was in a time when a lot of the older folks were around to help with the scene. for me lsd is a gift and tool given to man from the heavens. i truly believe it is here to point us back towards the light. these values are the same with almost all the family. after you get a glimpse of eternity you cant help ,but want to share it with others who need it." sand, scully, and owsely were the original chemists working for the family? "yes, all 3 were family. owsely was the original chemist of the dead scene/family. he set many of the standards and ethics still held today. he also got sand and scully involved and doing this work for the people not money. sand and scully were in the "brotherhood of eternal love". back then it was basically all one big network or family. after the feds broke up the bel in the 70s is when people split off and ran smaller labs,networks and were known by there product. i would also like to note that when all 3 were busted they were all threatend with huge sentences. they kept there mouth shut and served very little time in comparison to how much they could have served. pickard was family many years ago. he has been busted for manufacturing 3 times. on his second bust he ran his mouth to the feds about other drug activity within the scene resulting in several people getting prison time. after that he was shunned and nobody in the family would work for him. that is why he had to work with such shady people in kansas. had he been working with family he wouldnt be going to serve a lifetime prison sentence, he wouldnt have been busted at all. on his second bust instead of biting the bullet and keeping his mouth shut like sand, scully, and owsely, he chose to make a deal. many years later now he is going to prison for life because he was betrayed in the same way. i do hope that pickard can get out of prison before his life ends. he has a new kid that was just born and a new wife. he has done a great service to man by making lsd. i would hope that after a few years he can get released and live his remaining years with his new family. i doubt he will be so lucky though. many of us who have been graced by lsd owe a great debt to these 3 pioneer chemists and the ones that still remain active and unknown today." -continued', ['hacking tools'])
(579349, 83351, 'continued-"in the days of old tour wasnt just a time to flood the country with lsd, but also about making connections. for those of us on the road full time we needed an income when we got back to the bay area. meeting kind people on tour was always nice, but it also provided an chance to spread the juice when we wernt traveling. when the dead toured 4 times a year you would meet all sorts of folks from every nook and crany of the us. some of these people were chosen to provide for there community. this is a huge link in the distribution chain. and its also in very, very bad shape. when jerry died there was a lot of folks who quit touring. as people moved around connections were severed. in the old days if you lost track of people you knew you would see them at the next tour. now thats not an option because there is no tour. people have fell out of touch. people have moved on. so as the years have moved on the existing links have been stretched thinner and thinner."im starting to think the brotherhood is just one more lost religion. "i have little faith in the lsd movement ever getting full steam again. i hope im wrong. it will always be around, but the not like it was. the distribution system is in shambles. it seems that a whole new generation of younger people lacking the once highly held ethics are ruining things. on a positive note, the psychedelic movement will continue. things change and may seem dark ,but we must continue. the psychedelic experience and man have been together for thousands of years. it survived christianity,it can survive anything. it goes underground now and then, but is there for those dedicated enough to seek it out. if you feel strongly about the benefits of psychedelics then do something positive about it. you cant expect the old generation to carry the torch forever. a new wave of dedicated folks needs to rise up and continue this work. can you think of a more important thing to do? i believe theres a large number of us who would love to get into it and help, how is this possible? "it is going to be tough for any new people to get into this work. this summer has shown that poor choices were made in who would spread the love. not saying it cant be done, but it will be tough. it usually takes a few years of hanging around. your intentions will be tested. not to worry though, because there are many ways we can all help. first is to become educated and responsible when it comes to psychedelics. know the facts and when debating sceptics be mature and informed. most people have very poor info about lsd. rumors and bullshit plague its myth. the more people we have telling the truth the better. turn people on. youll never make a closer friend than one you turned on. after you get to know the effects of psychedelics you can tell that certain people would benefit from them. talk to them if theyre willing. dont be pushy, but offer them info. then if they want offer them the chance. the more truthful info they have the better off theyll be. i am a firm believer that psychedelics can be shown to be useful in mental health. i am in the middle of a 9 year academic voyage to get the proper credentials to help if the chance arises. if we can prove through science and medicine that lsd is benifitial then we make a great step forward. not only will it help expell the nasty rumors around them, but give people the chance touch the healing energy that lsd can open up. studies are under way in the us right now. there for conditions like ocd. even though most of us dont have ocd this study is important. it establishes the safety of psychedelics. this opens the doors for further studies that cover other areas. before the scheduling of lsd there was a lot of research being done. alot of it was very promising. lsd and other psychedelics were placed in the schedule one category and access to them was cut off even to legit researchers. this was a total political move that had nothing to do with the saftey or benefits of lsd. it was about trying to get control of a generation that didnt want to be under control. theres many researchers in the world very interested in psychedelic research. these are very bright m.d.s, phds and scientists. the more help on this front the better. this is were i will spend my remaining years for the movement. supply- there is always a need for psychedelics. if your totally dedicated and willing to risk your freedom to better this planet through providing psychedelics then all the info you need is available at your finger tips. i can think of nothing more important for the survival of our species and those we live with then for us all to have access to the psychedelic experience." to give some closure to this thread, a beautiful prayer: -by innerbeing "let us pray for the brotherhood, for their infinite compassion, and for their understanding of the sufferings of us unawakened individuals. may they realize that there are many who could benefit from their understanding here and now. we could only hope that they will recognize the need amongst us and they will respond out of their compassionate grace to help us in these dark times. we must generate the loving consciousness that has been lost in this decade.....we must develop loving-kindness for all of our brothers and sisters, and we must share these qualities with everyone at all times. the time has come, my dear brothers, for a reawakening of the values, of which you hold so dear, let us continue what you have started. we wait with patience for your response....and we shall continue to wait for as long as it takes. peace be with you all."', ['hacking tools'])

information is on how the dead/rainbow/origanal family handle lsd.when lsd crystal is bought it comes in little glass viles. its a dense crystal and a gram of it looks alot smaller than a gram of coke or flour(or other powder). ten grams can fit in a vile small enough to hold in your hand and clentch your fist and conceal.anyway as i said in my other thread [http://mycotopia.net...lotter-lsd.html when you first buy crystal from the family theirs 2 requirements. 1. you have to be taught how to lay it properly and be trusted to do so on your own. 2. you have to do a thumbprint. the family believes lsd crystal should only be handled by those with the proper energy or karma to do so. theres no better way to test somebodys faith of lsd than give them a thumbprint.originaly thumprints were given by taking the glass vile and puting your thumb overthe top of the vile and turning it and fliping it upside down real quick. this put a coating of crystal on your thumb which was pessed into the palm of the person ,leaving your crystal imbedded thumbrint in there palm(hence the term thumprint) where it would absorb(or they might lick it off.). this was your certification nowadays thumbprints are eaten. any time someone eats crystal its refered to as a print. this way was adopted because its more efficiant.as for the experiance itself. all revievers are experianced with lsd(at least they think so until there printed ) you feel it almost instantly. lsd crystal has an energy to it. having a jar of it my pocket is enough to alter my conciousness. as soon as it touches your skin or goes in your mouth you can feel it. alot of folks will throw up within minutes. this is an exorcism of sorts. like all the negative energy being cast out of your body. then you lay down and learn. as for the experiance i just couldnt do it justice to describe it. your never the same again.a thumprint doesnt open the door of perception it blows it off the hinges.you melt into eternety. you let go and die into the moment which is all. there is no you anymore only all. the intensity of this cant be described, but you realize as your sliping away that its familar.this is because it become quite clear this is exactlly what happens when you die. after an eternity you slowly start to come back in pieces. you feel reborn and a completely different person. you dont ever come completely down or back. this isnt a bad thing ,but its very scary at first.i wont try to describe it any more because i cant. also after your experianced with eating crystal its a little less tramatic. your first one is spent on the ground. after awhile i could eat crystal at shows and whatnot.i have only seen one print go bad and i described this in my other thread. the guy says its the most important event of his life and now lives happily so i guess it wasnt bad. his reaction at the time was.i think psychedelics are safer in large doses(im not talking about thumbprint sizes though) as far as bad trips go. they override your egos defenses in large enough doses. you cant think your having a bad trip because you cant think at all beacause there is no you. :dterrance mckenna and andrew weil md have said this also.it is hard to describe a thumbprint. human language cannot describe an experiance that is encompasses all of life. every cell of every creature or living thing that ever lived or will live is connected by the energy or light. when we die are body and our ego is gone. we become one with eternity or the light or god or whatever name you wish to call it. a thumbprint allows this to happen and rerturn to our physical body. my first print i layed down and quickly realized that this was my actual death. you watch the whole process unfold with complete awareness.i didnt cling to my body i just realized my life had passed. as i was spiraling up or out i saw my life evolve through the years i lived. the happiness, the sadness,the people i loved and the people i didnt. the joy that i gave and the pain that i caused. i saw the true nature of reality and why things were the way they were. as i got higher i saw the nature of reality on the cosmic scale and saw that the reason for our evolution was to experiance love. to love is to have experianced the finest of life. then came the moment were it was time to let go. as i did it came for me and i sobbed uncontrolabley for i realized that the light or energy we call god or creation was perfect. it was pure unconditional love.what else could god have been i realized. that glint of innocent perfection in a babys eye. the light was pure as the heart of jesus christ. i dissolved into it and died. since there was no me only the all ,i cannot remember the rest because there was no me to remember. after forever i slowly decended into my body.i spent days awake afterwards talking to myself. i vowed to god to spread lsd so others could see the light. i vowed to look at every person as the lord and treat them as such.i was reborn and continue to live by the values i learned. i became as active as i could spreading lsd. year after year in hotel rooms with a pyrex pan and watercolor paper. hoping excitedly that some of these hits will help guide my brothers and sisters back towards the light. lsd is a direct message from god. period. i dont think we get another chance. we can love each other or we can kill each other ,but it is up to us. as i always say in my threads as a reminder, my work with lsd ended years ago.as for eating and going to the bathroom. i dont think i ate for a week afterwards. as for going to the bathroom i hadnt eaten before hand at my guides advise so it wasnt a problem. i remember letting go as it got dark and coming back a lttle before sunrise. i was high for along time afterwards and as i said earlier you never fully return. i feel high all the time still and its been years.also i did many, many prints after that. i have eaten a lot of crystal but it was never like that first time.i must stress that i was in the company of very evolved and older people that made sure my experiances were optimal. these were kind old spirits that had been were i was going many years before and many times. they held me as a baby every inch of the way.you have heard of near death experiances right. a thumbprint is a beyond death experiance.i have a rich life now thats full of good fortune. a wonderful wife and 3 children who are completely wonderful. every day is complete joy. i couldnt ask for more, but i know it will end one day for good. i await this day with no fear ,but the knowlege that that most rewarding and enlightening experiance of life is death....ok ill tell you about the one that went bad.this finds me in oakland in the early 90s. between tours i would sit out in san francisco and keep things flowing. friends from the east coast would need shit so i would lay it and mail it or others would come out to get a lower price and i would lay it and send them on there way. well a real good friend came out to get 4 or 5 grams.with him he had a few people. i told him he could help me lay it and to have his friends hang out in the city till were done. he says this friend of his is ready to come with us. now i had talked to the guy before and knew he was connected to the rainbow family, but his energy seamed weird. trusting my friends judgement i said alright.so we decide to drive over to oakland to lay it in a hotel. we get to some sleazy hotel out by the freeway and get ready. now im a little edgy about this newbie watching, but as long as he stays out of the way its fine. so we get to work and it takes quite awhile to lay 5 grams of acid. thats 50 tenpack or 50,000 doses. were done and cleanin up and he say my friend is ready for a print. im like are you sure and he says i think so. i look at his friend and hes like just give it to me i can handle it. so i get out my jar of silver crystal and knock some out on the nightstand because my friend wants to take some with him to do in the mountains.well this fuckin dude sticks his finger right in my pile of crystal and then licks it. im like thats a pretty hefty dose there soldier. hes like ya whatever now what do we do. then i started to realize it was going to get weird. within 2 minutes hes saying man my fuckin stomach hurts that was poison. im like go in the bathroom your going to puke. he goes in there and and we hear him cussin and puking. meanwhile im askin my friend what the hell hes got us into. then the bathroom door opens and he comes out butt naked saying im gettin the fuck out of here.were like no man just chill your not going to be able to get far. we put him in the back bedroom and turn the lights out and figure thats best for him. i close the door and tell him if he needs me were there. i figure hes got some things to sort out with god. now this hotel is right on the freeway. in fact you can jump out the window onto it. were also on the second floor. well were sitting there and im making some phone calls telling people im going to be hung up for awhile and i hear cars on the freeway honking. we go back into the bedroom and hes halfway out the window, getting ready to jump onto the oakland freeway naked as the day he was born.we pull him back into the room and hes starting to realize hes dying.he thinks im causing him to die and im the devil. now shit gets ugly. hes screaming at us that hes dieing and trying to get out of the hotel. since i just layed 5 grams im high also as is my friend. we call some other friends to come over. were holding him down on the bed trying to cover his mouth. we have 50,000 doses of freshly layed lsd in the room and i dont need the cops coming. i take the pan and all the supplies i used to lay with and throw them out the window onto the freeway.my other friends get there and we tell the girls take the acid and get out of hear quick. this guys screaming at the top of his lungs that hes dying and i know the other hotel guests can here him. its got to be any minute that the oakland police show up. im telling him to let go ,dont fight it. he thinks im satan so hes not listening to anything i say. also as we have been wrestling him he has lost control of his bodily fluids. theres puke ,shit and piss all over. i cant imagine what the cops are going to think when they come in and see a couple hippies on some guy covered in puke and shit screaming im dying as we tell him its ok hell like it.after awhile he stops moving. he was sucked into eternity. he was gone. as he layed there motionless we cleaned him up. and my friend sang amazing grace over and over to him. after an hour passed i realized the cops hadnt came. i contribute this to 2 things. the protection of god and the fact we were in a nasty part of oakland and people mind there own buisness.my girl comes by and brings us clean shirts and pants. itake a shower and clean up as they watch him and then we take turns. my nerves are frazzled. im high and this guys bad trip has really wigged me out. me and my girl decide to go for a walk since my friends with him and hes not moving. we get out side and realize that going for a walk at 3 am in oakland isnt going to be good. she senses my tension and we go to the side of the hotel in some bushes were she layes me down and sets my mind at ease with that magic only a woman can perform.as dawn breaks hes coming around. talking incoherantly ,but i can see a sparkle in his eye. we all part ways and me and my girl head back to sf to get some sleep.a day or two later my friend calls and says there heading home and to come say goodbye. i get there and this guy comes up to me and gives me a big hug and says hes sorry. i tell him dont worry about it. he then tells me that he met god and was a different person now. this makes me happy.this man hasnt taken lsd since and lives in oregon and owns a organic farm.hes happy with a family and at peace.he says that night was the most important and best thing that ever happened to him. i see him at the oregon county fair every year and we always have a big hug.hes turned into somebody i really admire and love.after this incedent i became very carefull of who i printed.', ['hacking tools'])

(2 way \xc2\x96 3 way)basically, multi-signature, when used for arbitration, works by creating a 2-of-3 multisig that the payment is deposited to. there are three parties involved \xc2\x96 the buyer, the seller and the arbitrator. two of those three have to cooperate in order to release the payment.to give a more tangible example, lets say bob wants to buy something from alice, and they both trust trent as an arbitrator that can mediate disputes. bob deposits his payment to a 2-of-3 multisig address with thepublic keys of bob, alice and trent. alice can verify the payment was made and that the payment is \xc2\x93locked\xc2\x94 in the multisig deposit, and ships the goods to bob.if bob got the goods and he\xc2\x92s satisfied, he and alice can be the 2-of-3 and release the payment from the multisig to alice\xc2\x92s bitcoin address. in case of dispute, they both contact trent and explain what happened. then, either bob+trent can sign a transaction that issues a refund to bob, or alice+trent can sign a transaction that moves the funds to alice.the process on the website itself looks like that:1. bob goes to the \xc2\x93new transaction\xc2\x94 page, enters the arbitrator (either a username of a registered arbitrator, or any public key) and the terms of the transaction (those are signed digitally by bob and alice, which later proves to trent they both agreed to it)2. bob starts the transaction, and gets a link to share with alice. when alice enters, she confirms the arbitrator/terms by clicking \xc2\x93i agree\xc2\x943. bob and alice now see the transaction page with the multisig address, and bob makes the payment.4. alice see the payment was received (by checking the multisig balance) and ships the product.5. at this point, bob or alice can create a transaction that releases the funds, and ask the other party to approve it. if they get into a dispute, they have a link they can share with trent, where he can be the 2nd party that approves transactions.how it can be used anonymously?bitrated does not require an account or even an email address from buyer/sellers. the only details users provide are the terms of the transaction, which aren\xc2\x92t uploaded to the server and only shared via the url the parties send to eachother.arbitrators can optionally sign up to have a public profile listed on the website, but they don\xc2\x92t have to. they can simply provide their public key to the buyer/seller and have them use it.i saw you mentioned in one of our previous mails it based *mostly* on client side, can you elaborate on this?bitrated was built with a very strong security/privacy model. almost everything happens client-side, with the server not being involved unless its 100% necessary. private keys are created and used client side, transactions are constructed and signed client-side and the transaction data, including the terms, is only saved as part of the url each party has and isn\xc2\x92t stored on the server at all.the server is only involved in order to enable communication between clients. its impossible to communicate between browsers directly, so a websocket server is used to send information between connected clients. the data that is sent via the server isn\xc2\x92t considered sensitive \xc2\x96 just the the public key of the party joining the transaction and the partially-signed transaction request. both of those are sent immediately to the other clients and discarded, with no permanent copy being saved. (in the future, we plan to encrypt that end-to-end too)elaborate on how you don\xc2\x92t touch the private keys and how it can be verified?private keys are created and used client-side, and are never transmitted to the server. each party gets a url with his own private key embedded in the hash portion of the url (after the \xc2\x93#\xc2\x94, which is not part of the httprequest).bitrated is an open-source software that can be audited by anyone. it can be independently verified that the client-side code never sends sensitive information to the server, and it can be verified that the source served bythe webserver matches the code on github.in the future, we plan to provide a browser extension that does this automatically and ensures that the code coming from bitrated.com matches the code published on github.is there a possibility for the arbitrator to collect some fee? fees are possible, but not currently handled specifically in bitrated. there are basically two fees structures that i see people using:fees for every transaction, which is the common model today. in this case, it should be paid as a separate transaction, before starting the multisig. the arbitrator should simply refuse to handle disputes where the fee wasn\xc2\x92t paid in advance.fees for disputed transactions only. because the arbitrator doesn\xc2\x92t have to do anything when there\xc2\x92s no dispute, some of them choose to only charge for disputes. in this case, it can be paid from the multisig balance, where the arbitrator will simply refuse to sign transactions without his fees. bitrated\xc2\x92s interface can be used to create a transaction sending some percentage of the balance as fees to the arbitrator, and the rest to the winning party.most people using tor markets trying to avoid using js, and your service is based on js, how can this work together?i would be very careful about running java and flash, but i think js is relatively safe to execute. most of the web doesn\xc2\x92t function properly without javascript, and its necessary for a service like bitrated thatrelies heavily on client-side technology. also, its open source and can be verified to not contain malicious code.who provides the arbitration?bitrated doesn\xc2\x92t provide the arbitration services themselves \xc2\x96 the goal is to create a marketplace for arbitration services. we allow arbitrators to signup and offer their services for a fee, and let users choose which arbitrator they want to use.why not make a n .onion domain for this service?.onion is good for websites that wants to conceal their identity. bitrated is operated in the open and has a known owner (my name and my company\xc2\x92s name is listed in the about page), so i don\xc2\x92t think it\xc2\x92ll achieve much.service name:\xc2\xa0 bitrated service url: https://www.bitrated.com/feel free to try it out and contact the service admin directly at nadav@bitrated.com if you have any issues, questions or suggestions for improvements.we have also added this solution to the list of hidden marketplaces as a related service', ['hacking tools'])

ive received. i am consistently blown away by how the core of this community come together in times of strife.. to the multitude of you who lost faith in silk road, i still am glad ive heard your words. i am still devastated that i have failed you. and even i have fallen victim to this attack\xc2\xa0 the majority of my personal earnings are completely gone. my life is not in danger though, and my identity is still protected\xc2\xa0 i\xc2\x92m thankful for this.so now, it\xc2\x92s time to share with you our plan to move forward.i realize you have no way of knowing whether im telling the truth, on anything. trying to communicate the authenticity of my true character on the darknet is difficult to say the least, and i do not expect any of you to take me at my word. but my actions over the next few weeks will speak louder than words ever could, and if you stick around you\xc2\x92ll realize this.silk road is not deadwe are here to stay, and for the most part, i believe our values are the same as yours\xc2\xa0 the community\xc2\x92s. and even though i represent the latest idiot to make a security mistake, i am unlike those who simply give in, and am determined to use lessons learned to fight for this communitys long term security. im focusing on multi-signature transactions as our only safe trading mechanism long term. additionally, i am ready and willing to collaborate with other darknet administrators and utilize our talented penetration testing team to help them to regularly audit their security.and although the tinfoil club will probably hate this and continue to tear me to shreds without regard for my actions in december, and whether you choose to believe them or not, here are the facts:1. i live a very busy and complicated life. i take opsec to extreme levels which consume many of my hours per day. any time you see me here, it means i have completed a checklist which requires over an hour of preparation for me to reposition and reconfigure many things to ensure i leave the most minimal trail possible and can "safely" connect to this place. this job will never be safe, and it is impossible to be perfectly covert. i know what i am facing, both from le and from vendors who do not share my opinions of non-violence.2. all released announcements were my true plans, and all delays were due to unanticipated external factors upon which i cannot elaborate. my staff has been very frustrated at my lack of ability to keep the dev team on time. again, this is completely my fault and something for which i take complete responsibility. i do not trust any developers, so i meticulously review anything the dev team sends to me. many have criticized me for this, and i listened to them. had i reviewed the code even more meticulously and delayed the fix to speed up slow withdrawals last month, transaction malleability would not have affected us at all. this is completely my fault for listening to critics instead of my own sense of caution.3. the public has known that auto-finalize has been disabled for a long time, and has known that the escrow balance is massive.4. any smart person could deduce that re-enabling of auto-finalize requires me to move a vast sum from cold storage to the hot storage wallet to ensure adequate fund availability (which admittedly was too large and one of my biggest failures this month). the attack was surgical and timed perfectly.the reason such a high quantity of coins was stolen was because we were preparing to implement auto-finalization and had therefore moved a huge volume from the cold storage to the hot storage to ensure the coins from all auto-finalized orders could be withdrawn without a hitch.here are as many details on the attack as i can provide. i am still investigating, and do not want to leak anything which could compromise any other markets. transparency in this issue is key, however, you deserve as granular an explanation as possible as to why this happened.sr2 attack investigation results as of feb 151. when withdrawal delays were happening last month, we wrote a custom bitcoin implementation using several available libraries a reference, and built it on a shared infrastructure to load balance across accounts and provide risk mitigation if ever one server was compromised.2. as this implementation was being written by behind-the-scenes dev staff, a lynch mob was getting exponentially worse in the forums. our moderator staff became more and more insistent that it was crucial to fix this problem immediately, relaying to me many concerns, and threats, from the community.3. we cut a corner, deciding to watch transactions. many community members were reporting missing withdrawals, weeks after sending them. we implemented a liberal check to the "refresh deposit balances" link on the account page - in essence, we allowed it to search deeply for any missing coins, rescanning and rescanning. one of our team members was familiar with mtgoxs procedures and source code and vouched for the idea. our thoughts were that if the largest bitcoin exchange was using this approach to find missing coins, it must be commonplace. (i received her/his permission to publish this.)4. the transaction malleability bug was published last week at a time when i was disconnected from the internet for an extended period for opsec reasons. i did not become aware of the threat until the attack was already occurring. this was a failure on my part to trust more staff with critical access to stop withdrawals. the people who did have access to disable withdrawals were terrified of doing it without my permission, due to how negatively the community reacts when withdrawals are turned off. they knew if they disabled withdrawals, then re-enabled them, there would be a run on the bank and i would need to be online to deposit cold storage into hot storage. in effect, this was my failure to emphasize to staff that it is always okay to lean on the side of caution and hit killswitches as they deem necessary. it was also my failure to communicate expectations to the community that sometimes killswitches will have to be hit, and it just means were playing it safe. this month it is clear we did not play it safe. killswitches are pointless if the only person confident enough to hit them is the boss.5. the attacker used an account first registered in early jan to try exploiting the vulnerability. looking back at the accounts history indicates that this account has been used to pentest many aspects of our system unsuccessfully. every previous attempt to find an attack vector failed, due to hardening done by our penetration testing team. i had previously seen these attempts in the logs as something to celebrate: "look, our hardening is working, this hacker would have won, but we put security over features!" - several people suggested disabling the hackers accounts, but that is pointless in our business as anyone can simply re-register.6. we are still unclear as to the exact approach used to cause our servers perception of transactions to mismatch with reality, because we have largely been focusing on preparing for relaunch and building communication to share with you, the community, over the past day. to the best of our understanding, the attacker deposited increasingly larger amounts of bitcoins, and withdrew them while flooding the blockchain with ddos of similar transactions. 7. our system reflected his withdrawals, and his account showed as zero.8. the attacker rapidly clicked "refresh deposits" link until our code assumed that the transaction failed (all indications point to malleability as the root case). our system re-credited his account with the x btc it judged "unsuccessfully" withdrawn. this, again, due to the liberal rescanning mechanisms added last month (see point 3).9. in reality, our servers perceived the transactions inaccurately and the btc were successfully withdrawn. as a result our system inaccurately represented the users balance as larger than it truly was. this allowed the attacker to withdraw coins again.10. the attacker began depositing larger amounts, such as 50 btc at a time, in order to exploit the vulnerability quickly.11. they then drained our entire hot storage in one bitcoin server shard, and tried the attack from one of their other accounts. the other account was on a different shard, and allowed that hot storage to be drained.12. the attacker continued using different accounts until virtually all of our hot storage shards were drained.due to the type of vulnerability, our accounting system had an inaccurate perception of bitcoins on hand and therefore did not trigger any alerts until real user withdrawals began failing unexpectedly. this was a failure on our part to build a new server alert to check each shard of the new shared bitcoin infrastructure, and another symptom of how rushed we were when implementing the new system during a forum lynch-mob about slow withdrawals.lessons learned so far:1.  more staff should have access to killswitches and should not be afraid to use them. even if its just because of some news post about on clearnet about some "transaction malleability" thing. killswitches should be used liberally and regularly.2. a community needs to be comfortable with regular downtime - especially during periods when community safety and the safety of its money could be threatened. a good staff will be responsibly paranoid and hitting killswitches as they deem necessary, and should not be afraid of their community panicking each time precaution is exercised.3. there\xc2\x92s more to web security than rigorous penetration testing. it also requires the constant review of external services, systems and infrastructures.4. never make assumptions when implementing protocols you did not design. had we not trusted mtgoxs staff procedures, we would have reviewed our approaches with much more rigor. just because a large companys procedures are successful does not make them are safe.5. accept that your community will hate you regardless. in the darknet, you will be crucified by your community if anything ever goes wrong. psychologically prepare for everyone to hate you, because you inevitably will fail at something, and you will need to stay determined no matter what. dont let it get to your head, and dont let it affect your rigor with security. we cut corners with our deposit/withdrawal speed optimizations because we were afraid of the lynch-mob. we were foolish in this regard. we should have taken the entire site offline for as long as it took to implement a high-volume fault-tolerant bitcoin server in a well-tested, rigorous manner. this cost us an unspeakable amount of trust that we had slaved to build, some of us for years.this is where were at, with as much transparency as this medium allows:the worst that could happen did not happen.the worst thing that could happen for our communitys finances, however, did.we hate that it occurred under our watch.there is nothing we can do to change this. all we can do is be transparent about where we are at, and move forward.to those who will respond here for dramatic effect, please consider contributing your energy to the reconstruction of our community. if you cannot bring yourself to do this, then please take your negativity elsewhere. this is simple. if you have lost faith in silk road, i dont blame you in the least. i also do not want to read about it in perpetuity.trolling is easy. trolling during a disaster is cowardice. choosing to strengthen rather than troll, when trolling is the popular move - thats noble. i know that i speak for all silk road staff, seen and unseen, when i speak these words: we are going nowhere. we will remain, rebuild, and move forward toward the greater goal for which we strive by our running of this marketplace: personal freedom and foundational human rights.silk road will always rise again.', ['None'])

(580336, 83468, 'i was intrigued by psychedelics since my first psilocybin trip just as i turned into an adult - officially. i had become disillusioned with alcohol and marijuana; as it was consumed by the general populace, but within these fungi i found such pleasure and clarity. truly a satisfying and rewarding substance.psilocybin piqued my interest and soon there-after, i gave lsd a try. before trying anything else, or even more lsd - i approached the subject very cautiously. substance, source, and purity were absolutely of incredible importance. in the meantime i did a lot of reading, becoming very knowledgeable about alexander shulgin and erowid. then i found gracie & zarkov, the following passage moved me. leading to my first experiments with mda & 2c-b a few years later. recently (about 1.5 years ago) i re-experienced this article and i feel like i truly integrated the knowledge & wisdom contained within.i was originally very suspicious & careful about consuming drugs/psychedelics more than 1-2 times/year. however, recently ive made come to a conclusion that i have dedicated so much to the pursuit of knowledge behind these substances that they truly are my allies. i still dont consume them more than maybe 1/month, but i just follow my feelings on that one. my primary allies are as follows:mescaline, dom, psilocybin, mda, 4-aco-dmt, dmt, 2c-b, dob, 2c-e, 2c-d, 2c-i, and sativa cannabis (although usually not in-combination with psychedelics, as i believe it defeats the headspace i am trying to achieve .. increases the visuals, but deteriorates the mental clarity). harmala-alkaloids also, but never in combination with anything but tryptamines.ive also tried & loved 2c-t-7, dxm, d-amphetamine, and mdpv. i respect the destructive power of stimulants immensely and can count on one hand the number of times ive used d-amphetamine/mdpv in the past 10 years. also rarely use dissociatives, few times a year at most.tried & am neutral: mdma, 5-meo-mipt, 2c-p, ketamine (although ive had some great experiences in combination with 2c-b), mxetried & dislike: 5-meo-dipt, doc, butt plugslist of things id like to try: doi, dpt, bufotenine (5-oh-dmt), tma-series, mmda, aleph-series, and ganesha. things ive decided to avoid: nbome-series, most very recently developed rcs (especially stimulants), methylone~~~let us restate our position clearly: psychedelic drugs give the shaman reliable means of entering alternative reality tunnels that are at least as real as our everyday reality. the shamans task, therefore, is to become familiar with their effect and applications. psychedelic drugs are powerful tools, and powerful tools, like heavy construction equipment, can cause fatalities when operated by untrained personnel.naive or recreational use of psychedelic drugs does not make one either a shaman or a saint. if this were true, the bay area would have been overrun by saints and shamans in 1967. in traditional shamanic societies, there exist speci\xef\xac\x81c traditions, histories, rituals and practices which provide a stable, long-term set and setting by which the drug experiences is interpreted and controlled. even then, the use of the substances is severely limited either to certain festival occasions or to certain individuals. we have none of this cultural support or control. the requisite cosmology, epistemology, eschatology and ethics that are absolute requirements for effective sacred use of the hallucinogens are not given to us by our society. even such things as the nitty gritty technical details about drug preparation, dosage and use are generally unavailable.anyone who uses these drugs at high doses without this knowledgerisks madness and personal destructionfortunately, as post-moderns we offer you a simple solution: do the research, educate yourself, and then make it up as you go along!the accumulated knowledge of all of humanity is available to you in the library or in the bookstores along telegraph avenue. read history, philosophy, anthropology, psychology and religion along with mythology, science \xef\xac\x81ction and fantasy. create your own mythology or religion. make it historic-scienti\xef\xac\x81c in foundation and science \xef\xac\x81ction-fantasy in style. sign on your best friend for the journey (the buddy system is a safety net). start with the works in the accompanying bibliography. they contain enough information to make you a world class expert in the psychedelics? engage in twice monthly psychedelic training sessions with your buddy.in three or four years you will have a shamanistic starship capable of reliably taking you to worlds of beauty and religious depth that have been available heretofore only to humanitys great geniuses, artists and mystics (no shit).what does it take? about the amount of effort dedication that it takes to get a phd in the humanities. if you arent willing to put in this level of effort, choose another path.we cant tell you the details of your shamanistic starship. it could be furnished as a monastic cell or as a plush pleasure dome or anything in between. the design is up to you. each shaman must find his or her own way. certainly we wouldnt even dream of suggesting a destination once you have built it. the possibilities are endless.just remember: dont buy anyones bullshit along the way (especially ours) and dont go the guru route. and for goddess sake, have fun along the way.one final warning: you must remember this - those who know dont speak and those who speak dont know. to loosely quote terrence mckenna "the mysteries stand revealed. they are no longer exclusively the province of yogins and adepts but are open to all those who truly seek."welcome to the neopaleolithic where we poor monkeys get back to the unfinished business of re-creating ourselves as angels and going to the stars.good luck! stay high and stay free!gracie and zarkov~~~in discussion of the darknet as a source of drugs. this idea is absolutely compatible with my ethics. in fact even if drugs were legalized; my preferred method of distribution would be through the darknet. vendors are held to a higher standard than corporations. it also keeps people from being persecuted for publicy buying drugs. discreet packages that blend in with the mail. its a genius idea, and i truly hope we as a community continue to be successful in jumping these hurdles.know your source. know your substance.ps.if youve tried mescaline; whether as a cactus, or extracted material. give dom a try. its an absolutely brilliant psychedelic. if you havent tried mescaline, i suggest you try mescaline - then give dom a try. theyre both brilliant in their own ways, and neither is "superior."', ['hacking tools'])

list exists.\xc2\xa0 you will thank me\xc2\xa0 1.\xc2\xa0 go for a walk.\xc2\xa0 exploring virtually anywhere is an adventure on lsd.\xc2\xa0 nature takes on a new level of beauty on lsd.\xc2\xa0 (go for a hike, or go camping!!!)2. go for a swim!\xc2\xa0 ideally in a heated pool versus the ocean.\xc2\xa0 i have a feeling dark water would trip me out a bit.3. take a shower with your tripping partner in a completely dark shower.\xc2\xa0 (no light whatsoever)\xc2\xa0 it becomes like a sensory deprivation tank and is my favorite thing to do while tripping.\xc2\xa0 absolute darkness is the best, but a solitary blinking light can also be fun.\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa04. watch some live music at a concert or rave.5. try painting or finger-painting!\xc2\xa0 my second favorite thing to do on acid...the amount of color that comes from each brush stroke is beautiful and almost makes me cry.\xc2\xa0 never have you ever seen color like this.\xc2\xa0 painting becomes an emotional experience on acid and finger painting is tops because you get your sense of touch involved in the creativity.\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0i highly recommend it.6.\xc2\xa0 smoking hookah!\xc2\xa0 blowing smoke through soap bubbles or just blowing bubbles is fun.\xc2\xa0 when it pops, a little smoke comes out of the popped bubble and its unbelievably fun to watch.7.\xc2\xa0 massage and be massaged, or have your back scratched.\xc2\xa0 having your head massaged by one of those head massagers that looks like a metallic spider (they sell them in malls, like a ting-ting or something)8.\xc2\xa0 watching the winamp visualizer milkdrop!\xc2\xa0 this is certifiably the best visualizer ever!\xc2\xa0 you haven\xc2\x92t seen a visualizer until youve seen this on a psychedelic.\xc2\xa0 trust me on this one!!! google search \xc2\x93bltc winamp presets\xc2\x94 and download the bltc preset package.\xc2\xa0 (it will make the visualizer even better!)9. eat some fruit or veg.!\xc2\xa0 theres something very primal and rewarding about biting into a strawberry or blueberry or peach while tripping.\xc2\xa0 green beans, and juicy things taste very good.\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0meats and cheeses usually don\xc2\x92t taste so good.10.\xc2\xa0 go paintballing on acid...i have yet to try this but i hear its crazy.\xc2\xa0 might be a little too crazy though.11.\xc2\xa0 mirror time!\xc2\xa0 go stare at yourself in the mirror, stare into your eyes in one of those super magnified mirrors...watching them dilate and constrict is nuts!12.\xc2\xa0 listen to music on expensive studio headphones.\xc2\xa0 sennheiser or bose or something that wraps around your entire ear.\xc2\xa0 trust me, this is how music was meant to be listened to.13.\xc2\xa0 have sexual intercourse (punch anyone in the face who says otherwise...theyre lying to you.\xc2\xa0 sex on ex or psychedelics is the best and is so worth it.)14.\xc2\xa0 writie on your partner or paint on your partner with paint or black-light paint.\xc2\xa0 15.\xc2\xa0 floating down a river in an inter-tube.16.\xc2\xa0 take a stroll on the beach barefoot.\xc2\xa0 watch the ocean waves crash or go play in the rain.17.\xc2\xa0 star gazing and looking at the stars using google sky maps app on your phone18.\xc2\xa0 smelling extreme smells, preferably good smells...candles, incense, coffee grinds, salt. etc.\xc2\xa0 this can be quite interesting if you\xc2\x92re on a high dose of lsd and synesthesia is happening.\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa019.\xc2\xa0 smoking weed obviously...blunts are my favorite method when tripping.\xc2\xa0 (*roll them before you trip)\xc2\xa0 roll one up and have your sober-sitter go through a drive thru car-wash while you hot-box the blunt. \xef\x81\x8a20. inhale some nitrous oxide\xc2\xa0 this can really can add some trippiness to a trip.\xc2\xa0 its likely horrible for you, but it is quite fun.\xc2\xa0 i\xc2\x92m told you can take a bong\xc2\x85pull a rip of weed, let it remain in the chamber while you take out the slider and put a balloon of nitrous where the weed was, then take the rip.\xc2\xa0 weed and nitrous at once, you drop at least 4 iq points in one sitting but its fun nonetheless.21.\xc2\xa0 buy the biggest glowsticks you can find online and throw them around with your tripping partners.22.\xc2\xa0 chew or suck on some ice and then make out with your partner or go down on them.\xc2\xa0 that\xc2\x92s great fun.23. go for a bi-cycle ride.\xc2\xa0 (this is how the first lsd experience ever went down.)24. go jump on a trampoline, or moon-bounce if you can find one.\xc2\xa0 (be cautious please)25. go to an amusement park and ride the rides (i dont recommend this to anyone except super experienced trippers.\xc2\xa0 waiting in line sucks, but ipods and earbuds help.)26.\xc2\xa0 go to a water park.\xc2\xa0 (i dont recommend this to anyone except super experienced trippers)26. get into a hot tub or bath tub with food coloring and drop drops into the water and watch the dye move through the water.\xc2\xa0 (this may stain your skin for a couple days if you put a lot of color in.)27. hook up a fog machine in your room and let that thing go off for a while.\xc2\xa0 trippy lights or a strobe will help this.\xc2\xa0 *fog is just cool as fuck while tripping, but be sure to unplug any fire alarms, as they will be set off.28.\xc2\xa0 ask a sober sitter to drive you around town for a little bit.\xc2\xa0 or get a taxi (do not drive while tripping, it never ends well)29. vicks inhalers are quite fun on ecstasy...not too sure about other psychedelics.\xc2\xa0 i remember blowing some in my eyes sober once and it hurt so badly.\xc2\xa0 it was not at all pleasant like when youre rolling.30.\xc2\xa0 buy some poi balls off of a website.\xc2\xa0 they are like 10$ each or so...totally worth it.\xc2\xa0 they are likely led but swinging them around is fun and makes for amazing light shows.\xc2\xa0 also hula hooping is fun.31.\xc2\xa0 go to a planetarium or laser show (pink floyd laser light show is ideal) check your local imax or mosi science theater, they\xc2\x92re fun to go to while tripping.32.\xc2\xa0 play an instrument and make some music!\xc2\xa0 record what you come up with...or play with laser pointers if you have no musical talents.33.\xc2\xa0 get some dry ice and have some fun (try not to burn yourself)35.\xc2\xa0 go to a museum or look at some paintings or pictures you own.\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0paintings become like a little movie on lsd.\xc2\xa0 they can be quite entertaining.36.\xc2\xa0 drink a little wine or beer.\xc2\xa0 stay hydrated though.37.\xc2\xa0 play some visually cool and interactive video games38.\xc2\xa0 watch some classic cartoons (bugs bunny, inspector gadget\xc2\x85)39.\xc2\xa0 gambling is supposedly fun and some say you are better at it whilst tripping.\xc2\xa0 i imagine being in vegas would be the ideal situation on acid.40.\xc2\xa0 go skiing or snowboarding.41.\xc2\xa0 watch a 3-d movie.42.\xc2\xa0 film yourself.\xc2\xa0 set up a camera on a tripod in the room and forget about it.\xc2\xa0 or actively film some or all of your trip.\xc2\xa0 watching the footage when your sober is very entertaining and often will help you keep some of those amazing memories that are almost always forgotten when you trip balls.43.\xc2\xa0 skydiving is said to be intense, i can\xc2\x92t even imagine this though.44.\xc2\xa0 http://new.weavesilk.com/\xc2\xa0 this website is interactive art you make with your mouse and keyboard.\xc2\xa0 pretty cool!!!45.\xc2\xa0 watch planet earth or something similar on a crispy hd flat screen.46.\xc2\xa0 play jenga or double jenga!\xc2\xa0 chess, pinball machines\xc2\x85ping pong, games etc.47.\xc2\xa0 do some stream of consciousness writing!\xc2\xa0 start a sentence on paper, don\xc2\x92t ever lift the pen, and see where that takes you.48.\xc2\xa0 buy some gallium online.\xc2\xa0 gallium is a metal with a\xc2\xa0 melting point of 85degrees fahrenheit.\xc2\xa0 so if you hold it in your hand for a minute, it will melt.\xc2\xa0 gallium is not dangerous either.\xc2\xa0 mercury on the hand is quite toxic, so don\xc2\x92t play with that.\xc2\xa0 you can easily buy some online for about 40$ and i imagine it would be quite mind-bottling to play with while tripping.49.\xc2\xa0 go to a reflexologist (foot massage therapy) or go get a massage.50. go lay on the ground and stare up at the moon and stars.\xc2\xa0 now think about the fact that you are on a rock flying through space and that this rock orbits a star.\xc2\xa0 really try to wrap your mind around what a star is, how big it is, and that every element in the entire universe was once made in one of those things.51.\xc2\xa0 google image search fractals and check those out for a wee bit.52.\xc2\xa0 meditate or stretch.\xc2\xa0 close your eyes and start a journey within.\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa053.\xc2\xa0 pet a cat or throw a ball to your dog.\xc2\xa0 pets are super-fun on lsd.54.\xc2\xa0 do some people-watching.55.\xc2\xa0 go to an aquarium!\xc2\xa0 zoos are said to be kind of sad.\xc2\xa0 (caged lions and monekys etc.)\xc2\xa0 fuck fish though\xc2\x85they\xc2\x92re here for our

(thats what i get for tripping with people around for the first time in a long while) me and one friend had to talk this guy down for about a half hour.300 mics- your getting into heavy territory. still not considered by most to be a heavy dose, but thats only because they know where most people including themselves draw the line if they are experienced. its alot like 250 mics though.400 mics- most people would never take this much unless they knew the acid they have in their possesion and really wanted to get pretty far out there.this is why you dont see 200+ mic hits around.500 mics- pretty much where even some of the most experienced people draw the line. your vision is almost completely enveloped by fractal patterns, and if you were to stare at some pavement or something, it looks like you can see to the end of eternity. miles and miles of visual depth.700 mics- most people who talk of taking a ten strip usually dont have very potent acid(though it is good), so 550 to 700 is where they end up. this is also where "more acid" becomes less important because the effects are very similar to an even higher dose.1000 mics- most people will never go there. if you had a "two hits and you are floored" type of lsd, or 100 mics and up hits, this is where a ten strip would put you. you basically cant see anything but visuals, your mind as a whole is infinately connected with its self and your external environment. amazing things happen on this dose no matter what. it would scare most people shitless. some people will think they are dieing. many would end up dialing 911 if they were alone and could read the numbers on the phone.1500 mics- is almost exactly like 1700 mics. 1700 mics being the most i have ever done. very few people have used this much lsd.it is very psychologically dangerous for some people to do this. you can no longer really see your own hand in front of your face. your cognition and vision are both bathed in the same light. some people forget to breath frequently, and id imagine alot of people would pass out. you will loose your ego, but you will meet many organizers of human cognition in this egoless place. they are much smarter than human beings.

simplifies calculations of particle interactions and challenges the notion that space and time are fundamental components of reality.\xc2\x93this is completely new and very much simpler than anything that has been done before,\xc2\x94 said andrew hodges, a mathematical physicist at oxford university who has been following the work.the revelation that particle interactions, the most basic events in nature, may be consequences of geometry significantly advances a decades-long effort to reformulate quantum field theory, the body of laws describing elementary particles and their interactions. interactions that were previously calculated with mathematical formulas thousands of terms long can now be described by computing the volume of the corresponding jewel-like \xc2\x93amplituhedron,\xc2\x94 which yields an equivalent one-term expression.\xc2\x93the degree of efficiency is mind-boggling,\xc2\x94 said jacob bourjaily, a theoretical physicist at harvard university and one of the researchers who developed the new idea. \xc2\x93you can easily do, on paper, computations that were infeasible even with a computer before.\xc2\x94the new geometric version of quantum field theory could also facilitate the search for a theory of quantum gravity that would seamlessly connect the large- and small-scale pictures of the universe. attempts thus far to incorporate gravity into the laws of physics at the quantum scale have run up against nonsensical infinities and deep paradoxes. the amplituhedron, or a similar geometric object, could help by removing two deeply rooted principles of physics: locality and unitarity.\xc2\x93both are hard-wired in the usual way we think about things,\xc2\x94 said nima arkani-hamed, a professor of physics at the institute for advanced study in princeton, n.j., and the lead author of the new work, which he is presenting in talks and in a forthcoming paper. \xc2\x93both are suspect.\xc2\x94locality is the notion that particles can interact only from adjoining positions in space and time. and unitarity holds that the probabilities of all possible outcomes of a quantum mechanical interaction must add up to one. the concepts are the central pillars of quantum field theory in its original form, but in certain situations involving gravity, both break down, suggesting neither is a fundamental aspect of nature.in keeping with this idea, the new geometric approach to particle interactions removes locality and unitarity from its starting assumptions. the amplituhedron is not built out of space-time and probabilities; these properties merely arise as consequences of the jewel\xc2\x92s geometry. the usual picture of space and time, and particles moving around in them, is a construct.\xc2\x93it\xc2\x92s a better formulation that makes you think about everything in a completely different way,\xc2\x94 said david skinner, a theoretical physicist at cambridge university.the amplituhedron itself does not describe gravity. but arkani-hamed and his collaborators think there might be a related geometric object that does. its properties would make it clear why particles appear to exist, and why they appear to move in three dimensions of space and to change over time.because \xc2\x93we know that ultimately, we need to find a theory that doesn\xc2\x92t have\xc2\x94 unitarity and locality, bourjaily said, \xc2\x93it\xc2\x92s a starting point to ultimately describing a quantum theory of gravity.\xc2\x94clunky machinerythe amplituhedron looks like an intricate, multifaceted jewel in higher dimensions. encoded in its volume are the most basic features of reality that can be calculated, \xc2\x93scattering amplitudes,\xc2\x94 which represent the likelihood that

diagrams\xc2\x94 were included on a 2005 postage stamp honoring feynman.the 60-year-old method for calculating scattering amplitudes \xc2\x97 a major innovation at the time \xc2\x97 was pioneered by the nobel prize-winning physicist richard feynman. he sketched line drawings of all the ways a scattering process could occur and then summed the likelihoods of the different drawings. the simplest feynman diagrams look like trees: the particles involved in a collision come together like roots, and the particles that result shoot out like branches. more complicated diagrams have loops, where colliding particles turn into unobservable \xc2\x93virtual particles\xc2\x94 that interact with each other before branching out as real final products. there are diagrams with one loop, two loops, three loops and so on \xc2\x97 increasingly baroque iterations of the scattering process that contribute progressively less to its total amplitude. virtual particles are never observed in nature, but they were considered mathematically necessary for unitarity \xc2\x97 the requirement that probabilities sum to one.\xc2\x93the number of feynman diagrams is so explosively large that even computations of really simple processes weren\xc2\x92t done until the age of computers,\xc2\x94 bourjaily said. a seemingly simple event, such as two subatomic particles called gluons colliding to produce four less energetic gluons (which happens billions of times a second during collisions at the large hadron collider), involves 220 diagrams, which collectively contribute thousands of terms to the calculation of the scattering amplitude.in 1986, it became apparent that feynman\xc2\x92s apparatus was a rube goldberg machine.to prepare for the construction of the superconducting super collider in texas (a project that was later canceled), theorists wanted to calculate the scattering amplitudes of known particle interactions to establish a background against which interesting or exotic signals would stand out. but even 2-gluon to 4-gluon processes were so complex, a group of physicists had written two years earlier, \xc2\x93that they may not be evaluated in the foreseeable future.\xc2\x94stephen parke and tomasz taylor, theorists at fermi national accelerator laboratory in illinois, took that statement as a challenge. using a few mathematical tricks, they managed to simplify the 2-gluon to 4-gluon amplitude calculation from several billion terms to a 9-page-long formula, which a 1980s supercomputer could handle. then, based on a pattern they observed in the scattering amplitudes of other gluon interactions, parke and taylor guessed a simple one-term expression for the amplitude. it was, the computer verified, equivalent to the 9-page formula. in other words, the traditional machinery of quantum field theory, involving hundreds of feynman diagrams worth thousands of mathematical terms, was obfuscating something much simpler. as bourjaily put it: \xc2\x93why are you summing up millions of things when the answer is just one function?\xc2\x94\xc2\x93we knew at the time that we had an important result,\xc2\x94 parke said. \xc2\x93we knew it instantly. but what to do with it?\xc2\x94the amplituhedronthe message of parke and taylor\xc2\x92s single-term result took decades to interpret. \xc2\x93that one-term, beautiful little function was like a beacon for the next 30 years,\xc2\x94 bourjaily said. it \xc2\x93really started this revolution.\xc2\x94twistor diagrams depicting an interaction between six gluons, in the cases where two

al.twistor diagrams depicting an interaction between six gluons, in the cases where two (left) and four (right) of the particles have negative helicity, a property similar to spin. the diagrams can be used to derive a simple formula for the 6-gluon scattering amplitude.in the mid-2000s, more patterns emerged in the scattering amplitudes of particle interactions, repeatedly hinting at an underlying, coherent mathematical structure behind quantum field theory. most important was a set of formulas called the bcfw recursion relations, named for ruth britto, freddy cachazo, bo feng and edward witten. instead of describing scattering processes in terms of familiar variables like position and time and depicting them in thousands of feynman diagrams, the bcfw relations are best couched in terms of strange variables called \xc2\x93twistors,\xc2\x94 and particle interactions can be captured in a handful of associated twistor diagrams. the relations gained rapid adoption as tools for computing scattering amplitudes relevant to experiments, such as collisions at the large hadron collider. but their simplicity was mysterious.\xc2\x93the terms in these bcfw relations were coming from a different world, and we wanted to understand what that world was,\xc2\x94 arkani-hamed said. \xc2\x93that\xc2\x92s what drew me into the subject five years ago.\xc2\x94with the help of leading mathematicians such as pierre deligne, arkani-hamed and his collaborators discovered that the recursion relations and associated twistor diagrams corresponded to a well-known geometric object. in fact, as detailed in a paper posted to arxiv.org in december by arkani-hamed, bourjaily, cachazo, alexander goncharov, alexander postnikov and jaroslav trnka, the twistor diagrams gave instructions for calculating the volume of pieces of this object, called the positive grassmannian.named for hermann grassmann, a 19th-century german linguist and mathematician who studied its properties, \xc2\x93the positive grassmannian is the slightly more grown-up cousin of the inside of a triangle,\xc2\x94 arkani-hamed explained. just as the inside of a triangle is a region in a two-dimensional space bounded by intersecting lines, the simplest case of the positive grassmannian is a region in an n-dimensional space bounded by intersecting planes. (n is the number of particles involved in a scattering process.)it was a geometric representation of real particle data, such as the likelihood that two colliding gluons will turn into four gluons. but something was still missing.the physicists hoped that the amplitude of a scattering process would emerge purely and inevitably from geometry, but locality and unitarity were dictating which pieces of the positive grassmannian to add together to get it. they wondered whether the amplitude was \xc2\x93the answer to some particular mathematical question,\xc2\x94 said trnka, a post-doctoral researcher at the california institute of technology. \xc2\x93and it is,\xc2\x94 he said.a sketch of the amplituhedron representing an 8-gluon particle interaction. using feynman diagrams, the same calculation would take roughly 500 pages of algebra.nima arkani-hameda sketch of the amplituhedron representing an 8-gluon particle interaction. using feynman diagrams, the same calculation would take roughly 500 pages of algebra.arkani-hamed and trnka discovered that the scattering amplitude equals the volume of a brand-new mathematical object \xc2\x97 the amplituhedron. the details of a particular scattering process dictate the dimensionality and facets of the corresponding amplituhedron. the pieces of the positive grassmannian that were being calculated with twistor diagrams and then added together by hand were building blocks that fit together inside this jewel, just as triangles fit together to form a polygon.like the twistor diagrams, the feynman diagrams are another way of computing the volume of the amplituhedron piece by piece, but they are much less efficient. \xc2\x93they are local and unitary in space-time, but they are not necessarily very convenient or well-adapted to the shape of this jewel itself,\xc2\x94 skinner said. \xc2\x93using feynman diagrams is like taking a ming vase and smashing it on the floor.\xc2\x94arkani-hamed and trnka have been able to calculate the volume of the amplituhedron directly in some cases, without using twistor diagrams to compute the volumes of its pieces. they have also found a \xc2\x93master amplituhedron\xc2\x94 with an infinite number of facets, analogous to a circle in 2-d, which has an infinite number of sides. its volume represents, in theory, the total amplitude of all physical processes. lower-dimensional amplituhedra, which correspond to interactions between finite numbers of particles, live on the faces of this master structure.\xc2\x93they are very powerful calculational techniques, but they are also incredibly suggestive,\xc2\x94 skinner said. \xc2\x93they suggest that thinking in terms of space-time was not the right way of going about this.\xc2\x94quest for quantum gravitythe seemingly irreconcilable conflict between gravity and quantum field theory enters crisis mode in black holes. black holes pack a huge amount of mass into an extremely small space, making gravity a major player at the quantum scale, where it can usually be ignored. inevitably, either locality or unitarity is the source of the conflict.\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 puzzling thoughts\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 locality and unitarity are the central pillars of quantum field theory, but as the following thought experiments show, both break down in certain situations involving gravity. this suggests physics should be formulated without either principle.\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 locality says that particles interact at points in space-time. but suppose you want to inspect space-time very closely. probing smaller and smaller distance scales requires ever higher energies, but at a certain scale, called the planck length, the picture gets blurry: so much energy must be concentrated into such a small region that the energy collapses the region into a black hole, making it impossible to inspect. \xc2\x93there\xc2\x92s no way of measuring space and time separations once they are smaller than the planck length,\xc2\x94 said arkani-hamed. \xc2\x93so we imagine space-time is a continuous thing, but because it\xc2\x92s impossible to talk sharply about that thing, then that suggests it must not be fundamental \xc2\x97 it must be emergent.\xc2\x94\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 unitarity says the quantum mechanical probabilities of all possible outcomes of a particle interaction must sum to one. to prove it, one would have to observe the same interaction over and over and count the frequencies of the different outcomes. doing this to perfect accuracy would require an infinite number of observations using an infinitely large measuring apparatus, but the latter would again cause gravitational collapse into a black hole. in finite regions of the universe, unitarity can therefore only be approximately known.\xc2\x93we have indications that both ideas have got to go,\xc2\x94 arkani-hamed said. \xc2\x93they can\xc2\x92t be fundamental features of the next description,\xc2\x94 such as a theory of quantum gravity.string theory, a framework that treats particles as invisibly small, vibrating strings, is one candidate for a theory of quantum gravity that seems to hold up in black hole situations, but its relationship to reality is unproven \xc2\x97 or at least confusing. recently, a strange duality has been found between string theory and quantum field theory, indicating that the former (which includes gravity) is mathematically equivalent to the latter (which does not) when the two theories describe the same event as if it is taking place in different numbers of dimensions. no one knows quite what to make of this discovery. but the new amplituhedron research suggests space-time, and therefore dimensions, may be illusory anyway.\xc2\x93we can\xc2\x92t rely on the usual familiar quantum mechanical space-time pictures of describing physics,\xc2\x94 arkani-hamed said. \xc2\x93we have to learn new ways of talking about it. this work is a baby step in that direction.\xc2\x94even without unitarity and locality, the amplituhedron formulation of quantum field theory does not yet incorporate gravity. but researchers are working on it. they say scattering processes that include gravity particles may be possible to describe with the amplituhedron, or with a similar geometric object. \xc2\x93it might be closely related but slightly different and harder to find,\xc2\x94 skinner said.nima arkani-hamed, a professor at the institute for advanced study, and his former student and co-author jaroslav trnka, who finished his ph.d. at princeton university in july and is now a

jaroslav trnka, who finished his ph.d. at princeton university in july and is now a post-doctoral researcher at the california institute of technology.physicists must also prove that the new geometric formulation applies to the exact particles that are known to exist in the universe, rather than to the idealized quantum field theory they used to develop it, called maximally supersymmetric yang-mills theory. this model, which includes a \xc2\x93superpartner\xc2\x94 particle for every known particle and treats space-time as flat, \xc2\x93just happens to be the simplest test case for these new tools,\xc2\x94 bourjaily said. \xc2\x93the way to generalize these new tools to [other] theories is understood.\xc2\x94beyond making calculations easier or possibly leading the way to quantum gravity, the discovery of the amplituhedron could cause an even more profound shift, arkani-hamed said. that is, giving up space and time as fundamental constituents of nature and figuring out how the big bang and cosmological evolution of the universe arose out of pure geometry.\xc2\x93in a sense, we would see that change arises from the structure of the object,\xc2\x94 he said. \xc2\x93but it\xc2\x92s not from the object changing. the object is basically timeless.\xc2\x94while more work is needed, many theoretical physicists are paying close attention to the new ideas.the work is \xc2\x93very unexpected from several points of view,\xc2\x94 said witten, a theoretical physicist at the institute for advanced study. \xc2\x93the field is still developing very fast, and it is difficult to guess what will happen or what the lessons will turn out to be.\xc2\x94', ['hacking tools'])

(590877, 84878, 'this guide was originally written as a harm reduction guide to mda, but the guidelines outlined here also apply to mdma. i hope that this information reaches you all and better informs you of how to approach mdxx use. protect your minds, my friends. it is the most valuable thing you possess. mda (methylenedioxyamphetamine) has been shown to have a neurotoxic effect on the 5-ht (serotonin) axons when abused. many users will state that mda is completely safe to use often, but this is a false preconception based on nothing more than anecdotal claims that have zero scientific backing. there have been hundreds of studies throughout the years that outline both mdas, and its methylated cousin mdmas, neurotoxicity, and not taking the time to value the information they have uncovered is altogether unwise.with this in mind, mda can be used safely with no backlash assuming a set of precautions are followed when using it.1) do not roll more than once a month at least, with emphasis on trying to allow 2-3 months between use.2) a safe dosing guideline for mda is typically 1.0-1.5mg/kg. for instance, if you weigh 80kg, your dosage will be between 80-120mg depending on desired intensity. 80mg will be a light and sociable dose and 120mg will be a much heavier dose.3) keep your body temperature low and stay hydrated! this is perhaps the most important guideline in preventing neurotoxicity. ensure above all else that you are not overexerting yourself.4) antioxidants such as alpha lipoic acid, vitamin c, vitamin e, green tea extract (egcg), and magnesium glycinate will heavily aid in alleviating neurotoxicity, protecting your brain, and improving your roll.a more explanation on each of these points...- moderation is absolutely pivotal when using mda. mda releases serotonin in vast amounts and inhibits the enzyme tryptophan hydroxalyse (tph), which is responsible for creating more serotonin. because this inhibition is permanent, the body must compensate by creating more tph, and this restoration period typically takes between 1-3 months depending on the users diet and exercise patterns. with this in mind, the healthier you are, the quicker the process is. exercise is phenomenal for speeding up this process as exercise stimulates a release of bdnf which encourages the growth of new serotonin axons. the bottom line is this: spread out your use. depending on your health and exercise habits, wait at least one month between use, with a strong emphasis on waiting a preferred 2-3 months.- dosing and redosing are also two very large components of mda neurotoxicity. the higher you dose, the more prone you are to mdas neurotoxic effects. a general guideline for safely dosing mda is 1.0-1.5mg/kg. for example, if you weigh 80kg, the optimal dosage for mda is between 80-120mg. whether you choose 80mg or 120mg depends on how intense you want the experience to be and is entirely dependant on your choice. subjectively speaking on the intensity of effects,, 80mg will be a light, sociable dose, 100mg a moderate dose, and 120mg a high dose. because many users will choose to dose higher in search of a more intense experience, i will offer two critical insights: mda is much more potent than mdma, so try to avoid dosing too high, and more importantly, do not redose! redosing is highly unwise, entirely pointless, and plays a huge role in neurotoxicity and will lead to a terrible comedown.for a better representation of why this is bad, let me put it into a rough and incredibly oversimplified analogy. think of your serotonin transport system (sert) as a dam. this dam moderates your serotonin levels by slowly releasing it to control everything from mood, appetite, sleep, heart rate, libido, and so forth. when you ingest mda, it essentially takes control of the floodgates of this dam, opens them up to full capacity, and releases all the serotonin available behind it. what happens when you release all of the serotonin behind this dam? you must wait a while for the levels to return to normal. opening the floodgates to a dam with no water behind it makes absolutely no sense, and this is essentially what redosing mda does. you will not roll harder or longer by taking more; instead, you are simply making your comedown exponentially worse and increasing mda induced neurotoxicity.- keep your body temperature low! do not overexert yourself when dancing as hyperthermia is the leading cause of mda induced neurotoxicity due to a rise in oxidative stress. when your body temperature rises, you bodys natural process for preventing oxidative stress (antioxidants) becomes less efficient. that lowering of efficiency is exponential. the higher your body temperature gets, the faster reactive oxygen species are created, which damage your brain. a fantastic way to keep your body temperature low is thc (yes, smoking marijuana helps mda neurotoxicity too!), ensuring you dance in moderation, and making sure that you stay properly hydrated. in that breath, do not over-hydrate. depending on the amount of physical activity you are undergoing, 16-24oz of water every hour is optimal for staying hydrated. also, did i mention to keep your body temperature low?- preloading and postloading are two staples for enriching the mda experience and almost entirely negating the potential for neurotoxic damage. not only do they alleviate neurotoxicity, but you will find your roll to be much more smooth and grant you with a beautiful afterglow instead of a hangover. here are a few essential supplements that are key to a proper regimen. if you are unable to purchase these supplements or take them as advised, i will recommend that green tea, orange juice, or emergen-c packets as they will lightly aide in providing antioxidants. however, these two should not be considered an all inclusive replacement. they come recommended on a "better than nothing" basis and pressure should be placed on picking up the appropriate supplements.* na-r-ala (alpha lipoic acid): this is a powerful antioxidant that eliminates free roaming reactive oxygen and nitrogen particles, in turn reducing neurotoxicity. dose 100mg of na-r-ala 30 minutes prior to rolling and 2 hours into the roll. ensure that you purchase the na-r-ala isomer form of ala. while racemic ala is okay, na-r-ala is much more efficient.* magnesium glycinate: magnesium is a phenomenal substance that will alleviate the bruxism (jaw clenching) and fasciculations (muscle twitches) commonly experienced when taking mda. dose 400mg elemental magnesium glycinate 6 hours prior to rolling, again 30 minutes prior, and finally 2 hours into the roll. be sure you purchase either magnesium glycinate (preferred) or magnesium citrate. the most common form, magnesium oxide, is not readily absorbed, so completely avoid it.* vitamin c: the most common antioxidant out there and has been shown to mitigate mda induced hepatotoxicity and neurotoxicity. dose 1,000mg of vitamin c 30 minutes prior to rolling.* vitamin e: a powerful antioxidant that will seek out free radicals. dose 400 iu 30 minutes prior to rolling.* green tea extract (egcg): egcg is a potent antioxidant and diuretic. it will help with the urinary retention arising from mda induced vasopressin release. dose 400mg 30 minutes prior, and 2 hours into the roll.* 5-htp: 5-htp is the direct precursor to serotonin. supplementing 100mg of 5-htp with 400mg of egcg (egcg will help 5-htp cross the blood-brain barrier more efficiently) at bedtime for 5-7 days after rolling will aid your body in restoring serotonin to their proper levels. warning: 5-htp can cause cardiac fibrosis when used in high doses over extended periods of time, so avoid taking 5-htp in high doses for more than 5-7 days.* melatonin: melatonin is created from serotonin, and since your serotonin levels will be low, taking a melatonin supplement will help you fall asleep. melatonin is also a powerful antioxidant. take 5-10mg of melatonin prior to falling asleep after rolling.in the end, the best advice that can be offered is to simply be smart. know your limits, follow common sense, and remember exactly why youre taking mda. cherish and value the experience; dont tarnish it by abusing it and harming your mind and body.sources (clearnet)* supplements:http://www.geronova.com/sites/default/files/alt_med_rev_2008_0.pdfhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/s1044576584710128http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15212815http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11931860http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14740000* neurotoxicity:http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7582557http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2457659http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1784586http://www.maps.org/publications/1987_stone_3.pdf', ['hacking tools'])
(590889, 84878, 'none of the above supplements have provided me with any stomach discomfort in my experience, but obviously all of our bodies are different and react to things differently. your best bet is to simply have a test run without mdma and see how you feel when taking the supplements. also, i typically eat a decently sized meal 2-3 hours prior to rolling and taking supplements with food in your belly always helps. i know most people like to fast before, but i like to get my nutrition in prior to launching. also, this guide obviously errs on the extreme side of caution and was written to be a helpful resource on what to take. this pre-load/post-load regimen is what i recommend for instances where you will be exerting yourself a lot (dancing at a festival in the heat, for instance) and need as much protection as possible. if you are going to be rolling at home on the couch under the a/c with easy access to cold water, you really probably only need one dose of ala, and vitamin c for antioxidant purposes, and magnesium glycinate for alleviating jaw discomfort. the big keys to mitigating neurotoxicity are to take a reasonable dose and to keep your body temperature low. if you can do that, youre off to a great start!', ['hacking tools'])

(596339, 85635, 'interesting post, thanks for sharing. as i read your post you are recommending storing a wallet backup inside a truecrypt container, then storing the truecrypt container on a secure offshore server. not a bad idea at all. if i may add some information for consideration, both the armory and electrum wallets support true offline cold storage of your private keys. both wallets allow you to split the wallet into an online watching only copy of the wallet while the wallet with your private keys is stored on an offline computer.\xc2\xa0 the online watching only wallet can receive bitcoin routinely, but if you want to send bitcoin you need to 1) create an unsigned transaction using the online wallet 2) using a usb drive take the unsigned transaction file to the offline wallet and sign it then 3) take the signed transaction file back to your online computer and broadcast it online. both armory and electrum allow you to export a digital backup of your offline wallet with your private keys. it is a simple matter to make a truecrypt container with a strong password in which to store your digital backup. since both armory and electrum are deterministic wallets only one backup is only needed, ever. then just find long term secure storage offshore and upload the truecrypt container and you are good to go. using this method of cold storage your bitcoin can not be stolen because your private keys are on your offline computer (which must be encrypted with fde) with a digital copy kept securely encrypted with truecrypt at the storage location of your choice. and you can still send and receive bitcoin using your online and offline computers.', ['hacking tools'])

its entirety:hash: sha512i am sweating as i write this.christmas brought grave news. i cannot adequately express how deeply honored i was by your unconditional support of my staff.i do not expect the same reaction to todays revelations. this movement is built on integrity, and i feel obligated to be forthright with you.i held myself to a high standard as your leader, yet now i must utter words all too familiar to this scarred community:we have been hacked.nobody is in danger, no information has been leaked, and server access was never obtained by the attacker.our initial investigations indicate that a vendor exploited a recently discovered vulnerability in the bitcoin protocol known as "transaction malleability" to repeatedly withdraw coins from our system until it was completely empty.despite our hardening and pentesting procedures, this attack vector was outside of penetration testing scope due to being rooted in the bitcoin protocol itself.this attack hit us at the worst possible time. we were planning on re-launching the new auto-finalize and dispute center this past weekend, and our projections of order finalization volume indicated that we would need the communitys full balance in hot storage.in retrospect this was incredibly foolish, and i take full responsibility for this decision.i have failed you as a leader, and am completely devastated by todays discoveries. i should have taken mtgox and bitstamps lead and disabled withdrawals as soon as the malleability issue was reported. i was slow to respond and too skeptical of the possible issue at hand. it is a crushing blow. i cannot find the words to express how deeply i want this movement to be safe from the very threats i just watched materialize during my watch.ive included transaction logs at the bottom of this message. review the vendors dishonest actions and use whatever means you deem necessary to bring this person to justice. more details will emerge as we continue to investigate.given the right flavor of influence from our community, we can only hope that he will decide to return the coins with integrity as opposed to hiding like a coward.it takes the integrity of all of us to push this movement forward. whoever you are, you still have a chance to act in the interest of helping this community. keep a percentage, return the rest. dont walk away with your fellow freedom fighters coins. dpr2 returned the cold storage. i didnt run with the gold. but two people alone cannot move us forward. it takes an entire community committing to integrity - and though this crushing blow will not stop us, it sure is a testament to how greedy some bastards truly are.being a part of this movement might be the most defining thing you do with your entire life.dont trade that for greed, comrades.i will fight here by your side, even the greedy bastards amongst us.this community has suffered great financial loss over and over again, and i am devastated that it has happened again under my watch.hindsight is already suggesting dozens of ways this could have been prevented, but we must march onward.the only way to reverse a communitys greed is through generosity. our true character is revealed during trying times.if this financial hardship places you at risk of physical harm, contact me directly and i will do my best to help you with my remaining personal funds.- ----------------now what.- ----------------never again store your escrow bitcoins on a server.silk road will never again be a centralized escrow storage.this week has shown the collateral damage we can cause by being a huge target and failing in just one unforeseen area.i am now fully convinced that no hosted escrow service is safe.if i cannot trust myself to keep a hosted escrow solution safe, i cannot trust anyone.multi-signature transactions are the only way this community will be protected long-term.i am aggressively tasking our devs on building out multi-sig support for commonly-used bitcoin clients. expect a generous bounty if you have the skill to implement this.- -----------------until then.- -----------------1. we will never again allow ourselves to be a single point of failure. we will never again host your escrow wallets.2. vendor registration is closed while we regroup.3. all listings on silk road are now no-escrow (finalize-early) for 1-2 months while we implement multi-signature transactions and lobby for mainstream bitcoin client multi-sig support.4. all unshipped orders have been cancelled.5. vendors may link to other marketplaces on a trail basis until we launch multi-sig, then we will re-evaluate based on community input. we do not want to be a centralized point of failure, but we also do not want to lead our buyers into dangerous waters.6. from this point forward do not trust markets with centralized escrow. use multi-signature transactions whenever possible, with trusted third parties as escrow providers.everything will be offline for 24-48 hours to minimize variables as we continue to investigate. the evidence we have below will be expanded based on our findings.- ------------------no marketplace is perfect. expect any centralized market to fail at some point. this is precisely why we must unite in the decision to decentralize.we are relieved that our security procedures protected user identities, and that no servers were

(600164, 86378, 'of course it was a scam. get real people, and wake up.after reading through all forum posts/news/comments of the mods and admins of sr2.0, there are too many fishy things and contradictions:1) blaming transaction malleability, and the admin clearly quote saying that it is a "recently discovered bug" is laughable. it wasnt "published last week" as he stated in his latest forum post, it was "published" looooong ago.2) just before this "heist", a thread named reality check was posted, stating that users should be thankful for all the positive security measures that had been made, and for all the effort the admin(s) put in the development of the website. also, another thread was being publicized, promoting that nobody should finalize early any transaction, which then resulted in more btc in escrow. also, nothing was done regarding the required ban of certain well-known scammers, and certain users reported negative btc balance on their account after depositing a substantial amount of btc to their sr wallet.3) the admin defcon claims hes been off internet for like a whole week, so he didnt know about the mtgox announcement and the ddos attacks. lets be clear here: he runs a black market, the last thing he would do is not be informed for a whole damn week. hed had to live under a rock to not hear about the recent mtgox scandal. and if he really didnt then hes not to be trusted with running any site, let alone sr2.4) long minutes/hours after the admin stated in the sr forum, that the site has been hacked and all coins were stolen, several transactions were still happening, which deducted funds from known vendor accounts. i repeat, after the post has been made. this is just written scam all over it.5) the admin claims he took all funds from the wallets to a single "hot storage wallet" to re-enable the auto-finalize option on the site. and he left it there for 3 days straight. i refuse to believe this level of stupidity from an admin who runs a site like sr. then he tried to explain it by typing that he was stressed out. sure.6)\xc2\xa0 the posts of certain mods have too many contradictions. one minute they say "im only a moderator here, we are only paid to run the forums, i have nothing to do with sr itself", the usual blablabla, and the next minute the same person on a different thread writes sentences like "we will open the market when" this and this will be finished. oh, so suddenly its a "we"? also, they claim they accidentally delete threads, i.e. the most important one recently, regarding the admins statement on the situation. sounds believable, right?7) the admin, defcon, who failed his community by being hacked (as he claims) has the audacity to warn people of security issues of other sites, suggesting people not to use other marketplaces he doesnt even know, because he fears for the safety of the customers funds. oh, the irony...8 ) i suspect that the forums mods also have other forum accounts, so they can publicly write positive opinions about themselves, sr2 and anybody who still believes in them. otherwise, i cannot explain mods and other users (allegedly female) in the black market giving each other "hugs" and "kisses" and things of that nature, while some people lost thousands of dollars in a few days. also, the admin has a bunch of dedicated groupies co-signing whatever he says, exchanging female like emotional comments like "i am deeply thankful for the hundreds of supportive messages ive received". this is a business, not a f*cking female high school.simply put, i cant believe this unprofessional manner to conduct business, run a website, and the obvious scam that this is. these people should not be trusted with anything related to any black market in the future. unfortunately the fact is, that they can pop up anywhere anytime under a different name and identity, and we probably wouldnt know a thing about it.', ['None'])

all too familiar to this scarred community:we have been hacked.nobody is in danger, no information has been leaked, and server access was never obtained by the attacker.our initial investigations indicate that a vendor exploited a recently discovered vulnerability in the bitcoin protocol known as "transaction malleability" to repeatedly withdraw coins from our system until it was completely empty.despite our hardening and pentesting procedures, this attack vector was outside of penetration testing scope due to being rooted in the bitcoin protocol itself.this attack hit us at the worst possible time. we were planning on re-launching the new auto-finalize and dispute center this past weekend, and our projections of order finalization volume indicated that we would need the communitys full balance in hot storage.in retrospect this was incredibly foolish, and i take full responsibility for this decision.i have failed you as a leader, and am completely devastated by todays discoveries. i should have taken mtgox and bitstamps lead and disabled withdrawals as soon as the malleability issue was reported. i was slow to respond and too skeptical of the possible issue at hand. it is a crushing blow. i cannot find the words to express how deeply i want this movement to be safe from the very threats i just watched materialize during my watch.ive included transaction logs at the bottom of this message. review the vendors dishonest actions and use whatever means you deem necessary to bring this person to justice. more details will emerge as we continue to investigate.given the right flavor of influence from our community, we can only hope that he will decide to return the coins with integrity as opposed to hiding like a coward.it takes the integrity of all of us to push this movement forward. whoever you are, you still have a chance to act in the interest of helping this community. keep a percentage, return the rest. dont walk away with your fellow freedom fighters coins. dpr2 returned the cold storage. i didnt run with the gold. but two people alone cannot move us forward. it takes an entire community committing to integrity - and though this crushing blow will not stop us, it sure is a testament to how greedy some bastards truly are.being a part of this movement might be the most defining thing you do with your entire life.dont trade that for greed, comrades.i will fight here by your side, even the greedy bastards amongst us.this community has suffered great financial loss over and over again, and i am devastated that it has happened again under my watch.hindsight is already suggesting dozens of ways this could have been prevented, but we must march onward.the only way to reverse a communitys greed is through generosity. our true character is revealed during trying times.if this financial hardship places you at risk of physical harm, contact me directly and i will do my best to help you with my remaining personal funds.-

implement multi-signature transactions and lobby for mainstream bitcoin client multi-sig support.4. all unshipped orders have been cancelled.5. vendors may link to other marketplaces on a trail basis until we launch multi-sig, then we will re-evaluate based on community input. we do not want to be a centralized point of failure, but we also do not want to lead our buyers into dangerous waters.6. from this point forward do not trust markets with centralized escrow. use multi-signature transactions whenever possible, with trusted third parties as escrow providers.everything will be offline for 24-48 hours to minimize variables as we continue to investigate. the evidence we have below will be expanded based on our findings.- ------------------no marketplace is perfect. expect any centralized

since youre basically having to agree to route traffic for everyone else (and theyre agreeing to route traffic for you), its closer to "pay as you go", but youre paying with your own bandwidth.2. plausible deniability - just because traffic is coming from my i2p router instance, that doesnt necessarily mean its *my* traffic.\xc2\xa0 could be one of my peers traffic that im just routing.there are also some disadvantages (everything in life has a cost):1. i2p isnt "fire and forget".\xc2\xa0 you cant just connect, expect to get good bandwidth (as with tor) for free, then disconnect.\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0it really is built around the model that youre connected 24/7 (or at least, for hours on end) and always routing traffic for everyone.\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0the farther you stray from that model, the worse the performance gets.\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0you *can* connect to i2p in a hidden mode, where youre similar to a tor client, but performance is going to take a hit.\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0why would other i2p participants want to haul your traffic for you if youre not contributing to them?\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0i2p might take a few hours or a day to speed up to decent performance levels after you fire it up, and most complaints about its performance are from people who arent using it the way it was intended.2. i2p cant hide the real ips of its clients as well, because theyre relays too.\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0if everyone is a relay, everyone needs a way to know who all the relays are, and the net result is that its much easier to build a list of *all* i2p relays at any given time.\xc2\xa0 this opens up some attacks, where an adversary harvests lists of *all* i2p relays on a regular basis (i.e. who all is using i2p right now?), then works that into an intersection attack.\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0basically, "whom posted at times x, y, and z.\xc2\xa0 which i2p relays were all online at those three times?".\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0over time, intersection attacks get very effective.\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0one criticism that has been argued to hell and back at srfv2 is that in a marketplace scenario, if an adversary already knows a rough geographic location for an i2p user (i.e. they received a package from a vendor located in seattle), that intersection attack gets much easier.\xc2\xa0 not going to rehash it here.3. its hasnt received as much scrutiny.\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0academics have been beating on the tor network for a decade.\xc2\xa0 very few analyses of i2p have occurred, and that doesnt mean its problem-free.. it just means that nobodys looked at it closely.the third, rarely-mentioned network is freenet, which is a high-latency network that works much differently from tor and i2p.\xc2\xa0 wont bore you with that description here.hope that helps a little.\xc2\xa0 it gets complicated quick, and everybody ends up getting into religious battles over this versus that.\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0theyre both pretty interesting technologies, and neither one really stands up well to adversaries like nsa over the long haul, but theyre really all everyone has to work with right now.does a vpn running with i2p increases the security?', ['None'])

information in this thread was generously provided by chinacat72, a member of mycotopia forum, in 2005."i will discuss lsd crystal and what happens with it. this info is from my experiences a long time ago.i can safely offer it because i have retired from this line of work and stay far away from it. first i will briefly discuss the people or family as there called so you can get an appreciation for what they do and have done. the family is motivated to spread lsd because we believe that lsd is a key givin to us from above. lsd was givin to man from god to help him see the error of his ways. why do you think it was discovered during the most horrible time in history. it is the antidote for the atomic bomb. it`s doesn`t matter if you beleive this or not ,because what i`m trying to express is how deeply important the family feels about the sacred value of lsd. those who are at the upper level`s of the family will gladly sacrifice there lifes and freedom to do this work. ok now down to the crystal. i have little knowlege about lsd manufacture so i`m going to talk about the final product the crystal. on tour crystal came in brown glass bottles with 1-10 grams in them. the bottles were sealed and contained co2 and crystal. you can`t just buy crystal from family. first you have to be taught how to lay it ,which i`ll cover in a little bit. also you have to do a thumbprint(eat it) there are no exeptions to this rule.the reason is to make sure your karma is clean enough to handle this sacred work. types of crystal needlepoint -very pure(95% ) white powerdery crystal,was available in small amount`s. the best of the best white fluff -very pure(95% ) white light flakes of crystal. still around and the most sought after. very pure silver -good and clean(85-90% )-light greyish crystal. was an unbelievable amount of this around in the late eighty`s and early nineties. very good stuff. my first thumbprint was this kind. if you ate acid in the 80-90`s you probably sampled some silver. amber -decent(70%?) this crystal varied from a light amber color to an almost dark brown color.was always available.one batch called quadricept amber was the color of light honey and was very good.lot`s a people worked with this crystal but i always would use silver instead since it was better and the same price. lavender -(60-70%?) light purple to almost black colored crystal. like amber it varied batch to batch. tj (tornado juice) - purity unknown. i seen this shit in about four different colors and it always scared me. no experiance with it. champagne -(50-60% ) black crystal, nasty stuff imho. i worked with it once and swore to never touch it again. ok so you got some crystal and need to get it on blotter. it`s a pretty amazing feeling holding a jar in your hands that has 10 grams of crystal in it. that`s 100,000 doses in the palm of your hand. for dealing with laying we`ll say we got 1 gram. acid is always layed 1 gram=10 tenpacks. a tenpack is tensheets. 1gram=10,000doses. if your laying needlpoint your doses will be 95mcg, because your crystal is 95% pure. if your laying amber your shit will be 70mcg, because it`s 70% pure. got it now you get a glass pyrex pan to dip your tenpacks in. your crystal is dissovled into 110ml. of everclear per gram.the purer crystals dissolve instantly with a little stirring. the not so pure take a little shaking. champange is damn near impossible to get to dissolve evenly. paper-for white blotter standard watercolor paper#14 or equivalent is used. it`s critical you get the right paper. if you don`t it won`t absorb right and you`ll fuck it all up.print`s are made up ahead of time and perferated.ok so you got your crystal dissolved and your paper cut and ready. there are 2 schools when it comes to putting it on the paper. first dump the solution in the pan and dip each tenpack into it then lift it up and let any excess solution run off into the pan. second method is to put the tenpack into the pan and squirt the solution on it with a baby syringe(the ones they give little kids medicine with). i have done both and prefer dipping them just because its quicker .then the tenpacks are layed out to dry which doesn`t take long since alcohol evaporates quickly. if you did it right there will be very little residue left in the bottom of the pan.this redidue is extremely potent and is either soaked up with a piece of paper(called mop up) or made into potent liquid(called wash). whatever you choose this is saved for your personal use. while your doing all this you get very,very high. as soon as you open the jar of crystal it intoxicates the air. most people were rubber gloves when doing this some don`t. just don`t have any plans afterwards. there might be slightly different methods used when laying, but this is how the dead family does it. after the tenpacks are dryed there distibuted and eaten up. since the end of the grateful dead the massive distribution network that used to get rid of so much acid has been broken up badly. never fear acid is still out there" lsd is still around though it seems that a majority of the labs are inactive at the moment. this is normal as they don`t produce all the time. most like the silver family only produce about every 5 years. though they usually produce enough to last that long. when the grateful dead toured massive amount`s of lsd were distributed around the country. on a typical east coast tour 100-150grams could easily be sold. thats a million to a million and a half doses. this flooded these citys and the lsd trickled down to every nook and cranny of america. by the time it was dry again another tour would roll through the region and resupply it. plus we would meet people on tour from certain area`s of the country and keep them supplied with the help of the good ole usps. sadly when the dead stopped touring this network went into shambles. people fell out of touch and with no shows ,there wasn`t the marketplace for distibution.in turn parts of the country arn`t getting saturated anymore. lsd isn`t moved and sold like the cartel`s move coke and such. it`s handled by a brotherhood of people who truly believe there doing the work of god(or whatever name you call creation). we believe that lsd crystal has to be handled by the right people who are totally committed to the movement. when we moved crystal there was always the feeling that we were protected by a higher power. i can`t tell you how many times i have had crystal or acid on me or my brothers and have been in situation`s where we should have gotten busted and something always protected us. so many times that coincidence is not an option. why do i think we were protected. because the family does it for mankind not money. we viewed lsd as the only hope for the radical change in conciousness that would save us. so in effect we viewed are work as the work of god. you know why they never busted a family lab? because we would never betray lsd. just as jesus was nailed to the cross we were willing to spend the rest of our lives in jail or die to protect what we viewed as the salvation of are species. sound`s a little dramatic doesn`t it, but i`m trying to give you an understanding of the faith in lsd that the family has. by the way the kansas bust was not a family lab incase anybody is wondering. the point i`m trying to make is the family believes lsd has to move through the right hands. this is why you can`t go down to the corner and get a gram of crystal. sorry to ramble. as some of the cooks retire i rest assure you that they pass there recipes and secret`s down to those chosen to continue to fight the good fight. i don`t think it will ever be as readily available all over the country as it once was due to the break up of the distribution cycle of tour. i could be wrong and hope i am. alot of old family have moved on and including myself retired, feeling we served our time. the family does hear your cry`s for more acid and they don`t plan on giving up on mankind. nows a good time for labs to be inactive. the current government administration is viewed as a bad storm that needs to pass as jerry sang "all good things in all good time" keep the faith""for me and the rest of the people on tour it was just a matter of spending year after year on tour. the elder`s that are on top keep in a eye on everybody that help`s move there stuff. they also know the intentions of those people. if they know your true and a total believer in the work they start letting you hang around. many hour`s are spent in hotel rooms watching them work. they make sure you know every detail. also they make sure that you know the importance of being honest and laying your product correctly. every hit you lay has the potential to change somebody`s life and bring them into the light. it`s taught like an apprenticeship. my first thumbprint was silver. before my print i thought i was pretty experienced with acid. i had been puddled many times with strong liquid. i wasn`t near as experienced as i thought as i walked into the room and everybody had a huge grin on there face, and i saw what i was about to take. thumbprint`s arn`t weighed out on a scale. it`s more of "that`s a nice little chunk ,that should do" your talking several sheet`s or more when you do a print. fluff and needlpoint are damn pure and i don`t imagine bears was any purer. i have heard of batches of needlepoint being as high as 98% white fluff is gorgous crystal. we would eat this crystal like crazy. when i first met the main guy in charge of this crystal he was snorting it!!!! after i did a fluff print i never did any other kind except needlepoint. when you eat crystal you definatly can tell the differences between them. purity does matter at that level." isnt a thumbprint dangerous? youd think a persons mind would be changed forever after doing that amount. "a thumbprint isn`t even close to the largest doses people have done. dangerous? lsd is physiologicaly one of the safest drugs there are. there`s not one valid death that can be attributed to physiological complications from taking lsd. i didn`t know all this when i was taking it though. psychologically it could be very negative if the wrong person does it. that`s why we didn`t just walk around the parking lot handing out thumbprint`s. as far as high doses go, it totally opens you up. for about a week afterwards your first print you need some babysitting. hell you`ve just been reborn! after awhile it`s less tramatic. as for after effects. i am middle aged and healthy. i have 3 bright healthy children. and i`m just getting my bachelor`s degree with a 3.5gpa i do feel high very often though, but i don`t mind. the man that gave me my first print still does crystal once in awhile and he`s in his mid sixties."you mention the purity varying on alot of the crystal. how are they checking purity? just roughly with how long it takes to dissolve in a solvent? "i can tell by color. how crystallin it is and what color it is. you can inspect the crystal once you know what good clean crystal looks like. and then you can compare. i have a moto "if its white its all right". of course the jugement on my end is not scientific . i examin it like jewelers do jewels. the only real way to get a very accurate reading on how pure it is comes from the lab. most decent labs have a gc/ms and can get a decent purity reading from that. needlepoint and white fluff are the only ones that are reliably consistant. silver varies a little. lavender and amber vary greatly in appearance from batch to batch. indicating a difference in purity. if i was buying amber or lavender i would want to see it first. they have a tendancy every once in awhile to skimp on the last part of manufacture. the rinse and recrysitazation at the end is crucial in determing purity. if this isnt done enough your product is less pure.some of you may have heard owsley say he lost 20% of his product making sure its pure. thats because he rised it a ton of times. thats why his shit was said to be better than sandoz. amber and lavender if they dont due this good there crystal looks more dirty. also the purer you make your crystal the less it weighs and its sold by weight." how long does lsd "stay good"? i mean if i was to take it, put it in a zippylock and then put it in the pages of a book (someplace with unchanging air and no light) "i find that exact method perfect. i took two sheets of needlepoint and wraped them in plastic wrap then a. foil and put them in the middle of a book on a bookshelf. there going on 3 years old and last time somebody tried them they were very potent. they get no light ,air ,and are in a cool enviroment. as for crystal its stored in brown glass vials that are filled with co2 and sealed." you said the family was always on tour with the dead. do you know offhand if any of them ever had the occasion to hang with jerry and the guys? "a lot of the older guys did. hell the family started with the dead and bear. its all connected from the band, crew to the fans and faithful. as for hanging with jerry myself , no. i got backstage several times, but that doesnt mean anything. theres backstage and then there is the bands backstage ,thats off limits. i would much rather be in the crowd. the closest i ever got to jerry was ten feet as he walked by me and a bunch of other people. i just smiled. i had nothing to say. he had a lot of pressure with all the people who clung to him and thought he was a god. it was really hard for him to deal with and one of the reasons he turned to smack imho. i had nothing to say to him ,except mabye "play st. stephen!" i was just curious what kind of sheets were going around when you were into it, was there always different sheets or was there stockpiles of certain kinds? "over the 8 years i was on tour i saw more prints than i possibly could remember or list. i wouldnt even know were to begin. hundreds and hundreds of different kinds. my favorite was plain white unperferated paper. the reason for this was alot of cops dont know what a tenpack of white unperfed blotter looks like. once on a greyhound bus from floridia to baltimore our bus was stopped and a bunch of feds got on it. they searched everybodys bags. they were looking for guns or coke since we were coming from floridia. ill never forget the feeling of watching a federal agent (fbi i believe) go through my bag and pull stuff out. i had a gram(ten- tenpacks or 10,000 doses) of white paper. he pulled it out and had no clue what it was . it looked like just a bunch of ten inch square pieces of paper to him. had it be perferated and had a print on it he probably would have known. after that i was a true believer in white unperfed paper. prints are usually made in mass amounts and then sold to the different familys. so one kind of print can actually have several different kinds of crystal on them. this happened years ago with the jesus christ prints. the first ones were made of very pure white fluff and they were dipped to contain a little over 100mcg. people went nuts over them and the were the talk of the summer. then the lavender family got hold of the same print and put there dirty ass crystal on them and they were about half the strength as the original white fluff batch. people should know the truth about lsd. the internet is the perfect medium to transfer this knowlege. just enough info can be given to paint a general picture of how things work, without giving specifics that would endanger this important work. i am in the perfect position to do so. i am long enough removed from the active scene to offer information without endangering anyone including myself. my friends that still live in the old world are very supportive. now it seams lifetimes ago. i was just a tool in a very large tool box. the family was around long before i came around. luckily it was in a time when a lot of the older folks were around to help with the scene. for me lsd is a gift and tool given to man from the heavens. i truly believe it is here to point us back towards the light. these values are the same with almost all the family. after you get a glimpse of eternity you cant help ,but want to share it with others who need it." sand, scully, and owsely were the original chemists working for the family? "yes, all 3 were family. owsely was the original chemist of the dead scene/family. he set many of the standards and ethics still held today. he also got sand and scully involved and doing this work for the people not money. sand and scully were in the "brotherhood of eternal love". back then it was basically all one big network or family. after the feds broke up the bel in the 70s is when people split off and ran smaller labs,networks and were known by there product. i would also like to note that when all 3 were busted they were all threatend with huge sentences. they kept there mouth shut and served very little time in comparison to how much they could have served. pickard was family many years ago. he has been busted for manufacturing 3 times. on his second bust he ran his mouth to the feds about other drug activity within the scene resulting in several people getting prison time. after that he was shunned and nobody in the family would work for him. that is why he had to work with such shady people in kansas. had he been working with family he wouldnt be going to serve a lifetime prison sentence, he wouldnt have been busted at all. on his second bust instead of biting the bullet and keeping his mouth shut like sand, scully, and owsely, he chose to make a deal. many years later now he is going to prison for life because he was betrayed in the same way. i do hope that pickard can get out of prison before his life ends. he has a new kid that was just born and a new wife. he has done a great service to man by making lsd. i would hope that after a few years he can get released and live his remaining years with his new family. i doubt he will be so lucky though. many of us who have been graced by lsd owe a great debt to these 3 pioneer chemists and the ones that still remain active and unknown today." -continued', ['hacking tools'])
(762931, 109153, 'continued-"in the days of old tour wasnt just a time to flood the country with lsd, but also about making connections. for those of us on the road full time we needed an income when we got back to the bay area. meeting kind people on tour was always nice, but it also provided an chance to spread the juice when we wernt traveling. when the dead toured 4 times a year you would meet all sorts of folks from every nook and crany of the us. some of these people were chosen to provide for there community. this is a huge link in the distribution chain. and its also in very, very bad shape. when jerry died there was a lot of folks who quit touring. as people moved around connections were severed. in the old days if you lost track of people you knew you would see them at the next tour. now thats not an option because there is no tour. people have fell out of touch. people have moved on. so as the years have moved on the existing links have been stretched thinner and thinner."im starting to think the brotherhood is just one more lost religion. "i have little faith in the lsd movement ever getting full steam again. i hope im wrong. it will always be around, but the not like it was. the distribution system is in shambles. it seems that a whole new generation of younger people lacking the once highly held ethics are ruining things. on a positive note, the psychedelic movement will continue. things change and may seem dark ,but we must continue. the psychedelic experience and man have been together for thousands of years. it survived christianity,it can survive anything. it goes underground now and then, but is there for those dedicated enough to seek it out. if you feel strongly about the benefits of psychedelics then do something positive about it. you cant expect the old generation to carry the torch forever. a new wave of dedicated folks needs to rise up and continue this work. can you think of a more important thing to do? i believe theres a large number of us who would love to get into it and help, how is this possible? "it is going to be tough for any new people to get into this work. this summer has shown that poor choices were made in who would spread the love. not saying it cant be done, but it will be tough. it usually takes a few years of hanging around. your intentions will be tested. not to worry though, because there are many ways we can all help. first is to become educated and responsible when it comes to psychedelics. know the facts and when debating sceptics be mature and informed. most people have very poor info about lsd. rumors and bullshit plague its myth. the more people we have telling the truth the better. turn people on. youll never make a closer friend than one you turned on. after you get to know the effects of psychedelics you can tell that certain people would benefit from them. talk to them if theyre willing. dont be pushy, but offer them info. then if they want offer them the chance. the more truthful info they have the better off theyll be. i am a firm believer that psychedelics can be shown to be useful in mental health. i am in the middle of a 9 year academic voyage to get the proper credentials to help if the chance arises. if we can prove through science and medicine that lsd is benifitial then we make a great step forward. not only will it help expell the nasty rumors around them, but give people the chance touch the healing energy that lsd can open up. studies are under way in the us right now. there for conditions like ocd. even though most of us dont have ocd this study is important. it establishes the safety of psychedelics. this opens the doors for further studies that cover other areas. before the scheduling of lsd there was a lot of research being done. alot of it was very promising. lsd and other psychedelics were placed in the schedule one category and access to them was cut off even to legit researchers. this was a total political move that had nothing to do with the saftey or benefits of lsd. it was about trying to get control of a generation that didnt want to be under control. theres many researchers in the world very interested in psychedelic research. these are very bright m.d.s, phds and scientists. the more help on this front the better. this is were i will spend my remaining years for the movement. supply- there is always a need for psychedelics. if your totally dedicated and willing to risk your freedom to better this planet through providing psychedelics then all the info you need is available at your finger tips. i can think of nothing more important for the survival of our species and those we live with then for us all to have access to the psychedelic experience." to give some closure to this thread, a beautiful prayer: -by innerbeing "let us pray for the brotherhood, for their infinite compassion, and for their understanding of the sufferings of us unawakened individuals. may they realize that there are many who could benefit from their understanding here and now. we could only hope that they will recognize the need amongst us and they will respond out of their compassionate grace to help us in these dark times. we must generate the loving consciousness that has been lost in this decade.....we must develop loving-kindness for all of our brothers and sisters, and we must share these qualities with everyone at all times. the time has come, my dear brothers, for a reawakening of the values, of which you hold so dear, let us continue what you have started. we wait with patience for your response....and we shall continue to wait for as long as it takes. peace be with you all."', ['hacking tools'])

messages ive received. i am consistently blown away by how the core of this community come together in times of strife.. to the multitude of you who lost faith in silk road, i still am glad ive heard your words. i am still devastated that i have failed you. and even i have fallen victim to this attack\xc2\xa0 the majority of my personal earnings are completely gone. my life is not in danger though, and my identity is still protected\xc2\xa0 i\xc2\x92m thankful for this.so now, it\xc2\x92s time to share with you our plan to move forward.i realize you have no way of knowing whether im telling the truth, on anything. trying to communicate the authenticity of my true character on the darknet is difficult to say the least, and i do not expect any of you to take me at my word. but my actions over the next few weeks will speak louder than words ever could, and if you stick around you\xc2\x92ll realize this.silk road is not deadwe are here to stay, and for the most part, i believe our values are the same as yours\xc2\xa0 the community\xc2\x92s. and even though i represent the latest idiot to make a security mistake, i am unlike those who simply give in, and am determined to use lessons learned to fight for this communitys long term security. im focusing on multi-signature transactions as our only safe trading mechanism long term. additionally, i am ready and willing to collaborate with other darknet administrators and utilize our talented penetration testing team to help them to regularly audit their security.and although the tinfoil club will probably hate this and continue to tear me to shreds without regard for my actions in december, and whether you choose to believe them or not, here are the facts:1. i live a very busy and complicated life. i take opsec to extreme levels which consume many of my hours per day. any time you see me here, it means i have completed a checklist which requires over an hour of preparation for me to reposition and reconfigure many things to ensure i leave the most minimal trail possible and can "safely" connect to this place. this job will never be safe, and it is impossible to be perfectly covert. i know what i am facing, both from le and from vendors who do not share my opinions of non-violence.2. all released announcements were my true plans, and all delays were due to unanticipated external factors upon which i cannot elaborate. my staff has been very frustrated at my lack of ability to keep the dev team on time. again, this is completely my fault and something for which i take complete responsibility. i do not trust any developers, so i meticulously review anything the dev team sends to me. many have criticized me for this, and i listened to them. had i reviewed the code even more meticulously and delayed the fix to speed up slow withdrawals last month, transaction malleability would not have affected us at all. this is completely my fault for listening to critics instead of my own sense of caution.3. the public has known that auto-finalize has been disabled for a long time, and has known that the escrow balance is massive.4. any smart person could deduce that re-enabling of auto-finalize requires me to move a vast sum from cold storage to the hot storage wallet to ensure adequate fund availability (which admittedly was too large and one of my biggest failures this month). the attack was surgical and timed perfectly.the reason such a high quantity of coins was stolen was because we were preparing to implement auto-finalization and had therefore moved a huge volume from the cold storage to the hot storage to ensure the coins from all auto-finalized orders could be withdrawn without a hitch.here are as many details on the attack as i can provide. i am still investigating, and do not want to leak anything which could compromise any other markets. transparency in this issue is key, however, you deserve as granular an explanation as possible as to why this happened.sr2 attack investigation results as of feb 151. when withdrawal delays were happening last month, we wrote a custom bitcoin implementation using several available libraries a reference, and built it on a shared infrastructure to load balance across accounts and provide risk mitigation if ever one server was compromised.2. as this implementation was being written by behind-the-scenes dev staff, a lynch mob was getting exponentially worse in the forums. our moderator staff became more and more insistent that it was crucial to fix this problem immediately, relaying to me many concerns, and threats, from the community.3. we cut a corner, deciding to watch transactions. many community members were reporting missing withdrawals, weeks after sending them. we implemented a liberal check to the "refresh deposit balances" link on the account page - in essence, we allowed it to search deeply for any missing coins, rescanning and rescanning. one of our team members was familiar with mtgoxs procedures and source code and vouched for the idea. our thoughts were that if the largest bitcoin exchange was using this approach to find missing coins, it must be commonplace. (i received her/his permission to publish this.)4. the transaction malleability bug was published last week at a time when i was disconnected from the internet for an extended period for opsec reasons. i did not become aware of the threat until the attack was already occurring. this was a failure on my part to trust more staff with critical access to stop withdrawals. the people who did have access to disable withdrawals were terrified of doing it without my permission, due to how negatively the community reacts when withdrawals are turned off. they knew if they disabled withdrawals, then re-enabled them, there would be a run on the bank and i would need to be online to deposit cold storage into hot storage. in effect, this was my failure to emphasize to staff that it is always okay to lean on the side of caution and hit killswitches as they deem necessary. it was also my failure to communicate expectations to the community that sometimes killswitches will have to be hit, and it just means were playing it safe. this month it is clear we did not play it safe. killswitches are pointless if the only person confident enough to hit them is the boss.5. the attacker used an account first registered in early jan to try exploiting the vulnerability. looking back at the accounts history indicates that this account has been used to pentest many aspects of our system unsuccessfully. every previous attempt to find an attack vector failed, due to hardening done by our penetration testing team. i had previously seen these attempts in the logs as something to celebrate: "look, our hardening is working, this hacker would have won, but we put security over features!" - several people suggested disabling the hackers accounts, but that is pointless in our business as anyone can simply re-register.6. we are still unclear as to the exact approach used to cause our servers perception of transactions to mismatch with reality, because we have largely been focusing on preparing for relaunch and building communication to share with you, the community, over the past day. to the best of our understanding, the attacker deposited increasingly larger amounts of bitcoins, and withdrew them while flooding the blockchain with ddos of similar transactions. 7. our system reflected his withdrawals, and his account showed as zero.8. the attacker rapidly clicked "refresh deposits" link until our code assumed that the transaction failed (all indications point to malleability as the root case). our system re-credited his account with the x btc it judged "unsuccessfully" withdrawn. this, again, due to the liberal rescanning mechanisms added last month (see point 3).9. in reality, our servers perceived the transactions inaccurately and the btc were successfully withdrawn. as a result our system inaccurately represented the users balance as larger than it truly was. this allowed the attacker to withdraw coins again.10. the attacker began depositing larger amounts, such as 50 btc at a time, in order to exploit the vulnerability quickly.11. they then drained our entire hot storage in one bitcoin server shard, and tried the attack from one of their other accounts. the other account was on a different shard, and allowed that hot storage to be drained.12. the attacker continued using different accounts until virtually all of our hot storage shards were drained.due to the type of vulnerability, our accounting system had an inaccurate perception of bitcoins on hand and therefore did not trigger any alerts until real user withdrawals began failing unexpectedly. this was a failure on our part to build a new server alert to check each shard of the new shared bitcoin infrastructure, and another symptom of how rushed we were when implementing the new system during a forum lynch-mob about slow withdrawals.lessons learned so far:1.  more staff should have access to killswitches and should not be afraid to use them. even if its just because of some news post about on clearnet about some "transaction malleability" thing. killswitches should be used liberally and regularly.2. a community needs to be comfortable with regular downtime - especially during periods when community safety and the safety of its money could be threatened. a good staff will be responsibly paranoid and hitting killswitches as they deem necessary, and should not be afraid of their community panicking each time precaution is exercised.3. there\xc2\x92s more to web security than rigorous penetration testing. it also requires the constant review of external services, systems and infrastructures.4. never make assumptions when implementing protocols you did not design. had we not trusted mtgoxs staff procedures, we would have reviewed our approaches with much more rigor. just because a large companys procedures are successful does not make them are safe.5. accept that your community will hate you regardless. in the darknet, you will be crucified by your community if anything ever goes wrong. psychologically prepare for everyone to hate you, because you inevitably will fail at something, and you will need to stay determined no matter what. dont let it get to your head, and dont let it affect your rigor with security. we cut corners with our deposit/withdrawal speed optimizations because we were afraid of the lynch-mob. we were foolish in this regard. we should have taken the entire site offline for as long as it took to implement a high-volume fault-tolerant bitcoin server in a well-tested, rigorous manner. this cost us an unspeakable amount of trust that we had slaved to build, some of us for years.this is where were at, with as much transparency as this medium allows:the worst that could happen did not happen.the worst thing that could happen for our communitys finances, however, did.we hate that it occurred under our watch.there is nothing we can do to change this. all we can do is be transparent about where we are at, and move forward.to those who will respond here for dramatic effect, please consider contributing your energy to the reconstruction of our community. if you cannot bring yourself to do this, then please take your negativity elsewhere. this is simple. if you have lost faith in silk road, i dont blame you in the least. i also do not want to read about it in perpetuity.trolling is easy. trolling during a disaster is cowardice. choosing to strengthen rather than troll, when trolling is the popular move - thats noble. i know that i speak for all silk road staff, seen and unseen, when i speak these words: we are going nowhere. we will remain, rebuild, and move forward toward the greater goal for which we strive by our running of this marketplace: personal freedom and foundational human rights.silk road will always rise again.', ['None'])

into the investigation of data surrounding the attacks, and it there is absolutely zero evidence of any staff member being involved. we will publish more information as we determine its accuracy, thank you to all who have contributed tips on the attackers identities.after much self-reflection and deliberation with community members we value highly, it is clear that there is only one way forward.this leadership and this community will not stop until you are completely repaid.we know you feel defenseless right now. you are naked. many of you are convinced there is no logical reason any darknet admin would ever fight to get your coins back.i can stand here and reiterate that all i want to do is defend you, to steer this community towards incrementally safer operation. but my words are no comfort, and i understand that. you will never meet me. we are all anonymous.i gave a similar speech in december when we met our first impossible situation. you have no reason to trust my words. my actions will prove you wrong.here is the current plan. thank you to the dedicated vendors and buyers who helped draft this approach. this is not necessarily a final plan, we are open to suggestions on how to improve this and want your feedback.the plan for moving forward as of feb 151. this administration will not earn any commissions until everyone is completely paid back, and will be very transparent about the progress towards this goal.2. the marketplace will relaunch as no-escrow. we will not re-implement escrow unless it is multi-signature and decentralized to multiple escrow providers (trusted mediators with feedback just like vendors). never buy from a market which uses centralized escrow again. you will only get hurt no matter how honest the team is.3. all items will be priced at a flat 5% commission which will go directly into victims balances upon purchase.4. vendors who lost funds: commissions from your items will go directly into your wallet until you are completely repaid, then will be distributed to other vendors until they are repaid. vendor bonds are considered lost funds, and we also commit to paying these back.5. all vendors can opt-in to give a higher percentage back on their listings, and all buyers will be presented with a "donate" box on the shopping cart. vendors donation percentage will be publicly visible.6. we will launch the support system immediately. resubmit any open support requests you had which are still applicable. all previous messages will be ignored due to our inbound message volume. i have received over 1000 private messages over the past 24 hours, for example. this fresh start will allow us to stay on top of the support queue, rather than paying down a large debt incurred by previous administrators.7. we will still handle dispute resolution for existing escrow orders until all balances site-wide are in "pending balance" category. your stolen balances and escrows will display as "pending balance" and "pending escrow". yes, like christmas. i hoped to never have to take this approach again. all unshipped orders have been cancelled. to the vendors who have shipped orders despite no access to the portal: you are beautiful people. try to resolve with your buyer directly, and file a support ticket if you do not receive a refund to your pending escrow balance within a month.the plans above are subject to change as we consider your input.the statistics are humbling:26% of our monthly active users have lost their entire sr funds. that represents 47% of users who have purchased or sold items since launch.our inbound traffic has been growing at a rapid pace. the first ten days of february saw as many purchases as the entire month of january. by feb 13, we surpassed januarys total user registrations.we strongly believe that we can work together and make this right.silk road is not a name easily forgotten, and how we pull through this struggle will only solidify our name as the strongest community in the darknet.buyers and vendors: we are committed to getting everyone repaid even if it takes a year. do not forget to check your sr accounts frequently for balances repaid, and withdraw them when you see them.vendors:\xc2\xa0 you are welcomed and encouraged to vend on multiple markets. i only trust myself, and will not endorse any of them. but i have failed you. wherever you vend, may you prosper.buyers: do not purchase using centralized escrow. use markets which have implemented multi-signature, or only purchase with no-escrow (fe) from very trusted vendors. this is not an ideal climate, but it is the reality of the darknet today. i cannot emphasize strongly enough that every market which uses centralized escrow will fail. centralization makes a market a huge target for attackers, and a huge target for dishonest administrators.again, we welcome your feedback on this approach to moving forward, and will continue to refine it throughout the year based on sales data.i dont care how long it takes or how expensive it is, we will fight to get this community repaid.', ['None'])

(764410, 109360, 'i was intrigued by psychedelics since my first psilocybin trip just as i turned into an adult - officially. i had become disillusioned with alcohol and marijuana; as it was consumed by the general populace, but within these fungi i found such pleasure and clarity. truly a satisfying and rewarding substance.psilocybin piqued my interest and soon there-after, i gave lsd a try. before trying anything else, or even more lsd - i approached the subject very cautiously. substance, source, and purity were absolutely of incredible importance. in the meantime i did a lot of reading, becoming very knowledgeable about alexander shulgin and erowid. then i found gracie & zarkov, the following passage moved me. leading to my first experiments with mda & 2c-b a few years later. recently (about 1.5 years ago) i re-experienced this article and i feel like i truly integrated the knowledge & wisdom contained within.i was originally very suspicious & careful about consuming drugs/psychedelics more than 1-2 times/year. however, recently ive made come to a conclusion that i have dedicated so much to the pursuit of knowledge behind these substances that they truly are my allies. i still dont consume them more than maybe 1/month, but i just follow my feelings on that one. my primary allies are as follows:mescaline, dom, psilocybin, mda, 4-aco-dmt, dmt, 2c-b, dob, 2c-e, 2c-d, 2c-i, and sativa cannabis (although usually not in-combination with psychedelics, as i believe it defeats the headspace i am trying to achieve .. increases the visuals, but deteriorates the mental clarity). harmala-alkaloids also, but never in combination with anything but tryptamines.ive also tried & loved 2c-t-7, dxm, d-amphetamine, and mdpv. i respect the destructive power of stimulants immensely and can count on one hand the number of times ive used d-amphetamine/mdpv in the past 10 years. also rarely use dissociatives, few times a year at most.tried & am neutral: mdma, 5-meo-mipt, 2c-p, ketamine (although ive had some great experiences in combination with 2c-b), mxetried & dislike: 5-meo-dipt, doc, butt plugslist of things id like to try: doi, dpt, bufotenine (5-oh-dmt), tma-series, mmda, aleph-series, and ganesha. things ive decided to avoid: nbome-series, most very recently developed rcs (especially stimulants), methylone~~~let us restate our position clearly: psychedelic drugs give the shaman reliable means of entering alternative reality tunnels that are at least as real as our everyday reality. the shamans task, therefore, is to become familiar with their effect and applications. psychedelic drugs are powerful tools, and powerful tools, like heavy construction equipment, can cause fatalities when operated by untrained personnel.naive or recreational use of psychedelic drugs does not make one either a shaman or a saint. if this were true, the bay area would have been overrun by saints and shamans in 1967. in traditional shamanic societies, there exist speci\xef\xac\x81c traditions, histories, rituals and practices which provide a stable, long-term set and setting by which the drug experiences is interpreted and controlled. even then, the use of the substances is severely limited either to certain festival occasions or to certain individuals. we have none of this cultural support or control. the requisite cosmology, epistemology, eschatology and ethics that are absolute requirements for effective sacred use of the hallucinogens are not given to us by our society. even such things as the nitty gritty technical details about drug preparation, dosage and use are generally unavailable.anyone who uses these drugs at high doses without this knowledgerisks madness and personal destructionfortunately, as post-moderns we offer you a simple solution: do the research, educate yourself, and then make it up as you go along!the accumulated knowledge of all of humanity is available to you in the library or in the bookstores along telegraph avenue. read history, philosophy, anthropology, psychology and religion along with mythology, science \xef\xac\x81ction and fantasy. create your own mythology or religion. make it historic-scienti\xef\xac\x81c in foundation and science \xef\xac\x81ction-fantasy in style. sign on your best friend for the journey (the buddy system is a safety net). start with the works in the accompanying bibliography. they contain enough information to make you a world class expert in the psychedelics? engage in twice monthly psychedelic training sessions with your buddy.in three or four years you will have a shamanistic starship capable of reliably taking you to worlds of beauty and religious depth that have been available heretofore only to humanitys great geniuses, artists and mystics (no shit).what does it take? about the amount of effort dedication that it takes to get a phd in the humanities. if you arent willing to put in this level of effort, choose another path.we cant tell you the details of your shamanistic starship. it could be furnished as a monastic cell or as a plush pleasure dome or anything in between. the design is up to you. each shaman must find his or her own way. certainly we wouldnt even dream of suggesting a destination once you have built it. the possibilities are endless.just remember: dont buy anyones bullshit along the way (especially ours) and dont go the guru route. and for goddess sake, have fun along the way.one final warning: you must remember this - those who know dont speak and those who speak dont know. to loosely quote terrence mckenna "the mysteries stand revealed. they are no longer exclusively the province of yogins and adepts but are open to all those who truly seek."welcome to the neopaleolithic where we poor monkeys get back to the unfinished business of re-creating ourselves as angels and going to the stars.good luck! stay high and stay free!gracie and zarkov~~~in discussion of the darknet as a source of drugs. this idea is absolutely compatible with my ethics. in fact even if drugs were legalized; my preferred method of distribution would be through the darknet. vendors are held to a higher standard than corporations. it also keeps people from being persecuted for publicy buying drugs. discreet packages that blend in with the mail. its a genius idea, and i truly hope we as a community continue to be successful in jumping these hurdles.know your source. know your substance.ps.if youve tried mescaline; whether as a cactus, or extracted material. give dom a try. its an absolutely brilliant psychedelic. if you havent tried mescaline, i suggest you try mescaline - then give dom a try. theyre both brilliant in their own ways, and neither is "superior."', ['hacking tools'])

(770403, 110170, 'this guide was originally written as a harm reduction guide to mda, but the guidelines outlined here also apply to mdma. i hope that this information reaches you all and better informs you of how to approach mdxx use. protect your minds, my friends. it is the most valuable thing you possess. mda (methylenedioxyamphetamine) has been shown to have a neurotoxic effect on the 5-ht (serotonin) axons when abused. many users will state that mda is completely safe to use often, but this is a false preconception based on nothing more than anecdotal claims that have zero scientific backing. there have been hundreds of studies throughout the years that outline both mdas, and its methylated cousin mdmas, neurotoxicity, and not taking the time to value the information they have uncovered is altogether unwise.with this in mind, mda can be used safely with no backlash assuming a set of precautions are followed when using it.1) do not roll more than once a month at least, with emphasis on trying to allow 2-3 months between use.2) a safe dosing guideline for mda is typically 1.0-1.5mg/kg. for instance, if you weigh 80kg, your dosage will be between 80-120mg depending on desired intensity. 80mg will be a light and sociable dose and 120mg will be a much heavier dose.3) keep your body temperature low and stay hydrated! this is perhaps the most important guideline in preventing neurotoxicity. ensure above all else that you are not overexerting yourself.4) antioxidants such as alpha lipoic acid, vitamin c, vitamin e, green tea extract (egcg), and magnesium glycinate will heavily aid in alleviating neurotoxicity, protecting your brain, and improving your roll.a more explanation on each of these points...- moderation is absolutely pivotal when using mda. mda releases serotonin in vast amounts and inhibits the enzyme tryptophan hydroxalyse (tph), which is responsible for creating more serotonin. because this inhibition is permanent, the body must compensate by creating more tph, and this restoration period typically takes between 1-3 months depending on the users diet and exercise patterns. with this in mind, the healthier you are, the quicker the process is. exercise is phenomenal for speeding up this process as exercise stimulates a release of bdnf which encourages the growth of new serotonin axons. the bottom line is this: spread out your use. depending on your health and exercise habits, wait at least one month between use, with a strong emphasis on waiting a preferred 2-3 months.- dosing and redosing are also two very large components of mda neurotoxicity. the higher you dose, the more prone you are to mdas neurotoxic effects. a general guideline for safely dosing mda is 1.0-1.5mg/kg. for example, if you weigh 80kg, the optimal dosage for mda is between 80-120mg. whether you choose 80mg or 120mg depends on how intense you want the experience to be and is entirely dependant on your choice. subjectively speaking on the intensity of effects,, 80mg will be a light, sociable dose, 100mg a moderate dose, and 120mg a high dose. because many users will choose to dose higher in search of a more intense experience, i will offer two critical insights: mda is much more potent than mdma, so try to avoid dosing too high, and more importantly, do not redose! redosing is highly unwise, entirely pointless, and plays a huge role in neurotoxicity and will lead to a terrible comedown.for a better representation of why this is bad, let me put it into a rough and incredibly oversimplified analogy. think of your serotonin transport system (sert) as a dam. this dam moderates your serotonin levels by slowly releasing it to control everything from mood, appetite, sleep, heart rate, libido, and so forth. when you ingest mda, it essentially takes control of the floodgates of this dam, opens them up to full capacity, and releases all the serotonin available behind it. what happens when you release all of the serotonin behind this dam? you must wait a while for the levels to return to normal. opening the floodgates to a dam with no water behind it makes absolutely no sense, and this is essentially what redosing mda does. you will not roll harder or longer by taking more; instead, you are simply making your comedown exponentially worse and increasing mda induced neurotoxicity.- keep your body temperature low! do not overexert yourself when dancing as hyperthermia is the leading cause of mda induced neurotoxicity due to a rise in oxidative stress. when your body temperature rises, you bodys natural process for preventing oxidative stress (antioxidants) becomes less efficient. that lowering of efficiency is exponential. the higher your body temperature gets, the faster reactive oxygen species are created, which damage your brain. a fantastic way to keep your body temperature low is thc (yes, smoking marijuana helps mda neurotoxicity too!), ensuring you dance in moderation, and making sure that you stay properly hydrated. in that breath, do not over-hydrate. depending on the amount of physical activity you are undergoing, 16-24oz of water every hour is optimal for staying hydrated. also, did i mention to keep your body temperature low?- preloading and postloading are two staples for enriching the mda experience and almost entirely negating the potential for neurotoxic damage. not only do they alleviate neurotoxicity, but you will find your roll to be much more smooth and grant you with a beautiful afterglow instead of a hangover. here are a few essential supplements that are key to a proper regimen. if you are unable to purchase these supplements or take them as advised, i will recommend that green tea, orange juice, or emergen-c packets as they will lightly aide in providing antioxidants. however, these two should not be considered an all inclusive replacement. they come recommended on a "better than nothing" basis and pressure should be placed on picking up the appropriate supplements.* na-r-ala (alpha lipoic acid): this is a powerful antioxidant that eliminates free roaming reactive oxygen and nitrogen particles, in turn reducing neurotoxicity. dose 100mg of na-r-ala 30 minutes prior to rolling and 2 hours into the roll. ensure that you purchase the na-r-ala isomer form of ala. while racemic ala is okay, na-r-ala is much more efficient.* magnesium glycinate: magnesium is a phenomenal substance that will alleviate the bruxism (jaw clenching) and fasciculations (muscle twitches) commonly experienced when taking mda. dose 400mg elemental magnesium glycinate 6 hours prior to rolling, again 30 minutes prior, and finally 2 hours into the roll. be sure you purchase either magnesium glycinate (preferred) or magnesium citrate. the most common form, magnesium oxide, is not readily absorbed, so completely avoid it.* vitamin c: the most common antioxidant out there and has been shown to mitigate mda induced hepatotoxicity and neurotoxicity. dose 1,000mg of vitamin c 30 minutes prior to rolling.* vitamin e: a powerful antioxidant that will seek out free radicals. dose 400 iu 30 minutes prior to rolling.* green tea extract (egcg): egcg is a potent antioxidant and diuretic. it will help with the urinary retention arising from mda induced vasopressin release. dose 400mg 30 minutes prior, and 2 hours into the roll.* 5-htp: 5-htp is the direct precursor to serotonin. supplementing 100mg of 5-htp with 400mg of egcg (egcg will help 5-htp cross the blood-brain barrier more efficiently) at bedtime for 5-7 days after rolling will aid your body in restoring serotonin to their proper levels. warning: 5-htp can cause cardiac fibrosis when used in high doses over extended periods of time, so avoid taking 5-htp in high doses for more than 5-7 days.* melatonin: melatonin is created from serotonin, and since your serotonin levels will be low, taking a melatonin supplement will help you fall asleep. melatonin is also a powerful antioxidant. take 5-10mg of melatonin prior to falling asleep after rolling.in the end, the best advice that can be offered is to simply be smart. know your limits, follow common sense, and remember exactly why youre taking mda. cherish and value the experience; dont tarnish it by abusing it and harming your mind and body.sources (clearnet)* supplements:http://www.geronova.com/sites/default/files/alt_med_rev_2008_0.pdfhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/s1044576584710128http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15212815http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11931860http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14740000* neurotoxicity:http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7582557http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2457659http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1784586http://www.maps.org/publications/1987_stone_3.pdf', ['hacking tools'])
(770415, 110170, 'none of the above supplements have provided me with any stomach discomfort in my experience, but obviously all of our bodies are different and react to things differently. your best bet is to simply have a test run without mdma and see how you feel when taking the supplements. also, i typically eat a decently sized meal 2-3 hours prior to rolling and taking supplements with food in your belly always helps. i know most people like to fast before, but i like to get my nutrition in prior to launching. also, this guide obviously errs on the extreme side of caution and was written to be a helpful resource on what to take. this pre-load/post-load regimen is what i recommend for instances where you will be exerting yourself a lot (dancing at a festival in the heat, for instance) and need as much protection as possible. if you are going to be rolling at home on the couch under the a/c with easy access to cold water, you really probably only need one dose of ala, and vitamin c for antioxidant purposes, and magnesium glycinate for alleviating jaw discomfort. the big keys to mitigating neurotoxicity are to take a reasonable dose and to keep your body temperature low. if you can do that, youre off to a great start!', ['hacking tools'])

(as of 4/2/14, i am shipping only dmt internationally. this is subject to change at any time.)3. i package orders one time per day at around 1pm pst. if you do not get your order in by then, it will be shipped the next day.4. use a name associated with the address!!! this is the number one most common reason for mail not reaching a residence.5. do not ship to an abandoned business or house. they do not deliver to a location in which they know has no apparent residence.addresses should look like this:firstname lastname12345 jackson circle apt. 14nowhere, ny 12345if your address does not look like this, i will not ship until i have a correct address! i will not be held responsible for your mistakes.-----------escrow and refunds-----------i no longer work in escrow. all orders must be finalized early before i will ship. i only offer tracking on my products. if something goes wrong with your order and it appears that it is my fault, you will get a full refund or reship (there will only be a 50% refund/reship for the buds). i do not offer reships or refunds for international orders. i also will not help you if you come to me over a month after shipping your product. i do not keep shipping info for longer than one month for security measures.-----------ways to smoke dmt-----------1. the best way (and my personal favorite) is through a volcano vaporizer.2. the most popular way of doing it is the sandwich method. this is where you pack a layer of ash (cigarette ash will work but weed ash is the best) in the bottom of the bowl, sprinkle about 30-35mg of dmt per person on top of that ash, then pack another layer of ash on top of the dmt. the reason for this is because dmt degrades when hit with direct heat. it needs to be vaporized.3. build a dmt smoking machine. this is the internets favorite method because it is almost as effective as a volcano and can be built very cheap. you can google around on how to make these, there are many different kinds.tips for smoking dmt:1. do not drink. this will essentially kill or heavily deteriorate your trip.2. do not take benzos. this will also essentially kill or heavily deteriorate your trip.3. do not smoke out of a light bulb. the glass is too thin and burns most of your dmt.4. i love to smoke cannabis but i find that i never remember much if i am stoned when i do my dmt. so if you want to remember your trip very well, try to do it without cannabis (even though it does seem to make the trip better).', ['None'])

its entirety:hash: sha512i am sweating as i write this.christmas brought grave news. i cannot adequately express how deeply honored i was by your unconditional support of my staff.i do not expect the same reaction to todays revelations. this movement is built on integrity, and i feel obligated to be forthright with you.i held myself to a high standard as your leader, yet now i must utter words all too familiar to this scarred community:we have been hacked.nobody is in danger, no information has been leaked, and server access was never obtained by the attacker.our initial investigations indicate that a vendor exploited a recently discovered vulnerability in the bitcoin protocol known as "transaction malleability" to repeatedly withdraw coins from our system until it was completely empty.despite our hardening and pentesting procedures, this attack vector was outside of penetration testing scope due to being rooted in the bitcoin protocol itself.this attack hit us at the worst possible time. we were planning on re-launching the new auto-finalize and dispute center this past weekend, and our projections of order finalization volume indicated that we would need the communitys full balance in hot storage.in retrospect this was incredibly foolish, and i take full responsibility for this decision.i have failed you as a leader, and am completely devastated by todays discoveries. i should have taken mtgox and bitstamps lead and disabled withdrawals as soon as the malleability issue was reported. i was slow to respond and too skeptical of the possible issue at hand. it is a crushing blow. i cannot find the words to express how deeply i want this movement to be safe from the very threats i just watched materialize during my watch.ive included transaction logs at the bottom of this message. review the vendors dishonest actions and use whatever means you deem necessary to bring this person to justice. more details will emerge as we continue to investigate.given the right flavor of influence from our community, we can only hope that he will decide to return the coins with integrity as opposed to hiding like a coward.it takes the integrity of all of us to push this movement forward. whoever you are, you still have a chance to act in the interest of helping this community. keep a percentage, return the rest. dont walk away with your fellow freedom fighters coins. dpr2 returned the cold storage. i didnt run with the gold. but two people alone cannot move us forward. it takes an entire community committing to integrity - and though this crushing blow will not stop us, it sure is a testament to how greedy some bastards truly are.being a part of this movement might be the most defining thing you do with your entire life.dont trade that for greed, comrades.i will fight here by your side, even the greedy bastards amongst us.this community has suffered great financial loss over and over again, and i am devastated that it has happened again under my watch.hindsight is already suggesting dozens of ways this could have been prevented, but we must march onward.the only way to reverse a communitys greed is through generosity. our true character is revealed during trying times.if this financial hardship places you at risk of physical harm, contact me directly and i will do my best to help you with my remaining personal funds.- ----------------now what.- ----------------never again store your escrow bitcoins on a server.silk road will never again be a centralized escrow storage.this week has shown the collateral damage we can cause by being a huge target and failing in just one unforeseen area.i am now fully convinced that no hosted escrow service is safe.if i cannot trust myself to keep a hosted escrow solution safe, i cannot trust anyone.multi-signature transactions are the only way this community will be protected long-term.i am aggressively tasking our devs on building out multi-sig support for commonly-used bitcoin clients. expect a generous bounty if you have the skill to implement this.- -----------------until then.- -----------------1. we will never again allow ourselves to be a single point of failure. we will never again host your escrow wallets.2. vendor registration is closed while we regroup.3. all listings on silk road are now no-escrow (finalize-early) for 1-2 months while we implement multi-signature transactions and lobby for mainstream bitcoin client multi-sig support.4. all unshipped orders have been cancelled.5. vendors may link to other marketplaces on a trail basis until we launch multi-sig, then we will re-evaluate based on community input. we do not want to be a centralized point of failure, but we also do not want to lead our buyers into dangerous waters.6. from this point forward do not trust markets with centralized escrow. use multi-signature transactions whenever possible, with trusted third parties as escrow providers.everything will be offline for 24-48 hours to minimize variables as we continue to investigate. the evidence we have below will be expanded based on our findings.- ------------------no marketplace is perfect. expect any centralized market to fail at some point. this is precisely why we must unite in the decision to decentralize.we are relieved that our security procedures protected user identities, and that no servers were compromised. this was not a worst-case scenario: nobody will be getting arrested from this. financial loss is terrible, but will not put all of us behind bars.the details we have on the hacker are

the same reaction to todays revelations. this movement is built on integrity, and i feel obligated to be forthright with you.i held myself to a high standard as your leader, yet now i must utter words all too familiar to this scarred community:we have been hacked.nobody is in danger, no information has been leaked, and server access was never obtained by the attacker.our initial investigations indicate that a vendor exploited a recently discovered vulnerability in the bitcoin protocol known as "transaction malleability" to repeatedly withdraw coins from our system until it was completely empty.despite our hardening and pentesting procedures, this attack vector was outside of penetration testing scope due to being rooted in the bitcoin protocol itself.this attack hit us at the worst possible time. we were planning on re-launching the new auto-finalize and dispute center this past weekend, and our projections of order finalization volume indicated that we would need the communitys full balance in hot storage.in retrospect this was incredibly foolish, and i take full responsibility for this decision.i have failed you as a leader, and am completely devastated by todays discoveries. i should have taken mtgox and bitstamps lead and disabled withdrawals as soon as the malleability issue was reported. i was slow to respond and too skeptical of the possible issue at hand. it is a crushing blow. i cannot find the words to express how deeply i want this movement to be safe from the very threats i just watched materialize during my watch.ive included transaction logs at the bottom of this message. review the vendors dishonest actions and use whatever means you deem necessary to bring this person to justice. more details will emerge as we continue to investigate.given the right flavor of influence from our community, we can only hope that he will decide to return the coins with integrity as opposed to hiding like a coward.it takes the integrity of all of us to push this movement forward. whoever you are, you still have a chance to act in the interest of helping this community. keep a percentage, return the rest. dont walk away with your fellow freedom fighters coins. dpr2 returned the cold storage. i didnt run with the gold. but two people alone cannot move us forward. it takes an entire community committing to integrity - and though this crushing blow will not stop us, it sure is a testament to how greedy some bastards truly are.being a part of this movement might be the most defining thing you do with your entire life.dont trade that for greed, comrades.i will fight here by your side, even the greedy bastards amongst us.this community has suffered great financial loss over and over again, and i am devastated that it has happened again under my watch.hindsight is already suggesting dozens of ways this could have been prevented, but we must march onward.the only way to reverse a communitys greed is through generosity. our true character is revealed during trying times.if this financial hardship places you at risk of physical harm, contact me directly and i will do my best to help you with my remaining personal funds.- ----------------now what.- ----------------never again store your escrow bitcoins on a server.silk road will never again be a centralized escrow storage.this week has shown the collateral damage we can cause by being a huge target and failing in just one unforeseen area.i am now fully convinced that no hosted escrow service is safe.if i cannot trust myself to keep a hosted escrow solution safe, i cannot trust anyone.multi-signature transactions are the only way this community will be protected long-term.i am aggressively tasking our devs on building out multi-sig support for commonly-used bitcoin clients. expect a generous bounty if you have the skill to implement this.- -----------------until then.- -----------------1. we will never again allow ourselves to be a single point of failure. we will never again host your escrow wallets.2. vendor registration is closed while we regroup.3. all listings on silk road are now no-escrow (finalize-early) for 1-2 months while we implement multi-signature transactions and lobby for mainstream bitcoin client multi-sig support.4. all unshipped orders have been cancelled.5. vendors may link to other marketplaces on a trail basis until we launch multi-sig, then we will re-evaluate based on community input. we do not want to be a centralized point of failure, but we also do not want to lead our buyers into dangerous waters.6. from this point forward do not trust markets with centralized escrow. use multi-signature transactions whenever possible, with trusted third parties as escrow providers.everything will be offline for 24-48 hours to minimize variables as we continue to investigate. the evidence we have below will be expanded based on our findings.- ------------------no marketplace is perfect. expect any centralized market to fail at some point. this is precisely why we must unite in the decision to decentralize.we are relieved that our security procedures protected user identities, and that no servers were compromised. this was not a worst-case scenario: nobody will be getting arrested from this. financial loss is terrible, but will not put all of us behind bars.the details we have on the hacker are

adequately express how deeply honored i was by your unconditional support of my staff.i do not expect the same reaction to todays revelations. this movement is built on integrity, and i feel obligated to be forthright with you.i held myself to a high standard as your leader, yet now i must utter words all too familiar to this scarred community:we have been hacked.nobody is in danger, no information has been leaked, and server access was never obtained by the attacker.our initial investigations indicate that a vendor exploited a recently discovered vulnerability in the bitcoin protocol known as "transaction malleability" to repeatedly withdraw coins from our system until it was completely empty.despite our hardening and pentesting procedures, this attack vector was outside of penetration testing scope due to being rooted in the bitcoin protocol itself.this attack hit us at the worst possible time. we were planning on re-launching the new auto-finalize and dispute center this past weekend, and our projections of order finalization volume indicated that we would need the communitys full balance in hot storage.in retrospect this was incredibly foolish, and i take full responsibility for this decision.i have failed you as a leader, and am completely devastated by todays discoveries. i should have taken mtgox and bitstamps lead and disabled withdrawals as soon as the malleability issue was reported. i was slow to respond and too skeptical of the possible issue at hand. it is a crushing blow. i cannot find the words to express how deeply i want this movement to be safe from the very threats i just watched materialize during my watch.ive included transaction logs at the bottom of this message. review the vendors dishonest actions and use whatever means you deem necessary to bring this person to justice. more details will emerge as we continue to investigate.given the right flavor of influence from our community, we can only hope that he will decide to return the coins with integrity as opposed to hiding like a coward.it takes the integrity of all of us to push this movement forward. whoever you are, you still have a chance to act in the interest of helping this community. keep a percentage, return the rest. dont walk away with your fellow freedom fighters coins. dpr2 returned the cold storage. i didnt run with the gold. but two people alone cannot move us forward. it takes an entire community committing to integrity - and though this crushing blow will not stop us, it sure is a testament to how greedy some bastards truly are.being a part of this movement might be the most defining thing you do with your entire life.dont trade that for greed, comrades.i will fight here by your side, even the greedy bastards amongst us.this community has suffered great financial loss over and over again, and i am devastated that it has happened again under my watch.hindsight is already suggesting dozens of ways this could have been prevented, but we must march onward.the only way to reverse a communitys greed is through generosity. our true character is revealed during trying times.if this financial hardship places you at risk of physical harm, contact me directly and i will do my best to help you with my remaining personal funds.- ----------------now what.- ----------------never again store your escrow bitcoins on a server.silk road will never again be a centralized escrow storage.this week has shown the collateral damage we can cause by being a huge target and failing in just one unforeseen area.i am now fully convinced that no hosted escrow service is safe.if i cannot trust myself to keep a hosted escrow solution safe, i cannot trust anyone.multi-signature transactions are the only way this community will be protected long-term.i am aggressively tasking our devs on building out multi-sig support for commonly-used bitcoin clients. expect a generous bounty if you have the skill to implement this.- -----------------until then.- -----------------1. we will never again allow ourselves to be a single point of failure. we will never again host your escrow wallets.2. vendor registration is closed while we regroup.3. all listings on silk road are now no-escrow (finalize-early) for 1-2 months while we implement multi-signature transactions and lobby for mainstream bitcoin client multi-sig support.4. all unshipped orders have been cancelled.5. vendors may link to other marketplaces on a trail basis until we launch multi-sig, then we will re-evaluate based on community input. we do not want to be a centralized point of failure, but we also do not want to lead our buyers into dangerous waters.6. from this point forward do not trust markets with centralized escrow. use multi-signature transactions whenever possible, with trusted third parties as escrow providers.everything will be offline for 24-48 hours to minimize variables as we continue to investigate. the evidence we have below will be expanded based on our findings.- ------------------no marketplace is perfect. expect any centralized market to fail at some point. this is precisely why we must unite in the decision to decentralize.we are relieved that our security procedures protected user identities, and that no servers were compromised. this was not a worst-case scenario: nobody will be getting arrested from this. financial loss is terrible, but will not put all of us behind bars.the details we have on the hacker are below. stop at nothing to bring this person to your own definition of justice.humbled and

since youre basically having to agree to route traffic for everyone else (and theyre agreeing to route traffic for you), its closer to "pay as you go", but youre paying with your own bandwidth.2. plausible deniability - just because traffic is coming from my i2p router instance, that doesnt necessarily mean its *my* traffic.\xc2\xa0 could be one of my peers traffic that im just routing.there are also some disadvantages (everything in life has a cost):1. i2p isnt "fire and forget".\xc2\xa0 you cant just connect, expect to get good bandwidth (as with tor) for free, then disconnect.\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0it really is built around the model that youre connected 24/7 (or at least, for hours on end) and always routing traffic for everyone.\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0the farther you stray from that model, the worse the performance gets.\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0you *can* connect to i2p in a hidden mode, where youre similar to a tor client, but performance is going to take a hit.\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0why would other i2p participants want to haul your traffic for you if youre not contributing to them?\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0i2p might take a few hours or a day to speed up to decent performance levels after you fire it up, and most complaints about its performance are from people who arent using it the way it was intended.2. i2p cant hide the real ips of its clients as well, because theyre relays too.\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0if everyone is a relay, everyone needs a way to know who all the relays are, and the net result is that its much easier to build a list of *all* i2p relays at any given time.\xc2\xa0 this opens up some attacks, where an adversary harvests lists of *all* i2p relays on a regular basis (i.e. who all is using i2p right now?), then works that into an intersection attack.\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0basically, "whom posted at times x, y, and z.\xc2\xa0 which i2p relays were all online at those three times?".\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0over time, intersection attacks get very effective.\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0one criticism that has been argued to hell and back at srfv2 is that in a marketplace scenario, if an adversary already knows a rough geographic location for an i2p user (i.e. they received a package from a vendor located in seattle), that intersection attack gets much easier.\xc2\xa0 not going to rehash it here.3. its hasnt received as much scrutiny.\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0academics have been beating on the tor network for a decade.\xc2\xa0 very few analyses of i2p have occurred, and that doesnt mean its problem-free.. it just means that nobodys looked at it closely.the third, rarely-mentioned network is freenet, which is a high-latency network that works much differently from tor and i2p.\xc2\xa0 wont bore you with that description here.hope that helps a little.\xc2\xa0 it gets complicated quick, and everybody ends up getting into religious battles over this versus that.\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0theyre both pretty interesting technologies, and neither one really stands up well to adversaries like nsa over the long haul, but theyre really all everyone has to work with right now.does a vpn running with i2p increases the security?', ['None'])

silk road?s ssbdby all things vicessbd had no role to play in the silk road marketplace where drugs were bought and sold.\xc2\xa0 he was a moderator of the silk road discussion forum, which had its own url and was hosted on a different server to the marketplace. so why is the us so determined to extradite someone who may or may not be him?peter philip nash has been sitting in a brisbane jail cell since 20 december 2013.he is facing extradition to the united states to face allegations of narcotics conspiracy (maximum sentence of life in prison and a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years); conspiracy to commit computer hacking (maximum 5 years) and money laundering conspiracy, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.scales-of-injusticeaccording to the us indictment, nash was known online as ?samesamebutdifferent?, better known to silk road members as ssbd. ssbd was a well-loved moderator of the now defunct silk road discussion forums (new forums, colloquially known as sr2, have replaced the old). his job was to answer questions, explain the rules, move posts to their proper forum (with over a million posts, many were bound to wind up in the wrong place) and generally attend to banal administrative tasks.in any event, nash may or may not be ssbd.\xc2\xa0 but even if he is. what exactly was ssbd?s crime?all i have to go on is the indictment. i don?t know what other information the authorities have, but if all they have is what is in the indictment, it would be a travesty if australia was to agree to deport him.ssbd had no role to play in the silk road marketplace where drugs were bought and sold.\xc2\xa0 he was a moderator of the silk road discussion forum, which had its own url and was hosted on a different server to the marketplace. his job was confined to that site.two others who were arrested concurrently ? andrew jones (aka inigo) and gary davis (libertas) ? were immediately released on bail under the laws of the usa and ireland respectively. according to the indictment, inigo and libertas did have roles on the marketplace as well as the forums. the indictment differentiates the two where it says:?inigo?? worked as a site administrator on silk road?libertas? ?? worked as a site administrator on silk road?samesamebutdifferent?? worked as the primary moderator on the silk road discussion forums (my emphasis)nash was not granted bail because under the australian extradition act 1988, ?a magistrate or eligible federal circuit court judge shall not remand a person on bail under this section unless there are special circumstances justifying such remand?. it seems nash could not fulfil the ?special circumstances? requirement.next wednesday, nash is due back in court for a magistrate to determine whether he is ?eligible for surrender? to the us. if so, nash will be remanded in custody until the next phase of the proceedings ? surrender or review (or he can consent to extradition).under s.19 of the act, he will be eligible for surrender to us authorities if the magistrate is satisfied:(a)\xc2\xa0 the supporting documents in relation to the offence have been produced to the magistrate or judge;(b)\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0any additional requirements imposed by the us-australia extradition treaty are satisfied(c)\xc2\xa0 the conduct would have constituted an extradition offence if it had occurred in australia, and(d)\xc2\xa0 there are no substantial grounds for believing that there is an extradition objection in relation to the offencenow, a disclaimer. although i was a lawyer in my deep dark past, i have zero experience with either crime or extradition law. so i don?t know any more than anyone else. these are simply my uninformed opinions after looking at the act and extradition treaty, and knowing from two years of investigating silk road what ssbd?s role consisted of.19(b) ? any additional requirements imposed by the us-australia extradition treaty are satisfiedarticle vi of the treaty says: ?extradition shall be granted only if the evidence is found sufficient, according to the laws in the territory where the person whose extradition is requested is found, either to justify his trial or committal for trial if the offence with which he is charged or its equivalent had been committed in that territory?like i said, i don?t know what evidence they have, so i can only go on the indictment. it seems to me ?evidence? is pretty lacking in that document.first, i have no idea what evidence the us authorities have that nash is ssbd. they may have found some correspondence on the silk road servers between he and the site?s owner, dread pirate roberts. or perhaps ross ulbricht, the man accused of being dread pirate roberts, provided his details in an attempt at a plea bargain. ulbricht, it should be noted, has denied being dpr, and has denied all charges, so this seems unlikely. the indictment claims ssbd was paid around $50,000 per year. this presumably was paid in bitcoin. it is possible, though again unlikely, that the bitcoin trail was followed to nash?s bank account.most likely, the ?evidence? is an email from an anonymous email account or a message through an anonymous private claiming that ssbd?s real name is peter nash. not too compelling.this requirement for evidence is also relevant to the next two stipulations.19(c) ? the conduct would have constituted an extradition offence if it had occurred in australiathe wording says ?conduct? not ?crimes of which the person is accused?. the only conduct i could find attributed to ssbd in the indictment was:(1)\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0in relation to the narcotics charge: sent a message to dread pirate roberts, owner of silk road, summarising the actions he had taken during the previous week in his capacity as the primary forum moderator on the silk road discussion forums.-\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 i doubt that sending a message from one anonymous online account to another anonymous online account constitutes an extradition offence-\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 the narcotics charge is the only charge to have any ?overt acts? (which sounds similar to ?conduct? to me) listed underneath the charges attributable to ssbd(2)\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0in relation to the hacking charge: intentionally accessed computers without authorisation for commercial advantage and private financial gain, and in furtherance of criminal and tortious acts-\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 no ?overt acts? were listed under this charge; the above was a general accusation aimed at all three defendants; this does not sound like it could be considered ?conduct of the person constituting the offence,? which is what the act requires-\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 i would be interested to see what evidence they have that ssbd accessed computers without authorisation. there would certainly be no need to do so in order to carry out his functions of moderating a discussion forum. he would have carried out his duties on his own computer, logging in to the silk road administration panel (at least the small part he had access to), completely authorised to do so.(3)\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0in relation to the money laundering charge: conduct and attempt to conduct such financial transactions which in fact involved the proceeds of specified unlawful activity, to wit, narcotics trafficking and computer hacking-\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 no ?overt acts? were listed under this charge; the above was a general accusation aimed at all three defendants; this does not sound like it could be considered ?conduct of the person constituting the offence,? which is what the act requires-\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 again, i would be interested to see what evidence they have that ssbd conducted or attempted to conduct illegal financial transactions ? especially as conducting any transactions whatsoever was explicitly banned on the silk road forums, the only site ssbd had access to in any sort of administrative capacity. not surprisingly, dread pirate roberts wanted to keep all financial transactions on the marketplace, where he received a commission for each one19(d)\xc2\xa0 there are no substantial grounds for believing that there is an extradition objection in relation to the offence?extradition objections? (s.7) include:?(b)\xc2\xa0 the surrender of the person, in so far as it purports to be sought for the extradition offence, is actually sought for the purpose of prosecuting or punishing the person on account of his or her race, sex, sexual orientation, religion, nationality or political opinions ?; or(c)\xc2\xa0 on surrender to the extradition country in respect of the extradition offence, the person may be prejudiced at his or her trial, or punished, detained or restricted in his or her personal liberty, by reason of his or her race, sex, sexual orientation, religion, nationality or political opinions;?(my emphasis)this probably isn?t much of a legal argument, but in the real world, this whole extradition attempt smacks of politics. it?s all show so that politicians can trumpet a win on their long-doomed war on drugs. spending this sort of taxpayers? money to extradite a man who may or may not have been paid a paltry $50k a year to perform mundane administration tasks on what was purely a website for discussions? there is no suggestion that nash sold drugs himself. hell, there?s not even a suggestion that he bought drugs. just these trumped-up charges so conservatives can parade him in front of the media, claiming they?ve brought down some sort of evil drug cartel.according to the attorney-general?s department annual reports, most extradition requests are to return ex-pats, not australian citizens. they tend to be for fugitives that have escaped with hundreds of millions of fraudulently-obtained funds, or child sex predators of the most heinous kind.the united states requests extradition of two to four people from australia a year. should peter nash really be one of them', ['hacking tools'])

(823451, 118520, 'of course it was a scam. get real people, and wake up.after reading through all forum posts/news/comments of the mods and admins of sr2.0, there are too many fishy things and contradictions:1) blaming transaction malleability, and the admin clearly quote saying that it is a "recently discovered bug" is laughable. it wasnt "published last week" as he stated in his latest forum post, it was "published" looooong ago.2) just before this "heist", a thread named reality check was posted, stating that users should be thankful for all the positive security measures that had been made, and for all the effort the admin(s) put in the development of the website. also, another thread was being publicized, promoting that nobody should finalize early any transaction, which then resulted in more btc in escrow. also, nothing was done regarding the required ban of certain well-known scammers, and certain users reported negative btc balance on their account after depositing a substantial amount of btc to their sr wallet.3) the admin defcon claims hes been off internet for like a whole week, so he didnt know about the mtgox announcement and the ddos attacks. lets be clear here: he runs a black market, the last thing he would do is not be informed for a whole damn week. hed had to live under a rock to not hear about the recent mtgox scandal. and if he really didnt then hes not to be trusted with running any site, let alone sr2.4) long minutes/hours after the admin stated in the sr forum, that the site has been hacked and all coins were stolen, several transactions were still happening, which deducted funds from known vendor accounts. i repeat, after the post has been made. this is just written scam all over it.5) the admin claims he took all funds from the wallets to a single "hot storage wallet" to re-enable the auto-finalize option on the site. and he left it there for 3 days straight. i refuse to believe this level of stupidity from an admin who runs a site like sr. then he tried to explain it by typing that he was stressed out. sure.6)\xc2\xa0 the posts of certain mods have too many contradictions. one minute they say "im only a moderator here, we are only paid to run the forums, i have nothing to do with sr itself", the usual blablabla, and the next minute the same person on a different thread writes sentences like "we will open the market when" this and this will be finished. oh, so suddenly its a "we"? also, they claim they accidentally delete threads, i.e. the most important one recently, regarding the admins statement on the situation. sounds believable, right?7) the admin, defcon, who failed his community by being hacked (as he claims) has the audacity to warn people of security issues of other sites, suggesting people not to use other marketplaces he doesnt even know, because he fears for the safety of the customers funds. oh, the irony...8 ) i suspect that the forums mods also have other forum accounts, so they can publicly write positive opinions about themselves, sr2 and anybody who still believes in them. otherwise, i cannot explain mods and other users (allegedly female) in the black market giving each other "hugs" and "kisses" and things of that nature, while some people lost thousands of dollars in a few days. also, the admin has a bunch of dedicated groupies co-signing whatever he says, exchanging female like emotional comments like "i am deeply thankful for the hundreds of supportive messages ive received". this is a business, not a f*cking female high school.simply put, i cant believe this unprofessional manner to conduct business, run a website, and the obvious scam that this is. these people should not be trusted with anything related to any black market in the future. unfortunately the fact is, that they can pop up anywhere anytime under a different name and identity, and we probably wouldnt know a thing about it.', ['None'])

information is on how the dead/rainbow/origanal family handle lsd.when lsd crystal is bought it comes in little glass viles. its a dense crystal and a gram of it looks alot smaller than a gram of coke or flour(or other powder). ten grams can fit in a vile small enough to hold in your hand and clentch your fist and conceal.anyway as i said in my other thread [http://mycotopia.net...lotter-lsd.html when you first buy crystal from the family theirs 2 requirements. 1. you have to be taught how to lay it properly and be trusted to do so on your own. 2. you have to do a thumbprint. the family believes lsd crystal should only be handled by those with the proper energy or karma to do so. theres no better way to test somebodys faith of lsd than give them a thumbprint.originaly thumprints were given by taking the glass vile and puting your thumb overthe top of the vile and turning it and fliping it upside down real quick. this put a coating of crystal on your thumb which was pessed into the palm of the person ,leaving your crystal imbedded thumbrint in there palm(hence the term thumprint) where it would absorb(or they might lick it off.). this was your certification nowadays thumbprints are eaten. any time someone eats crystal its refered to as a print. this way was adopted because its more efficiant.as for the experiance itself. all revievers are experianced with lsd(at least they think so until there printed ) you feel it almost instantly. lsd crystal has an energy to it. having a jar of it my pocket is enough to alter my conciousness. as soon as it touches your skin or goes in your mouth you can feel it. alot of folks will throw up within minutes. this is an exorcism of sorts. like all the negative energy being cast out of your body. then you lay down and learn. as for the experiance i just couldnt do it justice to describe it. your never the same again.a thumprint doesnt open the door of perception it blows it off the hinges.you melt into eternety. you let go and die into the moment which is all. there is no you anymore only all. the intensity of this cant be described, but you realize as your sliping away that its familar.this is because it become quite clear this is exactlly what happens when you die. after an eternity you slowly start to come back in pieces. you feel reborn and a completely different person. you dont ever come completely down or back. this isnt a bad thing ,but its very scary at first.i wont try to describe it any more because i cant. also after your experianced with eating crystal its a little less tramatic. your first one is spent on the ground. after awhile i could eat crystal at shows and whatnot.i have only seen one print go bad and i described this in my other thread. the guy says its the most important event of his life and now lives happily so i guess it wasnt bad. his reaction at the time was.i think psychedelics are safer in large doses(im not talking about thumbprint sizes though) as far as bad trips go. they override your egos defenses in large enough doses. you cant think your having a bad trip because you cant think at all beacause there is no you. :dterrance mckenna and andrew weil md have said this also.it is hard to describe a thumbprint. human language cannot describe an experiance that is encompasses all of life. every cell of every creature or living thing that ever lived or will live is connected by the energy or light. when we die are body and our ego is gone. we become one with eternity or the light or god or whatever name you wish to call it. a thumbprint allows this to happen and rerturn to our physical body. my first print i layed down and quickly realized that this was my actual death. you watch the whole process unfold with complete awareness.i didnt cling to my body i just realized my life had passed. as i was spiraling up or out i saw my life evolve through the years i lived. the happiness, the sadness,the people i loved and the people i didnt. the joy that i gave and the pain that i caused. i saw the true nature of reality and why things were the way they were. as i got higher i saw the nature of reality on the cosmic scale and saw that the reason for our evolution was to experiance love. to love is to have experianced the finest of life. then came the moment were it was time to let go. as i did it came for me and i sobbed uncontrolabley for i realized that the light or energy we call god or creation was perfect. it was pure unconditional love.what else could god have been i realized. that glint of innocent perfection in a babys eye. the light was pure as the heart of jesus christ. i dissolved into it and died. since there was no me only the all ,i cannot remember the rest because there was no me to remember. after forever i slowly decended into my body.i spent days awake afterwards talking to myself. i vowed to god to spread lsd so others could see the light. i vowed to look at every person as the lord and treat them as such.i was reborn and continue to live by the values i learned. i became as active as i could spreading lsd. year after year in hotel rooms with a pyrex pan and watercolor paper. hoping excitedly that some of these hits will help guide my brothers and sisters back towards the light. lsd is a direct message from god. period. i dont think we get another chance. we can love each other or we can kill each other ,but it is up to us. as i always say in my threads as a reminder, my work with lsd ended years ago.as for eating and going to the bathroom. i dont think i ate for a week afterwards. as for going to the bathroom i hadnt eaten before hand at my guides advise so it wasnt a problem. i remember letting go as it got dark and coming back a lttle before sunrise. i was high for along time afterwards and as i said earlier you never fully return. i feel high all the time still and its been years.also i did many, many prints after that. i have eaten a lot of crystal but it was never like that first time.i must stress that i was in the company of very evolved and older people that made sure my experiances were optimal. these were kind old spirits that had been were i was going many years before and many times. they held me as a baby every inch of the way.you have heard of near death experiances right. a thumbprint is a beyond death experiance.i have a rich life now thats full of good fortune. a wonderful wife and 3 children who are completely wonderful. every day is complete joy. i couldnt ask for more, but i know it will end one day for good. i await this day with no fear ,but the knowlege that that most rewarding and enlightening experiance of life is death....ok ill tell you about the one that went bad.this finds me in oakland in the early 90s. between tours i would sit out in san francisco and keep things flowing. friends from the east coast would need shit so i would lay it and mail it or others would come out to get a lower price and i would lay it and send them on there way. well a real good friend came out to get 4 or 5 grams.with him he had a few people. i told him he could help me lay it and to have his friends hang out in the city till were done. he says this friend of his is ready to come with us. now i had talked to the guy before and knew he was connected to the rainbow family, but his energy seamed weird. trusting my friends judgement i said alright.so we decide to drive over to oakland to lay it in a hotel. we get to some sleazy hotel out by the freeway and get ready. now im a little edgy about this newbie watching, but as long as he stays out of the way its fine. so we get to work and it takes quite awhile to lay 5 grams of acid. thats 50 tenpack or 50,000 doses. were done and cleanin up and he say my friend is ready for a print. im like are you sure and he says i think so. i look at his friend and hes like just give it to me i can handle it. so i get out my jar of silver crystal and knock some out on the nightstand because my friend wants to take some with him to do in the mountains.well this fuckin dude sticks his finger right in my pile of crystal and then licks it. im like thats a pretty hefty dose there soldier. hes like ya whatever now what do we do. then i started to realize it was going to get weird. within 2 minutes hes saying man my fuckin stomach hurts that was poison. im like go in the bathroom your going to puke. he goes in there and and we hear him cussin and puking. meanwhile im askin my friend what the hell hes got us into. then the bathroom door opens and he comes out butt naked saying im gettin the fuck out of here.were like no man just chill your not going to be able to get far. we put him in the back bedroom and turn the lights out and figure thats best for him. i close the door and tell him if he needs me were there. i figure hes got some things to sort out with god. now this hotel is right on the freeway. in fact you can jump out the window onto it. were also on the second floor. well were sitting there and im making some phone calls telling people im going to be hung up for awhile and i hear cars on the freeway honking. we go back into the bedroom and hes halfway out the window, getting ready to jump onto the oakland freeway naked as the day he was born.we pull him back into the room and hes starting to realize hes dying.he thinks im causing him to die and im the devil. now shit gets ugly. hes screaming at us that hes dieing and trying to get out of the hotel. since i just layed 5 grams im high also as is my friend. we call some other friends to come over. were holding him down on the bed trying to cover his mouth. we have 50,000 doses of freshly layed lsd in the room and i dont need the cops coming. i take the pan and all the supplies i used to lay with and throw them out the window onto the freeway.my other friends get there and we tell the girls take the acid and get out of hear quick. this guys screaming at the top of his lungs that hes dying and i know the other hotel guests can here him. its got to be any minute that the oakland police show up. im telling him to let go ,dont fight it. he thinks im satan so hes not listening to anything i say. also as we have been wrestling him he has lost control of his bodily fluids. theres puke ,shit and piss all over. i cant imagine what the cops are going to think when they come in and see a couple hippies on some guy covered in puke and shit screaming im dying as we tell him its ok hell like it.after awhile he stops moving. he was sucked into eternity. he was gone. as he layed there motionless we cleaned him up. and my friend sang amazing grace over and over to him. after an hour passed i realized the cops hadnt came. i contribute this to 2 things. the protection of god and the fact we were in a nasty part of oakland and people mind there own buisness.my girl comes by and brings us clean shirts and pants. itake a shower and clean up as they watch him and then we take turns. my nerves are frazzled. im high and this guys bad trip has really wigged me out. me and my girl decide to go for a walk since my friends with him and hes not moving. we get out side and realize that going for a walk at 3 am in oakland isnt going to be good. she senses my tension and we go to the side of the hotel in some bushes were she layes me down and sets my mind at ease with that magic only a woman can perform.as dawn breaks hes coming around. talking incoherantly ,but i can see a sparkle in his eye. we all part ways and me and my girl head back to sf to get some sleep.a day or two later my friend calls and says there heading home and to come say goodbye. i get there and this guy comes up to me and gives me a big hug and says hes sorry. i tell him dont worry about it. he then tells me that he met god and was a different person now. this makes me happy.this man hasnt taken lsd since and lives in oregon and owns a organic farm.hes happy with a family and at peace.he says that night was the most important and best thing that ever happened to him. i see him at the oregon county fair every year and we always have a big hug.hes turned into somebody i really admire and love.after this incedent i became very carefull of who i printed.', ['hacking tools'])

(801703, 115349, 'clearnet warning:http://www.deepdotweb.com/2014/02/17/bitrated-bitcoin-arbitration-marketplace/i hope that i am not breaking any rules by posting this article but it had my interest peaked. the site or technique per se could compliment the garden well, since its a third party provider offering security for the customer without interfering or adding risk. all wed need would be a dedicated person to be the mediator. however i am more than comfortable trusting the vendors on this site with my coins, so i dont see an immediate need for it.what are your thoughts about it?since this is a clearnet article, i decided to do a copy paste below:one of the most needed things in the darknetmarket scene, is without a doubt, more multisig based services, few days ago we were introduced to some open source and 100% free solution for arbitration services in bitcoin transactions using multisigs, the service is called bitrated and it can be accessed here:service name:\xc2\xa0 bitrated service url: https://www.bitrated.com/it turned out that we are more or less familiar with the creator of this service and we pretty much know that they are reliable, so we decided doing a short interview with them and try to cover most of the frequently asked questions about this type of services with the hope it can be used to help reduced scamming, enjoy:how does it work? (2 way \xc2\x96 3 way)basically, multi-signature, when used for arbitration, works by creating a 2-of-3 multisig that the payment is deposited to. there are three parties involved \xc2\x96 the buyer, the seller and the arbitrator. two of those three have to cooperate in order to release the payment.to give a more tangible example, lets say bob wants to buy something from alice, and they both trust trent as an arbitrator that can mediate disputes. bob deposits his payment to a 2-of-3 multisig address with thepublic keys of bob, alice and trent. alice can verify the payment was made and that the payment is \xc2\x93locked\xc2\x94 in the multisig deposit, and ships the goods to bob.if bob got the goods and he\xc2\x92s satisfied, he and alice can be the 2-of-3 and release the payment from the multisig to alice\xc2\x92s bitcoin address. in case of dispute, they both contact trent and explain what happened. then, either bob+trent can sign a transaction that issues a refund to bob, or alice+trent can sign a transaction that moves the funds to alice.the process on the website itself looks like that:1. bob goes to the \xc2\x93new transaction\xc2\x94 page, enters the arbitrator (either a username of a registered arbitrator, or any public key) and the terms of the transaction (those are signed digitally by bob and alice, which later proves to trent they both agreed to it)2. bob starts the transaction, and gets a link to share with alice. when alice enters, she confirms the arbitrator/terms by clicking \xc2\x93i agree\xc2\x943. bob and alice now see the transaction page with the multisig address, and bob makes the payment.4. alice see the payment was received (by checking the multisig balance) and ships the product.5. at this point, bob or alice can create a transaction that releases the funds, and ask the other party to approve it. if they get into a dispute, they have a link they can share with trent, where he can be the 2nd party that approves transactions.how it can be used anonymously?bitrated does not require an account or even an email address from buyer/sellers. the only details users provide are the terms of the transaction, which aren\xc2\x92t uploaded to the server and only shared via the url the parties send to eachother.arbitrators can optionally sign up to have a public profile listed on the website, but they don\xc2\x92t have to. they can simply provide their public key to the buyer/seller and have them use it.i saw you mentioned in one of our previous mails it based *mostly* on client side, can you elaborate on this?bitrated was built with a very strong security/privacy model. almost everything happens client-side, with the server not being involved unless its 100% necessary. private keys are created and used client side, transactions are constructed and signed client-side and the transaction data, including the terms, is only saved as part of the url each party has and isn\xc2\x92t stored on the server at all.the server is only involved in order to enable communication between clients. its impossible to communicate between browsers directly, so a websocket server is used to send information between connected clients. the data that is sent via the server isn\xc2\x92t considered sensitive \xc2\x96 just the the public key of the party joining the transaction and the partially-signed transaction request. both of those are sent immediately to the other clients and discarded, with no permanent copy being saved. (in the future, we plan to encrypt that end-to-end too)elaborate on how you don\xc2\x92t touch the private keys and how it can be verified?private keys are created and used client-side, and are never transmitted to the server. each party gets a url with his own private key embedded in the hash portion of the url (after the \xc2\x93#\xc2\x94, which is not part of the httprequest).bitrated is an open-source software that can be audited by anyone. it can be independently verified that the client-side code never sends sensitive information to the server, and it can be verified that the source served bythe webserver matches the code on github.in the future, we plan to provide a browser extension that does this automatically and ensures that the code coming from bitrated.com matches the code published on github.is there a possibility for the arbitrator to collect some fee? fees are possible, but not currently handled specifically in bitrated. there are basically two fees structures that i see people using:fees for every transaction, which is the common model today. in this case, it should be paid as a separate transaction, before starting the multisig. the arbitrator should simply refuse to handle disputes where the fee wasn\xc2\x92t paid in advance.fees for disputed transactions only. because the arbitrator doesn\xc2\x92t have to do anything when there\xc2\x92s no dispute, some of them choose to only charge for disputes. in this case, it can be paid from the multisig balance, where the arbitrator will simply refuse to sign transactions without his fees. bitrated\xc2\x92s interface can be used to create a transaction sending some percentage of the balance as fees to the arbitrator, and the rest to the winning party.most people using tor markets trying to avoid using js, and your service is based on js, how can this work together?i would be very careful about running java and flash, but i think js is relatively safe to execute. most of the web doesn\xc2\x92t function properly without javascript, and its necessary for a service like bitrated thatrelies heavily on client-side technology. also, its open source and can be verified to not contain malicious code.who provides the arbitration?bitrated doesn\xc2\x92t provide the arbitration services themselves \xc2\x96 the goal is to create a marketplace for arbitration services. we allow arbitrators to signup and offer their services for a fee, and let users choose which arbitrator they want to use.why not make a n .onion domain for this service?.onion is good for websites that wants to conceal their identity. bitrated is operated in the open and has a known owner (my name and my company\xc2\x92s name is listed in the about page), so i don\xc2\x92t think it\xc2\x92ll achieve much.service name:\xc2\xa0 bitrated service url: https://www.bitrated.com/feel free to try it out and contact the service admin directly at nadav@bitrated.com if you have any issues, questions or suggestions for improvements.we have also added this solution to the list of hidden marketplaces as a related service', ['hacking tools'])

messages ive received. i am consistently blown away by how the core of this community come together in times of strife.. to the multitude of you who lost faith in silk road, i still am glad ive heard your words. i am still devastated that i have failed you. and even i have fallen victim to this attack\xc2\xa0 the majority of my personal earnings are completely gone. my life is not in danger though, and my identity is still protected\xc2\xa0 i\xc2\x92m thankful for this.so now, it\xc2\x92s time to share with you our plan to move forward.i realize you have no way of knowing whether im telling the truth, on anything. trying to communicate the authenticity of my true character on the darknet is difficult to say the least, and i do not expect any of you to take me at my word. but my actions over the next few weeks will speak louder than words ever could, and if you stick around you\xc2\x92ll realize this.silk road is not deadwe are here to stay, and for the most part, i believe our values are the same as yours\xc2\xa0 the community\xc2\x92s. and even though i represent the latest idiot to make a security mistake, i am unlike those who simply give in, and am determined to use lessons learned to fight for this communitys long term security. im focusing on multi-signature transactions as our only safe trading mechanism long term. additionally, i am ready and willing to collaborate with other darknet administrators and utilize our talented penetration testing team to help them to regularly audit their security.and although the tinfoil club will probably hate this and continue to tear me to shreds without regard for my actions in december, and whether you choose to believe them or not, here are the facts:1. i live a very busy and complicated life. i take opsec to extreme levels which consume many of my hours per day. any time you see me here, it means i have completed a checklist which requires over an hour of preparation for me to reposition and reconfigure many things to ensure i leave the most minimal trail possible and can "safely" connect to this place. this job will never be safe, and it is impossible to be perfectly covert. i know what i am facing, both from le and from vendors who do not share my opinions of non-violence.2. all released announcements were my true plans, and all delays were due to unanticipated external factors upon which i cannot elaborate. my staff has been very frustrated at my lack of ability to keep the dev team on time. again, this is completely my fault and something for which i take complete responsibility. i do not trust any developers, so i meticulously review anything the dev team sends to me. many have criticized me for this, and i listened to them. had i reviewed the code even more meticulously and delayed the fix to speed up slow withdrawals last month, transaction malleability would not have affected us at all. this is completely my fault for listening to critics instead of my own sense of caution.3. the public has known that auto-finalize has been disabled for a long time, and has known that the escrow balance is massive.4. any smart person could deduce that re-enabling of auto-finalize requires me to move a vast sum from cold storage to the hot storage wallet to ensure adequate fund availability (which admittedly was too large and one of my biggest failures this month). the attack was surgical and timed perfectly.the reason such a high quantity of coins was stolen was because we were preparing to implement auto-finalization and had therefore moved a huge volume from the cold storage to the hot storage to ensure the coins from all auto-finalized orders could be withdrawn without a hitch.here are as many details on the attack as i can provide. i am still investigating, and do not want to leak anything which could compromise any other markets. transparency in this issue is key, however, you deserve as granular an explanation as possible as to why this happened.sr2 attack investigation results as of feb 151. when withdrawal delays were happening last month, we wrote a custom bitcoin implementation using several available libraries a reference, and built it on a shared infrastructure to load balance across accounts and provide risk mitigation if ever one server was compromised.2. as this implementation was being written by behind-the-scenes dev staff, a lynch mob was getting exponentially worse in the forums. our moderator staff became more and more insistent that it was crucial to fix this problem immediately, relaying to me many concerns, and threats, from the community.3. we cut a corner, deciding to watch transactions. many community members were reporting missing withdrawals, weeks after sending them. we implemented a liberal check to the "refresh deposit balances" link on the account page - in essence, we allowed it to search deeply for any missing coins, rescanning and rescanning. one of our team members was familiar with mtgoxs procedures and source code and vouched for the idea. our thoughts were that if the largest bitcoin exchange was using this approach to find missing coins, it must be commonplace. (i received her/his permission to publish this.)4. the transaction malleability bug was published last week at a time when i was disconnected from the internet for an extended period for opsec reasons. i did not become aware of the threat until the attack was already occurring. this was a failure on my part to trust more staff with critical access to stop withdrawals. the people who did have access to disable withdrawals were terrified of doing it without my permission, due to how negatively the community reacts when withdrawals are turned off. they knew if they disabled withdrawals, then re-enabled them, there would be a run on the bank and i would need to be online to deposit cold storage into hot storage. in effect, this was my failure to emphasize to staff that it is always okay to lean on the side of caution and hit killswitches as they deem necessary. it was also my failure to communicate expectations to the community that sometimes killswitches will have to be hit, and it just means were playing it safe. this month it is clear we did not play it safe. killswitches are pointless if the only person confident enough to hit them is the boss.5. the attacker used an account first registered in early jan to try exploiting the vulnerability. looking back at the accounts history indicates that this account has been used to pentest many aspects of our system unsuccessfully. every previous attempt to find an attack vector failed, due to hardening done by our penetration testing team. i had previously seen these attempts in the logs as something to celebrate: "look, our hardening is working, this hacker would have won, but we put security over features!" - several people suggested disabling the hackers accounts, but that is pointless in our business as anyone can simply re-register.6. we are still unclear as to the exact approach used to cause our servers perception of transactions to mismatch with reality, because we have largely been focusing on preparing for relaunch and building communication to share with you, the community, over the past day. to the best of our understanding, the attacker deposited increasingly larger amounts of bitcoins, and withdrew them while flooding the blockchain with ddos of similar transactions. 7. our system reflected his withdrawals, and his account showed as zero.8. the attacker rapidly clicked "refresh deposits" link until our code assumed that the transaction failed (all indications point to malleability as the root case). our system re-credited his account with the x btc it judged "unsuccessfully" withdrawn. this, again, due to the liberal rescanning mechanisms added last month (see point 3).9. in reality, our servers perceived the transactions inaccurately and the btc were successfully withdrawn. as a result our system inaccurately represented the users balance as larger than it truly was. this allowed the attacker to withdraw coins again.10. the attacker began depositing larger amounts, such as 50 btc at a time, in order to exploit the vulnerability quickly.11. they then drained our entire hot storage in one bitcoin server shard, and tried the attack from one of their other accounts. the other account was on a different shard, and allowed that hot storage to be drained.12. the attacker continued using different accounts until virtually all of our hot storage shards were drained.due to the type of vulnerability, our accounting system had an inaccurate perception of bitcoins on hand and therefore did not trigger any alerts until real user withdrawals began failing unexpectedly. this was a failure on our part to build a new server alert to check each shard of the new shared bitcoin infrastructure, and another symptom of how rushed we were when implementing the new system during a forum lynch-mob about slow withdrawals.lessons learned so far:1.  more staff should have access to killswitches and should not be afraid to use them. even if its just because of some news post about on clearnet about some "transaction malleability" thing. killswitches should be used liberally and regularly.2. a community needs to be comfortable with regular downtime - especially during periods when community safety and the safety of its money could be threatened. a good staff will be responsibly paranoid and hitting killswitches as they deem necessary, and should not be afraid of their community panicking each time precaution is exercised.3. there\xc2\x92s more to web security than rigorous penetration testing. it also requires the constant review of external services, systems and infrastructures.4. never make assumptions when implementing protocols you did not design. had we not trusted mtgoxs staff procedures, we would have reviewed our approaches with much more rigor. just because a large companys procedures are successful does not make them are safe.5. accept that your community will hate you regardless. in the darknet, you will be crucified by your community if anything ever goes wrong. psychologically prepare for everyone to hate you, because you inevitably will fail at something, and you will need to stay determined no matter what. dont let it get to your head, and dont let it affect your rigor with security. we cut corners with our deposit/withdrawal speed optimizations because we were afraid of the lynch-mob. we were foolish in this regard. we should have taken the entire site offline for as long as it took to implement a high-volume fault-tolerant bitcoin server in a well-tested, rigorous manner. this cost us an unspeakable amount of trust that we had slaved to build, some of us for years.this is where were at, with as much transparency as this medium allows:the worst that could happen did not happen.the worst thing that could happen for our communitys finances, however, did.we hate that it occurred under our watch.there is nothing we can do to change this. all we can do is be transparent about where we are at, and move forward.to those who will respond here for dramatic effect, please consider contributing your energy to the reconstruction of our community. if you cannot bring yourself to do this, then please take your negativity elsewhere. this is simple. if you have lost faith in silk road, i dont blame you in the least. i also do not want to read about it in perpetuity.trolling is easy. trolling during a disaster is cowardice. choosing to strengthen rather than troll, when trolling is the popular move - thats noble. i know that i speak for all silk road staff, seen and unseen, when i speak these words: we are going nowhere. we will remain, rebuild, and move forward toward the greater goal for which we strive by our running of this marketplace: personal freedom and foundational human rights.silk road will always rise again.', ['None'])

into the investigation of data surrounding the attacks, and it there is absolutely zero evidence of any staff member being involved. we will publish more information as we determine its accuracy, thank you to all who have contributed tips on the attackers identities.after much self-reflection and deliberation with community members we value highly, it is clear that there is only one way forward.this leadership and this community will not stop until you are completely repaid.we know you feel defenseless right now. you are naked. many of you are convinced there is no logical reason any darknet admin would ever fight to get your coins back.i can stand here and reiterate that all i want to do is defend you, to steer this community towards incrementally safer operation. but my words are no comfort, and i understand that. you will never meet me. we are all anonymous.i gave a similar speech in december when we met our first impossible situation. you have no reason to trust my words. my actions will prove you wrong.here is the current plan. thank you to the dedicated vendors and buyers who helped draft this approach. this is not necessarily a final plan, we are open to suggestions on how to improve this and want your feedback.the plan for moving forward as of feb 151. this administration will not earn any commissions until everyone is completely paid back, and will be very transparent about the progress towards this goal.2. the marketplace will relaunch as no-escrow. we will not re-implement escrow unless it is multi-signature and decentralized to multiple escrow providers (trusted mediators with feedback just like vendors). never buy from a market which uses centralized escrow again. you will only get hurt no matter how honest the team is.3. all items will be priced at a flat 5% commission which will go directly into victims balances upon purchase.4. vendors who lost funds: commissions from your items will go directly into your wallet until you are completely repaid, then will be distributed to other vendors until they are repaid. vendor bonds are considered lost funds, and we also commit to paying these back.5. all vendors can opt-in to give a higher percentage back on their listings, and all buyers will be presented with a "donate" box on the shopping cart. vendors donation percentage will be publicly visible.6. we will launch the support system immediately. resubmit any open support requests you had which are still applicable. all previous messages will be ignored due to our inbound message volume. i have received over 1000 private messages over the past 24 hours, for example. this fresh start will allow us to stay on top of the support queue, rather than paying down a large debt incurred by previous administrators.7. we will still handle dispute resolution for existing escrow orders until all balances site-wide are in "pending balance" category. your stolen balances and escrows will display as "pending balance" and "pending escrow". yes, like christmas. i hoped to never have to take this approach again. all unshipped orders have been cancelled. to the vendors who have shipped orders despite no access to the portal: you are beautiful people. try to resolve with your buyer directly, and file a support ticket if you do not receive a refund to your pending escrow balance within a month.the plans above are subject to change as we consider your input.the statistics are humbling:26% of our monthly active users have lost their entire sr funds. that represents 47% of users who have purchased or sold items since launch.our inbound traffic has been growing at a rapid pace. the first ten days of february saw as many purchases as the entire month of january. by feb 13, we surpassed januarys total user registrations.we strongly believe that we can work together and make this right.silk road is not a name easily forgotten, and how we pull through this struggle will only solidify our name as the strongest community in the darknet.buyers and vendors: we are committed to getting everyone repaid even if it takes a year. do not forget to check your sr accounts frequently for balances repaid, and withdraw them when you see them.vendors:\xc2\xa0 you are welcomed and encouraged to vend on multiple markets. i only trust myself, and will not endorse any of them. but i have failed you. wherever you vend, may you prosper.buyers: do not purchase using centralized escrow. use markets which have implemented multi-signature, or only purchase with no-escrow (fe) from very trusted vendors. this is not an ideal climate, but it is the reality of the darknet today. i cannot emphasize strongly enough that every market which uses centralized escrow will fail. centralization makes a market a huge target for attackers, and a huge target for dishonest administrators.again, we welcome your feedback on this approach to moving forward, and will continue to refine it throughout the year based on sales data.i dont care how long it takes or how expensive it is, we will fight to get this community repaid.', ['None'])

for a hike, or go camping!!!)2. go for a swim!\xc2\xa0 ideally in a heated pool versus the ocean.\xc2\xa0 i have a feeling dark water would trip me out a bit.3. take a shower with your tripping partner in a completely dark shower.\xc2\xa0 (no light whatsoever)\xc2\xa0 it becomes like a sensory deprivation tank and is my favorite thing to do while tripping.\xc2\xa0 absolute darkness is the best, but a solitary blinking light can also be fun.\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa04. watch some live music at a concert or rave.5. try painting or finger-painting!\xc2\xa0 my second favorite thing to do on acid...the amount of color that comes from each brush stroke is beautiful and almost makes me cry.\xc2\xa0 never have you ever seen color like this.\xc2\xa0 painting becomes an emotional experience on acid and finger painting is tops because you get your sense of touch involved in the creativity.\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0i highly recommend it.6.\xc2\xa0 smoking hookah!\xc2\xa0 blowing smoke through soap bubbles or just blowing bubbles is fun.\xc2\xa0 when it pops, a little smoke comes out of the popped bubble and its unbelievably fun to watch.7.\xc2\xa0 massage and be massaged, or have your back scratched.\xc2\xa0 having your head massaged by one of those head massagers that looks like a metallic spider (they sell them in malls, like a ting-ting or something)8.\xc2\xa0 watching the winamp

search \xc2\x93bltc winamp presets\xc2\x94 and download the bltc preset package.\xc2\xa0 (it will make the visualizer even better!)9. eat some fruit or veg.!\xc2\xa0 theres something very primal and rewarding about biting into a strawberry or blueberry or peach while tripping.\xc2\xa0 green beans, and juicy things taste very good.\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0meats and cheeses usually don\xc2\x92t taste so good.10.\xc2\xa0 go paintballing on acid...i have yet to try this but i hear its crazy.\xc2\xa0 might be a little too crazy though.11.\xc2\xa0 mirror time!\xc2\xa0 go stare at yourself in the mirror, stare into your eyes in one of those super magnified mirrors...watching them dilate and constrict is nuts!12.\xc2\xa0 listen to music on expensive studio headphones.\xc2\xa0 sennheiser or bose or something that wraps around your entire ear.\xc2\xa0 trust me, this is how music was meant to be listened to.13.\xc2\xa0 have sexual intercourse (punch anyone in the face who says otherwise...theyre lying to you.\xc2\xa0 sex on ex or psychedelics is the best and is so worth it.)14.\xc2\xa0 writie on your partner or paint on your partner with paint or black-light paint.\xc2\xa0 15.\xc2\xa0 floating down a river in an inter-tube.16.\xc2\xa0 take a stroll on the beach barefoot.\xc2\xa0 watch the ocean waves crash or go play in the rain.17.\xc2\xa0 star gazing and looking at the stars using google sky maps app on your phone18.\xc2\xa0 smelling extreme smells, preferably good smells...candles, incense, coffee grinds, salt. etc.\xc2\xa0 this can be quite interesting if you\xc2\x92re on a high dose of lsd and synesthesia is happening.\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa019.\xc2\xa0 smoking weed obviously...blunts are my favorite method when tripping.\xc2\xa0 (*roll them before you trip)\xc2\xa0 roll one up and have your sober-sitter go through a drive thru car-wash while you hot-box the blunt. \xef\x81\x8a20. inhale some nitrous oxide\xc2\xa0 this can really can add some trippiness to a trip.\xc2\xa0 its likely horrible for you, but it is quite fun.\xc2\xa0 i\xc2\x92m told you can take a bong\xc2\x85pull a rip of weed, let it remain in the chamber while you take out the slider and put a balloon of nitrous where the weed was, then take the rip.\xc2\xa0 weed and nitrous at once, you drop at least 4 iq points in one sitting but its fun nonetheless.21.\xc2\xa0 buy the biggest glowsticks you can find online and throw them around with your tripping partners.22.\xc2\xa0 chew or suck on some ice and then make out with your partner or go down on them.\xc2\xa0 that\xc2\x92s great fun.23. go for a bi-cycle ride.\xc2\xa0 (this is how the first lsd experience ever went down.)24. go jump on a trampoline, or moon-bounce if you can find one.\xc2\xa0 (be cautious please)25. go to an amusement park and ride the rides (i dont recommend this to anyone except super experienced trippers.\xc2\xa0 waiting in line sucks, but ipods and earbuds help.)26.\xc2\xa0 go to a water park.\xc2\xa0 (i dont recommend this to anyone except super experienced trippers)26. get into a hot tub or bath tub with food coloring and drop drops into the water and watch the dye move through the water.\xc2\xa0 (this may stain your skin for a couple days if you put a lot of color in.)27. hook up a fog machine in your room and let that thing go off for a while.\xc2\xa0 trippy lights or a strobe will help this.\xc2\xa0 *fog is just cool as fuck while tripping, but be sure to unplug any fire alarms, as they will be set off.28.\xc2\xa0 ask a sober sitter to drive you around town for a little bit.\xc2\xa0 or get a taxi (do not drive while tripping, it never ends well)29. vicks inhalers are quite fun on ecstasy...not too sure about other psychedelics.\xc2\xa0 i remember blowing some in my

(thats what i get for tripping with people around for the first time in a long while) me and one friend had to talk this guy down for about a half hour.300 mics- your getting into heavy territory. still not considered by most to be a heavy dose, but thats only because they know where most people including themselves draw the line if they are experienced. its alot like 250 mics though.400 mics- most people would never take this much unless they knew the acid they have in their possesion and really wanted to get pretty far out there.this is why you dont see 200+ mic hits around.500 mics- pretty much where even some of the most experienced people draw the line. your vision is almost completely enveloped by fractal patterns, and if you were to stare at some pavement or something, it looks like you can see to the end of eternity. miles and miles of visual depth.700 mics- most people who talk of taking a ten strip usually dont have very potent acid(though it is good), so 550 to 700 is where they end up. this is also where "more acid" becomes less important because the effects are very similar to an even higher dose.1000 mics- most people will never go there. if you had a "two hits and you are floored" type of lsd, or 100 mics and up hits, this is where a ten strip would put you. you basically cant see anything but visuals, your mind as a whole is infinately connected with its self and your external environment. amazing things happen on this dose no matter what. it would scare most people shitless. some people will think they are dieing. many would end up dialing 911 if they were alone and could read the numbers on the phone.1500 mics- is almost exactly like 1700 mics. 1700 mics being the most i have ever done. very few people have used this much lsd.it is very psychologically dangerous for some people to do this. you can no longer really see your own hand in front of your face. your cognition and vision are both bathed in the same light. some people forget to breath frequently, and id imagine alot of people would pass out. you will loose your ego, but you will meet many organizers of human cognition in this egoless place. they are much smarter than human beings. "they" *are self conscious neurology.they are the mathematicians behind consciousness and even the visuals themselves.a dose 700 mics and above will show anyone some very profound things. doses like 500 mics and above have changed many lives in both positive and negative ways. still, it is no more threatening than mushrooms. so dont get me wrong.hope it helps, save trails my friends.', ['None'])

(813454, 116948, 'this guide was originally written as a harm reduction guide to mda, but the guidelines outlined here also apply to mdma. i hope that this information reaches you all and better informs you of how to approach mdxx use. protect your minds, my friends. it is the most valuable thing you possess. mda (methylenedioxyamphetamine) has been shown to have a neurotoxic effect on the 5-ht (serotonin) axons when abused. many users will state that mda is completely safe to use often, but this is a false preconception based on nothing more than anecdotal claims that have zero scientific backing. there have been hundreds of studies throughout the years that outline both mdas, and its methylated cousin mdmas, neurotoxicity, and not taking the time to value the information they have uncovered is altogether unwise.with this in mind, mda can be used safely with no backlash assuming a set of precautions are followed when using it.1) do not roll more than once a month at least, with emphasis on trying to allow 2-3 months between use.2) a safe dosing guideline for mda is typically 1.0-1.5mg/kg. for instance, if you weigh 80kg, your dosage will be between 80-120mg depending on desired intensity. 80mg will be a light and sociable dose and 120mg will be a much heavier dose.3) keep your body temperature low and stay hydrated! this is perhaps the most important guideline in preventing neurotoxicity. ensure above all else that you are not overexerting yourself.4) antioxidants such as alpha lipoic acid, vitamin c, vitamin e, green tea extract (egcg), and magnesium glycinate will heavily aid in alleviating neurotoxicity, protecting your brain, and improving your roll.a more explanation on each of these points...- moderation is absolutely pivotal when using mda. mda releases serotonin in vast amounts and inhibits the enzyme tryptophan hydroxalyse (tph), which is responsible for creating more serotonin. because this inhibition is permanent, the body must compensate by creating more tph, and this restoration period typically takes between 1-3 months depending on the users diet and exercise patterns. with this in mind, the healthier you are, the quicker the process is. exercise is phenomenal for speeding up this process as exercise stimulates a release of bdnf which encourages the growth of new serotonin axons. the bottom line is this: spread out your use. depending on your health and exercise habits, wait at least one month between use, with a strong emphasis on waiting a preferred 2-3 months.- dosing and redosing are also two very large components of mda neurotoxicity. the higher you dose, the more prone you are to mdas neurotoxic effects. a general guideline for safely dosing mda is 1.0-1.5mg/kg. for example, if you weigh 80kg, the optimal dosage for mda is between 80-120mg. whether you choose 80mg or 120mg depends on how intense you want the experience to be and is entirely dependant on your choice. subjectively speaking on the intensity of effects,, 80mg will be a light, sociable dose, 100mg a moderate dose, and 120mg a high dose. because many users will choose to dose higher in search of a more intense experience, i will offer two critical insights: mda is much more potent than mdma, so try to avoid dosing too high, and more importantly, do not redose! redosing is highly unwise, entirely pointless, and plays a huge role in neurotoxicity and will lead to a terrible comedown.for a better representation of why this is bad, let me put it into a rough and incredibly oversimplified analogy. think of your serotonin transport system (sert) as a dam. this dam moderates your serotonin levels by slowly releasing it to control everything from mood, appetite, sleep, heart rate, libido, and so forth. when you ingest mda, it essentially takes control of the floodgates of this dam, opens them up to full capacity, and releases all the serotonin available behind it. what happens when you release all of the serotonin behind this dam? you must wait a while for the levels to return to normal. opening the floodgates to a dam with no water behind it makes absolutely no sense, and this is essentially what redosing mda does. you will not roll harder or longer by taking more; instead, you are simply making your comedown exponentially worse and increasing mda induced neurotoxicity.- keep your body temperature low! do not overexert yourself when dancing as hyperthermia is the leading cause of mda induced neurotoxicity due to a rise in oxidative stress. when your body temperature rises, you bodys natural process for preventing oxidative stress (antioxidants) becomes less efficient. that lowering of efficiency is exponential. the higher your body temperature gets, the faster reactive oxygen species are created, which damage your brain. a fantastic way to keep your body temperature low is thc (yes, smoking marijuana helps mda neurotoxicity too!), ensuring you dance in moderation, and making sure that you stay properly hydrated. in that breath, do not over-hydrate. depending on the amount of physical activity you are undergoing, 16-24oz of water every hour is optimal for staying hydrated. also, did i mention to keep your body temperature low?- preloading and postloading are two staples for enriching the mda experience and almost entirely negating the potential for neurotoxic damage. not only do they alleviate neurotoxicity, but you will find your roll to be much more smooth and grant you with a beautiful afterglow instead of a hangover. here are a few essential supplements that are key to a proper regimen. if you are unable to purchase these supplements or take them as advised, i will recommend that green tea, orange juice, or emergen-c packets as they will lightly aide in providing antioxidants. however, these two should not be considered an all inclusive replacement. they come recommended on a "better than nothing" basis and pressure should be placed on picking up the appropriate supplements.* na-r-ala (alpha lipoic acid): this is a powerful antioxidant that eliminates free roaming reactive oxygen and nitrogen particles, in turn reducing neurotoxicity. dose 100mg of na-r-ala 30 minutes prior to rolling and 2 hours into the roll. ensure that you purchase the na-r-ala isomer form of ala. while racemic ala is okay, na-r-ala is much more efficient.* magnesium glycinate: magnesium is a phenomenal substance that will alleviate the bruxism (jaw clenching) and fasciculations (muscle twitches) commonly experienced when taking mda. dose 400mg elemental magnesium glycinate 6 hours prior to rolling, again 30 minutes prior, and finally 2 hours into the roll. be sure you purchase either magnesium glycinate (preferred) or magnesium citrate. the most common form, magnesium oxide, is not readily absorbed, so completely avoid it.* vitamin c: the most common antioxidant out there and has been shown to mitigate mda induced hepatotoxicity and neurotoxicity. dose 1,000mg of vitamin c 30 minutes prior to rolling.* vitamin e: a powerful antioxidant that will seek out free radicals. dose 400 iu 30 minutes prior to rolling.* green tea extract (egcg): egcg is a potent antioxidant and diuretic. it will help with the urinary retention arising from mda induced vasopressin release. dose 400mg 30 minutes prior, and 2 hours into the roll.* 5-htp: 5-htp is the direct precursor to serotonin. supplementing 100mg of 5-htp with 400mg of egcg (egcg will help 5-htp cross the blood-brain barrier more efficiently) at bedtime for 5-7 days after rolling will aid your body in restoring serotonin to their proper levels. warning: 5-htp can cause cardiac fibrosis when used in high doses over extended periods of time, so avoid taking 5-htp in high doses for more than 5-7 days.* melatonin: melatonin is created from serotonin, and since your serotonin levels will be low, taking a melatonin supplement will help you fall asleep. melatonin is also a powerful antioxidant. take 5-10mg of melatonin prior to falling asleep after rolling.in the end, the best advice that can be offered is to simply be smart. know your limits, follow common sense, and remember exactly why youre taking mda. cherish and value the experience; dont tarnish it by abusing it and harming your mind and body.sources (clearnet)* supplements:http://www.geronova.com/sites/default/files/alt_med_rev_2008_0.pdfhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/s1044576584710128http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15212815http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11931860http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14740000* neurotoxicity:http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7582557http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2457659http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1784586http://www.maps.org/publications/1987_stone_3.pdf', ['hacking tools'])
(813466, 116948, 'none of the above supplements have provided me with any stomach discomfort in my experience, but obviously all of our bodies are different and react to things differently. your best bet is to simply have a test run without mdma and see how you feel when taking the supplements. also, i typically eat a decently sized meal 2-3 hours prior to rolling and taking supplements with food in your belly always helps. i know most people like to fast before, but i like to get my nutrition in prior to launching. also, this guide obviously errs on the extreme side of caution and was written to be a helpful resource on what to take. this pre-load/post-load regimen is what i recommend for instances where you will be exerting yourself a lot (dancing at a festival in the heat, for instance) and need as much protection as possible. if you are going to be rolling at home on the couch under the a/c with easy access to cold water, you really probably only need one dose of ala, and vitamin c for antioxidant purposes, and magnesium glycinate for alleviating jaw discomfort. the big keys to mitigating neurotoxicity are to take a reasonable dose and to keep your body temperature low. if you can do that, youre off to a great start!', ['hacking tools'])

(819374, 117759, 'interesting post, thanks for sharing. as i read your post you are recommending storing a wallet backup inside a truecrypt container, then storing the truecrypt container on a secure offshore server. not a bad idea at all. if i may add some information for consideration, both the armory and electrum wallets support true offline cold storage of your private keys. both wallets allow you to split the wallet into an online watching only copy of the wallet while the wallet with your private keys is stored on an offline computer.\xc2\xa0 the online watching only wallet can receive bitcoin routinely, but if you want to send bitcoin you need to 1) create an unsigned transaction using the online wallet 2) using a usb drive take the unsigned transaction file to the offline wallet and sign it then 3) take the signed transaction file back to your online computer and broadcast it online. both armory and electrum allow you to export a digital backup of your offline wallet with your private keys. it is a simple matter to make a truecrypt container with a strong password in which to store your digital backup. since both armory and electrum are deterministic wallets only one backup is only needed, ever. then just find long term secure storage offshore and upload the truecrypt container and you are good to go. using this method of cold storage your bitcoin can not be stolen because your private keys are on your offline computer (which must be encrypted with fde) with a digital copy kept securely encrypted with truecrypt at the storage location of your choice. and you can still send and receive bitcoin using your online and offline computers.', ['hacking tools'])

can this be done?goblinbitcoin cold storage means keeping your wallets private keys on an offline computer. there is no more secure way to store your bitcoin, and bitcoin cold storage absolutely protects your bitcoin from loss, theft or seizure. online wallets like blockchain.info are convenient but should be considered your bitcoin checking account and used for only a few bitcoin, because online wallets can be hacked (remember instawallet?) for your bitcoin savings account you need maximum security and that means using a bitcoin client on your home computer, one that supports cold storage.which bitcoin wallets offer cold storage?only the armory and electrum bitcoin wallets allow you to split your wallet into an offline cold storage wallet which contains your private keys and an online watching only wallet that only contains your public keys. any hacker who is able to access your online wallet cannot steal your bitcoin, which are protected by your private keys in the offline wallet on a separate computer that never connects to the outside world.the online watching only wallet can give out receiving addresses and generate transactions. when you spend bitcoin from your online wallet the wallet generates an unsigned transaction file that you take to your offline computer on a usb key. you import the unsigned transaction into your offline wallet and sign with your private key, then take the signed transaction back to your online wallet and broadcast the signed transaction. because your offline wallet never connects to the internet your bitcoins are as secure as possible.armory and electrum are both deterministic wallets and only need to be backed up once. in a deterministic wallet all the bitcoin addresses your wallet will ever generate are derived from a long series of numbers or letters called a seed. as long as you have your seed backed up, you can recreate the wallet at will.hardware requirements for bitcoin cold storagearmorys online watching only wallet now runs on either 32 bit or 64 bit computer with 1-2 gb ram. you can download armory 0.90-beta at\xc2\xa0(https://bitcoinarmory.com/download/)the computer you use for your offline wallet does not need to be 64 bit. any computer made in the last ten years should work for your armory offline wallet. however, for maximum security your offline wallet should be used on a computer with full disk encryption to protect your private keys in case the computer is stolen.electrum is a lightweight bitcoin wallet and will run on any computer with no special requirements for memory. if the operating system on your offline computer does not offer full disk encryption consider replacing the os with a free linux distribution which does.\xc2\xa0 using linux for your offline wallet laptop also protects you from the risk of transmitting windows malware through the usb drive.recommendationsmake several small transactions with armory or electrum until you are comfortable signing transactions with your offline wallet. even delete your offline wallet and restore from backup to prove to yourself that your wallet can be recovered and your bitcoin are secure.armory guide to using offline (cold storage) wallets (https://wordpress.bitcoinarmory.com/about/using-our-wallet/#offlinewallet) \xe2\x80\x93 the gold standard for bitcoin wallets providing easy cold storage for everyoneelectrum offline (cold storage) wallets (https://electrum.org/tutorials.html#offline-mpk) - worthy lightweight runner up and available in a portable version that will run from a usb drivehope this helps!', ['None'])

(819394, 117763, 'since you are one of the only others working on p2sh, there is an interesting problem ive been working on that i havent found a good solution for.how can it be made easy to verify that the redeemscript that your p2sh address is made of when doing this sort of automated escrow system that a market would use doesnt have two public keys produced by the market (for the puprose of taking your coins). you could of course, message your vendor every single time before making your payment "i was given redeemscript [blah] is your public key in there?" i doubt vendors would be down with that solution. you could also require vendors to provide a signed copy of each public key they use, so you could verify that it was theirs. i dont think a market wants to store all those signed keys nor does a vendor want to go thru the burden of creating them all.the easiest solution for a vendor would be to have the vendor provide a public extended key from a bip32 wallet. the problem with this is of course it is now trivial to track payments to you on the blockchain, because you just look for every redeemscript presented with one of your keys in it. i will admit that im not too awesome at ecc... is there anyway to prove to a buyer that one of the addresses in the redeemscript is from the vendor without leaking any of the vendors info?', ['hacking tools'])
(819395, 117763, 'that doesnt really solve the problem that i was looking to fix. in order to assure that the redeemscript is authentic and hasnt been tampered, each party must communicate in advance of the payment with a seperate new signed message. in fact, it seems even less secure than tmps implementation because you ask the user to give up their private key during normal operations! why would the end user have to provide their key when blackbank should be able to sign the transaction and present to the vendor (or buyer, in the case of a refund) the partial signed transaction to complete? i can tell you that buyers have key management issues very, very often. also, if a malicious party ever gained control of the server, theyd be able to to take every order as it was finalized. i was hoping somebody with better skill at crypto than me would be able to figure out a way to present a proof that the key came from a set of keys the vendor produced without resorting to things such as storing signed hashes of keys or the like, or doing something like releasing an extended public key that could be used to trace transactions thru the blockchain.', ['hacking tools'])
(819397, 117763, 'quotethe key is only provided at the time an order is finalized.\xc2\xa0 the public/private key pairs should only be used once per transaction.\xc2\xa0 im sure if you look back up, signing a transaction for every purchase would be incredibly difficult for a buyer/vendor.why would it be difficult? what is inherently hard about signing a partial transaction? once i hand over my private key, i have no control over where the funds go. a malicious party in control of the server would be able to do whatever they wanted with the escrow funds at that time. that defeats the purpose of a 2 of 3 p2sh escrow system. the point of the system is that no matter how badly the market is compromised, the funds are safe. right now, tmps system is near perfect except for the fact that the user has to send a signed message to the vendor with the redeemscript used to create the p2sh address the payment was sent to, and if they dont communicate that information *in advance* of the payment, the buyer could lose money on the purchase. im looking for a way to solve this corner case without either a buyer being able to link payments together (like if you were to get a extended public key from an bip32 wallet) or without having to resort having to take extra action on each key produced by the vendor to guarrentee authenticity. quotehas anyone tried to sign a multi sig transaction with electrumman it was such a pain in the ass. i gave up in the end after a lot of waster time.got as far as putting in all the inputs it expects, such as prevhash_out etc and created the raw transaction.but on signing the raw transaction hash it always fails, even using all the required inputs as well as the transaction hex from following the python code.i am beginning to think the servers i am connecting to dont like it, and i dont have the resources to run my own electrum server. has anyone tried and got this to work?i am giving up and using the original bitcoind, but wanted to write a plugin which would make it easy for a newbie to run it in electrumthats why i wrote a patch to electrum to fix it so that it works with the same information that bitcoind uses, two months ago. that patch is the basis of the tmp electrum plugin.', ['hacking tools'])

(as of 4/2/14, i am shipping only dmt internationally. this is subject to change at any time.)3. i package orders one time per day at around 1pm pst. if you do not get your order in by then, it will be shipped the next day.4. use a name associated with the address!!! this is the number one most common reason for mail not reaching a residence.5. do not ship to an abandoned business or house. they do not deliver to a location in which they know has no apparent residence.addresses should look like this:firstname lastname12345 jackson circle apt. 14nowhere, ny 12345if your address does not look like this, i will not ship until i have a correct address! i will not be held responsible for your mistakes.-----------escrow and refunds-----------i no longer work in escrow. all orders must be finalized early before i will ship. i only offer tracking on my products. if something goes wrong with your order and it appears that it is my fault, you will get a full refund or reship (there will only be a 50% refund/reship for the buds). i do not offer reships or refunds for international orders. i also will not help you if you come to me over a month after shipping your product. i do not keep shipping info for longer than one month for security measures.-----------ways to smoke dmt-----------1. the best way (and my personal favorite) is through a volcano vaporizer.2. the most popular way of doing it is the sandwich method. this is where you pack a layer of ash (cigarette ash will work but weed ash is the best) in the bottom of the bowl, sprinkle about 30-35mg of dmt per person on top of that ash, then pack another layer of ash on top of the dmt. the reason for this is because dmt degrades when hit with direct heat. it needs to be vaporized.3. build a dmt smoking machine. this is the internets favorite method because it is almost as effective as a volcano and can be built very cheap. you can google around on how to make these, there are many different kinds.tips for smoking dmt:1. do not drink. this will essentially kill or heavily deteriorate your trip.2. do not take benzos. this will also essentially kill or heavily deteriorate your trip.3. do not smoke out of a light bulb. the glass is too thin and burns most of your dmt.4. i love to smoke cannabis but i find that i never remember much if i am stoned when i do my dmt. so if you want to remember your trip very well, try to do it without cannabis (even though it does seem to make the trip better).', ['None'])

its entirety:hash: sha512i am sweating as i write this.christmas brought grave news. i cannot adequately express how deeply honored i was by your unconditional support of my staff.i do not expect the same reaction to todays revelations. this movement is built on integrity, and i feel obligated to be forthright with you.i held myself to a high standard as your leader, yet now i must utter words all too familiar to this scarred community:we have been hacked.nobody is in danger, no information has been leaked, and server access was never obtained by the attacker.our initial investigations indicate that a vendor exploited a recently discovered vulnerability in the bitcoin protocol known as "transaction malleability" to repeatedly withdraw coins from our system until it was completely empty.despite our hardening and pentesting procedures, this attack vector was outside of penetration testing scope due to being rooted in the bitcoin protocol itself.this attack hit us at the worst possible time. we were planning on re-launching the new auto-finalize and dispute center this past weekend, and our projections of order finalization volume indicated that we would need the communitys full balance in hot storage.in retrospect this was incredibly foolish, and i take full responsibility for this decision.i have failed you as a leader, and am completely devastated by todays discoveries. i should have taken mtgox and bitstamps lead and disabled withdrawals as soon as the malleability issue was reported. i was slow to respond and too skeptical of the possible issue at hand. it is a crushing blow. i cannot find the words to express how deeply i want this movement to be safe from the very threats i just watched materialize during my watch.ive included transaction logs at the bottom of this message. review the vendors dishonest actions and use whatever means you deem necessary to bring this person to justice. more details will emerge as we continue to investigate.given the right flavor of influence from our community, we can only hope that he will decide to return the coins with integrity as opposed to hiding like a coward.it takes the integrity of all of us to push this movement forward. whoever you are, you still have a chance to act in the interest of helping this community. keep a percentage, return the rest. dont walk away with your fellow freedom fighters coins. dpr2 returned the cold storage. i didnt run with the gold. but two people alone cannot move us forward. it takes an entire community committing to integrity - and though this crushing blow will not stop us, it sure is a testament to how greedy some bastards truly are.being a part of this movement might be the most defining thing you do with your entire life.dont trade that for greed, comrades.i will fight here by your side, even the greedy bastards amongst us.this community has suffered great financial loss over and over again, and i am devastated that it has happened again under my watch.hindsight is already suggesting dozens of ways this could have been prevented, but we must march onward.the only way to reverse a communitys greed is through generosity. our true character is revealed during trying times.if this financial hardship places you at risk of physical harm, contact me directly and i will do my best to help you with my remaining personal funds.-

implement multi-signature transactions and lobby for mainstream bitcoin client multi-sig support.4. all unshipped orders have been cancelled.5. vendors may link to other marketplaces on a trail basis until we launch multi-sig, then we will re-evaluate based on community input. we do not want to be a centralized point of failure, but we also do not want to lead our buyers into dangerous waters.6. from this point forward do not trust markets with centralized escrow. use multi-signature transactions whenever possible, with trusted third parties as escrow providers.everything will be offline for 24-48 hours to minimize variables as we continue to investigate. the evidence we have below will be expanded based on our findings.- ------------------no marketplace is perfect. expect any centralized market to fail at some point. this is precisely why we must unite in the decision to decentralize.we are relieved that our security procedures protected user identities, and that no servers were compromised. this was not a worst-case scenario: nobody will be getting arrested from this. financial loss is terrible, but will not put all of us behind bars.the details we have on the hacker are

the same reaction to todays revelations. this movement is built on integrity, and i feel obligated to be forthright with you.i held myself to a high standard as your leader, yet now i must utter words all too familiar to this scarred community:we have been hacked.nobody is in danger, no information has been leaked, and server access was never obtained by the attacker.our initial investigations indicate that a vendor exploited a recently discovered vulnerability in the bitcoin protocol known as "transaction malleability" to repeatedly withdraw coins from our system until it was completely empty.despite our hardening and pentesting procedures, this attack vector was outside of penetration testing scope due to being rooted in the bitcoin protocol itself.this attack hit us at the worst possible time. we were planning on re-launching the new auto-finalize and dispute center this past weekend, and our projections of order finalization volume indicated that we would need the communitys full balance in hot storage.in retrospect this was incredibly foolish, and i take full responsibility for this decision.i have failed you as a leader, and am completely devastated by todays discoveries. i should have taken mtgox and bitstamps lead and disabled withdrawals as soon as the malleability issue was reported. i was slow to respond and too skeptical of the possible issue at hand. it is a crushing blow. i cannot find the words to express how deeply i want this movement to be safe from the very threats i just watched materialize during my watch.ive included transaction logs at the bottom of this message. review the vendors dishonest actions and use whatever means you deem necessary to bring this person to justice. more details will emerge as we continue to investigate.given the right flavor of influence from our community, we can only hope that he will decide to return the coins with integrity as opposed to hiding like a coward.it takes the integrity of all of us to push this movement forward. whoever you are, you still have a chance to act in the interest of helping this community. keep a percentage, return the rest. dont walk away with your fellow freedom fighters coins. dpr2 returned the cold storage. i didnt run with the gold. but two people alone cannot move us forward. it takes an entire community committing to integrity - and though this crushing blow will not stop us, it sure is a testament to how greedy some bastards truly are.being a part of this movement might be the most defining thing you do with your entire life.dont trade that for greed, comrades.i will fight here by your side, even the greedy bastards amongst us.this community has suffered great financial loss over and over again, and i am devastated that it has happened again under my watch.hindsight is already suggesting dozens of ways this could have been prevented, but we must march onward.the only way to reverse a communitys greed is through generosity. our true character is revealed during trying times.if this financial hardship places you at risk of physical harm, contact me directly and i will do my best to help you with my remaining personal funds.- ----------------now what.- ----------------never again store your escrow bitcoins on a server.silk road will never again be a centralized escrow storage.this week has shown the collateral damage we can cause by being a huge target and failing in just one unforeseen area.i am now fully convinced that no hosted escrow service is safe.if i cannot trust myself to keep a hosted escrow solution safe, i cannot trust anyone.multi-signature transactions are the only way this community will be protected long-term.i am aggressively tasking our devs on building out multi-sig support for commonly-used bitcoin clients. expect a generous bounty if you have the skill to implement this.- -----------------until then.- -----------------1. we will never again allow ourselves to be a single point of failure. we will never again host your escrow wallets.2. vendor registration is closed while we regroup.3. all listings on silk road are now no-escrow (finalize-early) for 1-2 months while we implement multi-signature transactions and lobby for mainstream bitcoin client multi-sig support.4. all unshipped orders have been cancelled.5. vendors may link to other marketplaces on a trail basis until we launch multi-sig, then we will re-evaluate based on community input. we do not want to be a centralized point of failure, but we also do not want to lead our buyers into dangerous waters.6. from this point forward do not trust markets with centralized escrow. use multi-signature transactions whenever possible, with trusted third parties as escrow providers.everything will be offline for 24-48 hours to minimize variables as we continue to investigate. the evidence we have below will be expanded based on our findings.- ------------------no marketplace is perfect. expect any centralized market to fail at some point. this is precisely why we must unite in the decision to decentralize.we are relieved that our security procedures protected user identities, and that no servers were compromised. this was not a worst-case scenario: nobody will be getting arrested from this. financial loss is terrible, but will not put all of us behind bars.the details we have on the hacker are

adequately express how deeply honored i was by your unconditional support of my staff.i do not expect the same reaction to todays revelations. this movement is built on integrity, and i feel obligated to be forthright with you.i held myself to a high standard as your leader, yet now i must utter words all too familiar to this scarred community:we have been hacked.nobody is in danger, no information has been leaked, and server access was never obtained by the attacker.our initial investigations indicate that a vendor exploited a recently discovered vulnerability in the bitcoin protocol known as "transaction malleability" to repeatedly withdraw coins from our system until it was completely empty.despite our hardening and pentesting procedures, this attack vector was outside of penetration testing scope due to being rooted in the bitcoin protocol itself.this attack hit us at the worst possible time. we were planning on re-launching the new auto-finalize and dispute center this past weekend, and our projections of order finalization volume indicated that we would need the communitys full balance in hot storage.in retrospect this was incredibly foolish, and i take full responsibility for this decision.i have failed you as a leader, and am completely devastated by todays discoveries. i should have taken mtgox and bitstamps lead and disabled withdrawals as soon as the malleability issue was reported. i was slow to respond and too skeptical of the possible issue at hand. it is a crushing blow. i cannot find the words to express how deeply i want this movement to be safe from the very threats i just watched materialize during my watch.ive included transaction logs at the bottom of this message. review the vendors dishonest actions and use whatever means you deem necessary to bring this person to justice. more details will emerge as we continue to investigate.given the right flavor of influence from our community, we can only hope that he will decide to return the coins with integrity as opposed to hiding like a coward.it takes the integrity of all of us to push this movement forward. whoever you are, you still have a chance to act in the interest of helping this community. keep a percentage, return the rest. dont walk away with your fellow freedom fighters coins. dpr2 returned the cold storage. i didnt run with the gold. but two people alone cannot move us forward. it takes an entire community committing to integrity - and though this crushing blow will not stop us, it sure is a testament to how greedy some bastards truly are.being a part of this movement might be the most defining thing you do with your entire life.dont trade that for greed, comrades.i will fight here by your side, even the greedy bastards amongst us.this community has suffered great financial loss over and over again, and i am devastated that it has happened again under my watch.hindsight is already suggesting dozens of ways this could have been prevented, but we must march onward.the only way to reverse a communitys greed is through generosity. our true character is revealed during trying times.if this financial hardship places you at risk of physical harm, contact me directly and i will do my best to help you with my remaining personal funds.- ----------------now what.- ----------------never again store your escrow bitcoins on a server.silk road will never again be a centralized escrow storage.this week has shown the collateral damage we can cause by being a huge target and failing in just one unforeseen area.i am now fully convinced that no hosted escrow service is safe.if i cannot trust myself to keep a hosted escrow solution safe, i cannot trust anyone.multi-signature transactions are the only way this community will be protected long-term.i am aggressively tasking our devs on building out multi-sig support for commonly-used bitcoin clients. expect a generous bounty if you have the skill to implement this.- -----------------until then.- -----------------1. we will never again allow ourselves to be a single point of failure. we will never again host your escrow wallets.2. vendor registration is closed while we regroup.3. all listings on silk road are now no-escrow (finalize-early) for 1-2 months while we implement multi-signature transactions and lobby for mainstream bitcoin client multi-sig support.4. all unshipped orders have been cancelled.5. vendors may link to other marketplaces on a trail basis until we launch multi-sig, then we will re-evaluate based on community input. we do not want to be a centralized point of failure, but we also do not want to lead our buyers into dangerous waters.6. from this point forward do not trust markets with centralized escrow. use multi-signature transactions whenever possible, with trusted third parties as escrow providers.everything will be offline for 24-48 hours to minimize variables as we continue to investigate. the evidence we have below will be expanded based on our findings.- ------------------no marketplace is perfect. expect any centralized market to fail at some point. this is precisely why we must unite in the decision to decentralize.we are relieved that our security procedures protected user identities, and that no servers were compromised. this was not a worst-case scenario: nobody will be getting arrested from this. financial loss is terrible, but will not put all of us behind bars.the details we have on the hacker are below. stop at nothing to bring this person to your own definition of justice.humbled and

silk road?s ssbdby all things vicessbd had no role to play in the silk road marketplace where drugs were bought and sold.\xc2\xa0 he was a moderator of the silk road discussion forum, which had its own url and was hosted on a different server to the marketplace. so why is the us so determined to extradite someone who may or may not be him?peter philip nash has been sitting in a brisbane jail cell since 20 december 2013.he is facing extradition to the united states to face allegations of narcotics conspiracy (maximum sentence of life in prison and a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years); conspiracy to commit computer hacking (maximum 5 years) and money laundering conspiracy, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.scales-of-injusticeaccording to the us indictment, nash was known online as ?samesamebutdifferent?, better known to silk road members as ssbd. ssbd was a well-loved moderator of the now defunct silk road discussion forums (new forums, colloquially known as sr2, have replaced the old). his job was to answer questions, explain the rules, move posts to their proper forum (with over a million posts, many were bound to wind up in the wrong place) and generally attend to banal administrative tasks.in any event, nash may or may not be ssbd.\xc2\xa0 but even if he is. what exactly was ssbd?s crime?all i have to go on is the indictment. i don?t know what other information the authorities have, but if all they have is what is in the indictment, it would be a travesty if australia was to agree to deport him.ssbd had no role to play in the silk road marketplace where drugs were bought and sold.\xc2\xa0 he was a moderator of the silk road discussion forum, which had its own url and was hosted on a different server to the marketplace. his job was confined to that site.two others who were arrested concurrently ? andrew jones (aka inigo) and gary davis (libertas) ? were immediately released on bail under the laws of the usa and ireland respectively. according to the indictment, inigo and libertas did have roles on the marketplace as well as the forums. the indictment differentiates the two where it says:?inigo?? worked as a site administrator on silk road?libertas? ?? worked as a site administrator on silk road?samesamebutdifferent?? worked as the primary moderator on the silk road discussion forums (my emphasis)nash was not granted bail because under the australian extradition act 1988, ?a magistrate or eligible federal circuit court judge shall not remand a person on bail under this section unless there are special circumstances justifying such remand?. it seems nash could not fulfil the ?special circumstances? requirement.next wednesday, nash is due back in court for a magistrate to determine whether he is ?eligible for surrender? to the us. if so, nash will be remanded in custody until the next phase of the proceedings ? surrender or review (or he can consent to extradition).under s.19 of the act, he will be eligible for surrender to us authorities if the magistrate is satisfied:(a)\xc2\xa0 the supporting documents in relation to the offence have been produced to the magistrate or judge;(b)\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0any additional requirements imposed by the us-australia extradition treaty are satisfied(c)\xc2\xa0 the conduct would have constituted an extradition offence if it had occurred in australia, and(d)\xc2\xa0 there are no substantial grounds for believing that there is an extradition objection in relation to the offencenow, a disclaimer. although i was a lawyer in my deep dark past, i have zero experience with either crime or extradition law. so i don?t know any more than anyone else. these are simply my uninformed opinions after looking at the act and extradition treaty, and knowing from two years of investigating silk road what ssbd?s role consisted of.19(b) ? any additional requirements imposed by the us-australia extradition treaty are satisfiedarticle vi of the treaty says: ?extradition shall be granted only if the evidence is found sufficient, according to the laws in the territory where the person whose extradition is requested is found, either to justify his trial or committal for trial if the offence with which he is charged or its equivalent had been committed in that territory?like i said, i don?t know what evidence they have, so i can only go on the indictment. it seems to me ?evidence? is pretty lacking in that document.first, i have no idea what evidence the us authorities have that nash is ssbd. they may have found some correspondence on the silk road servers between he and the site?s owner, dread pirate roberts. or perhaps ross ulbricht, the man accused of being dread pirate roberts, provided his details in an attempt at a plea bargain. ulbricht, it should be noted, has denied being dpr, and has denied all charges, so this seems unlikely. the indictment claims ssbd was paid around $50,000 per year. this presumably was paid in bitcoin. it is possible, though again unlikely, that the bitcoin trail was followed to nash?s bank account.most likely, the ?evidence? is an email from an anonymous email account or a message through an anonymous private claiming that ssbd?s real name is peter nash. not too compelling.this requirement for evidence is also relevant to the next two stipulations.19(c) ? the conduct would have constituted an extradition offence if it had occurred in australiathe wording says ?conduct? not ?crimes of which the person is accused?. the only conduct i could find attributed to ssbd in the indictment was:(1)\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0in relation to the narcotics charge: sent a message to dread pirate roberts, owner of silk road, summarising the actions he had taken during the previous week in his capacity as the primary forum moderator on the silk road discussion forums.-\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 i doubt that sending a message from one anonymous online account to another anonymous online account constitutes an extradition offence-\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 the narcotics charge is the only charge to have any ?overt acts? (which sounds similar to ?conduct? to me) listed underneath the charges attributable to ssbd(2)\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0in relation to the hacking charge: intentionally accessed computers without authorisation for commercial advantage and private financial gain, and in furtherance of criminal and tortious acts-\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 no ?overt acts? were listed under this charge; the above was a general accusation aimed at all three defendants; this does not sound like it could be considered ?conduct of the person constituting the offence,? which is what the act requires-\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 i would be interested to see what evidence they have that ssbd accessed computers without authorisation. there would certainly be no need to do so in order to carry out his functions of moderating a discussion forum. he would have carried out his duties on his own computer, logging in to the silk road administration panel (at least the small part he had access to), completely authorised to do so.(3)\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0in relation to the money laundering charge: conduct and attempt to conduct such financial transactions which in fact involved the proceeds of specified unlawful activity, to wit, narcotics trafficking and computer hacking-\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 no ?overt acts? were listed under this charge; the above was a general accusation aimed at all three defendants; this does not sound like it could be considered ?conduct of the person constituting the offence,? which is what the act requires-\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 again, i would be interested to see what evidence they have that ssbd conducted or attempted to conduct illegal financial transactions ? especially as conducting any transactions whatsoever was explicitly banned on the silk road forums, the only site ssbd had access to in any sort of administrative capacity. not surprisingly, dread pirate roberts wanted to keep all financial transactions on the marketplace, where he received a commission for each one19(d)\xc2\xa0 there are no substantial grounds for believing that there is an extradition objection in relation to the offence?extradition objections? (s.7) include:?(b)\xc2\xa0 the surrender of the person, in so far as it purports to be sought for the extradition offence, is actually sought for the purpose of prosecuting or punishing the person on account of his or her race, sex, sexual orientation, religion, nationality or political opinions ?; or(c)\xc2\xa0 on surrender to the extradition country in respect of the extradition offence, the person may be prejudiced at his or her trial, or punished, detained or restricted in his or her personal liberty, by reason of his or her race, sex, sexual orientation, religion, nationality or political opinions;?(my emphasis)this probably isn?t much of a legal argument, but in the real world, this whole extradition attempt smacks of politics. it?s all show so that politicians can trumpet a win on their long-doomed war on drugs. spending this sort of taxpayers? money to extradite a man who may or may not have been paid a paltry $50k a year to perform mundane administration tasks on what was purely a website for discussions? there is no suggestion that nash sold drugs himself. hell, there?s not even a suggestion that he bought drugs. just these trumped-up charges so conservatives can parade him in front of the media, claiming they?ve brought down some sort of evil drug cartel.according to the attorney-general?s department annual reports, most extradition requests are to return ex-pats, not australian citizens. they tend to be for fugitives that have escaped with hundreds of millions of fraudulently-obtained funds, or child sex predators of the most heinous kind.the united states requests extradition of two to four people from australia a year. should peter nash really be one of them', ['None'])

(75728, 16760, 'cleannet?? https://www.simonsfoundation.org/quanta/20130917-a-jewel-at-the-heart-of-quantum-physics/physicists have discovered a jewel-like geometric object that dramatically simplifies calculations of particle interactions and challenges the notion that space and time are fundamental components of reality.\xc2\x93this is completely new and very much simpler than anything that has been done before,\xc2\x94 said andrew hodges, a mathematical physicist at oxford university who has been following the work.the revelation that particle interactions, the most basic events in nature, may be consequences of geometry significantly advances a decades-long effort to reformulate quantum field theory, the body of laws describing elementary particles and their interactions. interactions that were previously calculated with mathematical formulas thousands of terms long can now be described by computing the volume of the corresponding jewel-like \xc2\x93amplituhedron,\xc2\x94 which yields an equivalent one-term expression.\xc2\x93the degree of efficiency is mind-boggling,\xc2\x94 said jacob bourjaily, a theoretical physicist at harvard university and one of the researchers who developed the new idea. \xc2\x93you can easily do, on paper, computations that were infeasible even with a computer before.\xc2\x94the new geometric version of quantum field theory could also facilitate the search for a theory of quantum gravity that would seamlessly connect the large- and small-scale pictures of the universe. attempts thus far to incorporate gravity into the laws of physics at the quantum scale have run up against nonsensical infinities and deep paradoxes. the amplituhedron, or a similar geometric object, could help by removing two deeply rooted principles of physics: locality and unitarity.\xc2\x93both are hard-wired in the usual way we think about things,\xc2\x94 said nima arkani-hamed, a professor of physics at the institute for advanced study in princeton, n.j., and the lead author of the new work, which he is presenting in talks and in a forthcoming paper. \xc2\x93both are suspect.\xc2\x94locality is the notion that particles can interact only from adjoining positions in space and time. and unitarity holds that the probabilities of all possible outcomes of a quantum mechanical interaction must add up to one. the concepts are the central pillars of quantum field theory in its original form, but in certain situations involving gravity, both break down, suggesting neither is a fundamental aspect of nature.in keeping with this idea, the new geometric approach to particle interactions removes locality and unitarity from its starting assumptions. the amplituhedron is not built out of space-time and probabilities; these properties merely arise as consequences of the jewel\xc2\x92s geometry. the usual picture of space and time, and particles moving around in them, is a construct.\xc2\x93it\xc2\x92s a better formulation that makes you think about everything in a completely different way,\xc2\x94 said david skinner, a theoretical physicist at cambridge university.the amplituhedron itself does not describe gravity. but arkani-hamed and his collaborators think there might be a related geometric object that does. its properties would make it clear why particles appear to exist, and why they appear to move in three dimensions of space and to change over time.because \xc2\x93we know that ultimately, we need to find a theory that doesn\xc2\x92t have\xc2\x94 unitarity and locality, bourjaily said, \xc2\x93it\xc2\x92s a starting point to ultimately describing a quantum theory of gravity.\xc2\x94clunky machinerythe amplituhedron looks like an intricate, multifaceted jewel in higher dimensions. encoded in its volume are the most basic features of reality that can be calculated, \xc2\x93scattering amplitudes,\xc2\x94 which represent the likelihood that a certain set of particles will turn into certain other particles upon colliding. these numbers are what particle physicists calculate and test to high precision at particle accelerators like the large hadron collider in switzerland.the iconic 20th century physicist richard feynman invented a method for calculating probabilities of particle interactions using depictions of all the different ways an interaction could occur. examples of \xc2\x93feynman diagrams\xc2\x94 were included on a 2005 postage stamp honoring feynman.united states postal servicethe iconic 20th century physicist richard feynman invented a method for calculating probabilities of particle interactions using depictions of all the different ways an interaction could occur. examples of \xc2\x93feynman diagrams\xc2\x94 were included on a 2005 postage stamp honoring feynman.the 60-year-old method for calculating scattering amplitudes \xc2\x97 a major innovation at the time \xc2\x97 was pioneered by the nobel prize-winning physicist richard feynman. he sketched line drawings of all the ways a scattering process could occur and then summed the likelihoods of the different drawings. the simplest feynman diagrams look like trees: the particles involved in a collision come together like roots, and the particles that result shoot out like branches. more complicated diagrams have loops, where colliding particles turn into unobservable \xc2\x93virtual particles\xc2\x94 that interact with each other before branching out as real final products. there are diagrams with one loop, two loops, three loops and so on \xc2\x97 increasingly baroque iterations of the scattering process that contribute progressively less to its total amplitude. virtual particles are never observed in nature, but they were considered mathematically necessary for unitarity \xc2\x97 the requirement that probabilities sum to one.\xc2\x93the number of feynman diagrams is so explosively large that even computations of really simple processes weren\xc2\x92t done until the age of computers,\xc2\x94 bourjaily said. a seemingly simple event, such as two subatomic particles called gluons colliding to produce four less energetic gluons (which happens billions of times a second during collisions at the large hadron collider), involves 220 diagrams, which collectively contribute thousands of terms to the calculation of the scattering amplitude.in 1986, it became apparent that feynman\xc2\x92s apparatus was a rube goldberg machine.to prepare for the construction of the superconducting super collider in texas (a project that was later canceled), theorists wanted to calculate the scattering amplitudes of known particle interactions to establish a background against which interesting or exotic signals would stand out. but even 2-gluon to 4-gluon processes were so complex, a group of physicists had written two years earlier, \xc2\x93that they may not be evaluated in the foreseeable future.\xc2\x94stephen parke and tomasz taylor, theorists at fermi national accelerator laboratory in illinois, took that statement as a challenge. using a few mathematical tricks, they managed to simplify the 2-gluon to 4-gluon amplitude calculation from several billion terms to a 9-page-long formula, which a 1980s supercomputer could handle. then, based on a pattern they observed in the scattering amplitudes of other gluon interactions, parke and taylor guessed a simple one-term expression for the amplitude. it was, the computer verified, equivalent to the 9-page formula. in other words, the traditional machinery of quantum field theory, involving hundreds of feynman diagrams worth thousands of mathematical terms, was obfuscating something much simpler. as bourjaily put it: \xc2\x93why are you summing up millions of things when the answer is just one function?\xc2\x94\xc2\x93we knew at the time that we had an important result,\xc2\x94 parke said. \xc2\x93we knew it instantly. but what to do with it?\xc2\x94the amplituhedronthe message of parke and taylor\xc2\x92s single-term result took decades to interpret. \xc2\x93that one-term, beautiful little function was like a beacon for the next 30 years,\xc2\x94 bourjaily said. it \xc2\x93really started this revolution.\xc2\x94twistor diagrams depicting an interaction between six gluons, in the cases where two (left) and four (right) of the particles have negative helicity, a property similar to spin. the diagrams can be used to derive a simple formula for the 6-gluon scattering amplitude.arkani-hamed et al.twistor diagrams depicting an interaction between six gluons, in the cases where two (left) and four (right) of the particles have negative helicity, a property similar to spin. the diagrams can be used to derive a simple formula for the 6-gluon scattering amplitude.in the mid-2000s, more patterns emerged in the scattering amplitudes of particle interactions, repeatedly hinting at an underlying, coherent mathematical structure behind quantum field theory. most important was a set of formulas called the bcfw recursion relations, named for ruth britto, freddy cachazo, bo feng and edward witten. instead of describing scattering processes in terms of familiar variables like position and time and depicting them in thousands of feynman diagrams, the bcfw relations are best couched in terms of strange variables called \xc2\x93twistors,\xc2\x94 and particle interactions can be captured in a handful of associated twistor diagrams. the relations gained rapid adoption as tools for computing scattering amplitudes relevant to experiments, such as collisions at the large hadron collider. but their simplicity was mysterious.\xc2\x93the terms in these bcfw relations were coming from a different world, and we wanted to understand what that world was,\xc2\x94 arkani-hamed said. \xc2\x93that\xc2\x92s what drew me into the subject five years ago.\xc2\x94with the help of leading mathematicians such as pierre deligne, arkani-hamed and his collaborators discovered that the recursion relations and associated twistor diagrams corresponded to a well-known geometric object. in fact, as detailed in a paper posted to arxiv.org in december by arkani-hamed, bourjaily, cachazo, alexander goncharov, alexander postnikov and jaroslav trnka, the twistor diagrams gave instructions for calculating the volume of pieces of this object, called the positive grassmannian.named for hermann grassmann, a 19th-century german linguist and mathematician who studied its properties, \xc2\x93the positive grassmannian is the slightly more grown-up cousin of the inside of a triangle,\xc2\x94 arkani-hamed explained. just as the inside of a triangle is a region in a two-dimensional space bounded by intersecting lines, the simplest case of the positive grassmannian is a region in an n-dimensional space bounded by intersecting planes. (n is the number of particles involved in a scattering process.)it was a geometric representation of real particle data, such as the likelihood that two colliding gluons will turn into four gluons. but something was still missing.the physicists hoped that the amplitude of a scattering process would emerge purely and inevitably from geometry, but locality and unitarity were dictating which pieces of the positive grassmannian to add together to get it. they wondered whether the amplitude was \xc2\x93the answer to some particular mathematical question,\xc2\x94 said trnka, a post-doctoral researcher at the california institute of technology. \xc2\x93and it is,\xc2\x94 he said.a sketch of the amplituhedron representing an 8-gluon particle interaction. using feynman diagrams, the same calculation would take roughly 500 pages of algebra.nima arkani-hameda sketch of the amplituhedron representing an 8-gluon particle interaction. using feynman diagrams, the same calculation would take roughly 500 pages of algebra.arkani-hamed and trnka discovered that the scattering amplitude equals the volume of a brand-new mathematical object \xc2\x97 the amplituhedron. the details of a particular scattering process dictate the dimensionality and facets of the corresponding amplituhedron. the pieces of the positive grassmannian that were being calculated with twistor diagrams and then added together by hand were building blocks that fit together inside this jewel, just as triangles fit together to form a polygon.like the twistor diagrams, the feynman diagrams are another way of computing the volume of the amplituhedron piece by piece, but they are much less efficient. \xc2\x93they are local and unitary in space-time, but they are not necessarily very convenient or well-adapted to the shape of this jewel itself,\xc2\x94 skinner said. \xc2\x93using feynman diagrams is like taking a ming vase and smashing it on the floor.\xc2\x94arkani-hamed and trnka have been able to calculate the volume of the amplituhedron directly in some cases, without using twistor diagrams to compute the volumes of its pieces. they have also found a \xc2\x93master amplituhedron\xc2\x94 with an infinite number of facets, analogous to a circle in 2-d, which has an infinite number of sides. its volume represents, in theory, the total amplitude of all physical processes. lower-dimensional amplituhedra, which correspond to interactions between finite numbers of particles, live on the faces of this master structure.\xc2\x93they are very powerful calculational techniques, but they are also incredibly suggestive,\xc2\x94 skinner said. \xc2\x93they suggest that thinking in terms of space-time was not the right way of going about this.\xc2\x94quest for quantum gravitythe seemingly irreconcilable conflict between gravity and quantum field theory enters crisis mode in black holes. black holes pack a huge amount of mass into an extremely small space, making gravity a major player at the quantum scale, where it can usually be ignored. inevitably, either locality or unitarity is the source of the conflict.\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 puzzling thoughts\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 locality and unitarity are the central pillars of quantum field theory, but as the following thought experiments show, both break down in certain situations involving gravity. this suggests physics should be formulated without either principle.\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 locality says that particles interact at points in space-time. but suppose you want to inspect space-time very closely. probing smaller and smaller distance scales requires ever higher energies, but at a certain scale, called the planck length, the picture gets blurry: so much energy must be concentrated into such a small region that the energy collapses the region into a black hole, making it impossible to inspect. \xc2\x93there\xc2\x92s no way of measuring space and time separations once they are smaller than the planck length,\xc2\x94 said arkani-hamed. \xc2\x93so we imagine space-time is a continuous thing, but because it\xc2\x92s impossible to talk sharply about that thing, then that suggests it must not be fundamental \xc2\x97 it must be emergent.\xc2\x94\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 unitarity says the quantum mechanical probabilities of all possible outcomes of a particle interaction must sum to one. to prove it, one would have to observe the same interaction over and over and count the frequencies of the different outcomes. doing this to perfect accuracy would require an infinite number of observations using an infinitely large measuring apparatus, but the latter would again cause gravitational collapse into a black hole. in finite regions of the universe, unitarity can therefore only be approximately known.\xc2\x93we have indications that both ideas have got to go,\xc2\x94 arkani-hamed said. \xc2\x93they can\xc2\x92t be fundamental features of the next description,\xc2\x94 such as a theory of quantum gravity.string theory, a framework that treats particles as invisibly small, vibrating strings, is one candidate for a theory of quantum gravity that seems to hold up in black hole situations, but its relationship to reality is unproven \xc2\x97 or at least confusing. recently, a strange duality has been found between string theory and quantum field theory, indicating that the former (which includes gravity) is mathematically equivalent to the latter (which does not) when the two theories describe the same event as if it is taking place in different numbers of dimensions. no one knows quite what to make of this discovery. but the new amplituhedron research suggests space-time, and therefore dimensions, may be illusory anyway.\xc2\x93we can\xc2\x92t rely on the usual familiar quantum mechanical space-time pictures of describing physics,\xc2\x94 arkani-hamed said. \xc2\x93we have to learn new ways of talking about it. this work is a baby step in that direction.\xc2\x94even without unitarity and locality, the amplituhedron formulation of quantum field theory does not yet incorporate gravity. but researchers are working on it. they say scattering processes that include gravity particles may be possible to describe with the amplituhedron, or with a similar geometric object. \xc2\x93it might be closely related but slightly different and harder to find,\xc2\x94 skinner said.nima arkani-hamed, a professor at the institute for advanced study, and his former student and co-author jaroslav trnka, who finished his ph.d. at princeton university in july and is now a

jaroslav trnka, who finished his ph.d. at princeton university in july and is now a post-doctoral researcher at the california institute of technology.physicists must also prove that the new geometric formulation applies to the exact particles that are known to exist in the universe, rather than to the idealized quantum field theory they used to develop it, called maximally supersymmetric yang-mills theory. this model, which includes a \xc2\x93superpartner\xc2\x94 particle for every known particle and treats space-time as flat, \xc2\x93just happens to be the simplest test case for these new tools,\xc2\x94 bourjaily said. \xc2\x93the way to generalize these new tools to [other] theories is understood.\xc2\x94beyond making calculations easier or possibly leading the way to quantum gravity, the discovery of the amplituhedron could cause an even more profound shift, arkani-hamed said. that is, giving up space and time as fundamental constituents of nature and figuring out how the big bang and cosmological evolution of the universe arose out of pure geometry.\xc2\x93in a sense, we would see that change arises from the structure of the object,\xc2\x94 he said. \xc2\x93but it\xc2\x92s not from the object changing. the object is basically timeless.\xc2\x94while more work is needed, many theoretical physicists are paying close attention to the new ideas.the work is \xc2\x93very unexpected from several points of view,\xc2\x94 said witten, a theoretical physicist at the institute for advanced study. \xc2\x93the field is still developing very fast, and it is difficult to guess what will happen or what the lessons will turn out to be.\xc2\x94', ['hacking tools'])

(78720, 17117, 'this guide was originally written as a harm reduction guide to mda, but the guidelines outlined here also apply to mdma. i hope that this information reaches you all and better informs you of how to approach mdxx use. protect your minds, my friends. it is the most valuable thing you possess. mda (methylenedioxyamphetamine) has been shown to have a neurotoxic effect on the 5-ht (serotonin) axons when abused. many users will state that mda is completely safe to use often, but this is a false preconception based on nothing more than anecdotal claims that have zero scientific backing. there have been hundreds of studies throughout the years that outline both mda\'s, and it\'s methylated cousin mdma\'s, neurotoxicity, and not taking the time to value the information they have uncovered is altogether unwise.with this in mind, mda can be used safely with no backlash assuming a set of precautions are followed when using it.1) do not roll more than once a month at least, with emphasis on trying to allow 2-3 months between use.2) a safe dosing guideline for mda is typically 1.0-1.5mg/kg. for instance, if you weigh 80kg, your dosage will be between 80-120mg depending on desired intensity. 80mg will be a light and sociable dose and 120mg will be a much heavier dose.3) keep your body temperature low and stay hydrated! this is perhaps the most important guideline in preventing neurotoxicity. ensure above all else that you are not overexerting yourself.4) antioxidants such as alpha lipoic acid, vitamin c, vitamin e, green tea extract (egcg), and magnesium glycinate will heavily aid in alleviating neurotoxicity, protecting your brain, and improving your roll.a more explanation on each of these points...- moderation is absolutely pivotal when using mda. mda releases serotonin in vast amounts and inhibits the enzyme tryptophan hydroxalyse (tph), which is responsible for creating more serotonin. because this inhibition is permanent, the body must compensate by creating more tph, and this restoration period typically takes between 1-3 months depending on the user\'s diet and exercise patterns. with this in mind, the healthier you are, the quicker the process is. exercise is phenomenal for speeding up this process as exercise stimulates a release of bdnf which encourages the growth of new serotonin axons. the bottom line is this: spread out your use. depending on your health and exercise habits, wait at least one month between use, with a strong emphasis on waiting a preferred 2-3 months.- dosing and redosing are also two very large components of mda neurotoxicity. the higher you dose, the more prone you are to mda\'s neurotoxic effects. a general guideline for safely dosing mda is 1.0-1.5mg/kg. for example, if you weigh 80kg, the optimal dosage for mda is between 80-120mg. whether you choose 80mg or 120mg depends on how intense you want the experience to be and is entirely dependant on your choice. subjectively speaking on the intensity of effects,, 80mg will be a light, sociable dose, 100mg a moderate dose, and 120mg a high dose. because many users will choose to dose higher in search of a more intense experience, i will offer two critical insights: mda is much more potent than mdma, so try to avoid dosing too high, and more importantly, do not redose! redosing is highly unwise, entirely pointless, and plays a huge role in neurotoxicity and will lead to a terrible comedown.for a better representation of why this is bad, let me put it into a rough and incredibly oversimplified analogy. think of your serotonin transport system (sert) as a dam. this dam moderates your serotonin levels by slowly releasing it to control everything from mood, appetite, sleep, heart rate, libido, and so forth. when you ingest mda, it essentially takes control of the floodgates of this dam, opens them up to full capacity, and releases all the serotonin available behind it. what happens when you release all of the serotonin behind this dam? you must wait a while for the levels to return to normal. opening the floodgates to a dam with no water behind it makes absolutely no sense, and this is essentially what redosing mda does. you will not roll harder or longer by taking more; instead, you are simply making your comedown exponentially worse and increasing mda induced neurotoxicity.- keep your body temperature low! do not overexert yourself when dancing as hyperthermia is the leading cause of mda induced neurotoxicity due to a rise in oxidative stress. when your body temperature rises, you body\'s natural process for preventing oxidative stress (antioxidants) becomes less efficient. that lowering of efficiency is exponential. the higher your body temperature gets, the faster reactive oxygen species are created, which damage your brain. a fantastic way to keep your body temperature low is thc (yes, smoking marijuana helps mda neurotoxicity too!), ensuring you dance in moderation, and making sure that you stay properly hydrated. in that breath, do not over-hydrate. depending on the amount of physical activity you are undergoing, 16-24oz of water every hour is optimal for staying hydrated. also, did i mention to keep your body temperature low?- preloading and postloading are two staples for enriching the mda experience and almost entirely negating the potential for neurotoxic damage. not only do they alleviate neurotoxicity, but you will find your roll to be much more smooth and grant you with a beautiful afterglow instead of a hangover. here are a few essential supplements that are key to a proper regimen. if you are unable to purchase these supplements or take them as advised, i will recommend that green tea, orange juice, or emergen-c packets as they will lightly aide in providing antioxidants. however, these two should not be considered an all inclusive replacement. they come recommended on a "better than nothing" basis and pressure should be placed on picking up the appropriate supplements.* na-r-ala (alpha lipoic acid): this is a powerful antioxidant that eliminates free roaming reactive oxygen and nitrogen particles, in turn reducing neurotoxicity. dose 100mg of na-r-ala 30 minutes prior to rolling and 2 hours into the roll. ensure that you purchase the na-r-ala isomer form of ala. while racemic ala is okay, na-r-ala is much more efficient.* magnesium glycinate: magnesium is a phenomenal substance that will alleviate the bruxism (jaw clenching) and fasciculations (muscle twitches) commonly experienced when taking mda. dose 400mg elemental magnesium glycinate 6 hours prior to rolling, again 30 minutes prior, and finally 2 hours into the roll. be sure you purchase either magnesium glycinate (preferred) or magnesium citrate. the most common form, magnesium oxide, is not readily absorbed, so completely avoid it.* vitamin c: the most common antioxidant out there and has been shown to mitigate mda induced hepatotoxicity and neurotoxicity. dose 1,000mg of vitamin c 30 minutes prior to rolling.* vitamin e: a powerful antioxidant that will seek out free radicals. dose 400 iu 30 minutes prior to rolling.* green tea extract (egcg): egcg is a potent antioxidant and diuretic. it will help with the urinary retention arising from mda induced vasopressin release. dose 400mg 30 minutes prior, and 2 hours into the roll.* 5-htp: 5-htp is the direct precursor to serotonin. supplementing 100mg of 5-htp with 400mg of egcg (egcg will help 5-htp cross the blood-brain barrier more efficiently) at bedtime for 5-7 days after rolling will aid your body in restoring serotonin to their proper levels. warning: 5-htp can cause cardiac fibrosis when used in high doses over extended periods of time, so avoid taking 5-htp in high doses for more than 5-7 days.* melatonin: melatonin is created from serotonin, and since your serotonin levels will be low, taking a melatonin supplement will help you fall asleep. melatonin is also a powerful antioxidant. take 5-10mg of melatonin prior to falling asleep after rolling.in the end, the best advice that can be offered is to simply be smart. know your limits, follow common sense, and remember exactly why you\'re taking mda. cherish and value the experience; don\'t tarnish it by abusing it and harming your mind and body.sources (clearnet)* supplements:http://www.geronova.com/sites/default/files/alt_med_rev_2008_0.pdfhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/s1044576584710128http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15212815http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11931860http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14740000* neurotoxicity:http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7582557http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2457659http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1784586http://www.maps.org/publications/1987_stone_3.pdf', ['hacking tools'])
(78732, 17117, "none of the above supplements have provided me with any stomach discomfort in my experience, but obviously all of our bodies are different and react to things differently. your best bet is to simply have a test run without mdma and see how you feel when taking the supplements. also, i typically eat a decently sized meal 2-3 hours prior to rolling and taking supplements with food in your belly always helps. i know most people like to fast before, but i like to get my nutrition in prior to launching. also, this guide obviously errs on the extreme side of caution and was written to be a helpful resource on what to take. this pre-load/post-load regimen is what i recommend for instances where you will be exerting yourself a lot (dancing at a festival in the heat, for instance) and need as much protection as possible. if you are going to be rolling at home on the couch under the a/c with easy access to cold water, you really probably only need one dose of ala, and vitamin c for antioxidant purposes, and magnesium glycinate for alleviating jaw discomfort. the big keys to mitigating neurotoxicity are to take a reasonable dose and to keep your body temperature low. if you can do that, you're off to a great start!", ['hacking tools'])

the same reaction to todays revelations. this movement is built on integrity, and i feel obligated to be forthright with you.i held myself to a high standard as your leader, yet now i must utter words all too familiar to this scarred community:we have been hacked.nobody is in danger, no information has been leaked, and server access was never obtained by the attacker.our initial investigations indicate that a vendor exploited a recently discovered vulnerability in the bitcoin protocol known as "transaction malleability" to repeatedly withdraw coins from our system until it was completely empty.despite our hardening and pentesting procedures, this attack vector was outside of penetration testing scope due to being rooted in the bitcoin protocol itself.this attack hit us at the worst possible time. we were planning on re-launching the new auto-finalize and dispute center this past weekend, and our projections of order finalization volume indicated that we would need the communitys full balance in hot storage.in retrospect this was incredibly foolish, and i take full responsibility for this decision.i have failed you as a leader, and am completely devastated by todays discoveries. i should have taken mtgox and bitstamps lead and disabled withdrawals as soon as the malleability issue was reported. i was slow to respond and too skeptical of the possible issue at hand. it is a crushing blow. i cannot find the words to express how deeply i want this movement to be safe from the very threats i just watched materialize during my watch.ive included transaction logs at the bottom of this message. review the vendors dishonest actions and use whatever means you deem necessary to bring this person to justice. more details will emerge as we continue to investigate.given the right flavor of influence from our community, we can only hope that he will decide to return the coins with integrity as opposed to hiding like a coward.it takes the integrity of all of us to push this movement forward. whoever you are, you still have a chance to act in the interest of helping this community. keep a percentage, return the rest. dont walk away with your fellow freedom fighters coins. dpr2 returned the cold storage. i didnt run with the gold. but two people alone cannot move us forward. it takes an entire community committing to integrity - and though this crushing blow will not stop us, it sure is a testament to how greedy some bastards truly are.being a part of this movement might be the most defining thing you do with your entire life.dont trade that for greed, comrades.i will fight here by your side, even the greedy bastards amongst us.this community has suffered great financial loss over and over again, and i am devastated that it has happened again under my watch.hindsight is already suggesting dozens of ways this could have been prevented, but we must march onward.the only way to reverse a communitys greed is through generosity. our true character is revealed during trying times.if this financial hardship places you at risk of physical harm, contact me directly and i will do my best to help you with my remaining personal funds.- ----------------now what.- ----------------never again store your escrow bitcoins on a server.silk road will never again be a centralized escrow storage.this week has shown the collateral damage we can cause by being a huge target and failing in just one unforeseen area.i am now fully convinced that no hosted escrow service is safe.if i cannot trust myself to keep a hosted escrow solution safe, i cannot trust anyone.multi-signature transactions are the only way this community will be protected long-term.i am aggressively tasking our devs on building out multi-sig support for commonly-used bitcoin clients. expect a generous bounty if you have the skill to implement this.- -----------------until then.- -----------------1. we will never again allow ourselves to be a single point of failure. we will never again host your escrow wallets.2. vendor registration is closed while we regroup.3. all listings on silk road are now no-escrow (finalize-early) for 1-2 months while we implement multi-signature transactions and lobby for mainstream bitcoin client multi-sig support.4. all unshipped orders have been cancelled.5. vendors may link to other marketplaces on a trail basis until we launch multi-sig, then we will re-evaluate based on community input. we do not want to be a centralized point of failure, but we also do not want to lead our buyers into dangerous waters.6. from this point forward do not trust markets with centralized escrow. use multi-signature transactions whenever possible, with trusted third parties as escrow providers.everything will be offline for 24-48 hours to minimize variables as we continue to investigate. the evidence we have below will be expanded based on our findings.- ------------------no marketplace is perfect. expect any centralized market to fail at some point. this is precisely why we must unite in the decision to decentralize.we are relieved that our security procedures protected user identities, and that no servers were compromised. this was not a worst-case scenario: nobody will be getting arrested from this. financial loss is terrible, but will not put all of us behind bars.the details we have on the hacker are below. stop at nothing to bring this person to your own definition of justice.humbled and furious,defcon- ------------------# attacker intel as of 2014-02-13 18:00:00 utcwe normally do not doxx
