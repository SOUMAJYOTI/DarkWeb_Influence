i personally don't care if people see i'm online as i'm here to help newbs and such some people want to appear as online there is enough traffic now that correlation is reallyonly a concern for people already under surveillance if you are chances are you shouldn't be ordering anything on the darknet if you are here for the conversation not the vendors i don't see why it shouldn't be an option it is a minor dent in your opsec hardly something that should be mandatory afaik the forum software automatically opts in so if you want to opt outfeel free to i'm not because i like getting pms in real time its your choice.
justme on september pmshort and simplified answer because it is not end to end encrypted when somebody catches your traffic everyone hosting an exit node can catch that le hosts some exit nodes for that purpose you are fucked you just gave away your address and time of arrival pm me if you want me to link you to some good safety stuff i would strongly advise you to do so i wouldn't mind seeing that link as i am new to this stuff and don't want to fuck up where do you guys usually get your packages sent if not you own place.
sterlingsword on november amquote from darknetdreamer on november amsound interesting would love to write a full review once the sites up sounds excellent it's making good progress i'll post again with my milestone estimations for delivery i'll be sure also to register you an account due to the nature of this market wishing to be secure and being based on vendor only inviting i may have to ask around about you just to make sure you have indeed ordered and used product before if a vendor can vouge for you i'll provide you with a valid one time registration link upon release thanks looking forward to the market and a full write up my blog is basically all about darknet security so i think your site will fit in perfectly given the nature of it.
thanks a million liquid everything is working now even decryption old version of kleopatra saved the day.
we should all be thanking amazon and other companies that have exponentially increased the amount of boxes packages that get shipped around the world alibaba dhgate whoever.
hi all i've had a hell of a time with bugs in gpg win encrypting messages i ended up downloading an older version and it seems to be working but not sure because i can't encrypt messages to other people if someone could help me can you please leave your public key and ill use it to encrypt a message here and i'll paste the message back if you could go ahead and decrypt it and let me know if it didn't show up blank i would great appreciate it thank you in advance.
mtsthelen on march pmwhat about safe bad anyone know anyone correct me if i'm wrong here but from what i understand as long you do these things you should be okay even with a clearnet provider like yahoo or something as long as it allows access through tor it should be fine as long as everything is properly encrypted never log in to your email account over the clearnet tor only encrypt encrypt encrypt and encrypt some more everything remember that subject lines and everything thats not inside the actual pgp message can easily be seen by a rd party nothing sensitive that could compromise your identity make sure you have pgp set up i reccommend tails on a usb and also some obvious things like don't re use any psuedonyms for the email address that you've used before that could link to any other clearnet accounts on forums or anything that could be used to link you from my understanding as long as an email provider allows access over tor and you encrypt your shit up tight then you should be good to go hope this helps a little peace mrs b.
dankbank on may pmgood guide to you i've always heard about tails but never knew really what it was until now i'll be doing this very soon thanksget on tails now seriously it's more secure and it wraps almost everything you need for darknet activities up in a neat lil os.
hey there jw if you got my order on me from friday i pm'd you.
not bothing with this anymore upon reading android wont be enough.
dolmio on april ami dont see why buyers have to fear about this personal privacy should be everyone's concernthis is the reason our privacy gets shitted on right now in every way imaginabl.
also never enable javascript to log in or create your account it could expose your ip address most onion email sites offer a javascript free option to log in like squirrelmail.
hey es thank you for sharing that very interesting post i'd like to read more about it and other thoughts that the author has would you mind passing along the source info it kinda sounds like bruce schneier.
luckyduck are you active here or should we be reaching out to you in other places.
tma is still available on the clearnet along with aleph and mem.
confirmed scammer rip s s s sigant org this is actually the real from silk road that has used two diff handles now since going private that i am referring to i won't tell anyone currently doing business with him what to do i will only present the facts be careful guys.
sillywabbit on may pmquote from dardush on may amthanks sillywabbit do you have by any chance an invite code i did not need one did they close regs yep.
imbunnyfufu on april pmthat truly sucks sorry bud i think that is the nature of those markets you need to be careful who you fe with the anonymity offered online allows seedy individuals to pull this shit it's crazy too because it was my first time back on the dnm's in months and my first purchase was with him and i got scammed i took a very small hit compared to some who lost thousands this was also prior to my discovering tmg this is where i feel the most comfortable and try to be as active here as possible everyone for the most part is here to bring people and things together to build friendships that can't be made irl love tmg.
dirtysouf on february pmtails devs have not renewed their pgp certificate they are well aware of this therefore you cannot verify the integrity of the tails iso try adding and certfying the tails key you'll see that it has expired despite showing a expire date in the only option for now is to use as many checksums as possible and downloading from multiple places i don't know where you're getting this from download the latest tails version from the pgp detached sig file from verify the iso file with the sig file gpg verify tails i iso sig tails i isogpg signature made fri feb pm utc using rsa key id a db gpg good signature from tails developers offline long term identity key gpg aka tails developers gpg warning using untrusted key spitfir.
hello guys i've come over from the silk road with a new user name i'd been scammed out of a little money on a couple market places now and i think what you guys have here is probably the way forward what i would like if it isn't too much hassle is a little help with pgp on android i have an email address and i think a pgp client called agp if someone could tell me what to try to send and receive back n encrypted message that would be great and good luck with the website.
to all of you thank you for your input ive read so many times that you absolutely must use a vpn but i did not see a point if all other angles were covered great reply es.
hiim looking for some leaks sites anyone know some good ones tnx.
roadman it will show tor is being used on the network not who you are if your system is compromised by a attack it possible to reveal other information if no links to you on hardware only hardware information reveal.
yes once we delete anything from here its gone for good.
lets not jump to conclusions heredoes anyone have any real information relating to this cheers s.
i haven't logged on in a few months and i'm pretty noob at all of this anyway so i need your help there are three drugs i want to try well two the other one i've had before lol shrooms lsd and cannabis now i've heard lsd is the easiest to ship securely and i already know a vendor i want to buy from as for cannabis i'm not sure how safe that is it can get pretty smelly and i figure it's much easier to get caught with it in the mail but am i wrong is there actually a safe way to ship that shit and receive it what about shrooms starting soon i'll be using tor within tails under a new username pass email etc is this enough are there other ways to keep safe i'll be storing shit on a usb and all bitcoins are something i never got the hang of i will be using a prepaid card to buy bitcoins how do you go about this and what do you use i've read the guides but i'm still pretty confused on the steps that and it has been a while lol lastly one of the markets i used to use and look at went down a while ago and hasn't come back up since so other than this site what mp do you use.
is their any way to contact oasis admins i forgot my password.
replied in the other thread as well to your question update your bridges check for new bridges at.
bonobo on june amdont think rc and stuff are really welcome around here there is an entire subforum here dedicated to rcs golden era sold aco dmt for g which would be allowed here his other three products are not allowed here but he wouldn't have been the first vendor to vend here who sold products not allowed here on other markets.
i don't know of any specific marketplace but damn that'd be awesome i'm tired of seeing markets filled with heroin fentanyl xanax and fake oxy presses i'd love to be able to select categories and place orders cathinones amphetamines do series amphetamine mescaline analogs md and analogs methylone ethylone mde mdma mda a pb a pb c's tryptamines substituted substituted alpha tryptamine lysergamides natural peyote ayahuasca grow kitsperhaps throw in this category for funsies medical suboxone naloxone diazepam i know those first three aren't but damn they're useful epinepherine pens obviously more but you get the idea basic stuf.
the friendly admins have enabled the feature that allows us to opt out of appearing online when we are to do this go to profile account settings then uncheck the option that shows people you are online everyone do this here's some food for thought on why quotethis is because of all those fbi probability attacks they monitor when you activate tor when you log into sites like say this site if it is ever compromised or safe mail which announces to everybody when you are online and then present this incourt and it's apparently solid evidence because plenty of people like jeremony hammond of lulzsec fame got convicted through simple meta data this guy appeared on irc at this time we monitoredhis wifi signal yes they can pinpoint your wifi signal if under surveillance and he was using tor exactly the same time that's all it takes.
tech specs updatewhile writing and designing i've came up will the following new additions that will make this new market extremely difficult to take down and give a fresh breath of confidence to the darknet marketplace users will no longer have to fret about bitcoins being locked into a marketplace if they choose to use mine internal x ca and spooferi've developed my own spoofer and my system stores every single bit of data using a kb x certificate to spoof every single last detail plain text isn't stored anywhere and no cpu power is saved when it comes to encryption even if it's a simple hello walletmy website is going to use an auto generated bitchain wallet and provide backup abilities your funds won't ever be dependent on my system simply download the wallup backup directly relayed through tor too you via bitchain if my site goes down simply do your thing and log into the wallet using your backup the wallet will also be completely accesable through my website all it will do is connect to bitchain to determine balance etc no funds will be stored on my site auto migrationthe server will automatically put up special text in specific areas to indicate time when timer goes off the website will peridiocally shut down for a period of hours and transfer to an entirely new server again to thwart le this will happen as desired or x per week databases won't migrate as often due to their security in design maybe per week and imagining the size of the database as it grows while a migration is in place users will be able to use the direct trade information posted by vendors if they do so post it during so you may log into your system wallet via bitchain and send your btc to the wallet address that you have in doing so the description and the text will show up the vendor will have the ability on system restart to archive the order and thus enter it into the system thus depleting stock etc purchase will continue to process as if it was purely done in the system.
this is why i would never trust a dnm with something important that would affect my real life like irl dealers who borrow money for their supply and then a dnm goes down and it's all fuck i'm dead i owe money to some bad people or heroin addicts on some where's my deposit and going through withdrawal like this is technology guys ever use it if so you know it breaks when you need it most don't put in more money than you can afford to lose and don't rely on it for important things.
i have an update but it's unfortunate i've decided that this isn't worth it for me i'd still very much like to do it but i haven't received nearly as much support as i'd of liked generally everyone appears to agree that this is a good idea but considering i'm risking a potential of life in prison for orchestrating designing and running a criminal enterprise i cannot do this until i have more support from vendors and from the community if there are any developers out there you can have my ideas for free send me a pm and we can discuss the concepts or if you're a vendor that wants to support me on this send me a message and we can discuss.
first get the coins out then get the popcorn out the silence from the market admin is hilarious lma.
even better here's a thread for pgp help right here in the garden topic.
if you connect to tor through your isp you'd better consider that you might be monitored and or on a list of suspicious individuals it might not be the case but chances are pretty high for that to be the case open wireless network are another option to protect a bit yourself as a vpn might not be as trust worthy as you believe it is good luck stay safe.
i just joined today and am excited to learn more it seems like a great community.
that was a piece of work and yes how did buyers not see that coming how long is a guy gonna move those numbersdon't blame nucleus it's the fucking piece of shit vendors that just keep it going there's scams on all marketsgolden rules if it looks too good to be true it probably is belive none of what you hear and half of what you see anything is.
could that be the default setting knowing the list of currently online users is of no use really.
i arrived too late would anyone be so nice to send me an invitation.
slvxb on june amquote from coldcuts on june amstarted looking at it like my second home best online community i had ever came across love ya guys i feel you brother friends in almost completely anonymity and it certainly feels like homeyes i'm still days here and i know i'll be here for a while.
thanks for the encouraging words i am definitely a very low target as in the single dose was my third order ever a strip was my largest and i cannot imagine le communicating across borders and wasting thousands of dollars on me especially since they know it is impossible for me to give them any info that they do not already have also apparently only people from my country have ever been caught using dnms most of them vendors who were sloppy irl this has been a good learning experience though again thanks for the encouragement i am very grateful for having found this community.
that truly sucks sorry bud i think that is the nature of those markets you need to be careful who you fe with the anonymity offered online allows seedy individuals to pull this shit.
hey guys has anybody had any trouble with the fa login i've only been on for a coupe of weeks with fa worked fine unil today anybody ese having this issue.
thanks for the great info.
never had that issue before it should prompt you for the bridge address you're using when it's configured takes no time extra to connect will pm you for specifics.
ohdonpiano on november pmbecause the thread was started in augustand facepalm.
i've seen more clearnet sites that sell trypamines than i have on dnms you can find al ist of vendor shops on reddit all depends on where you live of course.
scroat on august pmit was actually a particular key that was causing the problem it still is but i figured out i can use any other key just not that one is the key expired pgp will not use expired keys to encrypt messages spitfir.
all vpns and proxys will do is hide the fact from your service provider that you use tor if you aren't concerned about anyone finding out you use tor then you'll be fine.
really it's up every time you go to log in it's been down every time i've checked in the last week did the url change i open all three i saw listed in the rotation when i checked it out a little over a week ago and i haven't gotten back on onc.
if it's around for good now i have the unpleasent duty of eating my fedora.
all links verifed with dnstats comalways be careful to avoid phishing attempts.
woopieg on july pmwhat an amazing discussion after reading everyone's posts i thought i would mention something that may have been overlooked here's a disclaimer i'm sure everyone at mullvad are spot on in what they believe in when it comes to privacy and with what they're trying to accomplish at mullvad and i am in no way doubting that at all i'm only looking to disseminate information and perhaps my humble opinions sweden is one of the eyes and mullvad being a swedish company with their home servers located in sweden operates in the land of the eyes and i've always stayed away from all vpn providers that operate out of any of the eyes countries whether they have a strong association or a weak alliance with the american nsa countries that make up the eyes are not privacy friendly and i would only use vpn services and vpn servers located outside of the land of the eyes here's something about the eyes for those who might be interested wonder which is more risky using a company that resides in the lower tier of the eyes but has an excellent reputation ie mullvad using a less well known vpn in a country that isn't part of the eyes but may or may not log you and give you up if they are asked.
lelantos lelantoss bcnwbv onion although not free all funds go towards server maintenance and software hardware upgrades urss mail f onion a free service based in russia and brazil here is a link to more ideas not onion based but outside of usa anonymous proxy servers net en help email provider html safemailif using safe mail make sure you use manual pgp encrpytion keep in mind headers like the subject cc to and metadata aren't encrypted although though you said you're accessing it through tor so why not use a onion based email service such as those above also bare in mind that safe mail broadcasts when you are online here are some thoughts on why this is bad to use but bare in mind their policy on drugs and also that they are hosted in usa if you do decide to use them probably best not to sign up with a name such as iselldrugs riseup netquoteq what about child porn drugs corruption etc would you fight law enforcement requests for users doing these things a those things violate riseup s terms of service and unlike some more american libertarian service providers we do not exist to provide privacy for doing anything you want we would close the accounts of people doing those things and the collective may even decide to cooperate with law enforcement rather than set all the servers on fire and destroy the organization and your email.
i got everything i asked for she's always been a pleasure to work with.
i would like to know about this vendor too so up.
lately i've had a good experience with bitblender the laundered coins are available almost immediately so the whole process didn't take more than minutes but you could probably find some other mixers with lower fees as bitblender is definitely not the cheapest.
i have a paxful account and a wallet that i have downloaded i buy bitcoins with cash deposits at bofa you dont even need an account at bofa you just need cash and tell the teller you need to make a cash deposit to an account fill out the slip with information provided to you by the seller on paxful and there you go btc within minutes after you deposit.
spitfire on december pmi thought it was great too until they started serving ads through torads what really got me and caused me to abandon my accounts there is the fact that an ad that i was being served related to an organization in my country of origin that is either a huge coincidence or ip address data is possibly being leaked indicating the country of origin i've also been using sigaint org but i've never seen any ads there perhaps that's because i'm browsing with javascript disabled and ad block enabled the service has so far been quite reliable.
again thanks ketaman i will use like before tails from usb disactivate javascript encryption not proxy vpn socks and v m you right it's not good getting anybody else in trouble and must be not easy crack wifi i have to read more about opsec and learn more to be anonymous but i understand is enough like this i wonder if using v m with tails give me an extra layer of security and when i browse dn if my isp can watch what i do there i immagine can only see that i use tor i wish a good day for allall the best ketama.
bbkf on february pmthe upgraded kernel is the same flavor of linux used by redhat which works very closely with the us government does this mean that you're concerned about there being something unsafe in the software because the u s government works with redhat the beauty of open source software is that security experts can and do pore over the code to make sure that there are no security issues that means that nobody can easily insert malicious code into the program without it being detected.

goodfornothing on april pmtmg is in a league of it's own and entirely different i meant commission taking escrow offering money handling markets of the risk your capital kind not this open honest trust based forum that asks nothing in return for letting people find each other and communicate freely glad to see you here gfn i remember you from sr as i was one of your first customers good person we decided the best way to work a marketplace is not to run one at all as tmg was created by the avengers it would be a conflict of interest trying to be the middle men in a transaction so it's trust based and we have only had a few troubles with vendors and even most those troubles were taken care of by other members and or eventually resolved by the vendor that dropped the ball even with escrow and multisig you need to place your trust in someone so we set up this forum for communication and allow you to gain trust in the vendor directly roo.
how do you link your pgp key in your profile sig.
i just found this service that seems pretty trustworthy it's called bitblender and it looks promising this is not an endorsement i don't know the owners of this site and i do not vouch for them use at your own risk is a thread over at the sr forums where the owner of the site introduced the service the thread began as a review of another service bitlaunder that appears to be either really crummy or a scam i'm really digging this forums functionalit.
chess on april pmi haven't logged on in a few months and i'm pretty noob at all of this anyway so i need your helpwelcome back  chess on april pm there are three drugs i want to try well two the other one i've had before lol shrooms lsd and cannabis now i've heard lsd is the easiest to ship securely and i already know a vendor i want to buy from as for cannabis i'm not sure how safe that is it can get pretty smelly and i figure it's much easier to get caught with it in the mail but am i wrong is there actually a safe way to ship that shit and receive it what about shrooms this is the safest way to import weed or quantities of shrooms greater than an ounce if you're a one man operation i'm just shamelessly copy pasting this from another post i made in the security forum fifteen minutes ago here one good benefit of using a p o box and use the usps ones because there are news articles online of the private ones opening people's weed packages and having the cops wait for them the next time they come to pick up is that if you source a male wig i'm assuming you're a guy a silly hat and get yourself a new pair of sunglasses and normal clothes when you do pickups try to use a one and if you park down the street because the feds may be watching for your car in a controlled delivery too they will probably never even realize it's you if you're doing your pickup also wear something long sleeved to cover up your tattoos if you have any get a po box large enough to fit your drug packages it's worth the money do not fuck with a small sized po box that forces you to get everything from the counter if you study cd stories on reddit you see that this is how of the people using po boxes get caught or would have got caught when they get a slip saying to go to the counter the other of the time the feds already knew what they looked like and were either waiting inside or outside a good disguise and parking your car down the street will go a long way this is really only if you're doing shit like importing mdma from a foreign country though for domestic acid letters they're never going to intercept them but i'd still park down the street and use a disguise unless in theory your acid vendor re uses his same shipping from address and the feds profiled that and now they knew you had a drug delivery and were waiting for you if you are doing this method above extra brownie points if you walk in with a large envelope they're free in the usps lobbies grab a stack there's even ones that have a piece of blank cardboard in the x brown envelope so it looks like there's some weight to it go ahead and just write some bullshit to from info on it and don't put stamps on it pretending like you have something to mail check your po box with the back turned to the windows and preferably get your po box at a lobby that has no cameras and has access and stuff your drug package inside your coat quickly without making sudden movements close your coat up close the box go drop your letter off in the inside of the building but not the counter with all the cameras use a drop box in the lobby and leave if you do your pickups at am am you should be able to spot if there's any feds in the parking lot which you could probably get away with this right under their noses but if you really wanted to be cautious you could come back every night and grab it when they're gone or just wait days also leave your cell phone at home if you need to be this cautious your male wig can be sourced from paid in cash amazon gift cards at barnes and noble or speedway the gas station or other stores in your area create a new amazon account for buying your sketchy things like this and ship it to a friend's house so there's no digital trail of you ever buying it also for your po box ask for signature confirmation and email delivery there's another form you'll have to fill out this is the same form that gives you street addressing as well this is worth it also street addressing lets you address your po box like this donald duck main st los angeles ca instead of donald duck main st po box los angeles ca the street addressed version looks more legitimate with signature confirmation you will sign an extra piece of paper and they will use the signature on that piece of paper to electronically fill out any pieces of mail that required signature confirmation totally worth it because you never want to have to go to the counter also there's vendors who only send registered mail they are very few but signature confirmation does not apply to these so get your shipping details before you buy your product for email delivery have a burner protonmail com email address they don't keep login logs and all email is encrypted on their server so they can't read it and decryption is done locally on your computer through javascript they're hosted in a nuclear bomb shelter feet below ground in switzerland and it's open source specifically just for this box or a dark net email address set up before ahead of time then when you get any packages that you didn't have tracking on letters won't count you will get an email notification cool huh also for buying lsd i recommend these same procedures and precautions as above just get a x po box since sometimes you may get large x sized priority envelope sized letters from acid vendors and you just need the stuff to fit in your box keep your acid drop and your weed shrooms drop as separate addresses  chess on april pm starting soon i'll be using tor within tails under a new username pass email etc is this enough are there other ways to keep safe i'll be storing shit on a usb and all this silk road lieutenant got de anonymized by the fbi because he didn't use a vpn before tor a vpn unless you're using a cash prepaid g hotspot or public wifi it's worth your life even if you're a small fish  chess on april pm bitcoins are something i never got the hang of i will be using a prepaid card to buy bitcoins how do you go about this and what do you use i've read the guides but i'm still pretty confused on the steps that and it has been a while lol i saw this post is from april nd but if you're still around pm me your pgp key and i can securely share a few good ways of buying bitcoins with you  chess on april pm lastly one of the markets i used to use and look at went down a while ago and hasn't come back up since so other than this site what mp do you use alphabay is a good starting point but if you've already found tmg then if you still need acid check out the lsd listings here in the vendor forum and the acid listings on dhl are good too or just don't even mess with this at all and just go straight to buying sheet ug gel tabs that are the bomb from not ron paul on oasis x gel tabs for if the gel tabs are out of stock try his liquid drops at ug for total that's a sheet basically i hope this helps i saw this post was from april nd but i hope you log back in and see it still.
usps blocks tor exit nodes however you can use another end to end ssl encrypted usps proxy such as packagetrackr com i agree with snacktime though spoof your mac and check it at an internet cafe.
you can find all of that on the clearnet.
this is a great place it really is the garden with many beautiful flowers in it peace and love brothers.
yeah thanks for those great replies that's really important stuff to know so i'm glad i know it now i think i just shed like pounds in paranoia.
i should add that the reason why i am looking into another np vendor then value lucid is his stealth packaging the blotters aren't sealed and are subsequently at risk of damage through water the stealth is probably the worst i have seen it might be ok for within the eu but i live in a country with somewhat tricky customs and do not want to take unnecessary risks i was going to source some from ootp but my strip of np got lost on its way he has very generously reshipped a strip but he no longer sells np if i'm not mistaken.
scroat on april pm but i wanna order now yeah ffs these vendors seriously need to set up a paypal account.
pinto on november pmhmm good question i'm not sure about the safety between the two i use an online wallet blockchain that might be a good post if this doesn't get much attention make sure you google or use the search function and see if a topic has already been posted about the difference in safety and reliability in a downloaded vs online wallet thanks and best of luck feel free to ask anymore questions you have i'm more than happy to help out i'll probably just use blockchain as well then i don't want to risk downloading anything so paxful with chrome transfer it over to your wallet on tails and tor what if i wanted to use helix how would i do that and is it worth it also just in case i don't figure this out how exactly would i transfer stuff to my wallet or through helix and then to my wallet.
registered ty for the update.
aww i remember him he was my very first bitcoin purchase that involved drugs ordered some meo mipt blotters gave me free i nboh i think dont remember came in days shit was fast as fuck such a shame this is happening.
i'm using kleopatra i'll try it with the command line and see.
thank you we have lots of funds tied in escrow right now an exit scam would devastate not only our business but a small chunk of our lives for awhilecheers s.
debian which tails is based on is not compatible with all wifi devices inside computers for example it is not compatible with some of the newer macbook models because it doesn't come with the right drivers you can do some searching to see if debian comes with a driver for the wifi device on your computer model if not it is possible to buy a usb connected wifi dongle compatible with debian it's also possible to install the missing driver to tails in some case but there are negative sides to doing that from what i've heard.
i used to be a huge windows fanboy switched to linux about years ago when i went to school for computer science now i honestly can't stand windows must have a unix based system osx or linux either is fine for me.
when it comes to opsec there is no answer to what one needs to do the line between opsec and paranoia is different for everyone in terms of specifically using a vpn in addition to tor and public wifi you might ask yourself is it possible that someone is flagging monitoring connections from this access point to the tor network that someone may be the owner of the establishment a government agent an isp or another random dude connected to the same wifi if that risk poses a threat to you then you could consider using a vpn connection if you are comfortable taking that risk then you probably wouldn't use a vpn so to answer your question of whether or not anyone needs a vpn i would say yes some people do need a vpn whether or not you need a vpn is for you to decide whether or not i need a vpn is for me to decide that's my take on the question at least stay safe blu.
i am not understanding the reasoning for selecting ubuntu over tails as the more secure os they are both linux and what it boils down to is how it is configured out of the box now i haven't used tails before but i have been an ubuntu user for years what configurations could you make to ubuntu that you could not do with tails why use ubuntu and turn around and configure it to be like tails out of the box an encrypted live os with also encrypted persistent storage configured for the utmost privacy out of the box seems like a no brainer that being said if i could stick with my primary os and configure it to be just as secure if not more secure i would definitely be interested in a tutorial around that.
hiquote from luxaeterna on april pmdoes this sound ok where could i improve tails pgp lbc online bank wire electrum wash helix market vendor if you pay with your bank account then your lbc account will be tied to your identity better buy on lbc with cash by mail or find someone you can buy from in person then send from lbc to an electrum address in tails mixer another electrum wallet using various addresses most mixers support that and that's better market vendorthe good thing with that is that it will allow for an anonymous wallet where'll land your washed coins and your change if you want to be extra careful you then can send not directly from this wallet but use an other mixer in between your anonymous wallet and the seller if you move coins between addresses wallets it also adds some plausible deniability remember that the blockchain is public and that mixers could be run by your enemy good luck.
i really love the garden looks like a really tightly knit community i look forward the long journey of learning peace and lov.
you can use the same pgp to verify it is me i sell only the best lsd at the lowest cost i can every order is shipped priority mail free of charge my most recent batch that is selling now is the same as the previous one very nice stuff you will not be disappointed you can check my credentials using grams search for 'luckyduck' or read the rules below before ordering rules double then triple check your address before submitting an order the only problems i have ever had are because people don't write their address correctly i copy and paste what you give me use a real name to a real address no fake names no abandoned homes or empty store fronts no free samples don't ask if a package will arrive at a specific time i do not control the postal system for example i cannot guarantee your package will arrive by the weekend priority shipping usually takes a max of days but sometimes for whatever reason it takes everything will be shipped within hours of purchase and your item will not me marked shipped until after it has been dropped off at a postal box i also do not under any circumstance ship using overnight delivery there will never be a signature required for anything you receive from me i won't answer a question that can be answered by reading this page however i will do my best to respond to your inquiries quickly but my first priority is getting your orders packed up and in the mail i only ship from the usa to to others in the usa if you would like something sent to another country pm me and we might be able to work something out pgp only this is serious all non encrypted orders will be canceled non address related communication does not need to be encrypted please log back in and finalize as soon as you can once you receive it's just good manners i treat my customers well and expect the same in return if there is any problem with your order talk to me first before leaving feedback if poor feedback is left without trying to resolve the situation with me first there will be no resolution refund or reship given i am very easy to work with so just message me and we will work it out be safe and have fun the product each batch is tested i will turn down a batch if it does not meet my standards i have never once received a single complaint about the quality of my lsd in fact i've only received glowing reviews every site that i have ever vended on has always had a spotless record never anything below a so you can buy with confidence i will not sell a product that doesn't meet my high standards this is a business and i run it like one security is important to me your safety is a big priority for my customers and myself all precautions are taken very seriously from the start beginning with using a secure os and a highly regarded pgp tool with an extremely strong password for decryption the computer that is used was bought with cash hard drive was remove and only boots from an encrypted memory card this computer never touches the clear net it has also has never been exposed to any java script and never will hardware and software firewalls are used i never store any of your information aside from the order number and the corresponding tracking number which are kept encrypted and well hidden this information is deleted using a very through piece of software as soon as the order has arrived packaging is done in the utmost clean environment packing materials are all bought with cash from different locations all postage is bought with cash from locations no where near the places your orders are dropped all packages have printed labels that are printed using an extremely common printer that was bought with cash every package employs a decoy while packing quality gloves are worn every step of the way and are changed frequently throughout the process stealth is something i take seriously i've done this for a long time and have never had a package seized i have been a vendor for several years on many markets and have done so without incident i won't state my prior usernames for security reasons sometime i take long breaks from operating when a site goes down exit scam or seized then i start fresh with a new identity so as not to be linked to previous compromised sites each time i come back i start out as a new vendor and each time i quickly gain a good reputation and loyal customers i have never acted dishonest scammed or stolen in anyway from anyone online or in real life it's just not something i could do and still sleep at night even when there have been incidents of seized sites like sr or exit scams i have always honored the pending orders placed even though i loose money those customers also lost money and i feel like they should get what they paid for or at least what they tried to pay for i'm not greedy nor do i have a big ego so you will not see me on forums or elsewhere doing any kind of self promotion i let my feedback and word of mouth do that for me this is a one man band and i keep my prices low and quality is high therefor my profit margin is slim you will sometimes see others with lower prices but that may be because they import their product they don't know the quality or even if it is real lsd until it arrives while i pay more for my product and source it locally so i know that before i purchase it is lsd and high quality you get a real product from me as well as good stealth and quick shipping that you can count on when you buy from me you are keeping your money in our country economy and helping those that work to produce it as well begin pgp public key block

hi so i'm about the tumble some bitcoins again and want to ask a few questions to ensure my method is still safe i have been sending coins from my coinbase account to an address on my blockchain wallet from which i use shared coin to either send it to my personal wallet on my virtual machine or to another tumbler though lately my laziness and uncertainty about tumbling services has removed this step now my questions are is this an effective technique should i be creating new blockchain wallets regularly to add anonymity or are new addresses good enough and if i should use another tumbler what service do you guys suggest thanks so much for the help elli.
i ship daily once in a while i'll take a sunday off i try to ship as quickly as possible and i happen to liquidate quickly so now and then i won't have anything in stock for a few days but i wouldn't offer any sales during those times i won't post product unless it is in stock thanks l.
unit on may ami deposited into my agora account on around pm i sit here on may th at pm days after my deposit and nothing has shown in my agora account one would hope that with such a big deposit agora support might respond to messages however they have yet to respond to the messages i have sent with just questions regarding deposits they said withdraws are fixed however they are working on deposits i hope agora comes through on this and doesn't drop the ball depositting btc shouldn't be the scary thing about the dnm the mailing of drug should be however i sit here scared worried confused and very irritated at the very simple transaction of btc to my account i hope agora fixes this soon as well because if a normal order takes weeks after vendor sends out package i am looking at a solid month on one order this is sad and not what customers pay commission to see the one positive you can look at is they fixed withdrawls first while that may be frustrating towards your situation and i can see why with that much money but in terms of a market doing an exit scam it wouldn't make sense for them to let vendors withdraw their coins scidm.
i'm really starting to dig dhl they may not have many vendors but i only really purchase lsd and mdma and my two new favorite vendors for both substances are there jor and vitamin e they have a lot of escrow listings and only takes confirmations for deposits which is nice abraxas is good too plenty of vendors nice setup never had a problem there.
i see one vendor managed to get btc free of eic so there are signs of life but admins have left it too long to make an announcement rip me thinks.
i just want to say thank you for bringing to light how important a vpn is i've been using tails for quite some time at public spots and it's great to know that for only a year you can get a reputable quality vpn i have been running ubuntu for a while now but for some reason the mullvad client would not install until a did a fresh install of ubuntu i tried everything i swear there was some strange error saying it couldn't install python most likely due to some other application i had installed conflicting in one way or another so if your going to be like me and trust these guys and upgrade to ubuntu a vpn and get off tails might wanna start with a fresh wipe if you have issues what i really want to know is if there is a way to clear the system memory upon shutdown like tails does are the any other features we can copy over the one thing i'm really going to miss is that little gpgapplet with the clipboard that made encrypting decrypting with pgp so much faster.
tails devs have not renewed their pgp certificate they are well aware of this therefore you cannot verify the integrity of the tails iso try adding and certfying the tails key you'll see that it has expired despite showing a expire date in the only option for now is to use as many checksums as possible and downloading from multiple places.
this is a forum but you can also use it to directly contact vendors they post their offers in the active vendors section you'll also find reviews here so you can decide which vendor is trustworthy and reliable but there's no escrow which means you'll have to pay upfront it also means the admins can't steal your money as they aren't in any way involved with the orders.
doseheavy on november pmyou're a little late to the party dhl is already trying to capitolize on that i think we can do it better with less infrastructure we have a multisig system implemented here now in theory and all of the trusted vendors are here why would we want to pay a market to mediate the transactions when we have the resources trustworthy vendors to mediate ourselves aflao crypto srr is finishing bitwasp i asked for the amended lighthouse code be worked in so they have auction i have given all of the resources for vendors to get a vps and load whonix with amp so you can run a storefront forum or blog if you want to do some work help wizardx get the collective moved to tor and then we will work on a different phase of dn drugs it will go from the chemist to pgp signing for the vendors so people can tell quality and purity we were selling on the backend of the pms on thehive so there's no reason not to update it all and make the chemists players in the scene agian so the information isn't hoarded by a few and purity of product suffers thats what happened with the helio split i banter about opsec continuously and to make these changes happen everyone needs to be on the same albeit safe and secure playing field i'm going to build my idea and show you what kind of magic i'm working with if nobody wants to join it that's fine but when it comes to this sort of stuff i'm not so good at taking orders from others working with a community on their idea but if you have any comments for how this system could be improved i'd love to here about it not to mention there isn't any market doing this that i'm aware of my goal is to have a market with disputes because every single vendor is well trusted i was able to join dhl just be going to their site and registering and moreover you would want a market that's trusted to mediate it for you because you can rest assured that at the click of a button everything will be taken care of with no reason for concern stress or distress over anything you do on the site based on the nature of all of the vendors being trusted and within their own circle it either all turns to shit or it's all working correctly in theory or unless the majority of the vendors go on vacation and there's one little scrappy guy left in the corner snatching money from people but that's always a problem in any enviornment.

why shouldn't you track packages through tor.
the active vendors forum is generally kept up to date have a look around a bit there to find someone who meets your need.
i dont see why buyers have to fear about this.
excited to order soon you gave me the best mdma i've ever had in my life a year ago i'm sure the acid won't disappoint.
i really doubt anything too bad will come out from this except for perhaps vendors with inferior stealth getting busted also with the us debt being what it is i doubt much money and effort will go into this shit i wouldn't be surprised if they pulled another sort of c i a move and actually started selling themselves for more cash.
yeah that's from the recent acmd report which proposed a ban although it hasn't taken into effect yet lizardlabs wrote hopes this stock will last until the ban of his newest al lad batch so hopefully the ban won't be too soon sadly lizardlabs does not ship to the usa.
great discussion i wouldn't recommend ubuntu but if you decide to use it please check.
humblebumble on september pmright forehead slap i guess my assumption was that those sites would be ssl encrypted usps tracking is indeed ssl encrypted should be noted that determined law enforcement agencies only need to control a single certificate authority that browsers accept by default to successfully conduct a mitm attack on it would surprise me if they did i'd use tails with js off.
can someone send me a dhl invite please.
luxaeterna on may pmwent with zalas approach except deposited cash in a bank via a machine so no face to face with bank person and no leaking of id to buyer only thing is banks cameras only problem there i can think of is if buyer is le and wants to know who i am they could use the time stamp on the recpiet i had to take a screnshot of and go to the cameras of that bank around that time however that's a lot of hassle and they would have to try id me by face only put up posters this pay points are similar to atms are machines but i haven't noticed any camera on them even though there might be hidden ones are terminals for self service anything u can think of opened and if paranoia is so big u can go using it with a mask no jok.
it's a flea market.
lucidmotif on november amdebian which tails is based on is not compatible with all wifi devices inside computers for example it is not compatible with some of the newer macbook models because it doesn't come with the right drivers you can do some searching to see if debian comes with a driver for the wifi device on your computer model if not it is possible to buy a usb connected wifi dongle compatible with debian it's also possible to install the missing driver to tails in some case but there are negative sides to doing that from what i've heard a great suggestion but if i'm reading queen's post correctly it is that this has worked in the past for her although i could be wrong.
interesting thread i haven't purchased from any market for a while agora is always my main market but it has so many donwtimes atm it is difficult to use i think i will give middle earth an opportunity since some of my favourite vendors are there.
i love you thank you.
summa iru on april pmright now apart from tmg my favorite is nucleus very professional user friendly interface easy on the eyes it works everytime i go to login and most importantly has a few of my favorite vendors with agora so unreliable in my opinion it looks set to take over from evoi like middleearth but that's because i'm a crossbreed between an elve and a hobbit i can understand why you like nucleus but i seem to have problems everytime i login and the images are nowhere to be found i hope they'll fix that soon.
anyone using bitblender or bitcoinfog lately just curious what is best edit i did a transaction through bitblender about btc worth cheap fees fast processing all super smooth.
i believe shared send option has now been removed from blockchain info.
i found crypto market too it look good i am going to try for the moment i get order only with nucleus and middle earth nothing in the other market and nothing here i miss evolution i don't understand because i have very good price g about weed and very good review on grams anyway thanks for answer someone have good link with market list like hidden wiki.
just a heads up if mixed coins are available almost instantly it's not a good sign as you might be prone to timing attacks that's why it's good to always add some random time delay if a mixer offers such option.
ab seems no worse than usual for myself majestic garden on the other hand is just for me whenever i have to wait whether it be on the web or in a car in a parking lot i consider it a zen exercise a patience practice if you will how patient can i be oh so patient indeed.
sound interesting would love to write a full review once the sites up.
why so serious.
lobster on november amlooks like you've been keeping yourself busy i applaud you on your efforts to make the darknet a better place i don't really have any tech skills but i would love to help you if there is anything a non tech savy person can contribute if you could provide me with a list of expetations you have that would be great by doing so i'll give you a coupon code for off of any order once we launch funds will come from website wallet incase anyone is interested the vendor will still be receiving his price i'll add in a description for the coupon system i've worked out also in the meantime also we've thougut of a way to double as a vendor only market and a public market we figured it'd be best to provide a platform for new vendors to get familiar with the service or for new vendors starting out we will be taxing a certain amount from public sales and while the two websites will be hosted completely seperately they will still communicate meaning private sellers may list items publicly at their own risk of exposing themselves and whichever product they choose to list their identity will not be shown as a private vendor in our system their identity will simply show as their username also in the private system any chat with a vendor will display the vendor you have chosen a user may cancel an item session after first inquiring if they don't like the vendor and its been long enough that sales and stock of such item have been depleted to the point that another vendor is then selling that product other additions if a vendors stock has replenished and the other vendor stocks havnt that new stock replenishment is not considered into the stock algorithm in order to ensure fairness in other words you can never be the only active vendor via constantly adding more stock in an attempt to out number competitors with vendor permission via the forums or any other sort a vendor may add themselves to a users favorite's list this system is still being worked out a user may add a vendor to their favorites list if theyve chatted with them via inquiring about an item limitation of item inquiring vs purchases you may reinquire an already inquired item this is to help relieve vendors of onsloughts of messages for potentially uneducated buyers there's plenty of information elsewhere read it you're here to make a discreet anonymous address aside from providing exactly where you live to a complete stranger this limit resets every days require limit is for roughly items until user makes buys then limit is lifted number may be reduced to based on input from community wallets will automatically tumble amoungst other owned wallets of the site we are aware this creates a potential exit scam possibility for the admin of the site this functionality will be omitted if it is not welcome we believe that the security and benefit of tumbling the coins previous to withdrawls and deposits add extra layers of security and the only other scenario we could imagine was tumbling them amoungst other user accounts which in our opion was worse considering then any random user may have an opprtunity to steal coins potentially a somewhat dynamic rules engine for vendor that is currently on top this is being thought about potentially an internal automated vpn based tracking system if you buy with tracking and the vendor enters the tracking number view the tracking securely right here on our site this may be a later feature considering security we will try to use a vpn consistently same ip within your country if you tell us in your profile so that your identity and our server stay anonymous via x security more features are actively being worked on all features will be available on private public system users will only have access to the system they are designated in private users users registered via a trusted vendor's invitation will have access to both systems anonymous users and vendors that register without a registration link will have access only to the public system but can be promoted by a trusted vendor into the private system.
weird i was just thinking how fast it was running for me.
the biggest most active market atm is abraxas you need a referral invite to join so you can use mine here if you need one link.
although if you log into a public wifi your mac address would be recorded on that network so maybe the best case scenario would be to utilize the unprotected browser in tails.

have you tried from another ap are the results the same.
shot you a pm back thanks fragbite.
you just made a thread in the best market you're already there here as far as psychedelics everything you could want is here and in my opinion psychedelics are the only 'drugs' worth pursuin.
are the withdrawals working for everyone now i had a small change back on the site but i've nicely forgotten about it since it went down would be nice if they returned it back with an interest.
i came here to rub my tummy.
k on october ami think a lot of us were confused as exactly what tmg was istmg is a forum it is a home it is many things but most of all it is a family.
what's the best and most trustworthy btc mixer out there right now bitcoinfog.
im moving to dream all the good guys are there already invite for dreammarket safeft.
wow so much thought went into this but working directly with vendors whom have proven themselves this system is hard to beat i send coin they send product simple i will never join an open market agai.
i just placed an order the other day via that thread pgp e mail etc hoping to get it within a few days but cm's always been a stand up vendor just throw the address down somewhere and get their pub key.
pgp public keys can be signed as a way of verifying or authenticating that the key belongs to who they say they are the encryption is used by many people who aren't necessarily trying to be anonymous just have secure communication so it's common for people to sign keys in the keyring as a way of building trust in the keys so it sounds like you need to sign your own i haven't signed a key in a long time i think i'm using the right terms or explaining correct if i'm wrong someone please chime in.
we are all very blessed to have this place this time and this wonderful xtal to share i love you all.
organix on march pmthey don't really have fa though many have requested it they have optional pgp login but you can't set it up so that no one can login without both password and pgp so its kind of weak for realz never been there but that's weak.
yup my backup contact during market outtages or post closure is here on tmg and my secondary backup if tmg is also down is grams if we get to the point where i actually have to use grams to communicate i'll make a backup email contact but i don't want to be affiliated with an email address right now no i no longer use my old one because i have too many inboxes as it is and don't want to get a bunch of emails i'm not going to read it's easy enough to find me as it is when i need to use an email address i will resume doing so making a point of making it known that tmg is my backup contact and grams is my secondary backup because the amount of times people think i've disappeared off the face of the earth because they didn't check either of the two biggest markets around is mind blowing yes i'm talking about you agora buyers who think i've been inactive for the last year straight i'd tell you to look harder next time sr and evo would have been the first placed i'd have checked if i was looking for someone who was vending since sr but instead of having to look for me at all just know that i'm here on tmg and if tmg ever goes down i'm on grams.
my verdict is in nucleus is where it's at for me right now does anyone else find the interface on blackbank to be god awful as a vendor i find the design to be very poor it takes most work to do absolutely anything i ever have to do i find it to be about as functional as it is aesthetically appealing barely at all i don't care about the aesthetics if the interface is well thought out and practical but i can't stand the interface on blackbank middle earth i find much easier to use there are a few little things i dislike like how conversations without unread messages have to be sorted alphabetically by the other person's name and can't be sorted like a normal inbox so you can come back to a recent conversation even if you don't remember who it is because you're talking to a hundred different people and a few common features i'd like to see added like listing cloning which isn't that important to me but is definitely nice as well as some features i've never seen before but keep suggesting for the most part the interface works for me there i like that both nucleus and middle earth auto fe for fe listings unlike blackbank where even on a fe listing the buyer has to wait for you to accept before they can finalize and then you have to wait for them to finalize after that before you can withdraw so there's this whole correspondence dynamic that can leave funds sitting in limbo indefinitely whereas on middle earth and nucleus the second someone orders an fe listing you can withdraw and secure the funds middle earth has one issue that i find quite bothersome though buyers can't withdraw wtf is that it's their money i don't care if me doesn't want to be a free tumbler if that's their excuse they can charge a withdrawal fee like blackbank people deposit more coin than they need all the time to make sure they have enough for their order during btc fluctuations if nothing else they also should have the right to change their mind and pull their coin out what if you deposit as much as you need to buy something the btc drops or the vendor raises the price or hits vacation mode and you can no longer afford it and want to take your coin back or order a smaller listing or something else and now have a bunch of leftover coin you can't withdraw i really like the vendor side of middle earth but this troubles me to prevent it from being used as a tumbler if people actually use it as such and that's problematic they could charge a withdrawal fee for people who deposit then withdraw withut buying anything no withdrawal fee for people who spend more than half of the coin they deposit before withdrawing the remainder or something silly like that i still wouldn't like that but that's not nearly as bad as not letting people withdraw at all if they're willing to let me vend there for a mere commission they should let people tumble their coins at a slight cost as well even if most buyer withdrawals aren't even for that purpose but rather just because people want their money where they want their money somewhere safer than an anonymously run darknet market primarily used for drugs that are illegal in most of the world for example again i really like middle earth from the vendor side of things but they lose major brownie points for this issue i've had multiple people refuse to buy there for this reason and i completely understand why if they resolve this they'll be one of my favorite markets of all time as it stands i'm having a great time vending there but this doesn't sit right with me and nucleus nucleus scares me design wise it's one of my favorite two markets of all time along with evolution in fact it reminds me so much of evolution i feel like it's too good to be true yes i would like to see more features but this has all the essentials i can think of and it's laid out in a very naturally accessible way the ui for nucleus like evolution makes for a wonderful work experience on the vendor side evolution was my favorite marketplace design wise but i was only there for weeks steady before they made off with all the moneys i don't want to fall in love with nucleus like i fell head over heels with evolution only to have my heart broken again yes nucleus i find you attractive and i really enjoy being with you but i'm jaded from all my past relationships gone wrong and have my guard up and am not going to let myself get infatuated with you and get careless again as i have before i'm going to make the most of what we have together and hope it lasts but at the end of the day too much trust in your kind always ends badly so when the day comes when you lose the fight or stab us in the back i'll be ready and i'll move on like it aint no thing.
it was actually a particular key that was causing the problem it still is but i figured out i can use any other key just not that one.
on september pmi've always been a gardener but now i am majestic.
hey kitties very happy you got iti still wait mine was sent the th quite sure tomorrow cm masters at workpeace.
uncleal on april pmhere tmg is in a league of it's own and entirely different i meant commission taking escrow offering money handling markets of the risk your capital kind not this open honest trust based forum that asks nothing in return for letting people find each other and communicate freely.
hello i'm basically new to all things darkweb i experimented with tor in my chan days but never had a legitimate need however now i do which i would like to keep private however the vendor only accepts encrypted pgp messages the problem is i have no idea how to go about doing such i read a tutorial got a program kleopatra developed a personal key however when i tried to use it the site told me pgp key with missing self signature not allowed i even went back and looked at how to add self signature and i had completed such steps it's becoming really frustrating.
i only found this place as i used to order from lucymcgee a lot she used to advertise her shop on here so i guess it is like a market in that respect i think essentially this is just a forum like the hub only more chilled out.
yahblah on september amquote from bl cksm th on september pmi can certainly say that i am addicted to tmg love and lights same here brother i wish it was more popping though i find myself logging in many times a day hoping for some topic to chat on lol i deleted my reddit account the day after i found this place very much the same with me here i logged in everyday hoping that new interesting topic will pop out lo.

looks like you've been keeping yourself busy i applaud you on your efforts to make the darknet a better place i don't really have any tech skills but i would love to help you if there is anything a non tech savy person can contribute.

i was scammed by bcdirect for two orders in may june both were for oz mushrooms for they claim they were shipped but they have no proof and i have no love letter both shipments never arrived in reading the feedback this happens a lot to bcdirect i tried to reach a agreement but i was told without a love letter they would do nothing how can i have a letter when it wasn't shipped and they offer reship only with letter ri god damn diculousall we can do those that were scammed is to let people know and look out for each other i advise not to use not to trust.

i apologize i should have elabortated specifically the darknet heros website ask for my public key upon signing up however when i paste the key i've used from the program it demands a personal signature even though the program has my faux name and email so shouldn't it have a signature what am i missing here.

this is going to be tails specific if you are not using tails already i would highly recommend it it comes preconfigured with tor gpg off the record truecrypt irc and electrum is very easy to add this tutorial could be used with linux but you would need to manually install otr and configure the proxy if anyone would like i can write a tutorial for ubuntu and debian based os open up pidgin messenger by either clicking the pidgin icon or going to applications internet pidgin the first time you open it the manage accounts tab should pop up but if it does not go to accounts manage accounts addunder accopunt type select xmpp jabberenter information as follows username pick onedomain jabber deresource leave blankpassword create onecreate new account on this server check box next click the advanced tableave the require ssl box checkedconnect port connect server okj xc j szr y onionleave the rest of the settings as they arenext click the proxy tabit should say use global settings leave that as it isclick the add button and it should log you on at this point it is important to create an otr key go to tools plugins otr off the record and make sure it is enabledclick configure plugin you will need to select the account you just created from the drop down tab it should say no key present and generate key click generate key at this point you will have an otr fingerprint when you start talking to someone from the forums or here you will need to add them to your buddy list and start a private conversation with them to do this go to the otr menu in the chat box and click start private conversation it will give you a warning that they are not authenticated click authenticate buddy and go to manual fingerprint verification have them send you a copy of their otr fingerprint either through email or the forums encrypted with your pgp key once you have made sure that the fingerprints match click authenticate buddy at this point you are communicating in real time with perfect forward secrecy this means that every chat session has a unique key and unlike email they cannot go back and decrypt your chats even if they recover your otr key mixing the tor hidden service plus otr provides you complete anonymity privacy and plausible deniability this method does not use a hidden service for file transfers but all file transfers are routed over tor i would not accept file transfers unless you completely trust the person sending the file anyone wants to chat send me a pm this tutorial uses chaos computer clubs hidden service but you can substitute any other hidden jabber service namasteinann.
thatninja on august pmquote from tm on august ami've seen more clearnet sites that sell trypamines than i have on dnms you can find al ist of vendor shops on reddit all depends on where you live of course i live in good ol' 'murica and i'm just a little sketched out about ordering thru the clearnet especially not that it really matters i guess i'm getting other international packages with hella drugs in them anyway q you really shouldn't worry they are legal chems so nothing in theory should happen but at worst customs will take them call you a bad boy and send you a letter telling you to come claim your substances if you want the.
thanks.
dirtysouf on february pmthis is the th time of rechecking the pgp certificate i cannot trust nor verify their pgp key it keeps stating their key is expired devs have been notified but no action has been taken feel free to notify em this has been going on for way to long only method of integrity check atm is to multiple checksum using rarely used checksums along with our standards how precisely are you attempting to verify the iso file if you do it from the command line it works perfectly gpg verify tails i iso sig tails i isogpg signature made fri feb pm utc using rsa key id a db gpg good signature from tails developers offline long term identity key gpg aka tails developers gpg warning using untrusted key if you look at the tails developers' key you will see the following pub r acd f expires key fingerprint a d f d a e b b ca dbb b ac d fuid tails developers offline long term identity key uid tails developers sub r a db expires key fingerprint ba c f ac ed fe c bc a db sub r f c expires key fingerprint a f c ba b d c c dcb f c sub r a revoked key fingerprint c b c d d c f aa aa e a it appears that whatever method you're using to verify the iso may not able to cope with the revoked signing sub key if you use gpg from the command line it works perfectly the fault likely lies in whatever front end you're using to attempt to verify the file there is absolutely nothing wrong with the tails developers' key spitfir.
best thing about rc vendors is finding one stop shops i usually buy small quantities of a bunch of different chems and would rather receive one international letter than several also pretty partial to my primary vendor they've done right by me for four years i think they deserve my coins if i'm looking for something they stock.
thank yo.
i guess it really depends on what you are doing on the darknet if you're vending or doing something that really puts you on the wanted list it's probably best you be as secure as possible.
i do understand it's part of the reason why i use linux i rid myself of windows awhile ago when they started forcing people onto windows.
hello all my question is how likely is it for le to pose as a vendor on a dnm new to the deepweb and dnms in general i recently got some coin and made a purchase on nucleus from a trusted vendor however i was then left over with a little change and went searching for something to buy with what i had left over i found a vendor selling single blotters and decided to buy one even though they had zero feedback on top of wanting to spend my change the product promised was something i desparately wanted to try what could possibly go wrong maybe the guy's a scammer and i lose no biggie i thought the day after however it hit me is it not possible for a vendor with no feedback to in fact be le i am extremely frustrated with myself for being so careless i spent so much time learning all of the necessary opsec protocols to stay safe and anonymous only to possibly hand over my personal info directly to the luckily it was only one dose and i am from another country than the vendor claims to be from but aren't i still at risk should i abandon my current address for all future transactions should i wipe my computer clean suffice it to say i am anxiously awaiting this package and will never make this mistake again any knowledge on this topic will be very appreciated mps.
i'll pm you an encrypted message if you like what's your public key mine's available in my signature below you can import it and practice encrypting to me if that is something you need to do as well edit nevermind i found your key pming you.

is this information still current.
done thank you.
they are so worried about the heroin yet they don't bat an eye at the horrible pharmaceutical abuse problem which is the main reason most of these kids even get to a place in their lives where they think heroin is ok to do and that's mostly because they are so physically hooked on the expensive big pharma opioids that they it only makes sense that they switch to a cheaper and far more unregulated drug like heroin these politicians are disgusting people.
thanks for sending me this mate.
where do i find the market all i can see are the message boards.
begin pgp signed message hash sha in the pgp program you are using there should be an option under one of the tabs to back up keys use that option to save a text file of both your public and private keys as far as i know you cannot change the email address on a key you will have to generate a new one during the creation of that key the program should ask you if you would like to email a backup of you keys i recommend you do once you have the key file i suggest saving it in more than one place since im almost positive it was my thread you were working with ill try and explain this better some of what your confusion is i think is with the terminology the signature in my post refers to the text links at the bottom of this post see the links there are of them vendor page review page and pgp key if you cut and paste those links into your address bar it will take you to those individual pages where ive posted that info this is not to be confused with a pgp signature the pgp signature was generated with my pgp keys on creation it allows me to sign a message other users that have my pgp public key can use that to verify that the message was in fact created by the owner of the public key the message has not been changed or edited from the original content i will sign this message and include my public key from there you can copy and paste the whole message to your decryption clipboard and use the verify function to see that it was indeed me that created this post after you do that try this copy and paste the message to the clip board just as you did previously except this time pick a random word in here and delete it because the content was edited when you verify it you will receive a different message with a standard message if you receive that error message you can now confirm or suspect that either the post was not made by the person claiming to have written it or the original content of the message had been changed which is what happened when i edited my vendor op hopefull this helps some nonya begin pgp public key block sez bmgjthow aqltnjxpxnhq ka ha jl sswr ggcttgtsbqpkex sfi hb mjtnn rel m bvor l h h kv xd vpdeltg put gfr u pv xer ful hzrr jtw iuxwgbmt uaxy t itzvp j wrgcb xnq wq r thz z vtsfandwtiwkrw krjsm ustwj fdwmr qavjpj ddy jdmi m dmznabebaag i vbnlhidxob yuj c iqe bbmbcgahbqjti tnmh rg pvoxbpx jt jdthotr jmblibkhq btodj ryooclwbl xlsc tpbiysdffndc q vuvazvjmza enb werjh kfl pgykl txdl hab jhzr vft x v qarp ocd nbfeqzffj mwhcwenyuf gjg y svlrb pzvyju fb ub q cv rgkrvukk oerrym j m vcosyackolp cehrerrsw mdr pn u ja jaounemtyt kees jd ukud aq eu ujkaeiaklyk avmvirf l to o tdcsu avklzfc zyjfywz eig vkot cmjbe dmycoir cmiki nals o fiigy shed dxdfqrpq tvlqu bk ob tes triy jhqjulqx kd xn p xninfwlk zkgby fppkq n zyqe v mvoxbmwvwuby fgkleayt udr nj ybindxkllo v wmg udq yv xu buloy hsysrg rmo u pyke ucpwmi cj ic rrcapbo mfxng f mocc raq gvnte rlynrafvj jm lbh wqjgpubl d rrkfe tp rv n np ngsyixeprpvy yh i rrgntadg mz fblzkg epos zwuqjz bjvs untphjxjry ge pyhhpe ucmqt nfq z h e up sw w eq uhdd vec g yn janno y z ihjt ip rgcc zahzsyiahqj b dlle end pgp public key block begin pgp signature version gnupg v mingw v iajs b nih nhfkexp v ignc mfvs jevilwtql pz goeg fejxt t p vi toluk whfhtavcb iftztzhh nlozb x jpflxlemom b ixgi ttnejfepzbldo qwlacziynvpz beg vj mx yuqknqfwexqv wxg cs b mdrparkgd t un sgt bi zplytaqk dqyiq ic jiqbi jggxhptsi pt hvwxuogv uo ff m wqocrm kqjjvabzfk mphg end pgp signature.

as much as this should the setting by default if you've gotten this far in the darknet process you should be doing this instinctively at the very least knowing enough that this is almost always included in all bb style forums maybe it's just me but editing forum settings security profile is usually the first thing i update for account created.
tmgkoneko and vegan just pmed codes to both of you guys those are the only codes i have for now but will share with other gardeners when if i get more invites.
you should look at a modded version of aflao bitwasp it will save you a lot of time all you are doing by the vendor anonyminity is creating extra scripting to be hacked make sure you have it all locked down if not you will have to trust in people to refund its not just a payment code with a ledger created for an escrow account and then dropped in real addresses anonymous listings lead to a whole vacuum for scams are you logging the anonyminity to the vendor so when a scam occurs there is a way to locate the scammer.
thank you everyone for your help i was looking around cause i thought i had another ap but i don't i'm either going to look at the usb lucidmotif suggested or just try whonix vm that dimitri coolbreeze suggested the computer i'm using isn't new early 's i wish i had a macbook though lmao for everyone because you are all so kind and helpful thank yousno.
anyone knows along time to get money on my wallet using shared send how many confirmations thank.
yup sent.
i was copy and pasting and when i went to past into pgp i must've misclicked or something and recopied the original text not looking i just clicked ctrl v and send so i'm just wondering if messages are stored on tmg servers even after the message is deleted and whether i should burn the address now thanks i'm still in disbelief that i did that.
bubblybubbles on february pmquote from sterlingsword on december amquote from ultrabear on december ami for one love the idea sterling but do not see the issue with some type of small fee to help cover operational expenses on your end please keep me updated on your progress as i am extremely interested in your concept thank you i will i'm trying to negotiate a deal with a vendor for free lsd anually to run the service i know i could make a lot more by taxing transactions but that's not what i'm about i'm a firm believer that more money leads to more problems don't get me wrong i love money but i'd have to deal with laundering it getting it in the first place which would require more time just stuff i don't care for i make a good living and this type of merchant system is very easy to create all of the extra stuff are the challenge but i'm only interesting in helping people out i sincerally believe that anyone that wants lsd other drugs used sparingly should have access too them to free their mind and to not only help themselves but help others if i can provide a community to peolple that will offer that that's money in and of itself for me plus i'll habe a reliable market to buy lsd on but hopefully this vendor i'm in contact with will be interested in purchasing it i have him in mins for the top vendor so he'll probably get the source regardless just with lsd i will offer more i'll see how it goes lol either way i'm developing it though  on december amwow so much thought went into this but working directly with vendors whom have proven themselves this system is hard to beat i send coin they send product simple i will never join an open market againthank you for your feedback mod that's the idea a community based on human principle trust and that is exactly what i'm aiming for an entire community of completely trusted vendors of which vendors have the ability to ban if it comes down too it you can almost gurantee that so long as you're a good customer and don't lie cheat or steal that you'll have an entire community of people such as yourselves also harder for le to penetrate with typical social engineering hi sterling great idea i agree that vendors shouldn't or probably wouldn't have an issue with at least donating a small fee to help run the site i also like money and i'm currently helping out a friend with his business and even though i don't ask for money but just to clarify how we would work things out i asked in the beginning now i am comfortable with accepting his paying for resources fuel and whatever else i might need to work and running gear i make sure of it i rarely ask for anything but he's great anyway i think it's great how you are in a way giving the control back to the vendors and really focusing on trust being what drives the wheels you remind me of myself question i was wondering how the exact product pp price stock item count the victorious vendor sale method might work if a vendor of a smaller magnitude was to go up against someone like tor or the like or maybe i just haven't worked that out yet but you have i suppose this wouldn't be showed off publicly in respect of the vendors which is a shame it's a cool idea but instead just the transaction would initiate i don't quite understand how trust of the vendors toward each other works i thought at first it was trust amongst vendors and consumers anyway goodluck with this i hope you see it through maybe at first you could keep the numbers down until all the kinks are ironed out and keep it a bit easier for you and the mods to operate goodluck hello it's been a while but i'll attempt to answer your questions question i was wondering how the exact product pp price stock item count the victorious vendor sale method might work if a vendor of a smaller magnitude was to go up against someone like tor or the like answer we would still show the calculations but factor them toward a percentage this would create a scale that is similar amoungst a user perspective moving forward we would plan on still listing the total sales or similar so that the user could also gauge how relevent the percentile actually is perhaps we would implement another factor that indicates the sales margin such that a user could more accurately depict one vendor from perhaps a scammer with only sale that was shipped still question i don't quite understand how trust of the vendors toward each other works i thought at first it was trust amongst vendors and consumers answer the method of trust would implement a purely bias trust mostly as an experiment from the biased perspective we would not intend on biased trusting but that would probably be the inevitable result given we are humans and tend to choose only what can give us something moreso the trust is more or less a way to boast the entire website would be built with a focus on honesty we are considering accounting rating with number of other vendors invited essentially and ideally we would be creating a market place that fosters honesty trust diversity and competition while rewarding all aspects of the philsophy the primary reason a vendor should and would want to invite a new vendor that they trust is so that they can provide more product to the consumer more vendors more hubs so a vendor in theory that wants to hold all of the customers for themselves would and should inevitably fail because well they can't they need support this is a team project we are all working toward delivering lsd not buying brand new lambo's that we can look at when we're older and wonder what other outcome these decisions could of had i mean think about it how many vendors have you seen rise and fall more or less due to stress and large consumer load if vendors can learn to share customers when convinient and learn that in the end they'll still get theres we'll be one step closer towards progressing to a better world.
mail systems all over the world face the same issue how to stop people from shipping illegal drugs through the system most commonly drugs ordered from dark net marketplaces are shipped through the u s postal service congress is now calling on the obama administration to figure out how to fight the growing movement of these drugs through the mail as long as there are these substances out there that are ruining people s lives we as a society are going to have to do what we can to fight that william h jones dorchester county state attorney said the u s senate committee of finance said that non letter class mail that comes into the u s through foreign postal services aren t screened the same as packages that enter through private carriers such as fedex and ups this makes illegal drugs like heroin easier to ship into the united states this is estimated to happen on a daily basis sometimes multiple times a day heroin has been a real problem and it s killing people in addition to ruining lives the question is can we do it better and always the answer to that is yes we re going to be looking for ways to do it better jones continued he also stated that there are a lot of steps to go through when trying to fight this issue finding packages carrying these illegal goods how to identify them what can be done to identify them and knowing what investigative resources they have and ultimately trying to figure out what can be done to intercept them are all questions being asked we re always going to have to look at new ways of being better at fighting that problem just the way they re looking at new and better ways to move their product and make money one of the special challenges we have is to try to make sure the way we identify the proper person either the person who was involved in the smuggling of those substances at least on the local level into this county i don t think as a society we ll ever stop jones also said when asked if he thought the obama administration would take it seriously jones said i don t think that there s anyone involved in the drug enforcement problem if you will who s not taking fentanyl seriously jones added that law enforcement can do its part locally on that level but that he doesn t expect to see a federal change anytime soon he stated in an interview like a lot of things in the government it ll take some time so in the mean time we just have to keep pushing and hope that the interdiction authorities do a good job of catching these things that our screening processes are in place so that we can try to catch more of that and hope that in time the regulations are changed so that we can catch even more before it gets here or maybe even prevent them in other countries that would be ideal.
i downloaded tails and got everything set up but for some reason it won't connect to the internet it says that i am connected has the blue bars but the videlia sp onion is nowhere to be found and i can't get on tor or the unsafe web browser i've tried unspoofing that didn't work i tried to put in a bridge and it wouldn't go through i guess i put it in wrong i don't know how though i don't know what else to try and i've been going at this for two days now any help is very appreciated thank yousnow.
never track a pack through tor go to starbucks or somewhere with free wifi and check it cheers s.
i like middle earth the user interface is very friendly and intuitive the design is delicate with pleasant colors it seems that someone really made an effort making this website comfortable for vendors and buyers i think that should be appreciated.

tails can be a pain with wifi on new machines i find works wonders on hunks of crap like old thinkpads bought for cash bricks are the way forward have you considered whonix vm instead.
ok have seen this question come up a few times so thought i would write up some thoughts that might help stimulate some conversation safety note if you are a vendor it is probably best advised if you refrain from discussing the particulars of how you handle your coins in general try to avoid mention what software or hardware you use btc walletswhy trust a web service at all you can download a lite client and handle sending and receiving from your own computer note you must configure this to run through tor if you are going to use it for buying code select can you purchase btc through electrum not afaik can you explain why electrum would be anonymous compared to coinbase online wallet it is a client side wallet ie it lives on your computer therefore as long as your ensure it is configured to run through tor it means you can receieve and send btc wihtout needing to logon to an online wallet this comes with its own ramifications one consideration is that when you start a blockchain wallet using tor perhaps blockchain notes that transaction as having been through tor can we ensure that their serves are safe from government hacks however having a bitcoin wallet on your computer means that you have total control over your btc this has its ups and downs if i were to send btcs from an online wallet to my electrum wallet would it still be anonymous were the coins bought with anything that can identify you have you ever logged onto a service that is connected to your btc over a clearnet connection therefore associating your ip to those coins this is a bit simplistic but you get the idea if they were anonymous to begin with and you have electrum setup to only run through tor then they will remain anon online blockchain if you need a wallet on the fly then you could set up a brand new wallet for each transaction you don't need to use an email address and it can be one time use only on opsec for online wallets if using them to purchase controlled substances always access them through tor never link your real life identity to these services ie register with an email that is linked to your irl identity if you logon to it not through tor this means your ip physical location is linked to that wallet abandon it immediately never logon again and create new wallet start a new wallet for each transaction you don't need to use an email at all what to do if you bought btc with your credit card across an clearnet connection suggestion blockchain shared send blockchain shared send bitcoinfog will update this as we get more input and specific questions.
just did.
cerver on february pmquote from oldisgold on february pmwhat's the best and most trustworthy btc mixer out there right now bitcoinfog i would say that bitcoinfog is the best blockchain info privides shared send and i believe it's also quite good if you're really paranoid you can chain them like you btc fog you shared send you but it's also more expensive i also think that bitcoinfog requires a minimum deposit of btc which isn't that much if you're placing a big order but should be kept in mind nonetheless.
if abraxas is not coming back and need a place to buy or sell the dream market is the place to go all my main vendors are already there registrations are currently open invite for dream market safe and have funregardsft.
thetripguy on september pmthe title says it all i've been for a while in the market and i would love to buy from dhl only vendors can give invites on dhl so hit up some vendors on here that are vending on dhl currently i think flipkart had also posted a bunch of invites for tmg members you can try pming him.
thanks even more safe from usb without vm for the backdoor issuewhen used in windowstill not clear why many people use vm must be usefull maybe when using with linux good example the elicopter so like i thought only sees i browse tor and there are many reason people can use it not just for illegality if not wrong i read on the forum about tor exit nod are compromised really don't know much of iti immagine they can see tor ip or maybe they see all and decrypt everything you dogood day for everybod.
saw that no explanation as yet but agora had closed lips in downtime and it never did them any harm only strengthening their reputation think the yanks are still sleeping but i'm sure the reddit kids will get their popcorn out in the next hours.
i considered face to face but i live in a fairly small remote town.
thanks for the guide would be useful to me if i actually knew what multisig was i would include that on your blog i know myself and probably others would find it very useful.
a dos for ransom they are actually quite common from what i have seen also there are a variety of other explanations server maintenance taking longer than expected maybe security measure being implemented huge influx in traffic from the bitcoin flux coin in and coin out when a market gets taken down by le or is the result of an exit scam you will basically know immediately.
great work cc.
ok seems like there is no eta.
assume you create a blockchain wallet that you access only through tor with no email connected to your real name or ip email address would be through an overseas service how secure is it to transfer btc straight from thatwallet to a vendor for a purchase or should i use a coin tumbling service regardless.
i just checked localbitcoin and there are plenty of people willing to do cash trades at a slight markup but their cell numbers are listed so it should be easy as making contact and meeting up in person no id proof of address or anything aside from whatever phone number you use to set up a meeting and even then you could use a burner if you're paranoid.
alphabay seems best bet to me no history of compromis.
i had actually hoped to remove only incriminating data from from my windows without using dban anybody know of a way to do this i suppose i may have to restort to just encrypting my hard drive anybody know the best way to do this with windows i've heard a lot about truecrypt unfortunately it does not work with windows as for the blockchain question i've seen comments from people who use blockchain through tor but in order to due this scripts must be enabled so i wondered how people were comfortable doing this the same goes for reddit scripts must be enabled to post how are people comfortable doing this.
cumberlandkid on september pmi am not understanding the reasoning for selecting ubuntu over tails as the more secure os they are both linux and what it boils down to is how it is configured out of the box now i haven't used tails before but i have been an ubuntu user for years what configurations could you make to ubuntu that you could not do with tails why use ubuntu and turn around and configure it to be like tails out of the box an encrypted live os with also encrypted persistent storage configured for the utmost privacy out of the box seems like a no brainer that being said if i could stick with my primary os and configure it to be just as secure if not more secure i would definitely be interested in a tutorial around that  cumberlandkid on september pmi am not understanding the reasoning for selecting ubuntu over tails as the more secure os they are both linux and what it boils down to is how it is configured out of the box now i haven't used tails before but i have been an ubuntu user for years what configurations could you make to ubuntu that you could not do with tails why use ubuntu and turn around and configure it to be like tails out of the box hi cumberlandkid the two biggest security problems with tails are lack of vpn support and as of tails when you opened your tor browser it did not notify you when there was a tor browser update available this gives a complete false sense of security because tails is at least in the back of many minds hailed as some secure operating system when this couldn't be further from the truth also tor browser hardened would help but tails does not use tor browser hardened browsing the web with an outdated version of tor browser means that the nsa doesn't even have to target your tor browser with a zero day exploit they can just use known exploits this has already been happening how the nsa attacks tor firefox users with quantum and foxacid october i don't know if tails has been improved in this regard yet since there is not a tor browser update for tails yet however tails was pretty recent still it was released in and so tails this recently to have been missing this basic functionality is egregious in comparison on an ubuntu linux install of mine when i uncompressed an old version of tor browser and launched it from a fresh directory the first thing that popped up in my tor browser firefox screen was a giant warning saying warning this browser is out of date click on the onion and then choose check for tor browser update then there is one click after clicking on the green onion in the top left of your tor browser to update it to the latest version  cumberlandkid on september pmwhat configurations could you make to ubuntu that you could not do with tails why use ubuntu and turn around and configure it to be like tails out of the box running a vpn using tor hardened running your clearnet browsing and tor browser from a vm definitely not configuring it to 'be like tails' you have way more maneuvering room to secure ubuntu better than how tails comes out of the box instead of just being stuck with what tails gives you that release  cumberlandkid on september pman encrypted live os with also encrypted persistent storage configured for the utmost privacy out of the box seems like a no brainer that being said if i could stick with my primary os and configure it to be just as secure if not more secure i would definitely be interested in a tutorial around that i would definitely keep using a different machine for your dnm activities if you have one there have been web fingerprinting methods over the years that firefox has mitigations for against certain ones now canvas blocker to block canvas fingerprinting for instance but the last time i checked a few months ago there is still no mitigation against a new tactic called audio fingerprinting you imagine accidentally using the same computer you use facebook or linkedin from and having the nsa see that this and your dnm os had the same audio fingerprint and also coming from your same home ip if you're not using a vpn also no dnm astronaut should ever install ubuntu or any other flavor of linux for their dnm os unless they let it do the full disk encryption when they first installed ubuntu or unless they immediately full disk encrypted their entire dnm computer's hard drive after install say with veracrypt or a different full disk encryption program  cumberlandkid on september pmthat being said if i could stick with my primary os and configure it to be just as secure if not more secure i would definitely be interested in a tutorial around that i may make an ubuntu for dnm activities guide but i have to consider it deeper there is a lot of fun stuff you can do to secure your own linux even if you use a different flavor way better than what tails gives you out of the box with that said if you need any advice setting things up your ubuntu securely just poke me in a pm cumberlandkid vitaminls.
hey all just wondering what market had the lead atm with the most amount of listing and users cheers dolmi.
it seems as if we all concur on some level i like it how middle earth and nucleus show active listings and they are quicker more reliable than agora which has tons of old listings that no one took down nucleus looks more like evo but i like it better blackbank is ok but i'm not sold on it yet with these three markets plus a dozen smaller ones we have the right scale and enough diversity so that no one market is dominant running these services depends on having good traffic but not crazy high traffic which giant sites have the problem is that dnms are really popular everyone is doing it acid lsd.
hello all i've heard some whispers of a market that's more geared toward strictly psychedelics stocking a little bit more obscure of the chemicals along the lines of ho mipt ho hipt etc a partner i are looking to complete the pihkal tihkal list as well as explore different level geometries any help would be greatly appreciated.
you can use the same pgp to verify it is me i sell only the best lsd at the lowest cost i can every order is shipped priority mail free of charge my most recent batch that is selling now is the same as the previous one very nice stuff you will not be disappointed you can check my credentials using grams search for 'luckyduck' or read the rules below before ordering rules double then triple check your address before submitting an order the only problems i have ever had are because people don't write their address correctly i copy and paste what you give me use a real name to a real address no fake names no abandoned homes or empty store fronts no free samples don't ask if a package will arrive at a specific time i do not control the postal system for example i cannot guarantee your package will arrive by the weekend priority shipping usually takes a max of days but sometimes for whatever reason it takes everything will be shipped within hours of purchase and your item will not me marked shipped until after it has been dropped off at a postal box i also do not under any circumstance ship using overnight delivery there will never be a signature required for anything you receive from me i won't answer a question that can be answered by reading this page however i will do my best to respond to your inquiries quickly but my first priority is getting your orders packed up and in the mail i only ship from the usa to to others in the usa if you would like something sent to another country pm me and we might be able to work something out pgp only this is serious all non encrypted orders will be canceled non address related communication does not need to be encrypted please log back in and finalize as soon as you can once you receive it's just good manners i treat my customers well and expect the same in return if there is any problem with your order talk to me first before leaving feedback if poor feedback is left without trying to resolve the situation with me first there will be no resolution refund or reship given i am very easy to work with so just message me and we will work it out be safe and have fun the product each batch is tested i will turn down a batch if it does not meet my standards i have never once received a single complaint about the quality of my lsd in fact i've only received glowing reviews every site that i have ever vended on has always had a spotless record never anything below a so you can buy with confidence i will not sell a product that doesn't meet my high standards this is a business and i run it like one security is important to me your safety is a big priority for my customers and myself all precautions are taken very seriously from the start beginning with using a secure os and a highly regarded pgp tool with an extremely strong password for decryption the computer that is used was bought with cash hard drive was remove and only boots from an encrypted memory card this computer never touches the clear net it has also has never been exposed to any java script and never will hardware and software firewalls are used i never store any of your information aside from the order number and the corresponding tracking number which are kept encrypted and well hidden this information is deleted using a very through piece of software as soon as the order has arrived packaging is done in the utmost clean environment packing materials are all bought with cash from different locations all postage is bought with cash from locations no where near the places your orders are dropped all packages have printed labels that are printed using an extremely common printer that was bought with cash every package employs a decoy while packing quality gloves are worn every step of the way and are changed frequently throughout the process stealth is something i take seriously i've done this for a long time and have never had a package seized i have been a vendor for several years on many markets and have done so without incident i won't state my prior usernames for security reasons sometime i take long breaks from operating when a site goes down exit scam or seized then i start fresh with a new identity so as not to be linked to previous compromised sites each time i come back i start out as a new vendor and each time i quickly gain a good reputation and loyal customers i have never acted dishonest scammed or stolen in anyway from anyone online or in real life it's just not something i could do and still sleep at night even when there have been incidents of seized sites like sr or exit scams i have always honored the pending orders placed even though i loose money those customers also lost money and i feel like they should get what they paid for or at least what they tried to pay for i'm not greedy nor do i have a big ego so you will not see me on forums or elsewhere doing any kind of self promotion i let my feedback and word of mouth do that for me this is a one man band and i keep my prices low and quality is high therefor my profit margin is slim you will sometimes see others with lower prices but that may be because they import their product they don't know the quality or even if it is real lsd until it arrives while i pay more for my product and source it locally so i know that before i purchase it is lsd and high quality you get a real product from me as well as good stealth and quick shipping that you can count on when you buy from me you are keeping your money in our country economy and helping those that work to produce it as well begin pgp public key block

you aren't wrong so i've set up a fresh copy on a partition installed tor truecrypt and pgp are there any more security measures i can be taking if it isn't too much hassle for someone could you try sending me an encryped email which i can reply to just to get to grips with how it works that would be much appreciated is there a computer based email client i could use safely such as thunderbird thanks a lot.
done thanks for the heads up.
for now it seems not possible to register new useraccounts full speed maybe if someone has usefull register links would be much appreciated stay safe fre.
well bit blender went smoothly took less than mins then i went to deposit to a blockchain wallet and it sent fine address was for sure correct and everything but now blockchain is giving me an error when i try to log on error web server is down my javascript is also temporarily allowed like you have to do to see the captcha so that's not it hope this is resolved soon i was just logged onto my wallet and then the second i sent them to that wallet from bit blender i went to make sure they went through then it gave me the error edit ok just found out blockchain is down therefore blender worked flawlessly in less than mins hope the issues at blockchain get sorted out soon though that's for sure peace mrs b.
thanks katamangood one buy a laptop and use only for dn tails usb encryption disactivate java will be start don't really understand using in v m if is for extra layer of opsec or just to save staffi will never ever let any third part to encrypt for me what do you think about crack wifi and browse dn must be even more safe thank yo.
loading tails off of a usb drive will be more than enough in terms of keeping your hardware hidden secure java is much different than javascript javascript is a lightweight computer programming language scripting language that allows small scripts or programs to be run over the web java is basically a programming language for portable cross platform computer programs cracking someone else's wifi won't really help you much and i don't condone using other individuals' internet connections for illegal activity how would you feel if one day police broke down your door and arrested you for absolutely no reason other than someone living half a block from you had poor opsec learning to properly test attack and break into someone's network takes lots of time and a fair understanding of networking and can get you in trouble as well not worth it a vpn is not the same as a v m vm stands for virtual machine which is a program that is used to create a virtual computer inside the memory of your physical computer vpn stands for virtual private network this is a service provided by many companies where and this is a very basic explanation all incoming and outgoing information is first sent through a remote server it hides your internet usage from your isp internet service provider.
fantastic guide i was able to get tails set up in an hour last night with this.
ronpaulson on august pmi think the biggest barrier is just getting the capital to get them synthed a lot of labs have a kg minimum or more for custom synt.
inanna on april amlelantos has had great uptime and i suggest them to everyone ussrmail was down half of the time so i switched over to lelantos just make sure to encrypt everything and be careful about what you put for subject headers i have seen a lot of vendors mention lelantos might have to set up an email there when the time comes i know an email isn't essential in using the dn but it couldn't hurt to have one setup the right way.
for a simple introduction to tails.
i remember reading on chemsrus that lizardlabs doesn't ship to the us is that still true.

on february pmthe friendly admins have enabled the feature that allows us to opt out of appearing online when we are to do this go to profile account settings then uncheck the option that shows people you are online everyone do this here's some food for thought on why quotethis is because of all those fbi probability attacks they monitor when you activate tor when you log into sites like say this site if it is ever compromised or safe mail which announces to everybody when you are online and then present this incourt and it's apparently solid evidence because plenty of people like jeremony hammond of lulzsec fame got convicted through simple meta data this guy appeared on irc at this time we monitoredhis wifi signal yes they can pinpoint your wifi signal if under surveillance and he was using tor exactly the same time that's all it takes looks like the topic where you get this  should be pretty interesting and full of information can you paste the link tks for the tip.
because i'm technically retarded i would do this make a new key on tails put the public key in the pgp thread here encrypt a pm to the new key that has the old key information decrypt it on tails and import whatever you needthis way you don't have to learn how to do anything and you can just send the stuff inside of an encrypted pm to yourself then delete the pm you could also do this via an email account but not actually send the email.
coldcuts on june amstarted looking at it like my second home best online community i had ever came across love ya guys i feel you brother friends in almost completely anonymity and it certainly feels like hom.
cosmic consciousness on june amquote from vitaminlsd on june amquote from ssod on june amcurrently i am connecting to the darknet via tails tor bridges i feel as this is not a very safe unless i am wrong anyone have any advice on additional security measures to protect my real ip i get bulk so safety is a big concern to me let me know if my lack of faith in bridges is invalid though tails is not secure for serious dnm activities and here's the first reason why usa feds have already conducted tor attacks that have landed significant dnm figures behind bars the above article has more details about how the feds did it and who they have arrested so far a former silk road lieutenant for starters also tor bridges are practically useless for hiding from the nsa because the nsa harvests the tor bridge addresses from the emails send to from the tor project the nsa knows you're using tor anyways if you're using a tor bridge tor bridges were designed for people in repressive third world countries not us citizens hiding from the nsa it also gets worse and this is information that every dnm user serious or small should know about but since the edward snowden leaks the nsa has talked about if not bragged that they have timing attacks for de anonymizing tor users at the nsa in the washington post revealed that the nsa had figured out various ways of unmasking and penetrating the anonymity of the tor network since according to a page research paper titled simply tor the agency has worked on several methods that if successful would allow the nsa to uncloak anonymous traffic on a wide scale effectively by watching communications as they enter and exit the tor system rather than trying to follow them inside one type of attack for example would identify users by minute differences in the clock times on their computers and it still gets worse tor prioritizes fast relays and so if you consider that plausibly speaking many and possibly most of the most high speed tor relays are run by western intelligence agencies and not just grassroots tor volunteers it makes timing attacks so much easier for them from the pando com article from above quotein tor co founder roger dingledine revealed that the tor network is configured to prioritize speed and route traffic through through the fastest servers nodes available as a result the vast bulk of tor traffic runs through several dozen of the fastest and most dependable servers on today's network clients choose one of the fastest exit relays around of the time and of their choices come from a pool of relays this information above has already been public since the edward snowden leaks so now everyone reading this has no excuse not to get off tails and learn ubuntu or your other favorite flavor of linux and start using a reputable vpn impeccable track record of standing up against government requests keeps no logs and you can pay them in bitcoins you can start on this now or end up like the silk road lieutenant who got arrested because his tor connection got de anonymized by the government to what was probably his home ip address and if you're a serious dnm user you don't do business hours a day online from a public wifi spot this is not an acceptable solution for power users bonus points if you use a pre paid g hotspot with your non tails flavor of linux a reputable vpn where your face was never on camera buying the hotspot think fake wig cell phone at home and paid in cash true story great advise i however use a preconfigured travel router can be found on amazon called gl inet and flashed it with dd wrt and open vpn i then uploaded several vpn config files onto the router itself and foced all traffic through the vpn add to that i only plug in i never use wifi so the travel router is connected to the wan port from ethernet over power extender and then wired through the lan port into my machine i run tail when on the go and whinox when home i also 'bridge' into the tor network on start up and never use persistant memory i feel it is more secure to have my content keys keymanager etc stored on a seperate encrypted usb thumb drive that i then upload my keys before i go live so im essentially between my machine and the vpn that is then relaying those packets through a bridged connection into the tor i highly suggest you use aws to spawn yourself a vpn i feel it is more secure to have your very own vpn config rather than use one that is shared by others that's cool that you're using a vpn router that is definitely another good option besides the g hotspot i just threw out the g hotspot tip since it would be easier for most non tech folk to get working when you use your own aws vpn server though are you ever concerned that if you logged in to a clearnet website or did anything that the feds would know that login was or just that web browsing traffic was you are you ever concerned that you're the only vpn connection going to that server since the nsa could see you're the only connection going to your server on tcp or whatever port you configured it to listen on if your original network connection is coming from a g hotspot or something other than your home ip address you wouldn't be in bad of shape compared to if you were connecting from your home ip but you basically get no cover traffic by using your own vpn server plus you need to pay for it anonymously but you seem crafty and there's a few ways to do anonymous payments like that to the credit of commercial vpn providers and not all of them but there is at least one company i know of that takes their security very seriously and in some of the countries where they run a vpn server they own their own hardware including in the most secure country where they have servers and in their most secure country too they personally know the people who operate the data center they also have a track record of not accommodating government information requests nor in the other countries but say with their usa nodes they would have no control if the feds showed up with a gag order and took their vpn server's second hard drive that had the server's ssl private keys on it but at least on their certain overseas nodes this will basically never happen since they know the people who run the datacenter and they own their own hardware there.
hi thanks kitties i will i know is the best soo far peace and light for c.
is there any way to have this enabled by default.
i thought so too didnt take too long to figure out it's more like craigslist than ebay still in my limited experience a better forum than the reddit one.
before i found tmg ive always used alphabay thats was after agora went outta business.
summa iru on april amyou just made a thread in the best market you're already there here as far as psychedelics everything you could want is here and in my opinion psychedelics are the only 'drugs' worth pursuingwell put cannot agree more.
electrum already uses change addresses which makes it harder to be tracked back to your wallet nothing is safe.
hi i just came here from the active market list in reddit only to find its just the forum i have an agora account so im not new to this but thought this was a market but have now created a bb acoun.
new her.
just a heads up that mr blotter from the hansa is a scammer see here at reddit for more information on this pos clearnet url.
flourpower on august pmi thought so too didnt take too long to figure out it's more like craigslist than ebay still in my limited experience a better forum than the reddit onelike night and day this is a community of like minded seekers hoping to benefit one and other reddit is well reddit is reddit welcome.
long overdue finally got tails installed everything feels weird new is good i guess i have used pgp usb and have stored keys in there ect how do i import them into tails i basically followed the guide and somewhat stuck thank.
damn just missed the boat if anyone could hook a brotha up that'd be cheers.
tbh ever since i became a part of the tmg family i have never went back to any actual market when i first started i swore by only going escrow the relationship between customers and vendors is unbelievable here in the garden never have i felt so comfortable doing dd today its been nothing but dd with success i sure hope it stays that way here cheers.
tmg can be a market a cool place to hangout and meet cool people and its also a place you can call home users and vendors in tmg can be your best friend or even family but it is not and i hope it will not be reddit.
it's more like a dating is illegal but what happens between two consenting adults is drugs online is still illegal though.
i apologize if i am out of place why are you running and not.
i can certainly say that i am addicted to tmg love and lights.
i got fucked for goddamn motherfucker.
best wallet for a vendor can anyone help me set up bitcoin armory wallet i am scared of blockchai.
would this method be sufficient lbc wallet clearnet multibit wallet clearnet helix or bitblender dnm.
abraxas for sure its a winner cheer.
would just like to make a shout out to within a couple of days of registering i ran into him and we arranged something curteous prompt and to the point lovely fellow great deal will review when the tabs come around.
what pope says is spot on and that program is very good pop.
the title says it all i've been for a while in the market and i would love to buy from dhl.
cotlakqueque on april pmwhere do i find the market all i can see are the message boards this is a garden full of wise people you can learn from every day the market is over there there there.
on april pmit's more like a dating is illegal but what happens between two consenting adults is drugs online is still illegal though correct however tmg is an informational research and educational platform where educated individuals can share life experience's.
abraxas i don't feel good about nucleus being a reseller i can't afford to have someone take off with my coin.
on vacation for a while though probably several more months from the sound of it.
sad i know the tmg isn't perfect well sort of but if a vendor goes rouge we typically know before major scam can be pull off the gardeners here work the fields and we enjoy the fruits of their labor as it should be thanks for news helps to remind us why we are here.
just posted it here but this seems to be good place too i sent btc to bitcoinmixer info yesterday and i still haven't received anything back i've sent a note to the site asking what's going on but they haven't answered yet has anyone any suggestions on what to do guess there isn't much i can do except warning everyone not to use the service until the matter is settled i'll update as soon as i get word from them hopefully should this really turn out to be a scam i'll open a separate thread to increase visibility please please let it be some kind of mistake.
why not try abraxas.
tmg is more like a hook up market you can converse with vendors or customers alike and strike up a relationship of sorts share info etc not a market in the traditional sense of the word.
are you talking about dream or nuc on nucleus they do that but on dream the pgp is optional i have asked how to make it a pgp required login and never got a reply from admi.
sometimes it takes a long time to connect to tor depending on different factors have you tried just leaving it alone for up to or minutes and seeing if it connects to tor then.
i like nucleus middle earth i saw some kid was on middle earth at this coffee shop on his laptop those eagles they do look pretty harmless i wouldn't have known i'm setting up on black bank soon ootp is on there and a few other vendors i use feeling good about everything not agora we should have markets ideally so something for eeveryone but i'm trying to stay close to home if you know what i mean good luck markets.
cotlakqueque on april pmi'm confused is majestic garden a marketplace just like agora evolution nucleus etc if so where is the link to it this is not correct.
k on october ami think a lot of us were confused as exactly what tmg was isyes me too as i began to read this thread and right now i am impressed by the love you all are showing for new members.
salamander on june pm you can sort of look at it as a place that you can come to discuss products vendors and other markets or anything else really hell a lot of vendors out there are on here daily it is a place where you can meet those vendors and their costumers and chat with them so that when you do decide to order you can order in confidence knowing that they have been vetted through the community this place really is magesticvery well said plus it seems like all the best deals float around here and unmatched generosity and love its nice being able to talk with the best vendors of multiple markets.
so i friend recently turned me on to bridges and leveled my opsec up but i'm still having some issues he gave me bridges he personally uses and said they were all solid however when i put them in and the connectiing to tor thing comes up it just gets stuck there i don't know if this just takes longer than i expected but i waited a good min and it never connected the progress bar started but stayed frozen in one place any help would be greatly appreciated.
on february pm can you purchase btc through electrum not afaikquote can you explain why electrum would be anonymous compared to coinbase online wallet it is a client side wallet ie it lives on your computer therefore as long as your ensure it is configured to run through tor it means you can receieve and send btc wihtout needing to logon to an online wallet this comes with its own ramifications one consideration is that when you start a blockchain wallet using tor perhaps blockchain notes that transaction as having been through tor can we ensure that their serves are safe from government hacks however having a bitcoin wallet on your computer means that you have total control over your btc this has its ups and downs  i were to send btcs from an online wallet to my electrum wallet would it still be anonymous were the coins bought with anything that can identify you have you ever logged onto a service that is connected to your btc over a clearnet connection therefore associating your ip to those coins this is a bit simplistic but you get the idea if they were anonymous to begin with and you have electrum setup to only run through tor then they will remain anon.
got weed on june pmno other way besides you should be switching up your bridges every week or two quotewhy using the same bridges over a longer period is probably safer see.
dockellis on august pmquote from flourpower on august pmi thought so too didnt take too long to figure out it's more like craigslist than ebay still in my limited experience a better forum than the reddit onelike night and day this is a community of like minded seekers hoping to benefit one and other reddit is well reddit is reddit welcome reddit is a honey pot the place where u start losing your first money if this is how u got to dnms or the place where u get misguided in buying exactly what u don't want the place where shill and scamery takes off.
it's possible to use tails with a vpn but it's not really necessary unless you are administering a darknet market or hacking nsa servers you will be quite safe even with the standard tails installation that doesn't support vpns but it's possible to install a vpn on a router and then configure tails to route everything through this router you'll find plenty of good openvpn providers eg airvpn org but you'll have to pay a monthly fee for this service preferably using bitcoin then you'll have to choose whether you want to run tor over vpn or vpn over tor but unless you know well what you are doing it's probably better to just use tails without any vpn.
looking to buy lsd in new zealand south island today other seller fell through now trying this avenue can pay.
thank you.
queen on october am i don t think that there s anyone involved in the drug enforcement problem if you will who s not taking fentanyl seriously isn't taking fentanyl without a prescription illegal does everyone involved in the drug enforcement problem have a prescription for fentanyl is it worse to take it seriously than to take it recreationally this seems serious.
short and simplified answer because it is not end to end encrypted when somebody catches your traffic everyone hosting an exit node can catch that le hosts some exit nodes for that purpose you are fucked you just gave away your address and time of arrival pm me if you want me to link you to some good safety stuff i would strongly advise you to do so.
gleeful on june pmthanks for the great explanation i use ubuntu already since i have essentially abandoned windows because it sucks so hard with ubuntu and the vpn set up does it make sense to run tor through the vpn as an extra layer if so what package does ubuntu have available to run tor thanks yes absolutely you want to run tor through your vpn at all times for your vpn on linux i recommend mullvad and just to keep things neater in this thread for anyone reading it later i'm typing up my next post after this why mullvad is badass for dnm ops and how to install it on ubuntu what you want to install to get tor browser working on ubuntu is the tor browser file from the tor project website if your computer has gb of ram i recommend the tor browser hardened version only available for linux and it's hardened against certain types of exploits but it's a memory hog and uses about times as much memory as normal tor browser on linux but if you have the hardware for it the hardened version is totally worth it you can download tor browser hardened from this page on the tor project website it's under its own section called hardened tor browser you can't miss it be sure to download the signature file too and verify the signature if you've never done it before here's the command but first you'll need the tor browser developers pgp public key if you haven't downloaded it already instructions how to get it are on the webpage here on ubuntu the command would just be quotegpg keyserver x hkp pool sks keyservers net recv keys x e c e you can verify that this key says tor browser developers and that you didn't typo it by running this command if you like quotegpg fingerprint x e c e this will output something like quotepub r expires key fingerprint ef e d da ea a ba de e c e uid tor browser developers signing key sub r f c expires sub r d e expires then this is the signature verify command assuming you are in the directory where you saved both of these files quotegpg verify tor browser linux a hardened all tar asc tor browser linux a hardened all tar should say something like quotegpg good signature from tor browser developers signing key if it verified successfully then to run tor browser hardened it's honestly just as easy as extracting the tar file if you are in the same directory as the tor browser hardened tar file it goes like this quotetar xvjf tor browser linux a hardened all tar will have made a folder called tor browser now change directories there and run the start tor browser desktop file like this  tor browser desktopit should respond with exactly this quotelaunching ' browser start tor browser detach' then you are good to go there are also a few very specific config changes and setting changes and so on that should be made in tor browser to harden it even more maybe i could write a tor browser hardening post for linux to share here on tmg this week and if your dnm computer doesn't have the hardware for tor browser hardened you can just use the same commands as above just replace the tor browser hardened filenames with the normal tor browser filenames for the download you get from that same page as above on the tor project website gleeful if you run into any problems feel free to pm me or better yet just post it in the thread here so if anyone else has the same issue we can fix it together i'll check in here a few times a day this week in case you have any issues you run into.
ccleaner and bleachbit a must.
gleeful on june pmthanks i really appreciate it yw mullvad post coming in seconds i swear it's the easiest vpn to ever set up on ubuntu you just download it and run two commands to install it.
i have noticed that a great number of you appear to be using safe mail net as your email provider of choice i would strongly urge you to re consider on january forbes contributer runa a sandvik published an article entitled the email service the dark web is actually using you can read this article at i reached out to safe mail for comment amiram ofir safe mail s president and ceo responded in an email that the company and its employees certainly are not aware of any criminal activity adding that the company does follow court orders that are issued in israel by an israeli court any other law enforcement agency should contact the israeli authorities it s worth noting however that israel signed a mutual legal assistance treaty mlat with the u s in an mlat request was used to image the silk road web server according to the criminal complaint of sept ofir told me that communications between users and the web service are ssl protected and that information stored on the server is encrypted with user specific keys when asked if safe mail has received court orders issued by an israeli court on behalf of a non israeli law enforcement agency such as the fbi ofir replied with a short yes my followup email asking if safe mail has the ability to decrypt information without a user s key went unanswered you can bet your life that if safe mail's owners operators didn't know about any criminal activity before being contacted by forbes they sure as hell know about it now they may or may not have known about the huge number of people from silk road and other dnms using their service but the forbes article if nothing else will have forced them to take action lest they be considered complict if they do nothing to curb such activity it would not surprise me in the slightest to learn that emails are now scanned for certain keywords certain patterns of usage may now be flagged as well on agora there is one vendor who claims his safe mail account was disabled or shut down meaning he can no longer access it my tests have shown this account is still active meaning that messages sent to this account are likely being collected by the authorities for vendors especially please remember that even if you use pgp the header information is not encrypted or protected the authorities even if they cannot read your messages nevertheless know who wrote to you and when spitfir.
alot has happened in the past month it seems like a few rare events regarding markets and bitcoins have put people in a state of worried frenzy this may be a good opportunity to explore what all this means to us personally as well as a whole it certainly has been exciting i hope that this all wasn't too good to be true and if it is than that is the way it is meant to be.
any advice on cleaning my computer now that i am using tails exclusively whereas before i was using windows does tor store any information about sites visited onto my computer or do i only need to worry about deleting pgp keys and such what's the best way to go about completely wiping these things anything else i should be worried about what are the risks associated with enabling scripts on blockchain or reddit.
on may pmany advice on cleaning my computer now that i am using tails exclusively whereas before i was using windows does tor store any information about sites visited onto my computer or do i only need to worry about deleting pgp keys and such what's the best way to go about completely wiping these things anything else i should be worried about what are the risks associated with enabling scripts on blockchain or reddit i'm still learning about opsec but i will try and help if you are using tails exclusively on that machine i would recommend a dban nuke it deletes everything off of you computer just google dban download the file to a cd or usb and then you can wipe all contents of the computer while keeping tails safe on a usb tails is an amnesia systems when you exit tails your computer system is wiped of all knowledge of the tails session although i believe your isp may still be able to tell you were using tor not sure on this no need to delete pgp keys files or the like from your persistent folder tails is encrypted as long as your have a strong pass phrase for the system you are good to go as always forbid scripts globally see the s to the left of the url bar click it i am not sure on the reddit question just don't associate accounts and use a new identity to view pages like that if you are using the blockchain for your wallet i recommend you stop download and use the electrum wallet client there are many write ups on this if you have any other questions feel free to ask or pm me i do not know everything about opsec but i will help you if i can cheers rhet.
iambic poetry on october pmdamn just missed the boat if anyone could hook a brotha up that'd be cheers i sent you a pm ambe.
as long as there is a postal system and the smallest of rights to privacy the drugs will keep flowing they will never wipe out postal smuggling especially with the ridiculous amounts of legit packages being sent from internet orders international shipments are another story as they are seriously cracking down on packs from certain flagged countries but if they could have found a sure fire way to stop drugs from being shipped domestically they would have decades ago when people first thought to send drugs through the mail.
in tails once you have a key in passwords and keys you can get the public key by just selecting the key and ctrl c if you double click it you can navigate through to the private key keepassx is more of a password manager but i also use it as a vault for pgp keys and other things i save them as ascii text files and save them as attachments in keepassx and the only persistence i use is to store my keepassx db so when i start tails i have to unlock my keepassx db export any pgp keys i want and then import them into the passwords and keys thing that's also the clipboard icon up by the clock by the way you can encrypt decrypt things from your clipboard from there i'm pretty sure there's a persistence option for those pgp keys if you aren't as paranoid as me i don't know what pgp usb is but if you can get the keys out of it or off of it or whatever you can always just copy them to a usb drive mount it in tails and copy them over if you don't have another thumb drive you can mount the persistent volume from another linux box it's just luks.
ok i quit being lazy for a second and just looked up how to default this off for all new members this just tested out successfully for a new user on a test forum edit the file sources register phparound line right above registration options are always default options add this regoptions 'extra register vars' 'show online' it already knew that was a potential possible registration option so maybe there's a simpler way to do it but it works so that would obviously cover all new user registrations but you would still want to run that query to disable it for all existing users just once update smf members set show online obviously use whatever your forum table prefix is if not smf i try to forget how horrible php is so hopefully someone actually runs with this and the minutes it took to check this out wasn't in vain.
if you google pgp encryption site the first listing is igolder a gold trading site with pgp help then software wike etc my first question is if you use a clearnet site like that one that does the encrypt decrypt can all you type in become open to prying eyes i know that sounds naive but i really don't know second how important is key size and a bonus third question say i'm browsing my favorite vendors for fun and then go to search a word on google is mixing tor with clearnet a security problem.
hope everyone who needs to get in sees this it is a wonderful place i just wish jack would bring back the thin mint.
dolmio on april ami dont see why buyers have to fear about this because le would try to match the timing of you being online and your tor or vpn activity not but some paranoia is healthy it doesn't hurt i guess but i like to live dangerously so fuck it.
yeah agora's been in limbo for a while now i would advise you not to deposit or accept any money there until it's been stable for a while great market when it's more stable but this has been a bad time.
doseheavy on november pmyou should look at a modded version of aflao bitwasp it will save you a lot of time all you are doing by the vendor anonyminity is creating extra scripting to be hacked make sure you have it all locked down if not you will have to trust in people to refund its not just a payment code with a ledger created for an escrow account and then dropped in real addresses anonymous listings lead to a whole vacuum for scams are you logging the anonyminity to the vendor so when a scam occurs there is a way to locate the scammer yes their will be internal data logging disputes are still able to be made and messages sent to from vendors through the product page there will be a spot to ask questions no identiy from vendor will be shown unless question is answered this allows vendors the ability to conceal themselves should a user that's been suggested as le somehow gets in and hasn't yet been banned will still display vendor names the anonymity for the vendor buying would only be for the listings once a question is asked on the product the instant chat window if java enabled would still display the vendor you're communicating with if java isn't enabled you'd have the same typical html html screen as mem did also one vendor voted by all of the rest with the best reviews undecided will ultimately be given king status on the site giving them the ability to override small features and veto console votes that have been performed by the community they will be able to prioritize vendor inventory such as auto direct sales to vendor's stash instead of vendor's stash if vendor has an item that vendor has there will be a smart sense feature that dissalows similar items to be posted as a means to bypass this king admin will have ability to modify but this feature will be stricly difficult and will require much more approval from the vendor congress vendors on vacation mode will opt out and or auto vote not yet decided still working on the philsophy and bugs within the business logic aspect of the site but overall that's the general solution i'm thinking of essentially a darknet congress i don't have the full plan layed out yet which is why i'd like some feedback and i didn't mean to be nasty in my previous message dh i'm sorry if i came out that way at all i don't want to but i do this type of work fairly often so i'm extremely confident that i can architect a flawless system or atleast should a flaw be noted a solution would be implemented that would please everyone i have no interested in making anything off of the site either i just want lsd so no fee's for transactions or tax withdrawal crap that i've seen at other places but there might be a tax for funds that are transferred in and withdrawn without a purchase the system won't be intended to be a tumbler service so that type of activity will be looked down upon edit i have added donation abilities and details onto the original post if anyone would like to assist.
vendors should look at this seem to really be legit and fully encourage multi sig and discouragefe i was able to quickly set up an account and add a public key the site looks very appealing.
thanks again dude you're a very helpful person.
i don't think i've ever seen a market act like eic they seemed so legit to me site was clean functional and responsive then all of a sudden the admins went dark i can't for the life of me figure out why they are still live with the withdrawals and deposits not working it's a very situation indeed definitely do not put any btc into the site until everything is functional even if does become functional again i would proceed very cautiously.
hello you may know us or you may not it wouldn't matter i have put some time into finding similar like minded well educated freshly minted physicians who have offered to provide a little bit of their time to answering any question you may have on combining or concurrent drug usage or anything related to the use misuse abuse or enjoyment of psychoactive compounds we they do not judge and we do not ave a stigma against drug usage we they can only advise you on the safety at the bottom of the barrel it will end up being your own choice if you would like to know ow a drug works why it works how to recover and anything else related to your health send drintoxication an email my collaborators will likely be checking it more often than myself better that way they are licensed and practicing doctors who have offered to give up a little bit of their time to addressing question and help users we will also start to publish question that are good or that we feel would help everyone on a bi monthly basis please don't send question about item in my store or anything that has anything to with the purchasing or acquisition of your materials i am not the one who will be reading them i can barely handle a small surge here and sometime have spotty communication they will be checked by dr x and dr y who have no idea regarding the products that are online the prices or any of that other stuff they know neurobiology pharmacology substance abuse treatment physiology and all that other stuff they are 'freshly minted' liberal minded forward thinking like minded folk who are usmle approved physicians this inbox will be their first time using tor they are doing this out of a growing concern with various rc's used in combination or in conjunction with classical drugs and causing potentially life threatening cocktails health harm reduction drintoxication sigaint org with llovecosmi.
it seems that tails provides email services anyone would have a comment regarding this oops sorry i misinterpreted this post here will secure the email service i will use not provide an email service.
yeah windows sucks bad because they are collecting privacy too much i wonder if there are ways to stop windows from that but if you are vending then it would be best to have linux for tor.
very nic.
janesmith on may pmhow do you link your pgp key in your profile sig looks like you got it.
if you're really worried about security buy a laptop locally with cash and only use it for browsing dn however a tails usb is easy to use and offers basically equal security never send any identifying incriminating information over tor without pgp encryption or to an untrusted source and never trust any third party such as a market or even tmg to encrypt your messages for you as mirrormirror said don't torrent over tor you can use a vpn or proxy to torrent safely from your home tails automatically offers mac spoofing by default across the board as well.
i've had nothing but great experiences on blackbank originally only signed up there because i saw was on there and i'm pretty glad i did because it's been pretty consistent only thing is not too much variety but i'm only really on these marketplaces for acid anyways so it's fine with me agora is sometimes up sometimes down like now middle earth marketplace is pretty quick now too eventually i think i want to just work direct with some of these vendors through this forum seems better to develop a long term relationship that way.
britneystoke on may ami would not recommend currently using agora i have always loved the site but a lot of peoples deposits are not showing up lately my deposit has not showed for days with no reply from support i would recommend using alphabay or maybe abraxas till agora gets there shit figured out agora is now up and running full speed ahead captain cook.
oldisgold on february pmwhat's the best and most trustworthy btc mixer out there right now bitcoinfog i would say that bitcoinfog is the best blockchain info privides shared send and i believe it's also quite good if you're really paranoid you can chain them like you btc fog you shared send you but it's also more expensive.
you'll want to make javascript enabled and browser urlbar filter javascript value false to turn off java.
abraxas market is down including all alternative links and there is talk on ddw about an exit scam i really hope it is not the case of my favourite markets but cant help not thinking about the predicament of human greed peac.
if this does exist then i'd love to be a part of it the dnms that i use barely have an novel tryptamines i really want to try them all i guess i've been pretty lucky just to experiment with the ones that have found me so far i think the biggest barrier is just getting the capital to get them synthed and with a medium sized group to contribute that shouldn't be a huge problem.
maybe some vpn providers can be trusted but it's hard to tell before there is an actual problem their claims are mostly marketing in my opinion the market is competitive who would be stupid enough to admit logging and who would go to jail to protect a month user i don't know swedish law their claims can be true but they could be greedy entrepreneurs logging as much as they can to be on the safe side or even a honeypot sadly we have no way to tell mullvad software seems to only create firewall rules to block anything that's not going through vpn network interface setting up iptables to do this would work as good restoring an image is nice but if the host is compromised your image can be compromised too a skilled attacker could escape the vm a dvd can't be compromised by a distant attacker the bios could be but it's harder and probably not worth it to catch a small time buyer physical isolation is said to be better than software isolation more complicated and costly to set up but should be solid even more so if each system lives in ram and starts from a read only media for most users tails or tbb on linux with a strong firewall is probably enough don't you think so if you want to be extra safe use an air gaped machine to encrypt your stuff and keep your private key at worse if your tor box is compromised there won't be keys or unencrypted messages on it tails is nice because you don't need to read a lot of documentation to get started it works out of the box and it is supposed to be secure if you trust those who created the iso if you wanted to fight against anonymity and be willing to add a back door somewhere wouldn't a distribution aiming at providing anonymity be on top of the list.
no other way besides you should be switching up your bridges every week or two.
haha i started that topic and never noticed it was that's pretty cool thanks for the shout out scroat pgp really is quite a simple program to find and use i am one of the least computer literate people i know i still type with fingers and ask my yr old brother how to work an ipad but i googled pgp guide and was able to set it up myself so young cabinboy eruger your quest begins test out your best google fu and find yourself an installation guide follow the link above to the pgp trial thread where you will find my public key send me an encrypted message then plunder the darkweb fer all the treasure ye can carry happy questing captain.
this sounds interesting no clue if such a site exists or not though keeping my fingers crossed.
what about safe bad anyone know.
good guide to you i've always heard about tails but never knew really what it was until now i'll be doing this very soon thank.
best of luck with your sales here luckyduck.
nonya i tried your exercise it worked thanks i sent you a pm.
or getting a fairly good price quick sheet domestic if can help thanks.
it is a community.
has disabled account creation so people would use create other xmpp servers tbh i think it would be easier to use crypto cat the only difference is that you need to check the other person's identity manually this could easily be done with pgp.
here.
what an amazing discussion after reading everyone's posts i thought i would mention something that may have been overlooked here's a disclaimer i'm sure everyone at mullvad are spot on in what they believe in when it comes to privacy and with what they're trying to accomplish at mullvad and i am in no way doubting that at all i'm only looking to disseminate information and perhaps my humble opinions sweden is one of the eyes and mullvad being a swedish company with their home servers located in sweden operates in the land of the eyes and i've always stayed away from all vpn providers that operate out of any of the eyes countries whether they have a strong association or a weak alliance with the american nsa countries that make up the eyes are not privacy friendly and i would only use vpn services and vpn servers located outside of the land of the eyes here's something about the eyes for those who might be interested.
there have been a lot of posts on reddit about security issues the site itself looks nice and multi sig only is a plus i have a vendor account there just waiting for a little bit to put up listings scidm.
someone with more knowledge can feel free to correct me but it is my understanding that using a vm is almost never as safe as just using tails from a usb the reason for this is that you have to trust that there are no backdoors in the vm most likely there wouldn't be but if your are running your virtual machine on windows you can never be sure as for your other question your isp can see that you are using tor but not what you do there think of it as a helicopter watching you enter the subway sure the helicopter knows that you're using the subway but it doesnt know where you are going to get off.
great idea i'm under the impression that if i have coins totally unlinked to me and i use a blockchain wallet only ever logging on through tor then i am quite safe to send the coins to the vendor but for people who may have trouble getting coins that are totally unlinked to them maybe some information about different tumbling options advantages disadvantages current status reputation etc would be helpful.
it's great to see new people learn and discover the wonders of the darknet one quick note though you shouldn't be torrenting anything through tor not only is it bad opsec but it slows the whole network down see for more in response to your original question yes using a tails usb should be fine from home.
goodfornothing on april pmquote from uncleal on april pmhere tmg is in a league of it's own and entirely different i meant commission taking escrow offering money handling markets of the risk your capital kind not this open honest trust based forum that asks nothing in return for letting people find each other and communicate freely and there's no risk of take down this isn't really a marketplace it's just a network there's nothing ilegal about this forum.
if you still manage to get coins out it goes without saying tumble.
koolcid on march ami was copy and pasting and when i went to past into pgp i must've misclicked or something and recopied the original text not looking i just clicked ctrl v and send so i'm just wondering if messages are stored on tmg servers even after the message is deleted and whether i should burn the address now thanks i'm still in disbelief that i did that playing devil's advocate so you have proper safety what if tmg is really a le honeypot someone could say that messages are deleted and you are fine but now your private shipping information is in le's hands you would be communicated that everything is ok but all tmg is designed for is tracking monitoring activity and also waiting for people to mess up and not pgp communications the choice is yours and i'm not saying i believe the above but servers have been compromised in the past elsewhere so one should be very prudent if you are buying low volumes or getting free samples probably no big deal even if le was involved but if you are buying sheets and sending addresses unencrypted i'd be a little nervous again i'm not saying i think the servers are compromised or that this is a honeypot but i think it's wise to always assume everything is and never reveal information without encryption and if you do consider it burned you will make the best risk reward decision for yourself though.
i am back and active with premium lsd just having trouble figuring how to be listed as an active member again you can check my feedback on alphabay or search grams thanks l.

bitcoin blender is the first one i ever tried and it worked very fast i had no troubles and was able to withdraw instantly after depositing you can also set it to withdraw your coins later at random times with multiple withdraws to make it even harder to trace as for bitcoin fog i would avoid it i've read too many negative reviews saying that people never got their coins back some do but some don't apparently they might be doing a selective scam they don't scam all people so they can stay and look innocent and blame the issues on other services ect and keep people using their services so they can keep doing it.
hello i 'm new here can i use tails from usb encryption from my home pc to be safe for small order or do i need proxy vpn virtual machine and much more thank you for hel.
we're all doomed i am a new vendor with like in escrow.
to my knowledge the vendor wasn't selling here.
i just read through the part where vitaminlsd describes creating a amnesiac like enviorment using a vm the only problem with that is that assumes your ost system is not compromised that would mean your running a super clean no script offline and completely secure host system like openbsd itsfar more likely that your host system is already compromised i don't suggest this unles your running a very hardened setup like openbsd you could deploy a similar but tighter setup like whinox similar concept where one machine is exclusivcely a portal for the client.
appreciated.
i got michelle leonhart nudez just send me btc.
there is no exact way to answer this question except that your concerns are valid it's very possible for a vendor to be le it's also possible than inexperienced vendors keep more detailed records of your private info than they should this being said it's also possible that experienced vendors are making mistakes they should be avoiding you should probably assume your identity is compromised and wipe everything change addresses change pgp change username sticking with vendors others have reported success isn't but it's definitely a worthwhile precaution in this environment.
greenbuddy on may pmquote from unit on may pmu i couldn't agree more i've already swore to myself i'm sticking to micro transactions from now on i'd rather have btc on the line than what i had put myself into and exactly i've never felt comfortable with sharing that i even use the market with anybody but close close close friends when they would like help with using it or want me to over see a transaction for them i let them know i risk my money when i use these marketplaces so when you want to use them you're risking your money too basically saying i'll do my best to make sure they get a clean transaction but if it goes to hell in a hand basket which i've seen happen very easily it's not up to me to fix or compensate anything for them unit i also use markets for mostly btc deals its less of a worry and below a certain amount is imo much less dangerous than a larger amount some may say that it requires more orders to get the same amount but i'd rather get caught with a oz decriminalized amounts in some places of bud than a whole zip or qp not that it matters if the feds get you but if you get pulled over with it then unless you live in the deep south just a ticket the same is true for rl i used to have this strategy when buying weed i'd go to my dealer and if i was getting a half or a zip i would never tell them first i'd check it out and if the weed was sub par i'd just get a dub or a slice there are exceptions like if i wanted some primo bud from a vendor like cultmadeline who only sells oz's but their bud is fire and they are trusted even then i'd rather direct deal one thing about direct deals though i would place a very basic order one item and maybe a small cheap second but you don't need to make it confusing or overly complicated final note there are some things that make sense to buy in bulk the one thing i don't is with mdma i don't have many friends who do it although getting rid of it is easy the reason i don't is that i know that for myself i will do higher doses and more often if i bought a whole g if i had friends who would buy it i could sell it very fast for a nice profit most of my friends don't even know if the 'molly' they got of some uni student was real mdma and are averse to pills never had good ones or think they are cut thanks to pop culture its crazy smart people too that is what is so liberating about dnms you don't have to take what everyone else in your area or circle of friends does it cuts through ignorance like a machete love and light acid ever sense i found out how to use the dnm i don't allow my friends to get something somewhere other than me unless it's tested it's sad but a very true statement i trust dnm vendors more than drug dealers in real life with reviews honest in most aspects i can see if a vendor is notably good before i buy from them instead of being forced into whatever is in town at the time and my knowledge on these substances has multiplied in the last years sense sr and dpr i dont believe stupid stereotypical hippy mumbo jumbo either such as can't cut lsd with water from the store or brown molly is mda and white molly is mdma with dnm i've skipped passed the typical salesman and have jumped right to other entrepeneurs that share in like interest and care to look into the science rather than what most people i know do follow the guy that's eaten acid the longest nonono i'm too analytical to just go off of hear say i want to know from a person that's dealing with portions that if their stuff was bad they wouldnt move it because i'd order grams make a bad review greenbuddy might order grams and write a bad review than when someone else comes to maybe buy grams they see two bad reviews and a vendor trying to sell them shit again i trust dnm vendors more than i do rl vendors.
i would not recommend currently using agora i have always loved the site but a lot of peoples deposits are not showing up lately my deposit has not showed for days with no reply from support i would recommend using alphabay or maybe abraxas till agora gets there shit figured out.
hello i was wondering if it is ok to track a package using the usps tracking system if i was using tails ad tor browser with javascript and global scripts turned off thx.
hi there most of people who use darknet should to use mixing services to stay fully anonymousit makes impossible to track your transactions that s why i decided to make this listshare other links in this topic pleasemixers in darknet bitcoinblender brave bunny x bitcoinfog cleancoin btcmix bitlaundry bitmixer io tor.
done thank you kind sir.
this place is so much better than any market i've ever been a part of.
what link is that will search the forums for it.
samaya on september ambecause i'm technically retarded i would do this make a new key on tails put the public key in the pgp thread here encrypt a pm to the new key that has the old key information decrypt it on tails and import whatever you needthis way you don't have to learn how to do anything and you can just send the stuff inside of an encrypted pm to yourself then delete the pm you could also do this via an email account but not actually send the email i am more retarded than you so how does one make a new key on tails use keepassx nvm guess i go applications utilities passwords and keysnow that i made a key how do i get my pub keyencrypt a pm to the new key that has the old key information i assume keepassx is the pgp tool built in edit basically i used pgp usb and have a bunch of vendors names and pub keys imported into pgp usb i still have my pub key and user id in plain text i can import that i guess i want to import all my vendors that i have spoken to before like merge copy contacts thank.
but i wanna order now.
salamander on june pm you can sort of look at it as a place that you can come to discuss products vendors and other markets or anything else really hell a lot of vendors out there are on here daily it is a place where you can meet those vendors and their costumers and chat with them so that when you do decide to order you can order in confidence knowing that they have been vetted through the community this place really is magesticditto.
it would do well to become a market things look very comfortable here.
dxuutx on may pmthis is why i would never trust a dnm with something important that would affect my real life like irl dealers who borrow money for their supply and then a dnm goes down and it's all fuck i'm dead i owe money to some bad people or heroin addicts on some where's my deposit and going through withdrawal like this is technology guys ever use it if so you know it breaks when you need it most don't put in more money than you can afford to lose and don't rely on it for important things thank you i couldn't agree more i've already swore to myself i'm sticking to micro transactions from now on i'd rather have btc on the line than what i had put myself into and exactly i've never felt comfortable with sharing that i even use the market with anybody but close close close friends when they would like help with using it or want me to over see a transaction for them i let them know i risk my money when i use these marketplaces so when you want to use them you're risking your money too basically saying i'll do my best to make sure they get a clean transaction but if it goes to hell in a hand basket which i've seen happen very easily it's not up to me to fix or compensate anything for them.
hmm okey dokeythank.
can find people near to you who'd be willing to exchange btc for cash alternatively set up another wallet and use a tumbling service to get your btc from one wallet to the other.
who's the vendor on dream you're referencing if you're looking for psilocin analogues you might check out ion on alphabay or occasionally here he at one point anyway had aco dmt ho mipt ho met and aco met uk vendor curious something or other new only feedback is for some aco caps aco met ho det and a couple of others of the top of my head.
seems like a pretty bad time to be depositing coin to agora even when they come online for hours and it seems issues have been solved it seems like a big tease everyone who can't wait to get back on and get shit done and hasn't been scared off yet is like hope it stays up oh what's that it's staying up seemingly oh wait nevermind fuck fuck fuck fuck at this point i think it would be ambitious to get too comfortable even if it goes consecutive days with uptime oh and i'm not mocking the op i've fallen into the semi comfort of a little bit of responsive uptime a bit too easily too.
boo i missed it too if anyone has an invite to spare i'd love to join the party i replied to a post about invites from i am balthazar but haven't heard anything back.
wondering if anyone has had experience dealing with vendor b g mpact on evo checking out his dmt crystals that he claims to be pure looks like his reviews are ok with one neutral and one neg product never arrived as he ships from outside the us wondering if it's worth while before investing thanks for any assistance yes i'm new and loving every minute.
scroat on december pm think it's great was linked from the onions subi thought it was great too until they started serving ads through torads what really got me and caused me to abandon my accounts there is the fact that an ad that i was being served related to an organization in my country of origin that is either a huge coincidence or ip address data is possibly being leaked indicating the country of origin now mind you i've got adblock running and my hosts file is bulging with the addresses of most online advertisers redirected to the loopback address despite this the ads are still showing up the long and the short of it is that i no longer trust this service ymmv spitfir.
lelantos has had great uptime and i suggest them to everyone ussrmail was down half of the time so i switched over to lelantos just make sure to encrypt everything and be careful about what you put for subject headers.
also the point of wearing a male wig hat and basically an entire disguise that shouldn't make you stand out but instead make you unrecognizable as your normal self even while under camera is because if you study the cd's on reddit the of them where people got caught without going to the counter is because the feds were waiting for them on the inside and knew already exactly what they looked like and so they apprehended the person inside the lobby after they grabbed the package or the feds knew what the person looked like and also knew what car the person drove and they approached and arrested the person after they got into their car with the package don't let this happen to you.
they don't really have fa though many have requested it they have optional pgp login but you can't set it up so that no one can login without both password and pgp so its kind of weak.
line and bum.
hi all delited to be here seem like a lovely bunch of peoples just wondering a while back i was pretty bad with my opsec i bought btcs with online bank transfer on lbc then sent them to blockchain and then straight to a markets wallet what leak could happen to me here if the le got the person i bought the product off would they be able to track back to me also the other way around if the person i bought them off was le could they see i sent the btcs to blockchain and then to a market would it be safe enough to continue to use online back transfer so long as i wash them before sending them to vendor here i plan on doing tails pgp lbc electrum wash helix market vendor how does this sound thanking you.
zoxeebee on november amused or refurbished thinkpad x used or refurbished thinkpad t good advise by far the best you can get for that money a used refurbished thinkpad of the x or t series great quality hardware and very good supported by linux tails.
darknetdreamer on november pmquote from sterlingsword on november amquote from darknetdreamer on november amsound interesting would love to write a full review once the sites up sounds excellent it's making good progress i'll post again with my milestone estimations for delivery i'll be sure also to register you an account due to the nature of this market wishing to be secure and being based on vendor only inviting i may have to ask around about you just to make sure you have indeed ordered and used product before if a vendor can vouge for you i'll provide you with a valid one time registration link upon release thanks looking forward to the market and a full write up my blog is basically all about darknet security so i think your site will fit in perfectly given the nature of it awesome if that's the case and pending release i'll consider releasing source code too you as well so you can use that in addition to elevated account priviledges to accompany your review currently source code is only going to be released to the vendor that is on top this is still being written but the basis of judgement will be based on how long the vendor has been around rate of success vs rate of failure confidence factor overall rating across the darkneti'm still trying to decide all of the internal politics and due to the nature of this trusted environment i plan on developing said vendor will need to approve on this decision much lov.
cotlakqueque on april pmwhere do i find the market all i can see are the message boards lol keep looking brah.
no problem did you check out that link we sent about setting up electrum in tails.
does anyone really need a vpn why if you are not connected to any personal data whatsoever why use a vpn you are connected to a public wifi and youre using a computer with no harddrive do you still use a vpn.
hello so i'm thinking about going dark for a while but as with many of you i'm sure you'd like some security in dissapearing off of the darknet and wanting surity that upon return you'll still have access to customers vendors and their great product well i think the time may be here imagine this a vendor only market based on trust no user registrations and the site is essentially hidden on tor pgp services by default and maximum security implemented each and every source should in theory be a somewhat experianced darknet market buyer so essentially the concept is this vendors start the market i have in mind jor since he seems to be the most well trusted a vendor only community that when vendors like a customer they are able to provide a one time registration url that is then to be sent to the user they choose that user may then register on the site and take part in purchasing product next part i'm trying to plan is anonymous vendor buying but i don't quite know how this will work out essentially since the community is based on trust to begin with vendors will be responsible for knowing how much stock they put into the store no vendors name will be shared and categories and organization will be added for instance say you wand lsd well mrpickles and jor both have it but instead of it saying both vendors there's only one listing with the combined features both mrpickles and jor both put up there if there's the exact same posting on both accounts the system takes from whomver has the most stock in their inventory to help balance out and for fairness different categories of drugs if it gets to that point would have their own similar features marijuana would be difficult but i hopefully don't imagine anyone serious about buying drugs buys and ships marijuana or perhaps i'm just naive but i'd like to protect people against that since it's the most widely busted drug and quite frankly is probably within kilometer of anywhere you are at any given point in time that you are on this earth how does this sound i would also provide the solution open source so that admins could inspect it vendors and be sure there's no exit scam awal code developed in there that i nor anyone else would be able to touch also the system would use bitchain info's public api to create destory transfer money from wallets and would allow downloadable wallet backups directly from bitchain info if my site ever goes down your coin is always right where you left it so long as you can remember where you wrote down downloaded your backup stuff too comments feedback plz i just want access to lsd for my whole life just incase i run through my entire stock pile and this whole thing dissapears lol i plan on going dark for a while but if this sounds good to the community perhaps it can be a christmas present to everyone that's been loyal also the vendors i imagine starting out with are jesusofrave mrpickles and liquidergot if you know of anyone else that should be on that list they would need the approval of i don't know some percentage of approval from all of the current active vendors if you see talk too any of these vendors please have them read this thread thanks love all of you edit if you would like to make anonymous donations for this service please donate to  lthvdqygnumu bycubpkn ennbthe amount of donations received will vastly improve the quality of service i can provide and shorten the amount of time taken if i start receiving a large amount of donations i will put up a site as a placeholder for the service with accurate information if you donate be sure to send me a private message with your userid that you use across the darknet or send me a pgp key and a message personally you will be heavily rewarded for assisting in the development process of this but it has been undecided as of yet it's possible you could receive a vast amount of free lsd mdma if this takes off like i plan on it doing update for tech specs  sterlingsword on november amtech specs updatewhile writing and designing i've came up will the following new additions that will make this new market extremely difficult to take down and give a fresh breath of confidence to the darknet marketplace users will no longer have to fret about bitcoins being locked into a marketplace if they choose to use mine internal x ca and spooferi've developed my own spoofer and my system stores every single bit of data using a kb x certificate to spoof every single last detail plain text isn't stored anywhere and no cpu power is saved when it comes to encryption even if it's a simple hello walletmy website is going to use an auto generated bitchain wallet and provide backup abilities your funds won't ever be dependent on my system simply download the wallup backup directly relayed through tor too you via bitchain if my site goes down simply do your thing and log into the wallet using your backup the wallet will also be completely accesable through my website all it will do is connect to bitchain to determine balance etc no funds will be stored on my site auto migrationthe server will automatically put up special text in specific areas to indicate time when timer goes off the website will peridiocally shut down for a period of hours and transfer to an entirely new server again to thwart le this will happen as desired or x per week databases won't migrate as often due to their security in design maybe per week and imagining the size of the database as it grows while a migration is in place users will be able to use the direct trade information posted by vendors if they do so post it during so you may log into your system wallet via bitchain and send your btc to the wallet address that you have in doing so the description and the text will show up the vendor will have the ability on system restart to archive the order and thus enter it into the system thus depleting stock etc purchase will continue to process as if it was purely done in the system.
no i haven't i will see if that works thank you.
ty.
thank you i know about that part but everytime i put it in it says it's connected but yet it still won't work i'm thinking i might have to just start all over i looked online some more and apparently a lot of people are having the same issue sadly though i still have not been able to find a solution.
early june.
idk but it seems kinda covert like using burner phones and dead drops.
i've always been a gardener but now i am majesti.
where i live u can buy them straight at pay points type in your wallet address and insert cash and voil pretty simple ain't the same over there lbc has just the best prices and the biggest headaches.
does anyone know is there any link for dhl support or an email i found a pretty nasty bug if you enable step auth with pgp key log in then turn off step auth the next time you log in you are presented with the step auth page but with no code to decrypt so you are permanently locked out of the account anyone else ever have this issue.
upon login the correct captcha was rejected several times and i've had to load each page multiple times it often doesn't fully load and takes forever even if it only loads partially am i alone or are others having issues as well.
well that doesn't tell me why i'm having issues but it's good to know it's up and functioning well it's been a little faster but the captcha issues are still present thank.

caseysmith on april pmwould anyone mind dropping a link to middle earth i'm looking for a sight that has more reliability than agora which is unfortunate because i really like agora middle earth market is at mango u rivtwxy onion and i'd recommend against enabling javascript.
thank you for your time and efforts nonya i tried to import your public key it said key import failed code error text gig total number processed i tried copying and pasting both your key and your sig and i tried copying and pasting just your key without your sig neither method worked i've tried importing other peoples' keys from the thread where members post their keys some of them import just fine but some don't i am using the exact same method every time so i don't don't know what's going on there i never have any problem importing venders keys from their vender pages on other markets i had a similar experience a long time ago i think it was on sr i could import someone's key if they posted it on the forum but i couldn't do it if it was on their forum profile or maybe it was the other way around can you try pming me your key and maybe if i copy and paste it from there it will work i've tried pasting your pgp key link in the address bar it took me to start page com and said sorry there are no web results for this search when i paste mine into the address bar it says unable to connect mine no longer appears at the bottom of my posts because i just deleted it from my profile last night but i copied it before i deleted it in case i need it again next day edit i tried your pgp key link again took a minute to connect but it worked this time and i was able to import your key so this seems consistent with what you were saying on one of your threads my pgp key link still doesn't connect and i still don't remember how i acquired it in the first place and it would be nice to know how to create a new one with my updated email address but at least i can pm you now i didn't realize that your pgp key link goes to the same thread where all these members post their keys i generated a new key and tried to send it to my email address it said sending key failed thanks for clearing up my confusion over the word signature i understand the purpose of the sig i've found other info online about that but i can't find my sig i figured out how to generate a sig for a key that i generated yesterday and i exported the key to a folder like i normally do that's where i usually open a text file of my public key to give someone that text file still doesn't show a sig though oh and i wasn't trying to change the email address in my key i was trying to change it in my tmg forum account settings my main interest right now is to be able to import your public key then i'll try working with that message you created then maybe i'll try to tackle some of these other problems next day edit as i mentioned above i tried your pgp key link again took a minute to connect but it worked and i was able to import it this time when i get a chance i'll try working with your encryped message exercise and see what happens with that but at least i have your key imported i really appreciate your help you have been so nice.
i saw the news article it names specifically long term investigation that culminated in six arrest across europe and the us dang.
abraxis has been working fine for me.
does anyone have the onion i cant remember where to find it similar to the pushing taboo site by gg thanks.
snacktime on november pmlets not jump to conclusions heredoes anyone have any real information relating to this cheers stalphabay was getting attacked so far that's all i have seen no word from other markets as of yet.
i have to assume they have been compromised in some way the lack of communication is bafflin.
unit on may pmu i couldn't agree more i've already swore to myself i'm sticking to micro transactions from now on i'd rather have btc on the line than what i had put myself into and exactly i've never felt comfortable with sharing that i even use the market with anybody but close close close friends when they would like help with using it or want me to over see a transaction for them i let them know i risk my money when i use these marketplaces so when you want to use them you're risking your money too basically saying i'll do my best to make sure they get a clean transaction but if it goes to hell in a hand basket which i've seen happen very easily it's not up to me to fix or compensate anything for them unit i also use markets for mostly btc deals its less of a worry and below a certain amount is imo much less dangerous than a larger amount some may say that it requires more orders to get the same amount but i'd rather get caught with a oz decriminalized amounts in some places of bud than a whole zip or qp not that it matters if the feds get you but if you get pulled over with it then unless you live in the deep south just a ticket the same is true for rl i used to have this strategy when buying weed i'd go to my dealer and if i was getting a half or a zip i would never tell them first i'd check it out and if the weed was sub par i'd just get a dub or a slice there are exceptions like if i wanted some primo bud from a vendor like cultmadeline who only sells oz's but their bud is fire and they are trusted even then i'd rather direct deal one thing about direct deals though i would place a very basic order one item and maybe a small cheap second but you don't need to make it confusing or overly complicated final note there are some things that make sense to buy in bulk the one thing i don't is with mdma i don't have many friends who do it although getting rid of it is easy the reason i don't is that i know that for myself i will do higher doses and more often if i bought a whole g if i had friends who would buy it i could sell it very fast for a nice profit most of my friends don't even know if the 'molly' they got of some uni student was real mdma and are averse to pills never had good ones or think they are cut thanks to pop culture its crazy smart people too that is what is so liberating about dnms you don't have to take what everyone else in your area or circle of friends does it cuts through ignorance like a machete love and light acid.
thanks for the heads up i've been hearing good things about this marke.
curious if you think i should drop tor on windows all together i spend most of my day on windows devices and it's a lot of fun checking the forums i'd like to start actively posting here and maybe on reddit which i browse dnm all day i also log in to markets just to explore purchases are made on a tails box if this is a very stupid idea for opsec purposes i'll move to that box full time thoughts i love this place so much but i'm concerned my addiction to it is overriding my intelligence that i should drop windows entirely i do access dnms from a personal location that i browse casually on.
im new to the dn dw and ive noticed that people are constantly talking about dhl i was wondering if someone is willing to invite a newbie into a trustworthy site i recently tried dream market and am in escrow right now but am still looking for faster better more trustworthy websites.
according to many people golden era has stopped replying to emails and sending orders entirely despite people completing and sending bitcoin i personally made a purchase and didn't get a confirmation email but did get my package within a few days he is a research chemical vendor.
just a warning to everyone if a new forum member posts links to a marketplace mixing service bitcoin site any site where you send money they might be fake links designed to spoof the original site and steal your money verify those links before you send your bits to them.
i just used bitcoin blender for a small amount of coin under and it worked the whole process took under an hour.
not being detected is very important to me no matter what i'm doing i think i just need to bite the bullet and delete tor wipe drive move on with my new unix life just sucks because i'm on win devices all fucking day i'm sure u understand that said can't wait to become a contributor here i love you gaiz so much just can't do it all day like i wish i could.
vitaminlsd on june pmquote from gleeful on june pmquote from vitaminlsd on june amtails is not secure for serious dnm activities and here's the first reason why usa feds have already conducted tor attacks that have landed significant dnm figures behind bars the above article has more details about how the feds did it and who they have arrested so far a former silk road lieutenant for starters also tor bridges are practically useless for hiding from the nsa because the nsa harvests the tor bridge addresses from the emails send to from the tor project the nsa knows you're using tor anyways if you're using a tor bridge tor bridges were designed for people in repressive third world countries not us citizens hiding from the nsa it also gets worse and this is information that every dnm user serious or small should know about but since the edward snowden leaks the nsa has talked about if not bragged that they have timing attacks for de anonymizing tor users what does this breach have to do with tails isn't it just a live version of linux is it because it's not designed to be used with a vpn and that vpns are the safest way to access tor i'm not disputing what you're saying i just don't understand it thanks basically yea you want to always use a vpn before tor and tails doesn't have built in vpn support so unless you're using a vpn router like how cosmic consciousness explained then if your tor connection ever gets de anonymized they would see your home ip or wherever you're connected from and that by itself has been enough to land some unlucky people in jail and prison like the silk road lieutenant from that article the nsa even brags about how it can de anonymize tor users so not using a vpn first is like going out and having sex with women a night without a condom and hoping you don't get an std after a year one of the worst ways you can be de anonymized is like this tor basically uses three hops to send your data to the final destination node the first node or the guard node node the middle node node the exit node so if you log in to reddit com through tor using the same username you buy with on the markets with your connection without a vpn would look like your home ip tor node tor node tor node redditbut if you got unlucky and the government runs all three of those tor nodes and your tor prioritizes the fastest tor nodes tor node would know your home ip but not the contents of your connection tor node would also know that it's sending data on to tor node tor node knows that it received a connection from tor node although it doesn't know what the contents are tor node also knows that its sending data to tor node tor node finally sends your data to reddit tor node can always see your data in plaintext for any website not just reddit unless that connection to the website used even if your web traffic to reddit is all sent over encrypted to the reddit server tor node knows that this is one of the reddit servers for instance because in the connection during the ssl tls handshake the reddit server openly says says before everything gets encrypted that this server belongs to reddit if reddit has been put under some type of government gag order to give all ip addresses login times to the feds the feds would know you logged in through tor but if the feds are doing de anonymization attacks right now if tor node was one of their own they could see this connection to reddit and tor node knows it received a connection from tor node and tor node knows it made a connection to tor node likewise if we roll this back one more time tor node knows that it received a connection from tor node and tor node knows that it made a connection to tor node at a very specific point in time down to the second then finally tor node knows this connection came from your home ip address this is how the feds can de anonymize you if they control your entire tor circuit your tor node but the nsa even brags that it can de anonymize people just based off when you made your tor connection combined with when the request came out of the tor exit node so it's possibly they don't even need to control your entire tor circuit for that connection just run one of the tor node 's and use their nsa mass surveillance visibility to know when a connection came out of one of the tor nodes plus they can combine this roughly with the size of the encrypted data being sent back to you to narrow down how large the page you viewed was which can help them pinpoint you even closer with this second method i think the second one is sloppier but the nsa was caught bragging from information in the edward snowden leaks that this method still works ubuntu is really easy to learn i highly recommend it as an alternative to tails if you've only ever relied on tails before mullvad the vpn provider even has a linux client for their vpn you basically just click a button and it connects they're probably the best commercial vpn provider in my book you can pay them in bitcoins the only personally identifiable information with them is a numeric account id they keep no logs and they have repeatedly told off governments when they asked for information about users and they know the people who run their sweden data center and they used their own hardware for the nodes there so the usa government can't just show up there with a gag order and take one of their vpn server's hard drives with their ssl private keys on it like they could possibly to vpn servers here in america regardless of what company runs the vpn server ubuntu has all the bells and whistles that tails has and there is an enormous amount of documentation available for you you can find the answer to just about any problem in ubuntu by search engine ing xyz ubuntu you can also give it a full disk encryption password during your ubuntu install thanks for the great explanation i use ubuntu already since i have essentially abandoned windows because it sucks so hard with ubuntu and the vpn set up does it make sense to run tor through the vpn as an extra layer if so what package does ubuntu have available to run tor thanks.
abraxas because it's populated with vendors dhl has no vendors barely anything up middle earth has from what i've experienced some pretty jenky coding and nucleus doesn't seem to have very responsive support teams.
thanks i really appreciate it.
a new install with full disk encryption ubuntu can work for this then fill the drive with trash or start a live cd linux distro and wipe your hard drive using the wipe command or shredthen reinstall a fresh clean windows system or a fresh linux one with full disk encryption probably safer another option would be to physically destroy the hard drive and use your computer only with tails you'd have to trust those who made tails but even if tails was trying to write stuff on your hdd you'd be safe from that.
thanks everybodyi start to learn a little nowto mirrormirror thank you for answer that is safe enough without more specific layer of security will be ok sure it's not for big purchases or sellingmy next step will be about crack wifi access point change mac and use itmust be even more safe i can immagine people using mobile burning phone for dnmthank you to al.

bbkf on february pmthe change to a new kernel and reports of users having issues including dirtysouf not being able to verify the signing key has me stuck on tails what do you mean you can't verify the signing key do you mean you can't verify the iso with the detached pgp signature download the sig file and the iso again gpg verify tails i iso sig tails i isogpg signature made tue jan am utc using rsa key id a db gpg good signature from tails developers offline long term identity key gpg warning using untrusted key the tails developers publish their keys on the following page can also see this page on trusting verifying the tails developers pgp keys from bbkf on february pmis there an alternative that includes usb mounting persistence and memory wiping at shutdown anyone very knowledgeable feel safe using the upgrade the upgraded kernel is the same flavor of linux used by redhat which works very closely with the us government the kernel version is pretty much on a par with that as just about every up to date linux distro is using if there is a conspiracy linus is involved and just about every other distro developer as well linux amnesia debian ckt deb u i gnu linuxspitfir.
sorry can't help but had something similar happen with another vendor who was very highly regarded back in the day who also went private never thought they would do something like that either was doing lots of business with them ended up scamming me out of nearly k after doing private deals for half a year in some emails they had hinted they'd be doing a lot of drugs since they went private as a vendor not sure what but that it had been the cause for some delays we had had than i sent over k and was fed little lines of i'll send it soon etc stalling than they just went dark never heard from them again it might be the case once some of these vendors have made their millions and slow down to being private vendors quit they have enough money to live quite comfortably and other fall to the wayside free time and drugs also go together quite well maybe the passion has faded with them who knows anyways long rambling post but i wish you luck getting scammed sucks especially when its someone you thought you could trust and have rapport with.
also i am having to manually input my bridge info everytime i get on my tails is there a way so i can save the bridges onto my persistance and not have to input it by copy and paste everytime.
i found this discussion and thought you may find it interesting not my words quotethe first thing you have to ask is what problem you're trying to solve by using a vpn instead of or in addition to tor generally people use vpns to either encrypt their traffic from their isp or to engage in membership concealment your isp can't profile you as a tor user vpns are extremely weak to website fingerprinting attacks since all websites don't pad their encrypted packets to the same size with a vpn an adversary can identify with probability if you're visiting a certain preidentified website despite your traffic being encrypted i've never seen a vpn which has been tested as having its encrypted traffic being fingerprinted with less than certainty tor pads all packets to bytes which significantly strengthens it against fingerprinting attacks also tor encrypts your traffic anyway and provides excellent membership concealment in the form of transport layer protocol obfuscators like obfsproxy and skypemorph when you use a vpn you're revealing that you're using an anonymizer tor can be configured to try to hide the fact that you're using an anonymizer at all so already there's no real reason to use a vpn since all their advantages are exceeded by tor using a vpn to connect to tor means that you're absolutely fucked if your vpn is compromised since a passive attacker can just wiretap you before your entry point enough said it's an especially bad idea to use a vpn you found advertised on a drug fraud forum as an entry point this is a favored tactic of law enforcement once they've flipped somebody if you use tor to connect to a vpn you're now deanonymizing yourself in other ways if you visit a site like mtgox or pecunix or any log gathering site you've now linked a service you're paying for maybe via credit card but still bad even if you're paying with bitcoins to your operations commercial services should never be used as endpoints because historically most vpns see hidemyass vpnbook voxility safe mail etc are forced by the feds to give up their customers after enough time in court tor is all you need preferably with a protocol obfuscator there's never been a record of anybody using tor for any illegal activity being identified the most secure pedos carders hackers who have ever been pwnt from shadowcrew to geohot and countless others were pwnt because of their use of ssh tunnels or vpn services also please check out this thread on tor talk and pay special attention to anything said by arma the lead developer of tor tl dr vpns are bad vpn to tor is useless and can be very bad tor to vpn is very bad tor is fucking awesome if you're playing the game of picking a vpn based on how privacy conscious they seem or where they're located you've already lost as i said several vpns that advertise themselves as prioritizing privacy and even accept bitcoins as a payment option such as hma are known to comply with title interception orders the feds have also been known to set up vpns in historically fed resistant locales such as the cis or middle east and advertise them on drug fraud boards even if you pay for a vpn anonymously and only connect to it through tor you're making a bottleneck of where all your traffic goes this lets the vpn profile everything you do and that can be deanonymizing in and of itself the thrust of my posts is that you cannot trust vpn providers because they are operated by men who can be coerced by money or the laws of man to turn on you you really have no way of knowing how anonymous you truly are tor however can be trusted because it's based on the immutable laws of mathematics which have no regard for the laws of man don't be so quick to trust tor although an onion garlic mixnet routing solution can theoretically be implemented with a very low probability of de anonymization tor's implementation leaves much to be desired tor has a high guarantee of anonymity but the codebase has become so bloated with backwards compatibility exceptions and inefficient routing behaviors that i hypothesize a number of will become known in the next year much traffic correlation analysis on tor networks is already possible as aaron johnson showed in his recent paper that an average tor user with stable usage patterns can be deanonymized after months with probability tor does offer the wonderful pluggable transports stenography transforms which i recommend clients use as it may preserve your anonymity by obscurity alone most dpi attempts target the lowest common denominator of users indeed vpn services alone do not provide any guarantee of anonymity but tunneling visible tor traffic through a vpn may or may not provide you with more cover depending on the traffic analysis habits of your isp or governing agency pluggable transports may provide more obscurity although chinese government has recently began successfully thwarting connection attempts to obfs bridges by dpi assume patterns may be extrapolated from any data you send and receive and that your adversaries are highly motivated and funded particularly in the united states china and uk but i like tail tor better than whonix to.
nordicwhite on november amcan anyone recommend a good burner laptop for darknetmarket shopping vending use mostly large shopping i plan to use tails on usb or dvd asus c inch chromebook arm tails not available for arm yetused or refurbished thinkpad x used or refurbished thinkpad t all three should be under and support free and open source firmware bios through thinkpads can be easily repaired with cheap replacement parts as they are popular enterprise laptops it's easy to find refurbished ones in good condition.
chess on november pmquote from pinto on november ami have a paxful account and a wallet that i have downloaded i buy bitcoins with cash deposits at bofa you dont even need an account at bofa you just need cash and tell the teller you need to make a cash deposit to an account fill out the slip with information provided to you by the seller on paxful and there you go btc within minutes after you deposit i looked into it should i use tor with this website i might use an american express gift card something disposable from the dollar store you don't have to use tor with it just dont use that as your main wallet have a wallet that you downloaded or a wallet like blockchain that you can send the btc to right after you receive them you can pay with cards it just gets kind of expensive when you do that.
pinto on november pmquote from chess on november pmquote from pinto on november ami have a paxful account and a wallet that i have downloaded i buy bitcoins with cash deposits at bofa you dont even need an account at bofa you just need cash and tell the teller you need to make a cash deposit to an account fill out the slip with information provided to you by the seller on paxful and there you go btc within minutes after you deposit i looked into it should i use tor with this website i might use an american express gift card something disposable from the dollar store you don't have to use tor with it just dont use that as your main wallet have a wallet that you downloaded or a wallet like blockchain that you can send the btc to right after you receive them you can pay with cards it just gets kind of expensive when you do that one more noob question i'm using tails mainly should i have that wallet downloaded on tails my normal os or should i just use an online one and i noticed it does get very expensive but for now since i'm a big noob to all of this i feel like paxful with prepaid is the easiest for me.
reasons for not using abraxas in that scenario when using albion's shop you only need to trust him whereas when using abraxas the admins could run away with your funds in escrow or even if you finalize early they could run away with the funds in albion's wallet before he has time to withdraw them and imo albion is trustworthy plus i think you don't need to create an account to use his shop a working pgp gpg identity is all you need if it works like gammagoblin's shop finally there are no fees if a trade is made directly with albion on his shop i think abraxas takes a commission on every transaction.
i was wondering is there a bitcoin service that will allow me to make bitcoin purchases without bank account or credit card information i would like to be more anonomou.
jojen on november pmi am not sure if it is clever to use tor for your coinbase account i assume you want to buy bitcoin via a bank transfer in that case your real identity will be linked to your coinbase account anyway so no reason to use tor buy the coins using your clearnet browser then transfer them to a wallet not linkable to you you create and access this wallet only through tor and from there to the market vendor you want to buy from you can also configure tor browser to pick exit nodes from a specific country see good way to anonymously get bitcoin besides coinbase is localbitcoins com it allows you to buy bitcoins in person or via cash deposit or bank transfer directly from other people i don't have a bank account typically i just put money on a card i get from the dollar store that isn't re loadable what website would you recommend to purchase bitcoins with this disposable card other than localbitcoins really and what wallet would you recommend and should i get helix.
i've had a ton of rcs land from spain poland uk canada etc the only thing i had seized was a few hundred pellets i assume seized tracking just stopped in customs but i never got a letter or anything regular letters with powder should go through just fine vast majority of the time it can be a bit unnerving dealing with unencrypted personal info but most of them take btc nowadays at least.
havealick on august pmwould just like to make a shout out to within a couple of days of registering i ran into him and we arranged something curteous prompt and to the point lovely fellow great deal will review when the tabs come around indeed he is such an awesome vendor solid product and top notch customer service.
i'm sorry i have not heard of or used helix before as long as you don't send the coins directly from paxful to your markets wallet you'll be okay no much to worry about at all unless your moving lbs of marijuana and grams of xtal a week just place a small dollar order for btc see if you can get that into your desired wallet that way you get the hang of it before making a bigger order.
good stuff you should be very weary of cruising the darknet on what is essentially a homing device.
when i go to encrypt a message copy message click encrypt with clipboard the window opens up to select the key to use i check the box to select the key and nothing happenstried with many keys and get the same result i click ok and nothing happensi click cancel and nothing happensanyone have a clue.
sabbatical on august pmtma is still available on the clearnet along with aleph and mem tma's on clearnet aren't all tma's schedule in the us and basically illegal worldwide we remember back like 'ish that a chem site had tma in kg drums listed as available.
which market do you prefer buying or selling on and why.
so this just happened to me a couple days ago opened tor browser in tails and idea what just happened should i be concerned and just to make it clear im not using the name sajolida.
just seeing this now after being here for quite a while thank you but this should really be default shouldn't it.
mps on june amis it not possible for a vendor with no feedback to in fact be le of course it is it is also very possible that a vendor with lots of feedback is le if this possibility has only just occurred to you and you don't have a clear and satisfactory answer maybe it's a sign you're not ready to be playing around with it yet.
well that was a quick hello and goodbye i just read that my personal tipple mmc is banned on here so have fun and stay safe everyone bye.
hunting down the shulgin chems is part of the fun visiting the markets reguarly all sorts of stuff pops up for short windows every now and again something fairly obscure will get listed and if the right price and vendor seems ok i'll nab it for my collection there was some tma on alphabay a few months ago but very expensive a new vendor on dream has a few psilocin analogs at the moment although only in gram listings due to their reported relative instability and my infrequent opurtunities to partake i'm reluctant to buy anything but small samples of these.
currently i am connecting to the darknet via tails tor bridges i feel as this is not a very safe unless i am wrong anyone have any advice on additional security measures to protect my real ip i get bulk so safety is a big concern to me let me know if my lack of faith in bridges is invalid though.
hi all i want to know your opinion about market for you what is the best i speak about drug market i saw that agora don't work anymore evolution is dead so now how is the best i am on blackbank alphabay nucleus and abraxas do you think is it a good market or not and about middle earth is it done too or what if you know good market give me link please thanks for your future answeri wish the best at every peoples on majestic garden see you.
one more person here who would really appreciate an invite damn tonight only ending before night where i live.
the avid posted this list comparing privacy conscious email providers to r list thread.
thank you for understanding and replying scidmt this was more of a venting location i was so stressed irl and could not speak to anyone about it i almost wish there was a dnm therapist for times like this some people just need to talk it out however it's hard to open up to people in the real world abou this type of thing agora fixed the deposit and i'm speaking with my vendors to get my orders out now agora came through like they always do but this is the reason why majority of business should be done off market i think marketplaces are a good spot for buyers to find vendors however there should be no reliance on a third party agora ie site administrators to fix and or overlook transactions last time i go through website marketplace i trust agora and they came through for me but in real life i was a mess for days straight just on the hook of if i own my money anymore or not.
this is the th time of rechecking the pgp certificate i cannot trust nor verify their pgp key it keeps stating their key is expired devs have been notified but no action has been taken feel free to notify em this has been going on for way to long only method of integrity check atm is to multiple checksum using rarely used checksums along with our standards.
i'm with inanna on this one lelantos is nice and i feel worth their cost they did however shut down temporarily to fight off heartbleed and i was worried for a moment they're back up and running now and doing great.
can you purchase btc through electrum can you explain why electrum would be anonymous compared to coinbase online wallet if i were to send btcs from an online wallet to my electrum wallet would it still be anonymous.
yes it really does seem that way unfortunately now i'm just looking for confirmation of this in any way possible if anyone can confirm speaking with him after may th i will know for sure i am being scammed can anyone help me out here.
mirrormirror on september pmsomeone with more knowledge can feel free to correct me but it is my understanding that using a vm is almost never as safe as just using tails from a usb the reason for this is that you have to trust that there are no backdoors in the vm most likely there wouldn't be but if your are running your virtual machine on windows you can never be sure as for your other question your isp can see that you are using tor but not what you do there think of it as a helicopter watching you enter the subway sure the helicopter knows that you're using the subway but it doesnt know where you are going to get off using a vm would add an additional level of security if you're engaging in hacking activities ideally you create a new mac from your existing this includes spoofing of a new address this allows you to accomplish the same task as having a throw away computer in nearly every aspect except that you cannot just burn it meaning delete the vm the way hard drives store information except ssd's are based on flags deleting a file on your computer does not erase the bytes stored on the disk all this does is flip flags on thr hard drive letting the os know this area is writeable to fully delete any fine on any computer you must overwrite the bytes at that sector this means your os must write data back to the sector that flag exists at if you do not over write the data at that sector it is still recoverableif you're interested in permanently erasing data i would recommend either writing a program in c that generatesa text file until the disk is full and deletes it or i would recommend downloading ccleaner and use drive wipe option but in anyca i do not think this is necesarry unless you're edward snowden and leaking classified documents from an organization you should be completely safe vpn'ing and using tor from your home so long as a if you use wifi its encrypted a even if you have wifi encrypt it with a password once on a network you can packet sniff all informationb unless your isp logs your activity if you want to practice safety the best way only access markets when not from your home and only buy when not from your home you don't ever need to be on a market unless you're looking at stock communicating with a vendor or placing a purchase.
at the moment its nucleus shame about the forum being down for the last week seems a bit sketch.
bl cksm th on september pmi can certainly say that i am addicted to tmg love and lights same here brother i wish it was more popping though i find myself logging in many times a day hoping for some topic to chat on lol i deleted my reddit account the day after i found this place.
good looking out thanks.
sounds like he's stringing you along dude still might come through but that's whack as hell regardless no real excuse for that lack of comms if he does make it right i still wouldn't mess with him.
gfn my thoughts exactly on all accounts me is very nice but the no withdrawl thing is terrible i have not personally moved coin there and don't plan to i literally only have two vendors i buy from at this point three including gfn canada they are now spread across each market which makes me feel comfortable that i can always find them i think the main importance here is having an ability to directly contact your vendor in the case of market collapse i appreciate all the vendors that spread themselves as wide as they can and make themselves easy to find.
i thought blackbank had a large fiasco a while back what happened with that was it a scam.
yea abraxas has most of the vendors and some support but i like to keep an eye on most of the others as you can pick up a lot of info that you wouldn't otherwise i have just started looking at tmg i did look briefly ages ago but could not find the market url but now iv come back and taken a closer look thats quite funny what a twat i am i dont know yet if this is the site for me i suspect not for buying but if could well turn out to be a better forum to talk in general regarding all the other markets vendors specific drugs abraxas forum is such a pita with its captcha that everyone and his dog comments about but they wont change it the hub is ok but it seems like there are many more users on here apart from abraxas i have used dream market i have accounts on most of the others but have never actually traded on them i say why expose yourself to more markets than you absolutely have to have even got a vendor on necules to start up on abraxas just so i could buy from him turned out he had crap but thats life in the day of a drone head in uk nowadays frigging joke.
since onymous tmg identifies solely as an informational and communication platform not a marke.
hi guys im pretty new to this and have spent some time trying to work out tails and im thinking i should get a vpn but then i read this gave me a headacheshould i get a vpn on tails.
hello scroati had similar issues with the tails pgp applet or it not responsing at all the weird thing is that sometimes the issues happen and sometimes don't i downloaded pgp usb to my persistence drive and i am using that app now is very easy to use and you can import your keys directly from the tails pgp applet i know is not a fix but as a temporary solution it works for me best r.
sorry if this is a noob question but is it safe to access electrum org through tor i have coin poss linked to my identity that i want to tumble around but would like to avoid fog if possible just because it seems sketchy to me however if there is no other safe option i will use fog any way i could send them from a wallet currently linked to my id to another wallet created and only accessed through tor and repeat this times with throwaway wallets then to my vendor of choice hehe idk any advice is truly appreciated peace mrs b.
i haven't made any transactions on middle earth yet but hot damn it's a pleasure to navigate fast and silky smooth and nice to look at the fact that they have a shopping cart feature is a huge plus imo i'd imagine that's as convenient for vendors as it is buyers blackbank feels clunky to me pages seem to take longer than they should to load the text is hard to read always having to zoom in which causes everything to be crammed in and of course no shopping cart like agora purchasing multiple listings from a vendor is more complicated and time consuming than it needs to be on a more positive note i do appreciate their deposit withdrawal speed btw i'm glad to see you're still around gfn.
totally majestical as fuck dude i enjoy being in the company of like minded individuals feels like i'm a part of some secret society which only we understand membership is paid in love and doses that's what always drew me to psychedelics the nature of these substances is so deep and profound that it naturally filters out those who don't have the capacity to understand or embrace these facets of existence deep shit bruh.
i use that its annoymous and works great.

i'm starting to love tmg more and more i see vendors on markets and wanna ask them if they would just come to the loving tmg side of things it's the only garden that i know of that grows love happiness from lsd if that shit isn't majestical as fuck then sir i don't know what is deuces knuckle.
i thought only tma and tma were sched i could definitely be wrong about that though the vendor i saw stocking these was european and doesn't ship to the us unfortunately apparently it's a chinese lab making them i'm sure you could get them shipped from there they don't give a shit about our laws just getting our money.
well it would be best to customize the forum to set it off by default yeah but a quick simple workaround in the mean time would be to just run this query every so often to shut it off for everybody all at once update smf members set show online this could be done from a cron job to run every minutes a la someuser mysql u sqlusername ppassword dbname e 'update smf members set show online.
did the same thing a while back i messaged a mod to ask if a deleted message is really gone or if it was still in the database somewhere mod confirmed that once deleted it's really gone sender as well as receiver should delete.
this might sound pretty basic to some but if it can help just one user it will have been worth writing please feel free to add your own ideas on the topic never use a user name password that you have ever used on the clearnet never use the same user name password on more than one site always try to write in a neutral language change identities from time to time and change your writing patterns at the same time if you change your identity don't disappear from the old one and appear with the new one but let both personae stay alive at the same time or take some deserved rest from the network if you change your setup it can be the right time to change your online identity avoid using windows for your darknet browsing it is insecure you can either create your own custom linux distribution with security in mind full disk encryption firewall to block non tor traffic hardened kernel tor process browser isolation if you feel like it or use whonix or tails if you decide to trust those who made these systems tails is good because it will leave no tracks on your computer whonix is good because it provides some kind of isolation remove your hard drive when using tails if you can if you use an hard drive blank if from time to time and start fresh again learn encryption gnupg is a great tool create your own or more key and use it as much as you can if you are a vendor a journalist in an oppressive country or a paranoid mind traveler you might want to work with encrypted material on another machine that stays offline that way the computer connected on the internet would only be used for encrypted material making it harder for an attacker to know the content of your encrypted documents in case your computer got compromised or had a backdoor try to leave as little tracks of your activity as possible on the machine s you use use an open wifi if you can to make it harder to get to you if tor was broken or you made an mistake in your opsec remember that using tor might get you flagged as suspicious individual even in democratic first world countries have fun be kind to others and remember if you're not ready to do the time don't do the crime stay safe.
paulista on october ami arrived too late would anyone be so nice to send me an invitation sent you pm.
bitblender is a good one however they were hacked a while ago so still proceed with caution i'm suprised helix wasn't mentioned here another good way to mix coins is to buy alt coins then trade with other alts then convert to bitcoin best be sure of your exchange rates though don't want to screw yourself.
though whonix doesnt offer persistence or usb mounting it uses inbuilt storage and also doesnt leave any memory trace on your host you can encrypt any data which you want as persistence storage.
the u s senate committee of finance said that non letter class mail that comes into the u s through foreign postal services aren t screened the same as packages that enter through private carriers such as fedex and ups this makes illegal drugs like heroin easier to ship into the united states this is estimated to happen on a daily basis sometimes multiple times a day you think lo.
darknetdreamer on november amsound interesting would love to write a full review once the sites up sounds excellent it's making good progress i'll post again with my milestone estimations for delivery i'll be sure also to register you an account due to the nature of this market wishing to be secure and being based on vendor only inviting i may have to ask around about you just to make sure you have indeed ordered and used product before if a vendor can vouge for you i'll provide you with a valid one time registration link upon release.
bitcoinfog has been taking hours for deposits and withdrawals to show would recommend staying away for now what is the alternative.
even if its ssl encrypted its still possible for the receiving server usps to notice that this requests comes from an tor exit node given what we nowadays know about surveillance i wouldn't take any chances rather use a vpn good proxy sock from a public network when it comes to you worrying about mac addresses fake it.
you need to enter your wifi password every time you start up tails unless you're using a persistent volume which remembers stuff like wifi passwords there should be a little network icon near the upper right corner of your screen which becomes a drop down menu when you click on it you should be able to just enter your password in there if you enter your wifi password correctly tor should be able to connect.
use whonix so much better then tailstails is really a stripped down linux command prompt above which an ugly gui has been is super you just need to get the installation sorted and you re good to go explore the o.
it makes me wonder what all they could actually do to stop it from happening maybe increasing checks for residues and odors would work a bit but for all the drugs without potent smells i just can't imagine what they could do i imagine this darknet scene will be changed a little bit as the powers that be catch on but they're never going to stop it.
right forehead slap i guess my assumption was that those sites would be ssl encrypted.
just a heads up you dont need an invite just leave the invite code box blank and it creates an account for you dont mean to step on op's toes for getting some free shrooms or acid but it doesnt seem fair asking to be paid for something that is free anyway.
dewr on november pmwhat link is that will search the forums for it found this was the easiest to get the most current version of electrum up and running in tail.

tyr on november amstop reading the children on reddit its a dos attack it happens to all markets when they get big especially now with btc increase i hope you are right but what a dos attack is got to do with btc value.
i was going to order mushrooms from them on alphabay and started running into all kinds of negative reviews i figure i would find the opposite since they require fe but now that i read this post i'm staying away from them thank you for spreading the word.
that would be amazing but i personally think that tmg is more than that and who knows in the future there are more choices of safe substances.
it is well known that windows captures and transmits all user input would you really feel safe if microsoft a prism participant had your dnm credentials.
do you have tails on usb if so i'd just start over with the application on tails os generate a new public key post it here and we can try and send you a message not sure what you mean by you ''can't decrypt message to other people'' if your refering to you cant decrypt a message your sending to someone else that's correct once you encrypt that message with their public key they're the only one who can decrypt it.
magicflight on february amyou aren't wrong so i've set up a fresh copy on a partition installed tor truecrypt and pgp are there any more security measures i can be taking there are many more security measures you could be taking grab a router or raspberry pi and configure an anonymizing middle box with portal or corridor or whonix gateway use virtual machines to isolate apps from each other get a second offline computer for air gapped pgp get a third computer for air gapped btc cold storage encrypt and backup your bitcoin wallets in at least places if you want to get really adventurous you could roll your own hardened gentoo with the grsecurity and tresor kernel patches i don't know why qubes isn't based on hardened gentoo fedora was an odd choice of base operating system in any case you probably don't need to do all that unless you are a major vendor.
she's not selling on any markets that i'm aware of but she has a thread here.

i have not been able to successfully use blockchain from tails i can create an account but when i go to log in the username and password fields never load is this an issue with javascript or something maybe someone could tell me how to adjust my settings to allow this.
still looking two i like this forum tho nice background.
updated due to new spam policy's.
yea blockchain's been all fucky for the last couple of days i had electrum set up but now tails has a new version and i can't seem to get it to work with it one thing's for sure all of this ordering drugs online has caused me to learn about online security more deeply than i would have otherwise.
zoxeebee on november amquote from nordicwhite on november amthank you both very much love you both thinkpad it is which of the series would be more advised for darknetmarket use the x or t also do thinkpads run on some form of windows os or do they come with some form of linux os pre installed apologies if question is noob most come with windows preinstalled but you can just wipe the hard drive and install linux yourself thinkpads are renowned for good linux compatibility list of models x and t are good choices x small portable t solid business laptop or main difference is indeed the size as far as i know love the x grabbed one for under some weeks ago including a year warranty if you have some bucks left get a msata ssd and you'll own a great device.
roadman on october amthis may very well be a dumb question but i'll go for it anyways say someone was monitoring a public wifi network that you're running tor with will that person be able to see who you are and where exactly you're going on tor or will it just show them that someone connected to their wifi network is connected to the tor network and nothing more sorry op for jacking this thread but i think it would be a good extension to the question thanks you're probably safe wifi operators can easily mitm you but ssl certs provide some protection if you take the time to verify them with tor you'd be looking at potentially being redirected to a compromised entry point controlled by the network operator or his conspirators i think that'd be pretty difficult to pull off though your local place is probably not that sophisticated or interested a trusted vpn protects your traffic until it gets off the wifi operator's network but in this specific example i think a private tor bridge would be just as good.
lizard labs does ship to the us and if anyone wishes for an invite i have one for you.
tails stands for the amnesiac incognito live system tails is a live system that aims at preserving your privacy and anonymity it helps you to use the internet anonymously almost anywhere you go and on any computer but leave no trace using unless you ask it explicitly it is a complete operating system designed to be used from a dvd or a usb stick independently of the computer's original operating system it is free software and based on debian gnu linux tails comes with several built in applications pre configured with security in mind web browser instant messaging client email client office suite image and sound editor etc tails relies on the tor anonymity network to protect your privacy online the pre installed software is configured to connect through tor and direct non anonymous connections are blocked tails is being constantly updated for security flaws you will need to do this all over again soon to stay safe this comes from the tails website it's very important to keep your version of tails up to date otherwise your system will be vulnerable to numerous security holes the development team is doing its best to release new versions fixing known security holes on a regular basis you will need x gb usb thumb drives gb may pass they are very cheap and available almost everywhere download the latest version of the tails iso file from here remember where you save it if you are an advanced user you can download the cryptographic signature on this same page and then verify the download with the tails key from here download the latest version of the linux universal usb installer from here run the newly downloaded universal usb installer a read and 'agree to' the disclaimer b select tails from the first drop down list it's towards the end of the list step c browse to and select the tails iso file step d select your usb drive letter format the drive if its not empty already step e click 'create' button then wait for it to finish will be a few minutes at least restart the computer and boot into tails from the usb drive see below for details on booting from a usb drive booting from a usb drive if it does not automatically boot to the usb drive you need to select the boot order some newer computers will allow you to select which drive to boot to with a small menu without changing bios settings you might instead need to edit the bios settings restart your computer and watch for a message telling you which key to press to enter the bios setup it will usually be one of f f del esc or f press this key while your computer is booting to edit your bios settings you need to edit the boot order depending on your computer you should see an entry for 'removable drive' or 'usb media' move this to the top of the list to force the computer to attempt to boot from usb before booting from the hard disk save your changes and continue many flash drives ship usb fdd formatted and some systems will not detect or even boot usb fdd most systems can however boot usb zip and or usb hdd if you are having a hard time getting your bios to detect your flash drive you can try to format it as usb hdd or usb zip using the bootice program or similar caution this is a very advanced program use with caution follow links for the latest version more detailed instruction on how to boot from usb you can read you have problems accessing the bios read this other questions ask away or pm i will not accept donations for this tutorial i offer this only in hope that more people will start using tor if you have excess bitcoins you feel like donating to a worthy cause please send them to tor or tails up installing a persistent volume alongside a liveusb copy of tails this is why you need two usb drives you should now be presented with a log in prompt for a temporary session administration password this is reset every time you load tails it is optional to enter this it is used to allow current session access to system functions if you get any errors about access rights try using an admin password at log in also at this point you can optionally select to use a windows xp camo 'skin' to make tails look more like xp if you're in a public place for example this is also optional once tails is up and running insert the second usb drive click the 'applications accessories' menu then highlight 'tails' then click 'tails usb installer' a click the st option clone install b select your target device from the drop down menu your second usb drive c click 'next' then wait for it to finish however long to copy about gb to a usb drive usually a few minutes this will install a new copy of tails onto your second usb drive this will be your new proper tails usb shutdown this session of tails with the power button up in the right hand corner don't forget to take out the first usb you created and boot into the new second tails usb you can format the first usb drive later on that copy of tails is no longer required log in to the new tails usb once logged in click the 'applications' menu then highlight the 'system tools' sub menu then click on configure persistent volume the size of the persistent volume is automatically determined by how much left over space is on the usb drive after installing tails in the previous steps a choose your pass phrase for the persistent volume you will need to enter this every time you login to tails the persistent volume is an encrypted partition protected by a pass phrase once the persistent volume is created you can choose to activate it or not each time you start tails it is a good place to store sensitive materials when choosing your pass phrase remember that short easily guessed pass phrases are very easily cracked it would take one intel i k cpu over years to brute force crack an aes encrypted random character pass phrase using lowercase uppercase p c characters b click create and wait for it to finish c on completion a window will popup allowing you to select what tails will save in the new persistent volume automatically internet shortcuts pgp keys nudie pictures application settings etc i recommend selecting everything close and reboot with your modem plugged in and switched on log back into tails with your new persistent volume make sure your modem is plugged in and turned on click the 'system' menu then highlight the 'preferences' submenu then click on 'network connections' now only you know what type of internet connection you pay for i cannot help you with that my personal internet connection was amazingly simple to setup i was quite surprised by its pre configured setups it has many different countries options for local telcos pre installed another note tails is pre configured to go through tor it is pre installed with vidalia and a torified browser called 'iceweasel' it should automatically open up when connected to the internet if not use the 'iceweasel' browser menu shortcut to get onto the road also this operating system is not persistent for security measures meaning that any changes you make that are not saved in the persistent volume will not be saved on restarting tails you are now finished feel free to click through all the menus and play with the applications.
this may very well be a dumb question but i'll go for it anyways say someone was monitoring a public wifi network that you're running tor with will that person be able to see who you are and where exactly you're going on tor or will it just show them that someone connected to their wifi network is connected to the tor network and nothing more sorry op for jacking this thread but i think it would be a good extension to the question thanks.
vitaminlsd on june amtails is not secure for serious dnm activities and here's the first reason why usa feds have already conducted tor attacks that have landed significant dnm figures behind bars the above article has more details about how the feds did it and who they have arrested so far a former silk road lieutenant for starters also tor bridges are practically useless for hiding from the nsa because the nsa harvests the tor bridge addresses from the emails send to from the tor project the nsa knows you're using tor anyways if you're using a tor bridge tor bridges were designed for people in repressive third world countries not us citizens hiding from the nsa it also gets worse and this is information that every dnm user serious or small should know about but since the edward snowden leaks the nsa has talked about if not bragged that they have timing attacks for de anonymizing tor users what does this breach have to do with tails isn't it just a live version of linux is it because it's not designed to be used with a vpn and that vpns are the safest way to access tor i'm not disputing what you're saying i just don't understand it thanks.

i just cannot seem to wrap my head around bitcoinsi'm a bit confused on the whole matter i signed up for coinbase via tor with a sigaint email however buying and selling bitcoins is not available in my country yet so am i supposed to use google chrome or something i mean i'll probably just do it the noob way and buy coins with a card i can get from my local store that doesn't require any info but i feel like if i sign up for coinbase on chrome and use it to buy shite from middle earth on tor that's suspicious right and then there's wallets for storing coins correct and helix i don't know i just feel a bit confused and the guides don't really help me for some reason edit in a nutshell i'm aware that i shouldn't make an account on coinbase via chrome then suddenly use it on tor i'm just confused as to how i should take my usd money turn it into bitcoins and spend it on me.
i did a grams search and the only nz vendor i saw was thunderjew on nucleus.
nucleus or me.
nucleus seems to be where all my domestic sellers ar.
hmm good question i'm not sure about the safety between the two i use an online wallet blockchain that might be a good post if this doesn't get much attention make sure you google or use the search function and see if a topic has already been posted about the difference in safety and reliability in a downloaded vs online wallet thanks and best of luck feel free to ask anymore questions you have i'm more than happy to help out.

tertiary on october pmhey es thank you for sharing that very interesting post i'd like to read more about it and other thoughts that the author has would you mind passing along the source info it kinda sounds like bruce schneier ill try to locate.
anyone else getting this would really like to withdraw coin for my last three orders anyway for those who ordered from me before i hit vacation mode if blackbank doesn't come up please rest assured your orders are going out today have already gone out all pending orders for middle earth as well unfortunately middle earth doesn't seem to have a vacation mode that vendors can turn on themselves instead they must wait for gandalf please do not order from me on middle earth until june if you read this and i'm not in vacation yet it's supposedly getting ddos attacked right now and last i saw gandalf had not waved his vacation wand for me yet i will be checking when the site gets back up and sending anything else asap but please don't order my processing time has been fairly quick up until this point but any orders placed today or later may take a little longer to get out and i'd really not receive any and hope that i'm in vacation mode next time i'm able to load the site i'll resume taking orders in june and lsd will be back on the menu.
wonderful bit of community work here maybe we could sticky this thread.
acas has too many bugs imo i tried out the market and error pages kept cropping u.
that's a good question i assume the nsa has eyes everywhere and connect using public wifi at a distance i'm the guy parked in the s vw campervan in the very back of the starbucks parking lot with the massive antenna on the roof haha but on a serious note if mullvad is in an eyes country should i not use vpn in any of the eyes countries has anyone heard of cryptostorm are they ne good.
is a linux based operating system built for anonymity if you can mount an iso image copy of a dvd cd to a dvd or usb drive use tails it's more secure and it has everything you need built right in.
sterlingsword on december amquote from ultrabear on december ami for one love the idea sterling but do not see the issue with some type of small fee to help cover operational expenses on your end please keep me updated on your progress as i am extremely interested in your concept thank you i will i'm trying to negotiate a deal with a vendor for free lsd anually to run the service i know i could make a lot more by taxing transactions but that's not what i'm about i'm a firm believer that more money leads to more problems don't get me wrong i love money but i'd have to deal with laundering it getting it in the first place which would require more time just stuff i don't care for i make a good living and this type of merchant system is very easy to create all of the extra stuff are the challenge but i'm only interesting in helping people out i sincerally believe that anyone that wants lsd other drugs used sparingly should have access too them to free their mind and to not only help themselves but help others if i can provide a community to peolple that will offer that that's money in and of itself for me plus i'll habe a reliable market to buy lsd on but hopefully this vendor i'm in contact with will be interested in purchasing it i have him in mins for the top vendor so he'll probably get the source regardless just with lsd i will offer more i'll see how it goes lol either way i'm developing it though  on december amwow so much thought went into this but working directly with vendors whom have proven themselves this system is hard to beat i send coin they send product simple i will never join an open market againthank you for your feedback mod that's the idea a community based on human principle trust and that is exactly what i'm aiming for an entire community of completely trusted vendors of which vendors have the ability to ban if it comes down too it you can almost gurantee that so long as you're a good customer and don't lie cheat or steal that you'll have an entire community of people such as yourselves also harder for le to penetrate with typical social engineering hi sterling great idea i agree that vendors shouldn't or probably wouldn't have an issue with at least donating a small fee to help run the site i also like money and i'm currently helping out a friend with his business and even though i don't ask for money but just to clarify how we would work things out i asked in the beginning now i am comfortable with accepting his paying for resources fuel and whatever else i might need to work and running gear i make sure of it i rarely ask for anything but he's great anyway i think it's great how you are in a way giving the control back to the vendors and really focusing on trust being what drives the wheels you remind me of myself question i was wondering how the exact product pp price stock item count the victorious vendor sale method might work if a vendor of a smaller magnitude was to go up against someone like tor or the like or maybe i just haven't worked that out yet but you have i suppose this wouldn't be showed off publicly in respect of the vendors which is a shame it's a cool idea but instead just the transaction would initiate i don't quite understand how trust of the vendors toward each other works i thought at first it was trust amongst vendors and consumers anyway goodluck with this i hope you see it through maybe at first you could keep the numbers down until all the kinks are ironed out and keep it a bit easier for you and the mods to operate goodluck.
regarding rotating your bridges entry points msh points to valuable resources if you don't want to enter bridges info on every startup you can put the bridges data in the torrc file for tor browser bundle check tor browser bundle directory browser torbrowser data tor torrc file in tails it should be in etc tor torrc iirc.

ketaman on september amif you're really worried about security buy a laptop locally with cash and only use it for browsing dn however a tails usb is easy to use and offers basically equal security edi.
thanks uncleal very appriciated i understand using proxy vpn will hide my isp that i use torhoping that there is nothing wrong with it they will see only that i use it but not what i do with it hoping i'm not wrong hereusing tor for download torrents movies application with utorrent software the end as they say with vpn they keep logos and even if you pay maybe open vpn is the deal paing btc anonymous or just like i do only tor sure the best option must be cracking wifi around thanks.
thanks.
i didn't include alphabay in my poll because i didn't realize it had the userbase that it now does and new markets without many users i'm weary ofbut after checking it out i like what i see i have a good feeling about it decently feature rich some new ideas i could really see some of the features or ideas behind features there being improved in cool ways that would make them a little more useful i like seeing a market that has unique or less common features to me that's a sign that they value improving the service and that there's a decent likelihood of site improvements i dislike that a lot of markets tend to stay the same when they feel they've got the essentials down when innovative features could really imrpove the overall experience i realize we've got this dillemma where it seems all markets inevitable exit scam or get busted but amusing the very hypothetical possibility that multiple markets see a lot of growth and outlast people's expectations with integretiy and by eluding law enforcement organizations i'd like to see people gravitate towards the ones that are well designed feature rich and offer a streamlined vending experience of oustanding efficiency minimal redundancy tediousness and anything that would improve the customer experience too i'm of the mindset that improving the vendor side experience where heavy work loads can be much more manageable with the right features design is potentially as good for buyers as it is for vendors because the more efficiently we are able to work the better our customer service will be and some vendors will likely even charge less where the work process is less tedious and more efficient because they will be able to accomplish more in less time i know i would there's a handful of features that i'd outright lower my prices right away for and other features that would make me want to do frequent temporary discounts.
is tor that effective when it comes to wallets and anonymity to my understanding tor only disguises the activity you're doing but anyone who's eavesdropping at the exit node can get my ip pretty easily so if i use tor for my electrum wallet the electrum servers may not know where the coins came from but le can always know it by watching the exit nodes could it really be haha i guess i'm too paranoid  crepuscular on february pmbut for people who may have trouble getting coins that are totally unlinked to them maybe some information about different tumbling options advantages disadvantages current status reputation etc would be helpful btw i second this i think about new tumbling methods since btcfog at least according to what i read on reddit is latelz being sketchy as fuck.
thanks sillywabbit do you have by any chance an invite code.
what are lizardlabs exactly.
hello recently my local supply has dried up and so i have deciced to turn to the internet for all my needs having done a lot of reading i think i have the gist of everything security related and i have been trying to find a place to buy my first bitcoins and i've hit a wall as far as i can tell the most popular places are coinbase or localbitcoins i dont want to do any bank transfers but rather just walk into a bank and make a cash deposit into a specific account or at most just do a paypal transfer with no details but a reference number or something quite annoyingly localbitcoins seems to require a stupid amount of id checking even if i wasnt bothered with handing over id scans and phone numbers and proof of addess etc that amount of screwing about would still put me off due to all the hasstle so i thought fair enough these are legit exchanges there must be sellers on markets such as nucleus etc that are selling bitcoins apparently not my question is how do you guys get your bitcoins without having to perform the labours of hercules.
they do ship to us oh they must've changed or something i guess if you're gonna offer a lizardlabs invite for free i should too forget the trade idea if anyone wants an invite just message me and i will give you one freely it will require a functional email address.
started looking at it like my second home best online community i had ever came across love ya guys.
you can sort of look at it as a place that you can come to discuss products vendors and other markets or anything else really hell a lot of vendors out there are on here daily it is a place where you can meet those vendors and their costumers and chat with them so that when you do decide to order you can order in confidence knowing that they have been vetted through the community this place really is magestic.
keep in mind that tails comes with a firewall set up to allow only tor traffic you will have to set this up manually if you decide to maintain your own ubuntu system tails is amnesiac and can be run from a dvd that way you are sure that when you boot your system you start a clean system as long as your original tails iso is safe and trustworthy of course it would be very interesting for le to create a backdoor in tails as well as in ubuntu or debian without auditing everything you have to trust someone a vpn will hide the fact that you use tor from your isp don't expect any more protection if the cops want to get you they will get you wanna be sure you won't do the time don't do the crime.
so this is tough to write but i believe either something bad has happened to imb or more likely now that i may have been ripped off i have had an order with him unresolved since the beginning of april one that he claims was recently seized in europe an order he made me place to receive only a reship on a previous pack that got me a cd and two knock and talks he claimed that he had been disappointed in the past with customers leaving me due to screwing up once and said he needed another order to have the energy and motivation to do a reship he should have just honored as per his policy just to give you some context since returning as a customer this past september to 'hedge my bets' so to speak with another m source so i can get more packs to a drop as they have diff stealth and shipment areas i only got my first two orders from him with the same quality service that i had come to know imb for since sr my third order was the cd in which packs of m got a cd no big deal right but the quality of his customer service from that point then dropped off into nothing it seemed so i send him the coin for the new order and give him a new drop for the reship and a separate one for the other order it was odd that in this new order he didn t send his bullet point order template he was strict about using up until the order in question so he only ships the reship out and says he wants to wait until the reship lands a little frustrating but probably the best practice to avoid losses so the reship lands and i ask him to get the new one out asap and this is where the problems really seem to start imb's communication and response time was becoming even more abysmal he started frequently taking days to respond to emails often over days sometimes up to ten days and longer he always had an excuse and his last one in early april when i was inquiring if this new order had shipped was that his shipper was in the hospital and he was by his side for ten days i have heard the sick relative sob story before from scammers and it was a red flag to be honest but he says the order will ship the next day so i have faith and wait almost three weeks go by with no pack so i ask for the tracking number and he responds w o the tracking number but claims it was seized and writes me an almost frantic message telling me to clean house and abandon ties with the drop he seemed more animated and panicked than he normally is during these types of things so he actually replies the next day for once with the tracking number and says it didn't update and was removed from the system but curiously you get the same message from the tracking system when you enter in a random number formatted like a real tracking number the tracking says it is not registered in their database and to wait two days if it was posted recently this is something i have never seen before personally so yet again a week passes by with no word but imb eventually takes responsibility for the mistake saying they shipped too close to the border where the checks are harder and they will never do that again this is now the st of may and he's had my coins since the end of march so i push for a reship since it was clearly his fault which he agrees to but says it will take three weeks for him to do test runs and to contact him on may th so i wait and then email him on the th with a new unused drop specifically set up for imb in case i have more issues with him lol he hadn't responded to that email on the date i was instructed by him to get in touch i waited about days then sent another message asking what's up with this and to tell him that if he can't get my reship out in the next hours i would like a refund to order from cp like he suggested whom i already have been doing business with and should not have strayed from and i get no response again i wait another days and send him another email expressing my frustrations with all these problems and delays and just ask for refund as this is beyond ridiculous at this point still nothing no response my last message to him was on wednesday with a subject title of it appears you are scamming me and pleading for a resolution with a reship or refund or i may be forced to air my grievances publicly and not much surprise here he still has yet to respond hours later so he hasn't responded since may st over a month now and it has been days since the th of may when he told me to get back in touch about the reship i don't know what else to conclude here with all the problems leading up to this and the total lack of communication that got worse and worse up until now it really appears as if i am being fucked over by imb so now what i am now asking of the community is if any of imb s current customers have received email responses since the th of may because if they have that to me is a smoking gun and would pretty much prove that he s been ignoring me if anyone can chime in here to help that would be greatly appreciated now i sincerely hope i am wrong about this and he has a real reason for going dark but it's hard to keep the faith i will retract this statement apologize and go back to doing business with him if he can fix this for me but until then this is where it stands i only hope that my information will serve to help others make informed decisions about who they conduct business with.
i'd be more than happy to have an invite and be able to look around i appreciate all the works.
stay away i wouldn't even log onto the site it was left with nobody at the helm for several days before it went down then it pops back up with no explanation there is a strong possibility that it has been taken over by le with vendors and buyers of bulk being at the greatest risk.
the change to a new kernel and reports of users having issues including dirtysouf not being able to verify the signing key has me stuck on tails is there an alternative that includes usb mounting persistence and memory wiping at shutdown anyone very knowledgeable feel safe using the upgrade the upgraded kernel is the same flavor of linux used by redhat which works very closely with the us government.
vitaminlsd on june amquote from ssod on june amcurrently i am connecting to the darknet via tails tor bridges i feel as this is not a very safe unless i am wrong anyone have any advice on additional security measures to protect my real ip i get bulk so safety is a big concern to me let me know if my lack of faith in bridges is invalid though tails is not secure for serious dnm activities and here's the first reason why usa feds have already conducted tor attacks that have landed significant dnm figures behind bars the above article has more details about how the feds did it and who they have arrested so far a former silk road lieutenant for starters also tor bridges are practically useless for hiding from the nsa because the nsa harvests the tor bridge addresses from the emails send to from the tor project the nsa knows you're using tor anyways if you're using a tor bridge tor bridges were designed for people in repressive third world countries not us citizens hiding from the nsa it also gets worse and this is information that every dnm user serious or small should know about but since the edward snowden leaks the nsa has talked about if not bragged that they have timing attacks for de anonymizing tor users at the nsa in the washington post revealed that the nsa had figured out various ways of unmasking and penetrating the anonymity of the tor network since according to a page research paper titled simply tor the agency has worked on several methods that if successful would allow the nsa to uncloak anonymous traffic on a wide scale effectively by watching communications as they enter and exit the tor system rather than trying to follow them inside one type of attack for example would identify users by minute differences in the clock times on their computers and it still gets worse tor prioritizes fast relays and so if you consider that plausibly speaking many and possibly most of the most high speed tor relays are run by western intelligence agencies and not just grassroots tor volunteers it makes timing attacks so much easier for them from the pando com article from above quotein tor co founder roger dingledine revealed that the tor network is configured to prioritize speed and route traffic through through the fastest servers nodes available as a result the vast bulk of tor traffic runs through several dozen of the fastest and most dependable servers on today's network clients choose one of the fastest exit relays around of the time and of their choices come from a pool of relays this information above has already been public since the edward snowden leaks so now everyone reading this has no excuse not to get off tails and learn ubuntu or your other favorite flavor of linux and start using a reputable vpn impeccable track record of standing up against government requests keeps no logs and you can pay them in bitcoins you can start on this now or end up like the silk road lieutenant who got arrested because his tor connection got de anonymized by the government to what was probably his home ip address and if you're a serious dnm user you don't do business hours a day online from a public wifi spot this is not an acceptable solution for power users bonus points if you use a pre paid g hotspot with your non tails flavor of linux a reputable vpn where your face was never on camera buying the hotspot think fake wig cell phone at home and paid in cash true story great advise i however use a preconfigured travel router can be found on amazon called gl inet and flashed it with dd wrt and open vpn i then uploaded several vpn config files onto the router itself and foced all traffic through the vpn add to that i only plug in i never use wifi so the travel router is connected to the wan port from ethernet over power extender and then wired through the lan port into my machine i run tail when on the go and whinox when home i also 'bridge' into the tor network on start up and never use persistant memory i feel it is more secure to have my content keys keymanager etc stored on a seperate encrypted usb thumb drive that i then upload my keys before i go live so im essentially between my machine and the vpn that is then relaying those packets through a bridged connection into the tor i highly suggest you use aws to spawn yourself a vpn i feel it is more secure to have your very own vpn config rather than use one that is shared by others.
true dogchap i like your notations beneath your post count and karma.
hey guys i have a private invite into lizardlabs they are the original source of lsz and al lad and have the cheapest prices on both the clearnet and darknet excluding mssource but they sell minimum orders of a gram their prices for crystal al lad are usd for mg for mg for mg for mgas you can see their prices are really awesome and cheaper than anywhere else around you could buy crystal al lad and resell it on blotter to make a considerable profit their prices for lsz are more expensive because it is on tabs usd for x ug lsz for x ug however it is still cheaper than anywhere on research blotz com agora market silk road organic synth com et cetera however i am offering this as a trade what do i ask for you to get an invite a fee of dollars in bitcoin will do or mail to me a package of one single tab of lsd perhaps or so micrograms just one single dosed tab either that or grams of mushrooms something small and not pricey now wait a minute a lot of you right now are asking why you'd trust some dude who just got an account on this site like a few days ago that none of you know except for fartbomber whom i recently bought off of here's the trade off i am willing to make because i have zero reputation as a seller of anything i will give you my side of the deal first i will invite you into lizard labs and after you have registered and logged in to make sure it works you can give me the payment if you decide that i don't deserve anything and don't pay i will do nothing other than feel a bit disappointed that being said however i don't want to end up giving away most invites for free so i ask that you have at least posts or at least two points of karma in order for me to give you the invite before payment this is to prevent just any troll making an account and talking friendly in order to get a free invite and then ditching payment let me know if you guys are interested or just bored thanks.
looks like i missed it as well would really appreciate an invite.
all victims please add your names and orders numbers to this list and give honest feedback to the community via reddit to.
just an update alphabay is now the biggest market with abraxas being down for the time being vendor buyer registration would highly recommend using dream though as they are the longest running and most reliable dnm to datedream registration link.
what dosage are the tabs ug also does the xtal have a name i know you said you source locally but if they do have a name i'd love to hear it.
this is awesome might your guys be able to go one step further i'd love to see some of the questions sent to you guys possibly be put on the forum for others to learn from as well maybe thats up to the people sending in the questions to have it public or whatnot but i think that when it comes to harm reduction if your guys have info to keep everyone safe having it out in the public will hopefully benefit alot of people.
just do lbc and a cash deposit to a stranger's bank the process is easy enough for anyone any legit trader will be happy to guide you through it before you buy please check out my listings on hansa and my threads on tmg there are tons of great vendors on tmg but it can be difficult to navigate look for any way that you protect yourself and your money love lr.
hii've been trying to register on agora but keep having this message error cannot register at this time user limit reached please wait until the full release is there any way to know when they'll open registrations again thanks.
everything works withdrawals as wellalthough sometimes the support system is really lackin.
why is this even an option at all no real reason to have this on just an extra pattern to be analyzed stalking your fellow tmgers is never appropriate if you are refreshing your page waiting for your vendor to sign in so they can reply to your pm then maybe you don't have the patience to fully appreciate these great chemicals.
update tmg has banned all market link except for acas and dr d from being said on the forum due to spam you can find all the active market invites here link d link customers drddrddig z v onion session register d c a vendors drddrddig z v onion session register vendor d c a thank you and enjoy dnstats co.
luxaeterna on april pmwould it be safe enough to continue to use online back transfer so long as i wash them before sending them to vendor here i plan on doing tails pgp lbc electrum wash helix market vendor how does this sound thanking you this would be safe as long as if you're not buying k of bitcoins per month then you'd just better have a believable story what it's for or pay for and consult consult a bitcoin attorney if it's that serious have seen law firms on search engines before that specialize in bitcoin law also i would even recommend sending from helix back to a fresh address in a new bitcoin wallet we can call your tumbled stash like for gammagoblin's lsd to buy it when you go to checkout it locks in the bitcoin price but if you use helix sometimes it ends up sending a few dollars or cents less so you can either overpay in a situation like this or pay twice the better solution would be electrum wallet a helix electrum wallet b since then the exact amount will get sent to your vendor marketplace this also gives you a tumbled stash to play with instead of feeling like you're forced to send it all to the market immediately and have your extra coins sitting on there does this help.
gleeful on january pmstay away i wouldn't even log onto the site it was left with nobody at the helm for several days before it went down then it pops back up with no explanation there is a strong possibility that it has been taken over by le with vendors and buyers of bulk being at the greatest risk agreed looks sketchy as fuck avoid.
clagget on june pmif you google pgp encryption site the first listing is igolder a gold trading site with pgp help then software wike etc my first question is if you use a clearnet site like that one that does the encrypt decrypt can all you type in become open to prying eyes i know that sounds naive but i really don't know no one should be caught dead using a site like igolder i wouldn't use it even in an emergency  clagget on june pmsecond how important is key size you should be using a bit rsa primary key with a bit encryption subkey i wouldn't use anything smaller  clagget on june pmand a bonus third question say i'm browsing my favorite vendors for fun and then go to search a word on google is mixing tor with clearnet a security problem i wouldn't do that either if you get distracted and use the clearnet browser for something that should be private spitfir.
i'm not sure what you mean by the electrum change addresses does this sound ok where could i improve tails pgp lbc online bank wire electrum wash helix market vendor.
i was able to order from him last month arrived and had an awesome trip if he's really scamming then he must be doing it randomly try to checkout the tmg shrooms forum maybe you can find some trustworthy vendors.
vitaminlsd on june ami mean mullvad already has a history of denying government requests and the usa doesn't have any jurisdiction to jail a swedish vpn provider didn't know they had an history of non cooperation is it just their claim could be marketing or facts  vitaminlsd on june ammullvad's co founder was the first person that we publicly know of to successfully exploit the heartbleed vulnerability against openvpn this is one thing they have standing out for them above all other vpn providers why they're worthy of your business before or after the exploit was publicly published if it's after many people could have done that as all the code needed was public too  vitaminlsd on june amthen since mullvad is a vpn provider and based in sweden they're not even legally obligated to keep logs under the eu data retention directive because in sweden this doesn't apply to vpn providers ianal but they can't even be legally forced to keep logs on users and i've seen no indication that they are their entire reputation and business depends on it if a lavabit style situation ever happened mullvad has already stated they would rather discontinue their business if they were somehow forced to give up information on any user that's what they say but couldn't they receive a secret court order again i don't know anything about swedish and european law so i can't comment on that but i doubt they couldn't be forced to reveal identifying information concerning a customer in case of a serious crime i don't know if drug related offenses are taken lightly or not in sweden  vitaminlsd on june amif you can figure out how to do this in iptables yourself please share this since this would be a big benefit to the community this iptables configuration is on my bucket list to get working not for mullvad's sake but for the sake of other vpns i use but i haven't started working on these iptables rules yet there are many rule set available on the clearnet as well as many possible ways to achieve that you can limit outgoing connections to the ips and ports of your vpn server and force all other traffic to go through tun block all ipv traffic as it's not needed for tor learning iptables is worth it to understand what the commands are actually doing when you are done testing i recommend iptables persistent as you seem to be using ubuntu  vitaminlsd on june amwith a tails setup your main threat model is not a compromised dvd but a zero day exploit against tor browser on tails you have no extra layers of security compared to doing everything in vms if a zero day exploit compromises your tor browser on tails your entire os including your pgp private keys your pgp private key passwords your decrypted keepass entries after you unlock your keepass all of this is theoretically accessible to the attacker now and if the government is doing some sneaky shit going after tails users to get after say serious people in the drug trade then these above things would be the keys to the castle that the feds would target on a tails system don't forget that tails has a firewall blocking non tor traffic if the attacker can't either escalate privileges to the root user or change his user to debian tor there is no way he can guess your actual ip address they also use apparmor of course virtual or physical isolation would be better than tails if you have no interest in the fact that's it's fully amnesiac and can be run from a read only dvd but tails is better than running tbb on a windows or linux machine with no firewall rules for those of us who like an amnesiac system and don't mind using no vpn as well as for those who want a vpn and use a vpn router tails seems to be a good option if you want to really protect your private key keepass and unencrypted stuff get a second cheap laptop and keep all these air gapped even if you use virtual machines an air gapped computer remove the wireless card if you are paranoid can't hurt to manage your gpg keys and make sure they never touch a machine connected to the network  vitaminlsd on june amwith this vm setup i described all you would pretty much ever do with your host os at that point is install ubuntu security updates and that's it and you should do it over a vpn that has cover traffic over it too so the government can't profile you that you run ubuntu on one or more systems from your house or what packages you keep updated the ubuntu packages you install from apt are signed too so if your initial ubuntu iso you installed was a legitimate one the signed packages you're downloading from ubuntu should be legitimate as well hell you can even run tails in a vm as your main way of using tor browser and a vpn from your host os now you've solved the tor de anonymization problem and you have insulated yourself against zero day exploits from the government for anyone focusing on virtual machines whonix is probably better than tails as it provides software isolation and comes with supposedly strong firewall rules but it's not read only an attacker can theoretically modify your images even if as you said it's a complicated task and it's far from amnesiac it's even possible to setup a vm for vpn with vpn only firewall rules and use this as a gateway to the internet for whonix gateway you would have to start two vm before being able to use tbb on the third one but you'd be able to avoid leaks on each step would be maybe better to use a vpn router so that an attacker escaping a vm would still be stuck behind the vpn but if the attacker is skilled enough to escape your vm couldn't he hack your router too  vitaminlsd on june ambut i don't even recommend running tails as your main vm os for tor browsing and here's a few reasons why when i tried using the built in tor browser feature to update tor browser in tails at least in a tails vm i had i don't know if this is different in tails the newest now tor browser complained that it does not have the system permissions required to install it this can be remedied by installing the newest tor browser manually but this is kind of defeating the purpose of why you'd want to use tails in the first place so basically the next time there's a tor browser update that has any security patches in it your tor browser on tails has known in it and i don't think anybody bothers in tails to check if their tor browser is up to date every time they boot up tails you probably would have to download a new iso each time there is a new release  vitaminlsd on june amwhereas with tor browser on ubuntu there's a simple on click button to upgrade the entire tor browser install and tor browser at least on ubuntu checks every time on startup if there's a new tor browser version also tails only runs normal tor browser and not tor browser hardened the latter of which has been hardened more against exploits right but tails includes a firewall forcing traffic to the tor network and avoiding leaks tails also sets the system clock through tor and wipes your memory when you shut down your computer won't work if run in a vm obviously  vitaminlsd on june amqubes os praised by edward snowden and other esteemed computer security professional is actually built around the concept of everything being done in vms but using qubes proficiently is out of reach for most dnm users but if you're making repeat purchases or posting on darkweb forums with that same username or posting about things that would get you arrested then a vpn is absolutely a necessity unless you want to leave yourself open to ending up like that silk road lieutenant a qubes live dvd with whonix working out of the box would be nice and easy i've seen posts where some people ask for it maybe in a close future it will be available a problem i see with qubes is that you need recent hardware to be able to run it while a second hand laptop should be able to run tails just fine i don't know anything about this silk road guy was he busted because of a weakness in tor was he a tails user  vitaminlsd on june amthis is super paranoid in a good way i think if you need this level of security go for it but this wouldn't protect you from having your tor connection de anonymized to your home ip still the thing is that if your tor connection ever gets de anonymized to your home ip address and they do decide to raid you or do physical surveillance on you and then raid you or the places you do business at you wouldn't be expecting any of this to be coming it wouldn't protect you if tor is broken if tor isn't broken physical isolation will make it impossible to an attacker to get your real ip unless they are able to hack your tor router as well as the system where you run your browser  vitaminlsd on june ami trust tails they're in it for the right reasons but you just can't run vms in it and it's not vpn friendly i totally agree with you to use a vpn with tails the best way is probably to use a vpn router setup like what cosmic consciousness described another problem with tails is that guards change too often using bridges is an easy fix in the end it depends who your enemy is on the one hand if your enemy is powerful enough not much will protect you it can be easy for him to trace the vpn connection back to you spying on the network without your vpn provider or yourself knowing targeted hacking would be an option too on the other hand for most people hanging out in this majestic garden who like myself are here for the community and not to conduct business i feel like tails or whonix can be good enough eventually with an air gapped machine for gpg and sensitive documents as usually recommended a vpn router if the provider can be trusted or to hide the fact that you use tor to your isp can be nice a setup as you describe can be great as well as long as there is a strong firewall and that everything is done the right way using an os like tails or whonix is nice as you don't need to be tech savvy to set it up you just need to trust the devs.
i like these ideas tough part is implementing them and breaking the monotonicity of open markets and the plague that is reddi.
this really is helpful cc heavy thanking light and love.

let's hope not.
mtsthelen on march pmwhat about safe bad anyone know from my point of view torbox's main weakness is its' character limitation on password length spitfir.
thanks for the reply i'll be sure to clean up and take a break from this until i feel more comfortable.
nordicwhite on november amthank you both very much love you both thinkpad it is which of the series would be more advised for darknetmarket use the x or t also do thinkpads run on some form of windows os or do they come with some form of linux os pre installed apologies if question is noob most come with windows preinstalled but you can just wipe the hard drive and install linux yourself thinkpads are renowned for good linux compatibility list of models x and t are good choices x small portable t solid business laptop or.
prarp on august pmhunting down the shulgin chems is part of the fun visiting the markets reguarly all sorts of stuff pops up for short windows every now and again something fairly obscure will get listed and if the right price and vendor seems ok i'll nab it for my collection there was some tma on alphabay a few months ago but very expensive a new vendor on dream has a few psilocin analogs at the moment although only in gram listings due to their reported relative instability and my infrequent opurtunities to partake i'm reluctant to buy anything but small samples of these who's the vendor on dream you're referencing if you're looking for psilocin analogues you might check out ion on alphabay or occasionally here he at one point anyway had aco dmt ho mipt ho met and aco met.
schuldig on may pmit is pre installed with vidalia and a torified browser called 'iceweasel' it should automatically open up when connected to the internet if not use the 'iceweasel' browser menu shortcut to get onto the road iceweasel opened up automatically for me up to tails version but i've had to use the shortcut in the last two versions and.
i have one more question do i use blockchain as a stand alone wallet or use a popular mainstream one that i can easily transfer from my cc or bank account and then transfer them to blockchain im new to bitcoin so i'm a lot clueless right now.
pinto on november ami have a paxful account and a wallet that i have downloaded i buy bitcoins with cash deposits at bofa you dont even need an account at bofa you just need cash and tell the teller you need to make a cash deposit to an account fill out the slip with information provided to you by the seller on paxful and there you go btc within minutes after you deposit i looked into it should i use tor with this website i might use an american express gift card something disposable from the dollar store.
chances are it will be okay but i understand it is a horrible feeling to think that someone has personal info on you and you don't know what's going to happen its that period of waiting for the letter that can be so stressful the biggest thing really is to get a drop address that isn't connected with you and so can never link your address with your internet activity live and learn hope everything turns out okay.
bum.
abraxas for sure the referals is mint as im earning a fair few btc just from referals also everything runs perfect there.
i think a lot of us were confused as exactly what tmg was i.
i've gotten stuff from him before he's been around for a while assuming he's the same b g mpact from sr his gear was good took weeks or so to the usa.
i deposited into my agora account on around pm i sit here on may th at pm days after my deposit and nothing has shown in my agora account one would hope that with such a big deposit agora support might respond to messages however they have yet to respond to the messages i have sent with just questions regarding deposits they said withdraws are fixed however they are working on deposits i hope agora comes through on this and doesn't drop the ball depositting btc shouldn't be the scary thing about the dnm the mailing of drug should be however i sit here scared worried confused and very irritated at the very simple transaction of btc to my account i hope agora fixes this soon as well because if a normal order takes weeks after vendor sends out package i am looking at a solid month on one order this is sad and not what customers pay commission to see.
i'm not big on markets everything i could possibly need is right here but if you are looking for something that's not here i would suggest agora is the best option at.
goodfornothing on may pmseems like a pretty bad time to be depositing coin to agora even when they come online for hours and it seems issues have been solved it seems like a big tease everyone who can't wait to get back on and get shit done and hasn't been scared off yet is like hope it stays up oh what's that it's staying up seemingly oh wait nevermind fuck fuck fuck fuck at this point i think it would be ambitious to get too comfortable even if it goes consecutive days with uptime oh and i'm not mocking the op i've fallen into the semi comfort of a little bit of responsive uptime a bit too easily too howdy gfn thank you for the response it's weird not being able to trust the dnm but it's a giving being blessed with dpr before was just soo easy to have lack of downtime quick deposits withdraws that when i go to make an order on any marketplace i just quickly jump the gun which is faulty faulty on my end as i get left with in limbo however agora has fixed this and given me my btc i was still worried sick for multiple days like i can't lose that much money that's more than my car is worth i just need to be more understanding for the dnm but at the same time know that they could bail for numerous reasons at anytime.
it seems they may have reached such a high user volume on their servers for now they must not allow new users maybe this way the site shouldn't overload completely too much while figuring out a safe way to expand their server capabilities then again who really knows the reasons but if they were purposely stealing deposits me thinks they would also be allowing new users.
i don't know but when you do register please pretty please use the referral link in the top of my sig.
on october ami found this discussion and thought you may find it interesting not my words quotethe first thing you have to ask is what problem you're trying to solve by using a vpn instead of or in addition to tor generally people use vpns to either encrypt their traffic from their isp or to engage in membership concealment your isp can't profile you as a tor user vpns are extremely weak to website fingerprinting attacks since all websites don't pad their encrypted packets to the same size with a vpn an adversary can identify with probability if you're visiting a certain preidentified website despite your traffic being encrypted i've never seen a vpn which has been tested as having its encrypted traffic being fingerprinted with less than certainty tor pads all packets to bytes which significantly strengthens it against fingerprinting attacks also tor encrypts your traffic anyway and provides excellent membership concealment in the form of transport layer protocol obfuscators like obfsproxy and skypemorph when you use a vpn you're revealing that you're using an anonymizer tor can be configured to try to hide the fact that you're using an anonymizer at all so already there's no real reason to use a vpn since all their advantages are exceeded by tor using a vpn to connect to tor means that you're absolutely fucked if your vpn is compromised since a passive attacker can just wiretap you before your entry point enough said it's an especially bad idea to use a vpn you found advertised on a drug fraud forum as an entry point this is a favored tactic of law enforcement once they've flipped somebody if you use tor to connect to a vpn you're now deanonymizing yourself in other ways if you visit a site like mtgox or pecunix or any log gathering site you've now linked a service you're paying for maybe via credit card but still bad even if you're paying with bitcoins to your operations commercial services should never be used as endpoints because historically most vpns see hidemyass vpnbook voxility safe mail etc are forced by the feds to give up their customers after enough time in court tor is all you need preferably with a protocol obfuscator there's never been a record of anybody using tor for any illegal activity being identified the most secure pedos carders hackers who have ever been pwnt from shadowcrew to geohot and countless others were pwnt because of their use of ssh tunnels or vpn services also please check out this thread on tor talk and pay special attention to anything said by arma the lead developer of tor tl dr vpns are bad vpn to tor is useless and can be very bad tor to vpn is very bad tor is fucking awesome if you're playing the game of picking a vpn based on how privacy conscious they seem or where they're located you've already lost as i said several vpns that advertise themselves as prioritizing privacy and even accept bitcoins as a payment option such as hma are known to comply with title interception orders the feds have also been known to set up vpns in historically fed resistant locales such as the cis or middle east and advertise them on drug fraud boards even if you pay for a vpn anonymously and only connect to it through tor you're making a bottleneck of where all your traffic goes this lets the vpn profile everything you do and that can be deanonymizing in and of itself the thrust of my posts is that you cannot trust vpn providers because they are operated by men who can be coerced by money or the laws of man to turn on you you really have no way of knowing how anonymous you truly are tor however can be trusted because it's based on the immutable laws of mathematics which have no regard for the laws of man don't be so quick to trust tor although an onion garlic mixnet routing solution can theoretically be implemented with a very low probability of de anonymization tor's implementation leaves much to be desired tor has a high guarantee of anonymity but the codebase has become so bloated with backwards compatibility exceptions and inefficient routing behaviors that i hypothesize a number of will become known in the next year much traffic correlation analysis on tor networks is already possible as aaron johnson showed in his recent paper that an average tor user with stable usage patterns can be deanonymized after months with probability tor does offer the wonderful pluggable transports stenography transforms which i recommend clients use as it may preserve your anonymity by obscurity alone most dpi attempts target the lowest common denominator of users indeed vpn services alone do not provide any guarantee of anonymity but tunneling visible tor traffic through a vpn may or may not provide you with more cover depending on the traffic analysis habits of your isp or governing agency pluggable transports may provide more obscurity although chinese government has recently began successfully thwarting connection attempts to obfs bridges by dpi assume patterns may be extrapolated from any data you send and receive and that your adversaries are highly motivated and funded particularly in the united states china and uk but i like tail tor better than whonix torthis is extremely wise information and i am very glad you posted it esmile.
tm on august ami've seen more clearnet sites that sell trypamines than i have on dnms you can find al ist of vendor shops on reddit all depends on where you live of course i live in good ol' 'murica and i'm just a little sketched out about ordering thru the clearnet especially not that it really matters i guess i'm getting other international packages with hella drugs in them anyway q.

so i'm new to this whole thing amd still trying to figure this out i have a few questions i hope someone will take the time to answer first what exactly is pgp i know it's an encryption key or something how do i find out mine how do i use this to encrypt an email and is there anything else i need to know to order from vendors most want you to use the key to send them an email but honestly i'm lost if someone could help that would be great thank.
so lsz is still not classified as a drug or since i read on june th the uk acmd recommended that lsz be specifically named in the uk misuse of drugs act as a class a drug despite not identifying any harm associated with its use is that the reason why they can sell it on clear net so openly.

i have several problems i changed my email from mailtor net to safe mail net i'm trying to change my pgp signature that appears at the bottom of my forum posts because it still ends with my old email address i can't find my pgp signature from within my pgp program i am also confused because apparently there is a sig that starts with at the beginning and ends with my email address which appears at the bottom of my posts and in the signature field in my forum profile i don't remember how i was ever able to find my sig and enter in the sig field in my profile in the first place i tried entering my new pgp public key in the pgp signature field in my profile per the instructions in the new members thread hoping it would somehow convert it to a sig but that didn't work apparently there is also something much longer about a fourth the size of a public key that starts with begin pgp signature that i see on a vender's thread that is referred to as their sig so that means there are types of sigs i can't figure out how to find either one of these types of sigs for my own pgp key i also tried to change my email address in my forum account settings but it says i must enter my old email address in order to make any changes how can i change my email address in there if it needs my old email address in order to make changes also someone said i should be able to obtain their public key through the link in their sig they were referring to the long one that starts with begin pgp signature does anyone know how to obtain their key from that many thanks to all who can help me.
another thing you can do is to buy bitcoins normally with the idchecks and whatnot and then tumble them around obfuscate so to speak tl dr have clearnet bitcoin wallet tied to your irl name then have darknet bitcoin wallet which in theory should be really hard to link to your irl person.

ultrabear on december ami for one love the idea sterling but do not see the issue with some type of small fee to help cover operational expenses on your end please keep me updated on your progress as i am extremely interested in your concept thank you i will i'm trying to negotiate a deal with a vendor for free lsd anually to run the service i know i could make a lot more by taxing transactions but that's not what i'm about i'm a firm believer that more money leads to more problems don't get me wrong i love money but i'd have to deal with laundering it getting it in the first place which would require more time just stuff i don't care for i make a good living and this type of merchant system is very easy to create all of the extra stuff are the challenge but i'm only interesting in helping people out i sincerally believe that anyone that wants lsd other drugs used sparingly should have access too them to free their mind and to not only help themselves but help others if i can provide a community to peolple that will offer that that's money in and of itself for me plus i'll habe a reliable market to buy lsd on but hopefully this vendor i'm in contact with will be interested in purchasing it i have him in mins for the top vendor so he'll probably get the source regardless just with lsd i will offer more i'll see how it goes lol either way i'm developing it though  on december amwow so much thought went into this but working directly with vendors whom have proven themselves this system is hard to beat i send coin they send product simple i will never join an open market againthank you for your feedback mod that's the idea a community based on human principle trust and that is exactly what i'm aiming for an entire community of completely trusted vendors of which vendors have the ability to ban if it comes down too it you can almost gurantee that so long as you're a good customer and don't lie cheat or steal that you'll have an entire community of people such as yourselves also harder for le to penetrate with typical social engineering.
the simplest pgp software is gpg usb ime it can be saved on a usb encrypted if you like although it doesn't have to be the software will make you a public key which you will give out to anyone who wishes to send you an encrypted message likewise you'll use other's public keys to encrypt messages to them encrypting a message will return you a big string of gobbledygook which can then be decrypted only by the holder of a corresponding private key gpg usb has some simple instructions wih it it's literally a few clicks of a mouse easy stuff.
tortrip on april amquote from spitfire on december pmi thought it was great too until they started serving ads through torads what really got me and caused me to abandon my accounts there is the fact that an ad that i was being served related to an organization in my country of origin that is either a huge coincidence or ip address data is possibly being leaked indicating the country of origin i've also been using sigaint org but i've never seen any ads there perhaps that's because i'm browsing with javascript disabled and ad block enabled the service has so far been quite reliable i just found it freaky they now seem to have fixed whatever the problem was and i have resumed using the service once more spitfir.
gardener on june pmkeep in mind that tails comes with a firewall set up to allow only tor traffic you will have to set this up manually if you decide to maintain your own ubuntu system tails is amnesiac and can be run from a dvd that way you are sure that when you boot your system you start a clean system as long as your original tails iso is safe and trustworthy this type of behavior isn't desirable on ubuntu since you want to keep your packages updated as soon as there's security updates firefox patches for security updates for any clearnet web browsing you may do over your vpn etc and these firewall rules wouldn't allow ubuntu to check for security updates plus unless you configured your iptables firewall just right your vpn couldn't connect either if you are ultra paranoid you can actually replicate the amnesiac ness of tails like this you can basically install ubuntu in a vm update all packages tweak everything just the way you like it plus if you're going to run a double vpn get your certs or your mullvad client etc set up now harden firefox for any clearnet web browsing harden your tor browser for any clearnet web browsing but don't visit any sites on either of these yet then take a snapshot now a would be attacker has a near zero attack surface against your tor browser or firefox unless they had a zero day exploit for it with turning javascript off in tor browser this pretty much eliminates of their attack surface and if you have good web hygiene with noscript in firefox and also have flash disabled this also eliminates most of a would be attacker's attack surface now the best part is that you can revert to your snapshot every time you close your vm whenever there are any security updates for ubuntu firefox or tor browser install your updates without visiting any other websites while the update is installing then take a new vm snapshot after the update is done you now have what's basically an amnesiac system that reverts to a clean and secure state every time you start it bookmarks are a pain in the ass doing things this way but if you are crafty you can export your bookmarks to a vm folder share then when you start your vm again to your most recent snapshot you can import your bookmarks and snapshot it again it would be incredibly difficult for the feds to compromise your vm this way even with a zero day drive by download exploit against firefox on ubuntu or tor browser since you would just revert to a fresh start again the next time you started your vm  gardener on june pma vpn will hide the fact that you use tor from your isp don't expect any more protection if the cops want to get you they will get you wanna be sure you won't do the time don't do the crime i completely disagree that the cops can get you if you use a good vpn the mullvad servers in sweden are some of the most hardened commercial vpn servers in the world vpns not to use include are hidemyass that comes first to mind they collect logs and say this up front in their log policy and they gave the feds logs that got a lulzsec member arrested to use well lets just talk about mullvad for a minute mullvad is run by some of the most badass computer security professionals in the entire vpn industry back when the heartbleed vulnerability was publicly disclosed in april of one of the mullvad co founders was one of the first people to set up a test openvpn server successfully steal the ssl private keys from it also patched their vpn servers as soon as the openssl patches for heartbleed were out the are headquartered in sweden and are under no obligation to any gag orders or court orders to the united states government to reveal any information about their users in fact mullvad has actually gotten user information requests before and here is how they responded taken from  what steps are taken when a valid court order requires your company to identify an active user of your service has this ever happened  we get requests from governments from time to time they never get any information about our users we make sure not to store sensitive information that can be tied to publicly available information so that we have nothing to give out we believe it is not possible in swedish law to construct a court order that would compel us to actually give out information about our users not that we would anyway we started this service for political reasons and would rather discontinue it than having it work against its purpose not only do they not keep logs but it's probably not possible under swedish law for them to be court ordered to turn over information about users and they don't keep logs or any personally identifiable information anyways your account id is literally a numeric id and that's it there isn't even any place to give an email address when you sign up and what they mean by we would rather discontinue it than having it work against its purpose is that they'd rather pull a lavabit if they were ever going to be legally forced to decrypt traffic or turn over user information lavabit was edward snowden's personal email provider they were based in the usa and a usa court ordered them to turn over their ssl private keys so that the government could decrypt ssl tls traffic to the lavabit servers and the lavabit owner decided to shut down the entire service rather than comply the mullvad sweden servers would almost certainly be the most secure ones since they are in mullvad's home country and when the mullvad writer here is referring to servers they've assembled and configured themselves and that are in data centers with ambitious physical security this would almost certainly include the sweden one  do you have physical control over your vpn servers and network or are they outsourced and hosted by a third party if so which ones where are your servers located  we have a range of servers from on one end servers lovingly assembled and configured by us with ambitious physical security in data centers owned and operated by people we trust personally and whose ideology we like on the other end rented hardware in big data centers which to use depends on the threat model and performance requirements currently we have servers hosted by glesys internet services services and leaseweb in sweden the netherlands usa and germany they are very clear about their no logging policy and say this up front can also pay them in bitcoins they even accept cash in the mail and possibly one of the best parts why mullvad is x superior to any other vpn provider for linux is because mullvad has its own client for ubuntu debian that has a kill switch built in to it so with this kill switch if your vpn connection ever drops the mullvad client stops all network traffic for dnm ops you absolutely do not want your tor traffic leaking out if your vpn ever drops and the mullvad client prevents this information leakage from happening gleeful you'll still want your vpn besides just tor browser on ubuntu so to install mullvad find the linux download on the mullvad website under the downloads page at and install it with quotesudo dpkg i mullvad all deb then install the dependencies with quotesudo apt get f installnow you can run either mullvad from the command line or easier yet find the gui icon pin it to your ubuntu taskbar and you can run it in one click from there now just installing the client gives you a hour trial period to test it with if you want to play with it first.
ssod on june amcurrently i am connecting to the darknet via tails tor bridges i feel as this is not a very safe unless i am wrong anyone have any advice on additional security measures to protect my real ip i get bulk so safety is a big concern to me let me know if my lack of faith in bridges is invalid though tails is not secure for serious dnm activities and here's the first reason why usa feds have already conducted tor attacks that have landed significant dnm figures behind bars the above article has more details about how the feds did it and who they have arrested so far a former silk road lieutenant for starters also tor bridges are practically useless for hiding from the nsa because the nsa harvests the tor bridge addresses from the emails send to from the tor project the nsa knows you're using tor anyways if you're using a tor bridge tor bridges were designed for people in repressive third world countries not us citizens hiding from the nsa it also gets worse and this is information that every dnm user serious or small should know about but since the edward snowden leaks the nsa has talked about if not bragged that they have timing attacks for de anonymizing tor users at the nsa in the washington post revealed that the nsa had figured out various ways of unmasking and penetrating the anonymity of the tor network since according to a page research paper titled simply tor the agency has worked on several methods that if successful would allow the nsa to uncloak anonymous traffic on a wide scale effectively by watching communications as they enter and exit the tor system rather than trying to follow them inside one type of attack for example would identify users by minute differences in the clock times on their computers and it still gets worse tor prioritizes fast relays and so if you consider that plausibly speaking many and possibly most of the most high speed tor relays are run by western intelligence agencies and not just grassroots tor volunteers it makes timing attacks so much easier for them from the pando com article from above quotein tor co founder roger dingledine revealed that the tor network is configured to prioritize speed and route traffic through through the fastest servers nodes available as a result the vast bulk of tor traffic runs through several dozen of the fastest and most dependable servers on today's network clients choose one of the fastest exit relays around of the time and of their choices come from a pool of relays this information above has already been public since the edward snowden leaks so now everyone reading this has no excuse not to get off tails and learn ubuntu or your other favorite flavor of linux and start using a reputable vpn impeccable track record of standing up against government requests keeps no logs and you can pay them in bitcoins you can start on this now or end up like the silk road lieutenant who got arrested because his tor connection got de anonymized by the government to what was probably his home ip address and if you're a serious dnm user you don't do business hours a day online from a public wifi spot this is not an acceptable solution for power users bonus points if you use a pre paid g hotspot with your non tails flavor of linux a reputable vpn where your face was never on camera buying the hotspot think fake wig cell phone at home and paid in cash.
humblebumble on september pmalthough if you log into a public wifi your mac address would be recorded on that network so maybe the best case scenario would be to utilize the unprotected browser in tails check the package as much as you want imo even if they had my ip address and mac address attached to a package that ended up having drugs i'm still not testifying againesy myself so that's gonna be a hard one to prove in court you could be expecting a package from bon macy's victoria secret or porn from germany and the sender could've sent you bullshit nothing or even drugs the part where people get fucked is when they open and have drugs at the same location that the package was sent to even physical address attached to po box if you're super paraniod and you check the package at free wifi locations than they see that someone was still expecting a package and someone knew that package was on it's way the safest bet is to check the tracking at the sending location there's still room for denial with that.
set up some bridges if you can done correctly they can hlep hiding your useage from isp dpis are stilla worry though for some tor document have some good info in it but i find it can get a little nerdy for me to decypher that's me thoug.

nope not phished my account was working fine and was fulfilling orders today an escrow got released so i went to withdraw and my correct pin would not work account got froze so complained about it to admin then i took to reddit to complain min after reddit complaints my password no longer worked no phishing links or password disclosure.
gleeful on june pmquote from vitaminlsd on june amtails is not secure for serious dnm activities and here's the first reason why usa feds have already conducted tor attacks that have landed significant dnm figures behind bars the above article has more details about how the feds did it and who they have arrested so far a former silk road lieutenant for starters also tor bridges are practically useless for hiding from the nsa because the nsa harvests the tor bridge addresses from the emails send to from the tor project the nsa knows you're using tor anyways if you're using a tor bridge tor bridges were designed for people in repressive third world countries not us citizens hiding from the nsa it also gets worse and this is information that every dnm user serious or small should know about but since the edward snowden leaks the nsa has talked about if not bragged that they have timing attacks for de anonymizing tor users what does this breach have to do with tails isn't it just a live version of linux is it because it's not designed to be used with a vpn and that vpns are the safest way to access tor i'm not disputing what you're saying i just don't understand it thanks basically yea you want to always use a vpn before tor and tails doesn't have built in vpn support so unless you're using a vpn router like how cosmic consciousness explained then if your tor connection ever gets de anonymized they would see your home ip or wherever you're connected from and that by itself has been enough to land some unlucky people in jail and prison like the silk road lieutenant from that article the nsa even brags about how it can de anonymize tor users so not using a vpn first is like going out and having sex with women a night without a condom and hoping you don't get an std after a year one of the worst ways you can be de anonymized is like this tor basically uses three hops to send your data to the final destination node the first node or the guard node node the middle node node the exit node so if you log in to reddit com through tor using the same username you buy with on the markets with your connection without a vpn would look like your home ip tor node tor node tor node redditbut if you got unlucky and the government runs all three of those tor nodes and your tor prioritizes the fastest tor nodes tor node would know your home ip but not the contents of your connection tor node would also know that it's sending data on to tor node tor node knows that it received a connection from tor node although it doesn't know what the contents are tor node also knows that its sending data to tor node tor node finally sends your data to reddit tor node can always see your data in plaintext for any website not just reddit unless that connection to the website used even if your web traffic to reddit is all sent over encrypted to the reddit server tor node knows that this is one of the reddit servers for instance because in the connection during the ssl tls handshake the reddit server openly says says before everything gets encrypted that this server belongs to reddit if reddit has been put under some type of government gag order to give all ip addresses login times to the feds the feds would know you logged in through tor but if the feds are doing de anonymization attacks right now if tor node was one of their own they could see this connection to reddit and tor node knows it received a connection from tor node and tor node knows it made a connection to tor node likewise if we roll this back one more time tor node knows that it received a connection from tor node and tor node knows that it made a connection to tor node at a very specific point in time down to the second then finally tor node knows this connection came from your home ip address this is how the feds can de anonymize you if they control your entire tor circuit your tor node but the nsa even brags that it can de anonymize people just based off when you made your tor connection combined with when the request came out of the tor exit node so it's possibly they don't even need to control your entire tor circuit for that connection just run one of the tor node 's and use their nsa mass surveillance visibility to know when a connection came out of one of the tor nodes plus they can combine this roughly with the size of the encrypted data being sent back to you to narrow down how large the page you viewed was which can help them pinpoint you even closer with this second method i think the second one is sloppier but the nsa was caught bragging from information in the edward snowden leaks that this method still works ubuntu is really easy to learn i highly recommend it as an alternative to tails if you've only ever relied on tails before mullvad the vpn provider even has a linux client for their vpn you basically just click a button and it connects they're probably the best commercial vpn provider in my book you can pay them in bitcoins the only personally identifiable information with them is a numeric account id they keep no logs and they have repeatedly told off governments when they asked for information about users and they know the people who run their sweden data center and they used their own hardware for the nodes there so the usa government can't just show up there with a gag order and take one of their vpn server's hard drives with their ssl private keys on it like they could possibly to vpn servers here in america regardless of what company runs the vpn server ubuntu has all the bells and whistles that tails has and there is an enormous amount of documentation available for you you can find the answer to just about any problem in ubuntu by search engine ing xyz ubuntu you can also give it a full disk encryption password during your ubuntu install.
gardener on june pmmaybe some vpn providers can be trusted but it's hard to tell before there is an actual problem their claims are mostly marketing in my opinion the market is competitive who would be stupid enough to admit logging and who would go to jail to protect a month user i mean mullvad already has a history of denying government requests and the usa doesn't have any jurisdiction to jail a swedish vpn provider and for contrast a lot of vpn providers do admit up front to logging like hidemyass mullvad's co founder was the first person that we publicly know of to successfully exploit the heartbleed vulnerability against openvpn this is one thing they have standing out for them above all other vpn providers why they're worthy of your business they take cash in the mail too that's how you know they're serious about protecting their users' privacy  gardener on june pmi don't know swedish law their claims can be true but they could be greedy entrepreneurs logging as much as they can to be on the safe side or even a honeypot sadly we have no way to tell i sincerely believe mullvad isn't logging anything when a vpn provider throws somebody under the bus like hidemyass did with that lulzsec member everybody hears about it there has not been one story ever of mullvad giving up any information about even a single user likewise with hidemyass this was their excuse for their actions  our vpn service and vpn services in general are not designed to be used to commit illegal activity it is very naive to think that by paying a subscription fee to a vpn service you are free to break the law without any consequences since mullvad is a vpn provider and based in sweden they're not even legally obligated to keep logs under the eu data retention directive because in sweden this doesn't apply to vpn providers ianal but they can't even be legally forced to keep logs on users and i've seen no indication that they are their entire reputation and business depends on it if a lavabit style situation ever happened mullvad has already stated they would rather discontinue their business if they were somehow forced to give up information on any user  gardener on june pmmullvad software seems to only create firewall rules to block anything that's not going through vpn network interface setting up iptables to do this would work as good if you can figure out how to do this in iptables yourself please share this since this would be a big benefit to the community this iptables configuration is on my bucket list to get working not for mullvad's sake but for the sake of other vpns i use but i haven't started working on these iptables rules yet  gardener on june pmrestoring an image is nice but if the host is compromised your image can be compromised too a skilled attacker could escape the vm a dvd can't be compromised by a distant attacker the bios could be but it's harder and probably not worth it to catch a small time buyer if the host is ever compromised your entire box including your vms are compromised too then so don't let your host get compromised with a tails setup your main threat model is not a compromised dvd but a zero day exploit against tor browser on tails you have no extra layers of security compared to doing everything in vms if a zero day exploit compromises your tor browser on tails your entire os including your pgp private keys your pgp private key passwords your decrypted keepass entries after you unlock your keepass all of this is theoretically accessible to the attacker now and if the government is doing some sneaky shit going after tails users to get after say serious people in the drug trade then these above things would be the keys to the castle that the feds would target on a tails system with this vm setup i described all you would pretty much ever do with your host os at that point is install ubuntu security updates and that's it and you should do it over a vpn that has cover traffic over it too so the government can't profile you that you run ubuntu on one or more systems from your house or what packages you keep updated the ubuntu packages you install from apt are signed too so if your initial ubuntu iso you installed was a legitimate one the signed packages you're downloading from ubuntu should be legitimate as well for an attacker to compromise your host os through the vm you're basically talking about a zero day exploit against either tor browser or firefox if you use noscript correctly plus a privilege escalation exploit against your virtual machine software to get the bad guy to root this is basically just not going to happen but running everything in a vm like this gives you another huge layer of security because they'd need the privilege escalation exploit and then also the vm breakout exploit and if they didn't know you do everything from vms then the chances of an attacker having this type of vm breakout exploit against a patched ubuntu vm and up to date virtual machine software is practically non existent we're talking about possibly hundreds of hours of exploit development work if there's even a vm breakout exploit that is possible when the vm is a patched ubuntu install hell you can even run tails in a vm as your main way of using tor browser and a vpn from your host os now you've solved the tor de anonymization problem and you have insulated yourself against zero day exploits from the government but i don't even recommend running tails as your main vm os for tor browsing and here's a few reasons why when i tried using the built in tor browser feature to update tor browser in tails at least in a tails vm i had i don't know if this is different in tails the newest now tor browser complained that it does not have the system permissions required to install it this can be remedied by installing the newest tor browser manually but this is kind of defeating the purpose of why you'd want to use tails in the first place so basically the next time there's a tor browser update that has any security patches in it your tor browser on tails has known in it and i don't think anybody bothers in tails to check if their tor browser is up to date every time they boot up tails whereas with tor browser on ubuntu there's a simple on click button to upgrade the entire tor browser install and tor browser at least on ubuntu checks every time on startup if there's a new tor browser version also tails only runs normal tor browser and not tor browser hardened the latter of which has been hardened more against exploits qubes os praised by edward snowden and other esteemed computer security professional is actually built around the concept of everything being done in vms but using qubes proficiently is out of reach for most dnm users but basically if you don't use vms but still use a vpn on your host os or an alternative like a prepaid cash only g hotspot or the vpn router setup cosmic consciousness described you have protected yourself against the tor de anonymization problem that was the original issue in this thread then even without vms if you have good internet hygiene and don't run untrusted downloads and don't allow javascript from all websites when clearnet browsing using noscript with firefox you're a pretty damn difficult target at this point just linux with a good host vpn and good opsec hygiene would be good enough for most dnm users who need to be concerned about getting de anonymized but if you want to take things a step further and decide to do everything in vms and you do it right you've now made compromising your host os and your most valuable data pgp private keys and passwords in keepass near impossible  gardener on june pmphysical isolation is said to be better than software isolation more complicated and costly to set up but should be solid even more so if each system lives in ram and starts from a read only media physical isolation is a good idea it's just that tails isn't good enough in my book what if you are targeted with a zero day exploit against your tor browser in tails you could have been using tor browser from a hardened vm but now instead your entire tails os and this could include all your keystrokes your pgp private keys your keepass entries after you've decrypted them all of this could be compromised tails just can't provide vms  gardener on june pmfor most users tails or tbb on linux with a strong firewall is probably enough don't you think so if the government knowing their dnm username the day they de anonymize a tor connection of theirs and find that it's coming from their home ip address isn't a concern to them then tails is good enough but if you're making repeat purchases or posting on darkweb forums with that same username or posting about things that would get you arrested then a vpn is absolutely a necessity unless you want to leave yourself open to ending up like that silk road lieutenant bonus points if you do everything serious from vms but for now just having a vpn would keep you from getting de anonymized to your home ip unless you're using a prepaid g hotspot and have good internet hygiene like using this g hotspot for only dnm activities and don't ever log in to your facebook from it or you're using a vpn router setup like what cosmic consciousness described  gardener on june pmif you want to be extra safe use an air gaped machine to encrypt your stuff and keep your private key at worse if your tor box is compromised there won't be keys or unencrypted messages on it this is super paranoid in a good way i think if you need this level of security go for it but this wouldn't protect you from having your tor connection de anonymized to your home ip still the thing is that if your tor connection ever gets de anonymized to your home ip address and they do decide to raid you or do physical surveillance on you and then raid you or the places you do business at you wouldn't be expecting any of this to be coming the feds would tear through every single flash drive hard drive and unencrypted piece of data that you own to try and pin this on you that you actually are username xyz online plus if you have any drugs in your house or they physically follow you to say your trap house this would almost certainly spell doom for you it is better just to use a vpn to begin with and sleep much more soundly at night because you use a reputable vpn provider with a server in a good country mullvad is month when you pay them in bitcoins there's no reason not to be using them unless getting de anonymized isn't a concern and it should be for all of us who make serious repeat purchases from the same username  gardener on june pmtails is nice because you don't need to read a lot of documentation to get started it works out of the box and it is supposed to be secure if you trust those who created the iso if you wanted to fight against anonymity and be willing to add a back door somewhere wouldn't a distribution aiming at providing anonymity be on top of the list i trust tails they're in it for the right reasons but you just can't run vms in it and it's not vpn friendly.
yeah like june s.
that's why a setup that leaves as little forensic evidence as possible is needed tails on a dvd is an option to consider you keep your computer clean add your private key to en encrypted usb partition that you can wipe easily in case you feel like it without having to wipe your hdd good luck and consider that a truster vendor could get caught and keep vending being le this did happen with fake ids this could and probably did also happen with drugs you don't seem like an high profile target though have a clean house and sleep well.
went with zalas approach except deposited cash in a bank via a machine so no face to face with bank person and no leaking of id to buyer only thing is banks cameras only problem there i can think of is if buyer is le and wants to know who i am they could use the time stamp on the recpiet i had to take a screnshot of and go to the cameras of that bank around that time however that's a lot of hassle and they would have to try id me by face only put up posters.
i am not sure if it is clever to use tor for your coinbase account i assume you want to buy bitcoin via a bank transfer in that case your real identity will be linked to your coinbase account anyway so no reason to use tor buy the coins using your clearnet browser then transfer them to a wallet not linkable to you you create and access this wallet only through tor and from there to the market vendor you want to buy from you can also configure tor browser to pick exit nodes from a specific country see good way to anonymously get bitcoin besides coinbase is localbitcoins com it allows you to buy bitcoins in person or via cash deposit or bank transfer directly from other people.
yup these instructions work great.
pinto on september pmweird i was just thinking how fast it was running for me yu.

hi any gpg usb users in here i have an issue with decrypting a tmg members pgp message to me i copy and past the encrypted message in the textedit field i then click the decrypt icon and i get the following error message decryption failedno secret keyno private key with id faa present in keyring what am i doing wrong please thank yo.
if anything this is more proof that hos or whoever is a major target of law enforcement and that we really shouldn t be talking about this business on the clearnet anywhere than any notion that the whole sub is just a honeypot i think the arrogant sense that people on the sub have that their crimes aren t worthy of targeting from law enforcement these are people who live to make drug arrests i also think it s a bit alarmist to assert that it exists only for this purpose and that no worthwhile discussion takes place thereon and it s not insignificant seemingly to me that hos didn t have any overt problems with reddit when the reviews were adulatory and the attitude changed when they started to turn critical.
xtronlasd on june pmwhich ones would you recomend and is agora a safe to use marketplace pgp everything and use only vendors with high ratings revie.
this is a forum but you can also use it to directly contact vendors they post their offers in the active vendors section you ll also find reviews here so you can decide which vendor is trustworthy and reliable but there s no escrow which means you ll have to pay upfront it also means the admins can t steal your money as they aren t in any way involved with the orders.
yes i m using tails thanks rebirth i believe the bridges from torproject have worked although i m confused why my other ones did not they seem to work fine for the trusted person that gave them to me.
nucleus or me.
i believe they are simply deleted permanently once you delete them.

hi i have only used pgp key s before at dnm s but now i m all in for direct deals with trusted vendors when i look around in here i m a little confused how do i contact a vendor it seems like i have no permission to do so i searc a vendor when i press the vendors profilename it says you are not allowed to access this section why i also have a pgp key but im not sure how i share this as i can see other people are doing in their profile is there a place to upload a public pgp key as i can see others having links for in their profile i m all new in forum based markets so maybe i have just overseen something thanks for the help best regards.
i use that its annoymous and works great.
but i wanna order now.
i understand that electrum is the best way to go but if someone ever needed an online wallet which one would be the one to use also should you use it on tor because i heard somewhere that btc over tor somehow deanonomizes you also do you need to use a mixer if you re sending it to a unique btc address you re given when doing a direct wallet to wallet transaction with a vendor i don t really like using mixers but i will if it s critical to opse.
you know what they say about never trusting a carder.
summa iru on april pmthe godself print i think only albertheijn has these tabs he was on evo but now that s gone he has a thread here but in the inactive vendors section link below is also on agora it s the godself tabs you re talking about it s nice to hear they re strong i only have a few myself and yet to try them what would you guess half is g were the oevs strong if you could report on them in the thread linked below i m sure all those involved would appreciate it for the detailed response summa i think it was the godself ones i could probably rate half easily at ug could it be more i bought them locally in my country but now nobody has them was just sold as alex greys not godself so jealous if that s the same batch you guys have in your hands thanks for all the links sorry for the silly question but whenever i copy a link into a new tab from this forum my browser or any other browser for that matter refuses to open the link any idea what that could be the only way i can browse something on this site if i click there manually so strang.
brilliant thanks for that.
wish hansa would get the amount of users it deserves.
doses lysergic on january amlol speak english its not insignificant it is not not significant when you use a double negative you obscure your meaning ianae the post by dxuutx undoubtedly contains florid prose perhaps excessively and i appreciate your plea for simple english on internet forums it is usually more effective to have style enhance an argument rather than have the argument be a frame for displaying one s style however the use of the double negative in it s not insignificant is valid here before going further let s first correct the misquote so that the phrase regains its original meaning taken out of context as above the phrase implies the possessive sense of its eg people admired its not insignificant beauty whereas the original was it s an abbreviation of the verb it is yes i know at worst this is a common mistake and at best acceptable textspeak and generally is too small to be worth picking up on but your opening point is that dxuutx should speak english therefore introducing a grammatical error into your first  dxuutx s post unfairly helps your claim as to the phrase itself the double negative is an example of a figure of speech called litotes or more generally meiosis where something is deliberately played down or understated in order to increase its importance litotes is common in many languages both ancient and modern in europe it has a fine pedigree being found in homer s iliad ovld s metamorphoses and the epic poem beowulf logically it may be true that it s not insignificant has the same meaning as it s significant but litotes remains an acceptable way of emphasising a statement even to fowler who would certainly be sympathetic towards your desire for greater clarity a dictionary of modern english usage hw fowler various editions just saying.
this looks very suspicious perhaps law enforcement are now running the business in order to catch users.
darknetdreamer on november amsound interesting would love to write a full review once the sites up sounds excellent it s making good progress i ll post again with my milestone estimations for delivery i ll be sure also to register you an account due to the nature of this market wishing to be secure and being based on vendor only inviting i may have to ask around about you just to make sure you have indeed ordered and used product before if a vendor can vouge for you i ll provide you with a valid one time registration link upon release.
agora is the bulk of my new customers but after an order or two most people are moving to direct deals i m probably at agora and direct deals it has an ebb and flow to it galindo.
does this market exist still cheers dolmi.
fuck the centralized markets man trusted vendor boutique sites and email forum direct trades is the onlyway to go with any kind of assurance that your coin or identity is not being compromised for all we know every market is run by leo or their informants.
thank you we have lots of funds tied in escrow right now an exit scam would devastate not only our business but a small chunk of our lives for awhilecheers s.
knuckles on august pmquote from sillywabbit on august pmfuck the centralized markets man trusted vendor boutique sites and email forum direct trades is the onlyway to go with any kind of assurance that your coin or identity is not being compromised for all we know every market is run by leo or their informants i was just coming in here to say this i have no problem sending money upfront to trust worthy vendors hopefully direct transactions like that are both a security benefit to sellers and buyers i prefer forums like tmg to deal with vendors i like it too but i also like dealing with active marketplaces where it s easier for buyer to find me that being said i m on abraxas and link.
anyway you have to act as if they were stored forever as who knows what the admin of the server might do and or if it runs on a virtual machine that the fbi is really interested in always assume the worst case scenario so that you stay safe stay saf.
helloi need some help about getting btc unkown and laundry it and send it to different adresses how do i start get the btc from example localbitcoins send it to helix bitblender then to another mixer and then to some ewallet example bitgo store it there then to another mixer and from there to the market or directly to a vendor any guidence or help is helpfull im new to this.
personally i ll be using abraxas i ve used it in the past as a backup and they ve been extremely reliable not the most active but it s worth considering due to the fact it will be picking up activity wise when people go looking for alternatives what i have most vendors switch to so far is abraxas and or middle earth.
i opened an account there the day before and made an order from you mr pickles yesterday batches of lsd i agree with what s been said about the dhl no bullshit vendors all seems pretty reputable and more importantely as very passionate about the quality of their products very secureeasy transactions the only downside which i think will pick up slowly is a lack of variety i couldn t find any dmt so i have to look for it somewhere else and i don t like having too many accounts around i hope dhl starts getting more reputable vendors i look forward to it being my stop shop s.
is one of the most promising markets atm i think they are currently open for free registration it focuses on quality rather than quantity nice community and forum no porn accounts no fakery no bullshit awesome user interface both for vendors and buyers super easy to create listings direct wallet to wallet payment i have a few more invites left and i am happy to send them to the gardeners avengers note that i have no assoaciation with it but i am just hoping it gets busier much love lightpickles.
dhl looks promising but its to exclusive to be the next bit market i would think dream will pick up a bunch of the users from abraxas due to its easy interface and long standing reputation.
the article the haarlem court today extended the remand of three men on trial for large scale drug trafficking through illegal online marketplaces and money laundering one of the men years until his arrest in december probably one of the greatest dutch sellers vendors of narcotics at international underground market places he was known as holland online on several anonymous marketplaces such as silk road silk road and agora in his home in amsterdam following his arrest over a kilo of mdma more than kilos of ecstasy pills and more than euros in cash and bitcoins seized the trader was arrested following a drug transaction in which a policeman was accidental witness in his car were also found ecstasy pills mdma and lsd sheets maina man of years from utrecht was among others active in the underground marketplace evolution where he was known by more than successful transactions as one of the biggest drug vendors of this market in his house were confiscated expensive goods cash and bitcoins he used the account albert heijn the third suspect a man of years acted as a supplier to various vendors and approached this through the market place under the account amsterdam united the three defendants were possible only a few years in the drug trade through online marketplaces but played it ready to build a good reputation in a short time and so much income in bitcoins more than one million sales in euros generating international cooperationnot only the dutch police did criminal investigation into this new form of drug trafficking two weeks ago was convicted in the united states the accused ross ulbricht to manage the online marketplace silk road and sentenced to life imprisonment the united states is also a dutch man who was known on silk road as super trips sentenced to imprisonment for years the dutch police and justice work closely with law enforcement agencies in other countries eurojust and europol to identify online vendors operating in the hidden market place the studies are part of this international cooperation to combat illegal trade on the internet hidden darkweb and the action onymous where hundreds of underground market places off the air are met the next hearing in the trial on september st.
bonobo on january amon multisig haha xd it seems a bit complicated to me as well though but i want to be free from sending coins on market excrow mind you i dont order often just once in a while but that tends to be a medium large sized orderwhy not just order direct then.
liquidergot on november pmor maybe have it as a different priced option ex mg xtal direct trade mg xtal multisig this would at least give people the option but keeping the direct trade price considerably lower most will choose the cheaper option especially with trusted vendors it may seem like a huge price difference but it s also a lot of work the vendors need to get paid for multisign escrow prices.
whoever placed that order with me today please dispute it it went out today and you should get it in a couple days but dispute the fuck out of it as if i didn t send it because they just deleted my account and are stealing all my money dispute it saying i scammed you or something i don t want those motherfuckers to get that money that i earned.
did you find out which ios app is a pg.
hmm okey dokeythank.
tails is best as far as entry level darknet computing goes a nice package with everything you need for dark net dealings except for bitmessage wrapped up in it i really think most people ordering only personal amounts have little to nothing to worry about on the computer security side of things as far as we know the nsa can only unmask a small portion of tor traffic and cannot target specific people to unmask besides when s the last time you heard about an investigation into a drug user maybe if someone call in a tip to an overly bored and vengeful police department in a small town but most police departments just have bigger crimes that take up all of their time oh and can t forget time for writing traffic ticket weather you re on talis or not though if you ve ever looked up info about cybersecurity tor tails darknet anything and the like from a computer that can be linked to you you re probably on a permanant watchlist shrugs shoulders whaddyagonnado check out this article for more info on tor it will scare you and comfort you all at the same time.
yeah i got tails up and running only thing that sucks is that there are a ton of sites you can t use due to javascriptetc it would be nice to run torthen a vpn or proxies seems like cloudflare blocks tor as well.
sillywabbit on february pmvery likely although from the rise of other markets the fact that evo and agora are still up and the further development of p p networks like bitmessage doubt they can do much to stop it deter yes but those who are top notch in their opsec and know how to make robust websites the only shot they have is to get in on the inside like they did agree the cats already out of the bag and le knows it and that s percisely the reason why le turns to scare tactics because they know they can t do anything about it legally at least but more and more bills keep being brought up that would allow le and the nsa to infringe on our rights even more and this also needs to be addressed and stopped.
gpg can work with keys higher then and most gui gpg tools only allow you to select bit encryption keys there are many other ways to make a bit key bit you can do a lot better then that i could upload binaries that have the code edits done but that would be a really stupid thing for anyone to do download encryption software from a dark net admin so you will need to edit compile the software linux or os x users only download the latest version of gpg ftp ftp gnupg org gcrypt gnupg gnupg tar bz untar the archive and edit g keygen cfind everywhere where it says and change it to navigate to the main folder and sart building the code into the program code select autogen sh configurelook for errors you will probably need to install libraries through you package manager apt get or yum for os x you are stuck with brew i know with the version of ubuntu i am running i had to downgrade some packages to install libssl dev after you install all missing libraries rerun config and make sure you have it all before you make code select make installnow you can run the command to generate a new key in the terminal code select gpg gen keyselect rsa and rsa and you will see that the is now bit as the highest allowed to make if you would like to take it a bit further anther member pointed out to me that if you edit g gpg cchange if gcry control gcryctl init secmem to if gcry control gcryctl init secmem or higher if your system has the ram available this will speed up key generation and allow you to make a greater then bit key without running into memory errors resulting into core dumps my current key is a bit ke.
there are many reports of helix not releasing the coins wonder whats up there and sigaint has been having network issues lately.
idk but it seems kinda covert like using burner phones and dead drops.
thanks mirrormirrorit s even more safe from usb without vm for the backdoor issuewhen used in windowstill not clear why many people use vm must be usefull maybe when using with linux good example the elicopter so like i thought only sees i browse tor and there are many reason people can use it not just for illegality if not wrong i read on the forum about tor exit nod are compromised really don t know much of iti immagine they can see tor ip or maybe they see all and decrypt everything you dogood day for everybod.
all vpns and proxys will do is hide the fact from your service provider that you use tor if you aren t concerned about anyone finding out you use tor then you ll be fin.
bananai ve never heard of this but i ll look into it my plate is full for now with a lot of projects so this is something that i may never get to work on especially with the availability of easier and proven alternative routes.
helloi opened an account at dream market with an eye to open store in there any users care to share the love for this market pickles.

unit on may pmu i couldn t agree more i ve already swore to myself i m sticking to micro transactions from now on i d rather have btc on the line than what i had put myself into and exactly i ve never felt comfortable with sharing that i even use the market with anybody but close close close friends when they would like help with using it or want me to over see a transaction for them i let them know i risk my money when i use these marketplaces so when you want to use them you re risking your money too basically saying i ll do my best to make sure they get a clean transaction but if it goes to hell in a hand basket which i ve seen happen very easily it s not up to me to fix or compensate anything for them unit i also use markets for mostly btc deals its less of a worry and below a certain amount is imo much less dangerous than a larger amount some may say that it requires more orders to get the same amount but i d rather get caught with a oz decriminalized amounts in some places of bud than a whole zip or qp not that it matters if the feds get you but if you get pulled over with it then unless you live in the deep south just a ticket the same is true for rl i used to have this strategy when buying weed i d go to my dealer and if i was getting a half or a zip i would never tell them first i d check it out and if the weed was sub par i d just get a dub or a slice there are exceptions like if i wanted some primo bud from a vendor like cultmadeline who only sells oz s but their bud is fire and they are trusted even then i d rather direct deal one thing about direct deals though i would place a very basic order one item and maybe a small cheap second but you don t need to make it confusing or overly complicated final note there are some things that make sense to buy in bulk the one thing i don t is with mdma i don t have many friends who do it although getting rid of it is easy the reason i don t is that i know that for myself i will do higher doses and more often if i bought a whole g if i had friends who would buy it i could sell it very fast for a nice profit most of my friends don t even know if the molly they got of some uni student was real mdma and are averse to pills never had good ones or think they are cut thanks to pop culture its crazy smart people too that is what is so liberating about dnms you don t have to take what everyone else in your area or circle of friends does it cuts through ignorance like a machete love and lightacid.
quotewhat s the advantages of buying direct off a vendors site verses buying direct off a vendor through email well nothing too much i think a vendor operated site or market share the same negative consequences of possibly storing and not protecting your information as well as it should however after doing some email deals i must say that the process of ordering direct can be more cumbersome time consuming where it is more streamlined in a market type setting with a cart checkout function.
russia don t give a fuck as long as the right pockets are getting lined.

hii am kinda new to the deep web and i am abit scared to buy on here so to minimise the risks i thought i could ask the more experienced people in other words you guys i found a site which looks promising torsupermarket i trust this site and if not can you recomend any other places where i can buy cheap electronics thank.
i would not recommend currently using agora i have always loved the site but a lot of peoples deposits are not showing up lately my deposit has not showed for days with no reply from support i would recommend using alphabay or maybe abraxas till agora gets there shit figured out.

just a heads up ive deposited coins to my account days ago and despite seeing them enter my account via blockchain i have never received my coins i ve messaged support multiples times but they have never responded im not the only one with this problem either if you check the agora reddit pages or the bugs section there are plenty of posts about the same thing i have always loved and supported agora and would love to continue to do so but so far no one has heard back from support regarding this issue just be careful with your coins atm i recommend sticking to abraxas or alphabay until the situation is resolvedi will update this post immediately if i receive my coins or hear back from support.
just stopping by to rant may should have found the ranting thread but anyways electrum has not connected in like days wtf i need some moneyanyone have advice cheers rhet.
the most stable and most used sites currently are abraxas and alphabay however there are plenty of other markets operating as of now this is a list of all the markets i could find if you do not see one listed please post below so i can add itabraxas invite referral link required to join uptime market link invite referral link required to join uptime market link uptime crypto market uptime dream market referral link required to join uptime market link india company uptime french dark net uptime gotmilk pharmacy uptime hansa referral link required to join uptime market link plugs uptime idc uptime london underground uptime middle earth marketplace uptime nucleus market uptime outlaw market uptime ramp uptime rutor uptime silkkitien uptime the hub uptime the majestic garden uptime tochka uptime torepublic market uptime.
great idea i m under the impression that if i have coins totally unlinked to me and i use a blockchain wallet only ever logging on through tor then i am quite safe to send the coins to the vendor but for people who may have trouble getting coins that are totally unlinked to them maybe some information about different tumbling options advantages disadvantages current status reputation etc would be helpful.
yea i just saw an article on deepdotweb earlier about this who incident i m glad that justice is finally being served i never used sheep marketplace but it pains me that so many people lost money hopefully the heavy hand of justice will fall upon kimble and verto no.
thanks just alil stressed ou.
hii m looking for a marketplace where industrial mahinery and operation manuals are offered does anyone have a suggestion on where to look.
just found out my login isnt working i used it just yesterday and everything was ok when i logged out but i m trying now with the same password and im not able to get in no freaking way anyone could have guessed because its a letter generated pw good thing is that i had only chump change over there so haven t lost anythingi was going to order g mdma now which is the next best market seen for outlaw but it looks awful really it makes agora look like a designing marvel im a sucker for gui no way im using thatdhl has a bunch of known vendors is it a good place to order from nucleus had some problems recently so i m not sure if i should go there looking for any inputs.
just an fyi who knows what else was taken.

dream is the nicest market in terms of infrastructure and such imo just a pleasant experience overall.
it s not even possible to log in atm because there is no captcha what s that all about.
how would you like to use it for storage for sending.
dont fool yourselves into thinking that by using tails and washing bitcoins and masking online status and using different passwords that you wont get caught i have had personal experience where a vendor sent me xanax pills in the mail without any stealth just threw a bunch of pills in an envelope and sent them and since then all my mail was being checked without my knowledge except first class mail i believe either way when my order for tabs of lsd was ordered thats when the authorities arrested me and guess what they have everything that was done click by click order by order all my passwords all my orders and history of things i bought i went to jail for this and was let out early for good behavior but as someone once told me dont do the crime if you cant do the time pink floyd shee.
greenbuddy on may pmquote from unit on may pmu i couldn t agree more i ve already swore to myself i m sticking to micro transactions from now on i d rather have btc on the line than what i had put myself into and exactly i ve never felt comfortable with sharing that i even use the market with anybody but close close close friends when they would like help with using it or want me to over see a transaction for them i let them know i risk my money when i use these marketplaces so when you want to use them you re risking your money too basically saying i ll do my best to make sure they get a clean transaction but if it goes to hell in a hand basket which i ve seen happen very easily it s not up to me to fix or compensate anything for them unit i also use markets for mostly btc deals its less of a worry and below a certain amount is imo much less dangerous than a larger amount some may say that it requires more orders to get the same amount but i d rather get caught with a oz decriminalized amounts in some places of bud than a whole zip or qp not that it matters if the feds get you but if you get pulled over with it then unless you live in the deep south just a ticket the same is true for rl i used to have this strategy when buying weed i d go to my dealer and if i was getting a half or a zip i would never tell them first i d check it out and if the weed was sub par i d just get a dub or a slice there are exceptions like if i wanted some primo bud from a vendor like cultmadeline who only sells oz s but their bud is fire and they are trusted even then i d rather direct deal one thing about direct deals though i would place a very basic order one item and maybe a small cheap second but you don t need to make it confusing or overly complicated final note there are some things that make sense to buy in bulk the one thing i don t is with mdma i don t have many friends who do it although getting rid of it is easy the reason i don t is that i know that for myself i will do higher doses and more often if i bought a whole g if i had friends who would buy it i could sell it very fast for a nice profit most of my friends don t even know if the molly they got of some uni student was real mdma and are averse to pills never had good ones or think they are cut thanks to pop culture its crazy smart people too that is what is so liberating about dnms you don t have to take what everyone else in your area or circle of friends does it cuts through ignorance like a machete love and lightacid ever sense i found out how to use the dnm i don t allow my friends to get something somewhere other than me unless it s tested it s sad but a very true statement i trust dnm vendors more than drug dealers in real life with reviews honest in most aspects i can see if a vendor is notably good before i buy from them instead of being forced into whatever is in town at the time and my knowledge on these substances has multiplied in the last years sense sr and dpr i dont believe stupid stereotypical hippy mumbo jumbo either such as can t cut lsd with water from the store or brown molly is mda and white molly is mdma with dnm i ve skipped passed the typical salesman and have jumped right to other entrepeneurs that share in like interest and care to look into the science rather than what most people i know do follow the guy that s eaten acid the longest nonono i m too analytical to just go off of hear say i want to know from a person that s dealing with portions that if their stuff was bad they wouldnt move it because i d order grams make a bad review greenbuddy might order grams and write a bad review than when someone else comes to maybe buy grams they see two bad reviews and a vendor trying to sell them shit again i trust dnm vendors more than i do rl vendors.
thanks for taking the plunge jean luc glad to know it s fast and works as expecte.
you can use veracrypt or truecrypt to encrypt a volume i know it works in linux but am not too sure if it works in windows i make volumes within the drive one hidden and one not so if you are made to give the password you can give the non hidden volume password and protect teh hidden volume hope this helps.
this might sound pretty basic to some but if it can help just one user it will have been worth writing please feel free to add your own ideas on the topic never use a user name password that you have ever used on the clearnet never use the same user name password on more than one site always try to write in a neutral language change identities from time to time and change your writing patterns at the same time if you change your identity don t disappear from the old one and appear with the new one but let both personae stay alive at the same time or take some deserved rest from the network if you change your setup it can be the right time to change your online identity avoid using windows for your darknet browsing it is insecure you can either create your own custom linux distribution with security in mind full disk encryption firewall to block non tor traffic hardened kernel tor process browser isolation if you feel like it or use whonix or tails if you decide to trust those who made these systems tails is good because it will leave no tracks on your computer whonix is good because it provides some kind of isolation remove your hard drive when using tails if you can if you use an hard drive blank if from time to time and start fresh again learn encryption gnupg is a great tool create your own or more key and use it as much as you can if you are a vendor a journalist in an oppressive country or a paranoid mind traveler you might want to work with encrypted material on another machine that stays offline that way the computer connected on the internet would only be used for encrypted material making it harder for an attacker to know the content of your encrypted documents in case your computer got compromised or had a backdoor try to leave as little tracks of your activity as possible on the machine s you use use an open wifi if you can to make it harder to get to you if tor was broken or you made an mistake in your opsec remember that using tor might get you flagged as suspicious individual even in democratic first world countries have fun be kind to others and remember if you re not ready to do the time don t do the crime stay saf.

nordicwhite on november amcan anyone recommend a good burner laptop for darknetmarket shopping vending use mostly large shopping i plan to use tails on usb or dvd asus c inch chromebook arm tails not available for arm yetused or refurbished thinkpad x used or refurbished thinkpad t all three should be under and support free and open source firmware bios through thinkpads can be easily repaired with cheap replacement parts as they are popular enterprise laptops it s easy to find refurbished ones in good condition.
i tried to do the link abraxas profile and it states user not listed is there another way that i can verify to start vending or would i need to pay the thanks in advance.

retaining a lawyer how to handle getting caught or entry into the series on security is how to handle getting caught let us face it we are all human and we make mistakes unfortunately you only need to make one mistake and the law enforcement commonly referred to as le on these forums can bust you maybe they will wait for you to do something more serious before they nab you but if you slip up and they feel you are worth going after you can expect them to get you no matter where you live with rare exception the first thing i want to do is link you to another thread i just came across on these forums main question is should i keep an emergency lawyer fund on hand and how much should it be the response i think was most appropriate for this question was the following  vanillaroyale on january amgive your lawyer k and put him on a retainer don t have a emergency fund stash lying around if that is what you mean you should already have your lawyer paid plus extra in case he needs to post bond for you and they seize the majority of your drug funds once you get arrested by le they can seize your money based on the assumption that it is drug related so you need to have a lawyer paid for ahead of time that way in the unfortunate case that you get a visit from the feds you have a lawyer ready to go the agreed upon amount was around next i want to talk to you about what to do in case you get interrogated by le there is a great thread about this the take homes from this thread are basically keep your moouth shut the feds are going to try all types of tactics on you to get you to admit to guilt of the crimes you are being accused of they will likely use the good cop bad cop on you first they will tell you that they want to help you and that they are after the big guys they just need your help to put away the big guys do not listen to this i have never cooperated with a good cop le and have it end up working in my favor once you admit to being guilty you can kiss your freedom good bye secondly if you refuse to cooperate their attitude will change to bad cop they will say ok fine you do not want to cooperate i tried to help but now you are going to be in a lot of trouble do you have any idea what kind of charges you are facing you are going away for a long time unless you start talking they are going to try and scare you into admitting guilt again keep your mouth shut and continue to ask for a lawyer hopefully the one you put on a retainer prior to this happening never speak without a lawyer present and never do anything you do not have to do legally if you have the right to remain silent then exercise that right i know there are some circumstances in which you do not have that right but unless that is the case you are better off staying quiet third drop the attitude do not argue with the cops about having nothing on you or something for that matter act scared anxious and confused act like you have no idea what is going on and that you are scared for your life tell the cops they are scaring you and you want to see your lawyer because you do not know what this is about they need evidence and solid evidence at that to charge you with a crime they are going to try and correlate posts you made on forums phone numbers you called perhaps a package shipped to your home all forms of communication bank transfers and so forth until they can find a way to link you to the crime you are being accused of but the biggest piece of evidence will always be your willingness to admit your guilt for a lesser sentence when sabu found that he was facing years in federal prison he quickly spilled everything and started working for the feds again talk to your lawyer find out the evidence against you and only answers questions your lawyer advises you to answer and answer them in a way your lawyer advises you to answer them try and be as honest as possible with your lawyer your lawyer can not and will not share any admittance of guilt you have with the prosecutors or le this is called attorney client privilege please note there are a few instances where this does not apply.
i m actively avoiding the markets the only advantage markets have is escrow buying from a vendor directly here is like having to fe on the markets but you avoid having to send money to the market where you are susceptible to being phished or having the admins either take your cash directly or in an exit scam every day people are claiming that their money is being stolen on ab i think it s easier here to establish trust with a vendor and not to have to worry about a market being shut down and having your btc lost and having your orders in limbo if a vendor starts scamming here it s evident pretty quickly and people will just stop sending them their money long live tmg.

nothing on this if the list is legit and the proxy is still active accessing the proxy from a sandboxed environment and monitoring the server logs might produce some useful information how many people could be accessing the board through this proxy without knowing it.

enigmaticsmile on february pmtry to keep your desktop or laptop clean you can download tor and gpg to an external hd or usb can gpg software be kept on an external drive that isn t an os like tails i learned that as it needs access to services it has to be kept on the machine this is why i encrypt my gpg software as well as my computer and never save any keys but i m always on the lookout for apps i can keep on a thumb drive i m going to read up on truecrypt.
ulbricht guilty in silk road online drug trafficking trialjury convicts on seven counts doesn t believe ulbricht was just the fall guy by joe mullin feb pm utcnew york a jury on wednesday convicted ross ulbricht on federal charges accusing him of being the mastermind behind the online drug bazaar silk road where hundreds of millions of dollars in illegal goods were traded before law enforcement shuttered the site in late the jury of twelve reached its guilty verdicts on all seven counts after deliberating less than four hours ulbricht faces up to life in prison he ll be sentenced at a separate proceeding in a few months the seven charges include three drug counts distributing or aiding and abetting the distribution of narcotics distributing narcotics or aiding and abetting distribution over the internet and conspiracy to violate narcotics laws he was also convicted on a fourth count of conspiracy to run a continuing criminal enterprise which involves supervising at least five other people in an organization in addition he was convicted on conspiracy charges for computer hacking distributing false identification and money laundering the verdict was handed up to us district judge katherine forrest in a manila envelope she gave it to her court clerk who read it out the judge then polled each juror asking them to verbally concur in the verdict as the verdict was read ulbricht s father kirk ulbricht held his head midway through the reading ulbricht turned to face his family and friends who filled about two rows of courtroom benches after it was read ulbricht was taken out of the room by the same two federal marshals who led him in each day of the trial it s not the end ulbricht s mother lyn ulbricht said to her son as he was escorted from the courtroom several other relatives in front rows simply shouted out a quick goodbye in the back of the gallery a supporter shouted ross is a hero the year old ulbricht who the authorities said made millions of dollars in commissions put on a brief defense of just three character witnesses during the three week criminal trial ulbricht s defense attorney joshua dratel told reporters gathered outside the courthouse that he plans to appeal dratel said the judge presiding over the trial hampered his defense by excluding evidence and witnesses a position echoed by the defendant s mother the defense was shackled she told reporters gathered outside the courthouse after the verdict it s not fair dratel didn t say much about the negotiations before the trial but he did say the government didn t make a meaningful offer that would have reduced ulbricht s possible sentence the trial proceeded over days spread over three weeks during closing arguments tuesday dratel told jurors that the data authorities seized from ulbricht s computer connecting him to the site could have been created by others the internet is not what it seems he told the six woman six man panel dratel has said his client who did not take the stand had created the site but was the fall guy for the site s real operators prosecutors countered dratel telling jurors there was a mountain of evidence that ulbricht was the dread pirate roberts thousands of pages of chats with silk road admins and other management documents were recovered from his open laptop there s no dispute when the defendant was arrested he was logged in as dread pirate roberts prosecutor serrin turner told jurors there were no little elves that put all of that evidence on the defendant s computer.
i am interested i understand tmp uses multisig what software are people there using i don t have a problem with command line tools as long as commands are not too complicated after much mucking around with gui pgp tools i have found nothing beats gpg perhaps the same is true with multisig.
the protocol part depends on the server you re trying to connect to i haven t been able to use ckl obj gypcu onion in a while but i had some luck with electrumh alorp onion both use tcp the listening port depends on how you have tor set up if you re using tails for example or other linux with tor package installed you can use if you only have the browser bundle you have to use.
introduction to secure communication tor sslgreetings comrades through my research i have put together some security measures that should be considered by everyone the reason i put this together is mainly for the newbies of this forum but if i can help anyone out then i am grateful for this i would like to start out by saying if you are reading like you are likely a silk road user if this is the case then the thing you must be using to even access this form is tor tor will provide you with a degree of anonymity by using an bit aes advanced encryption standard there has been some debate as to whether or not the nsa can crack this code and the answer is likely yes this is why you should never send anything over tor that you aren t comfortable sharing with the entire world unless you are using some sort of pgp encryption which we will talk about later communication from your computer to the internet relies on an entry node which basically enters your computer into the tor network this entry node communicates with your computer this entry node knows your ip address the entry node then passes your encrypted request onto the relay node the relay node communicates with the entry node and the exit node but does not know your computer s ip address the exit node is where your request is decrypted and sent to the internet the exit node does not know your computer s ip only the ip of the relay node using this model of nodes it makes it harder but not impossible to correlate your request to your original ip address the problem comes obviously when you are entering plain text into tor because anybody can set up an exit node the fbi can set up an exit node the nsa or any other foreign government or any malicious person who may want to steal your information you should not be entering any sensitive data into any websites especially when accessing them over tor if any of the nodes in the chain are compromised and some likely are and the people in charge of those compromised nodes have the computing power to decrypt your request then you better hope it wasn t anything sensitive so what can we do to fix this well luckily we are now having more and more servers that are offering something called hidden services you can easily recognize these services by the address onion these services offer what s called end to end encryption what this does is take the power out of the compromised exit nodes and put them back in your hands the web server of the hidden service now becomes your exit node which means the website you are visiting is the one decrypting your message not some random exit node ran by a potential attacker remember the exit node has the key to decrypt your request the exit node can see what you are sending in clear text once they decrypt it so if you are entering your name and address into a field the exit node has your information if you are putting a credit card a bank account your real name even your login information then you are compromising your identity another step you can take is to only visit websites that use something called http secure you can tell if the website you are visiting is using http secure by the prefix at the beginning of the address if you see then your website is using http secure what this does is encrypts your requests so that only the server can decrypt them and not somebody eavesdropping on your communication such as a compromised tor exit node this is another form of end to end encryption if somebody were to intercept your request over http secure they would see encrypted data and would have to work to decrypt it another reason you want to use whenever possible is that malicious tor nodes can damage or alter the contents passing through them in an insecure fashion and inject malware into the connection this is particularly easier when you are sending requests in plain text but reduces this possibility you must be made aware however that can also be currently cracked depending on the level of the key used to encrypt it when you visit a website using you are encrypting your request using their public key and they are decrypting it using their private key this is how cryptography works a public key is provided to those who want to send an encrypted message and the only one who can decrypt is the one with the private key unfortunately many websites today are still using private keys that are only bits long which in today s world are no longer enough so you need to make sure you find out which level of encryption the website you are visiting uses to make sure they are using at a minimum if not bits even doing all of this unfortunately is not enough because we have another problem what happens if the web server itself has become compromised maybe your tor nodes are clean maybe you have used for all your requests but the web server itself of the website you are visiting has been compromised well then all your requests are again as good as plain text with that being said this will conclude the first post in this series of the steps we can take to protect our privacy online to remain anonymous and maintain our freedom.
it doesn t break the transaction chain so it shouldn t be used on it s own but it s good in combo with different mixing methods.
some people say that small domestic order are fine in your own address if you can keep a clean house a few days before and a few days after and if it s not too often abandoned building might look weird if there hasn t been letters there for a while you might want to test it first and why not register for some crap using that name and address consider switching drop point after a few successful drops the mailbox of a family out for holidays can be nice but your package has to come before they come back from holidays and you have to be able to check their mailbox without neighbors seeing you that s a complicated matter.
i m using your mom as an os she gives me a blowjob every time i hit the enter key xdjust i have a tails liveusb that i use on a laptop that currently has lubuntu loaded on as for my pc i use ubuntu and windows only due to my gaming habits but i don t get on the darknet much on my pc i mainly only go into the chatrooms on it the laptop is where i do my business aspect of it all.
just a heads up if mixed coins are available almost instantly it s not a good sign as you might be prone to timing attacks that s why it s good to always add some random time delay if a mixer offers such option.

i mainly use os x with tor directly installed as a service started as the user at log in i then have different browsers for where i need to go the one i use for dark net dealings use i have what i call dark fox where i am not completely safe but am able to run simple javascripts without compromising security not easy to do but it s all there my main reason for using os x is that it s the only fully posix compliant unix out there after going through and unlocking all the things they lock to keep stupid people from hurting the os you will find yourself in better control over the entire os just like any other version of linux i also like how pgp integrates into the operating system and allows for easy import signature decryption and encryption without the need to open a separate app then i have a regular version of firefox for clearnet use and i have installed chromium not from the one from google for a recommendation to others i would have to say using whonix is a good way to start you don t need to change the os or boot to a different flash live usb just download virtualbox and the different images they have ready for you to use in any os if the settings are the same as the walk through i made to isolate a virtual os behind tor you should be able to use full java flash and anything that doesn t require udp to work without risk of exposure.
dhl look solid very engaging also i loved the theme.
there is away to use electrum in tails without persistence it does however require an external usb or sd disk where to store your wallet and the electrum app we will not use the tails pre installed electrum version we will be using the downloaded one i ll explain below how to start it btw i am not saying this is the correct way to do things i personally will use tails persistence but since you asked here is a way to do it in your external data disk create a secret password protected partition using tails disk utility this will be only visible from tails and it will be like a persistent drive for your data here is where you store your wallet and electrum app in electrum site downloads get installation from python sources and download linux version once unzipped you ll have a folder save this in your secret disk all you need to do is access this folder from your terminal in terminal command line type cd and drag the folder from your desktop to terminal it should look something like cd amnesia externaldisk electrum this opens the folder in terminal and once you are inside the folder command line shows something like amnesia exernaldisk electrum once you are in the folder run electrum type electrum electrum app should open the you create a wallet and save this wallet in your secret disc file looks something like mywallet dat by default each time electrum starts will load the last wallet used make sure to create a backup copy of your wallet in another secret disk just in case hope that helps sorry for the short technical explanations on linux terminal but i am not expert just an average user.
bum.
thank you for your time and efforts nonya i tried to import your public key it said key import failed code error text gig total number processed i tried copying and pasting both your key and your sig and i tried copying and pasting just your key without your sig neither method worked i ve tried importing other peoples keys from the thread where members post their keys some of them import just fine but some don t i am using the exact same method every time so i don t don t know what s going on there i never have any problem importing venders keys from their vender pages on other markets i had a similar experience a long time ago i think it was on sr i could import someone s key if they posted it on the forum but i couldn t do it if it was on their forum profile or maybe it was the other way around can you try pming me your key and maybe if i copy and paste it from there it will work i ve tried pasting your pgp key link in the address bar it took me to start page com and said sorry there are no web results for this search when i paste mine into the address bar it says unable to connect mine no longer appears at the bottom of my posts because i just deleted it from my profile last night but i copied it before i deleted it in case i need it again next day edit i tried your pgp key link again took a minute to connect but it worked this time and i was able to import your key so this seems consistent with what you were saying on one of your threads my pgp key link still doesn t connect and i still don t remember how i acquired it in the first place and it would be nice to know how to create a new one with my updated email address but at least i can pm you now i didn t realize that your pgp key link goes to the same thread where all these members post their keys i generated a new key and tried to send it to my email address it said sending key failed thanks for clearing up my confusion over the word signature i understand the purpose of the sig i ve found other info online about that but i can t find my sig i figured out how to generate a sig for a key that i generated yesterday and i exported the key to a folder like i normally do that s where i usually open a text file of my public key to give someone that text file still doesn t show a sig though oh and i wasn t trying to change the email address in my key i was trying to change it in my tmg forum account settings my main interest right now is to be able to import your public key then i ll try working with that message you created then maybe i ll try to tackle some of these other problems next day edit as i mentioned above i tried your pgp key link again took a minute to connect but it worked and i was able to import it this time when i get a chance i ll try working with your encryped message exercise and see what happens with that but at least i have your key imported i really appreciate your help you have been so nice.
beetlejews on august ami havent gotten my btc yet either withdrew two days ago yall figure it will still come i hope i dont lose like i did on blackbanki recieved my btc after about days it sucks waiting but i think you will get it eventually hope it comes through for you much lovehalfpin.
i had actually hoped to remove only incriminating data from from my windows without using dban anybody know of a way to do this i suppose i may have to restort to just encrypting my hard drive anybody know the best way to do this with windows i ve heard a lot about truecrypt unfortunately it does not work with windows as for the blockchain question i ve seen comments from people who use blockchain through tor but in order to due this scripts must be enabled so i wondered how people were comfortable doing this the same goes for reddit scripts must be enabled to post how are people comfortable doing this.
i don't personally use the stuff you're using the easiest way for me would be to put all of their public keys into a message and encrypt it to myself then open it on my new system decrypt it and import the keys generally getting your public key is quite easy as it's one of the major things that everyone with any pgp program will be doing perhaps explore the program a bit look for thing that say stuff like keys or if you see your key listed somewhere try right clicking on it and perhaps a dropdown will appear with a number of options.
update this morning when checking my wallet the btc arrived almost days after so problem resolved thanks but strange and took a very long time for an automated process seems that someone corrected manually the transfer problem maybe only young beta system error we must be kind and tolerant about it after all i did not loose money let sigaint have a chance and improve their young mixer that seems great the pay somebody is usefull i will use pay shield again now i can trust that money does not vanish.
moreau on january amquote from doses lysergic on january amlol speak english its not insignificant it is not not significant when you use a double negative you obscure your meaning ianae the post by dxuutx undoubtedly contains florid prose perhaps excessively and i appreciate your plea for simple english on internet forums it is usually more effective to have style enhance an argument rather than have the argument be a frame for displaying one s style however the use of the double negative in it s not insignificant is valid here before going further let s first correct the misquote so that the phrase regains its original meaning taken out of context as above the phrase implies the possessive sense of its eg people admired its not insignificant beauty whereas the original was it s an abbreviation of the verb it is yes i know at worst this is a common mistake and at best acceptable textspeak and generally is too small to be worth picking up on but your opening point is that dxuutx should speak english therefore introducing a grammatical error into your first  dxuutx s post unfairly helps your claim as to the phrase itself the double negative is an example of a figure of speech called litotes or more generally meiosis where something is deliberately played down or understated in order to increase its importance litotes is common in many languages both ancient and modern in europe it has a fine pedigree being found in homer s iliad ovld s metamorphoses and the epic poem beowulf logically it may be true that it s not insignificant has the same meaning as it s significant but litotes remains an acceptable way of emphasising a statement even to fowler who would certainly be sympathetic towards your desire for greater clarity a dictionary of modern english usage hw fowler various editions just saying a response requires more thought on my part get back to ya.
i m not really seeing where a prepaid card would help maybe if it were like a gift card but in the bitcoin exchange sites all prepaid card rates are marked way up cheapest ways to use exchanges in my area are mg or western union which is usually a higher rate than mg is a no go here.
goodfornothing on may pmseems like a pretty bad time to be depositing coin to agora even when they come online for hours and it seems issues have been solved it seems like a big tease everyone who can t wait to get back on and get shit done and hasn t been scared off yet is like hope it stays up oh what s that it s staying up seemingly oh wait nevermind fuck fuck fuck fuck at this point i think it would be ambitious to get too comfortable even if it goes consecutive days with uptime oh and i m not mocking the op i ve fallen into the semi comfort of a little bit of responsive uptime a bit too easily too howdy gfn thank you for the response it s weird not being able to trust the dnm but it s a giving being blessed with dpr before was just soo easy to have lack of downtime quick deposits withdraws that when i go to make an order on any marketplace i just quickly jump the gun which is faulty faulty on my end as i get left with in limbo however agora has fixed this and given me my btc i was still worried sick for multiple days like i can t lose that much money that s more than my car is worth i just need to be more understanding for the dnm but at the same time know that they could bail for numerous reasons at anytime.
dxuutx on december pmif anything this is more proof that hos or whoever is a major target of law enforcement and that we really shouldn t be talking about this business on the clearnet anywhere than any notion that the whole sub is just a honeypot i think the arrogant sense that people on the sub have that their crimes aren t worthy of targeting from law enforcement these are people who live to make drug arrests i also think it s a bit alarmist to assert that it exists only for this purpose and that no worthwhile discussion takes place thereon and it s not insignificant seemingly to me that hos didn t have any overt problems with reddit when the reviews were adulatory and the attitude changed when they started to turn critical lol speak english its not insignificant it is not not significant when you use a double negative you obscure your meaning thereon this word has been used not since again not one knows what the fuck not insignificant again that hos didn t have a problem when the reviews were positive adulatory if you yern to be not unlike leo tolstoy well then i ll just not continue writing now.
goodfornothing on april pmtmg is in a league of it s own and entirely different i meant commission taking escrow offering money handling markets of the risk your capital kind not this open honest trust based forum that asks nothing in return for letting people find each other and communicate freely glad to see you here gfn i remember you from sr as i was one of your first customers good person we decided the best way to work a marketplace is not to run one at all as tmg was created by the avengers it would be a conflict of interest trying to be the middle men in a transaction so it s trust based and we have only had a few troubles with vendors and even most those troubles were taken care of by other members and or eventually resolved by the vendor that dropped the ball even with escrow and multisig you need to place your trust in someone so we set up this forum for communication and allow you to gain trust in the vendor directly roo.
never track a pack through tor go to starbucks or somewhere with free wifi and check it cheers s.
jor has an alternate key for people having just this issue it was his main key that was giving troubl.
yeah i have imported the key and everything.
thanks buddy so kind of yo.
blond wig blender is the first one i ever tried and it worked very fast i had no troubles and was able to withdraw instantly after depositing you can also set it to withdraw your coins later at random times with multiple withdraws to make it even harder to trace as for blond wig fog i would avoid it i ve read too many negative reviews saying that people never got their coins back some do but some don t apparently they might be doing a selective scam they don t scam all people so they can stay and look innocent and blame the issues on other services ect and keep people using their services so they can keep doing it.
localbitcoins comfind someone selling btc for vanilla go to cvs riteaid walmart etc and put your cash onto a vanilla reload card give the seller your digit vanilla reload code you will have your btc in a matter of moments no idea how you could be having trouble getting btc you can also meet someone and purchase with cash locally.
pgp tails virtual box so keep in mind that if you are a user of silk road or any other form of activism you never want to enter any identifying details about yourself online make it so that even if the nsa intercepted and decrypted or compromised silk road that the only information they have against you is your username and password how safe is that username and password does your password contain any identifying information is it the same password that you use for your personal email does it contain a name of somebody you know personally always keep all of these factors in mind another step you must take especially when communicating with other users on sites such as silk road is using pgp encryption this is not always possible such as in cases when you are logging into a website filling out a form logging into an email etc consider any type of information you enter into a website using plain text possibly compromised never put anything sensitive is any type of plain text format online pgp comes into play because it uses a very strong method of encryption called cryptography pgp stands for pretty good privacy and it is used for encrypting decrypting and signing texts e mails files directories and whole disk partitions and to increase the security of e mail communications for the more technical users it uses a serial combination of hashing data compression symmetric key cryptography and finally public key cryptography for the less technical users the process of encrypting messages using pgp is as follows you create a private key and a public key the public key is the key you give out to people you want to send you encrypted messages your private key is kept privately by you this private key is the only key that can unlock messages that were previously locked with your public key if you are still confused think about it like this think about a public key that can go around locking boxes that are intended for you anyone can lock a box that is intended for you but you are the only one with the key to unlock the box either if the person who sent you a message locked a box message with your public key they themselves can not unlock it only the person possessing the private key can unlock it if you wish to respond to this person you must use their public key to encrypt the message you intend to send to them and they themselves use their own private key to decrypt the message you sent them if you are still with me i am glad i haven t lost you yet this is called cryptography and was designed so that anybody intercepting your message could not decrypt the message without your private key even if you yourself lose your private key there is no method of key recovery you can consider that message locked forever so how do you use pgp well before we get to that i want to introduce you to a live operating system which makes using pgp encryption and decryption very easy a live operating system is an operating system that you can run on top of your current operating system so for example if you are a windows user you have choices you can download the live operating system burn it to a cd or dvd and then boot your computer from that dvd or cd this will make sure your computer run as if you have this operating system installed on your computer however if you remove the cd or dvd and reboot then your computer will boot as normal you can also use a usb drive to perform this same feature secondly you can run this live operating system in what s called a virtual box the benefits of this are that you can run windows simultaneously as you run this other operating system and you can easily switch back and forth between them without rebooting the computer both methods have their pros and cons the pros of running a live cd boot are that reduce the risk of having your computer compromised by viruses malware and keyloggers that rely on windows to run if you are going to run this os from a virtual box i suggest downloading virtual box from oracle note the next the live operating system i would encourage you to use is tails tails can be found at the following website the reason i choose tails is because it has many of the security features that you require to stay anonymous already installed some users are not happy with tails but it really is a great operating system loaded with security features many i will talk about in this series on security including pgp encryption and decryption make sure you download the tails iso file from the official tails website and you can either load it into virtual box or burn it to a dvd or load it onto a usb and booting your computer from that drive there are plenty of tutorials on how to load tails into virtual box so i won t go into much detail other than make sure you run virtual box and tails from a usb drive or sd card i would suggest a usb drive however for reasons i will explain later but basically when when virtual box runs directly on your hard drive it creates a virtual hard drive that is uses as a temporary hard drive while tails is running once tails is closed this virtual drive is deleted but it s not permanently deleted as we know from the power of recovery tools deleted files are easily recoverable with the right tools i will talk about how to protect your files from data recovery tools in future posts but for now just keep virtual box and tails off of your hard drive and load it either on a usb drive or sd card the same goes when booting your computer directly into tails from a dvd or usb stick your hard drive will be used to store files used by tails so make sure any files that are saved or accessed using tails are done from a usb stick or sd card otherwise they will be recoverable this is why i prefer using a virtual box and running both the virtual box and tails inside of it off of a usb stick keep as much as possible off of your actual hard drive it is possible to shred files beyond recovery but it s much easier to do this on a gb flash drive then it is a tb hard drive next post we will get back on topic and start learning how to use pgp the reason i have to take a detour to using tails is because we will be using tails for many of the features from here on out including pgp.
so i just woke up to the mailman at my door saying that i owe for a package to be delivered that the postage was due and he would be back by later today to drop the package and collect the moneyanyone have any experience with this.
the simplest pgp software is gpg usb ime it can be saved on a usb encrypted if you like although it doesn t have to be the software will make you a public key which you will give out to anyone who wishes to send you an encrypted message likewise you ll use other s public keys to encrypt messages to them encrypting a message will return you a big string of gobbledygook which can then be decrypted only by the holder of a corresponding private key gpg usb has some simple instructions wih it it s literally a few clicks of a mouse easy stuf.
slarky on may amthank you i was having the same problem too taking a first look in security i wasn t able to find a secure tor based e mail provider any help is appreciated sigaint everything though never trust the server not to be compromise.
haven t been able to access my coins in weeks edit fixedon linux make sure ibusd is running or electrum will break.
lovelyface on april pmhi guys im pretty new to this and have spent some time trying to work out tails and im thinking i should get a vpn but then i read this gave me a headacheshould i get a vpn on tails i wouldn t if i were you even in tails when discussion of vpns has come up it would appear that only pptp is being considered for support pptp is no longer considered safe as far as i am determine see the following site for details clearnet spitfir.
i have an account over there and have done several large transactions flawless one with a small problem that was solved between the vendor and i one order had to start a support ticket but the issue was solved with in a few days the support over there is awesome even when they were under attack by a wanna be hacker they went out of their way to help.
galindoi on july pmagora is the bulk of my new customers but after an order or two most people are moving to direct deals i m probably at agora and direct deals it has an ebb and flow to it galindoithanks for your response i look forward to doing business with you soon.
agora is back up agora is back up agora is back up agora is back up agora is back up agora is back up agora is back up agora is back up for now here are a couple of reg links for anyone that needs em enjoylink.
my ab wallet became frozen due to too many pin attempts i bitch publicly about not getting help on this min later i lose access to my account after publicly bashing ab for days the admin finally restores my access and says oh so sorry i feel for you you were phished i log into my account and all my funds are gone so i can t remove my funds from my frozen wallet yet a supposed phisher can they are fucking crooks and fucking liars.
we wouldn t trust this market with our btc if you do make an order please let everyone know via this thread sant.
thanks as well.
jackspay on february pmi am having the same problem with safe mail net and thunderbird i am using thunderbird and gpg win and can t seem to get it to work i need to find a safe email address that is anomymous any help appericated thanks i ditched the safe mail for pgp purposes instead created a gmail account while on tor i use it only for this purpose and only for a week or two actually i only use it to send pgp keys to myself into that same address as this seems to be the only way i can atm add public keys to my keychain i m sure others will give a better answer i now have made my first purchase and no emails needed only pm s.
good looking out thank.
crypto on february amyou can anonymize recipients by putting throw keyid in your gpg conf unfortunately some pgp clients are crappy and won t test all the private keys in their key chain so they will fail to decrypt anonymized pgp messages kgpg on linux allows you to create bit keys it also has the option to remove the key id without editing the gpg conf file so you can select to remove it only for certain messages seahorse allows you to edit the key email and such so you can make a bit key without an email like i di.
i only have a pgp key do i have necessarily to make a one.
the consensus is that they have exit scammed unless the admins do come back from the dead there have been reports of coins moving from the eic deposit address which can only be viewed as the action of admins moving the stolen coins to their own wallets shame indeed but i wonder if they were hacked again or if its was an exit is multisig really the solution some customers are struggling to implement basic opsec like pgp its unlikely they would go to the lengths of storing the private key of a transaction and broadcasting it after its completed etc exit scams these days are just another liability the cost of using the dnm s its the vendors who struggle often having hundreds of coins in escrow.
disable javascript and you ll be ok if you can t login with javascript disabled better forget about this site check for how to do it for the reason you could use tails or whonix if you don t already use a better way than those to connect to tor.
i have heard that albert heijn was busted along with theheineken and they may have been supplied through the same operation they have been detained in nl pending trial according to a news story i read in dutch which mentioned something about supertrips and others it seems credible at this point it sucks but it will not stop the lsd mdma from nl that would be like a little boy trying to hold back the sea with his finge.

hi alli want to know your opinion about market for you what is the best i speak about drug market i saw that agora don t work anymore evolution is deadso now how is the best i am on blackbank alphabay nucleus and abraxas do you think is it a good market or not and about middle earth is it done too or what if you know good market give me link please thanks for your future answeri wish the best at every peoples on majestic gardensee you.
made my first purchase on dhl a few days ago still waiting on delivery but i m definitely a fan of the market s interface so far i especially like the fact that after you pay your member bond you can keep your coins in your own wallet and send them through after you ve started the purchasing process.
well the title says it all got scammed for half a coin and it s not only me clearnet have written about this already wanted to post this in a separate thread to increase visibility stay save don t follow my example use your common senselov.
with your current opsec you re currently most likely better off than over half the buyers on the darknet use tails pgp sensitive info use trusted vender and you will be a okay plus lsd is super easy to stealth safe tripping my friend good vibe.
i have a few invites message me if you need one pickles.
it seems that tails provides email services anyone would have a comment regarding this oops sorry i misinterpreted this post here will secure the email service i will use not provide an email service.
m ya and space to the rescue thanks for chipping in both of you have a cheeky so it would seem size matters but it depends how you use it.
tmg has set up a guide to help this is useful welcom.
for a simple introduction to tails.
what pope says is spot on and that program is very good pop.
ehh dont bother agora is shutting down dood dont make an account or deposit money.
so i buy it from local with cash or someone else pays non cash for another one he sends it from local to helix and then from helix to market sure thats enough or helix to another helix what if cash its not optional give me some couple of a to c options thank.
i think this is a great idea customer protection without the risk of central escrow to the vendor or the responsibility of handling finances for the market.
has disabled account creation so people would use create other xmpp servers tbh i think it would be easier to use crypto cat the only difference is that you need to check the other person s identity manually this could easily be done with pgp.
whole disk encryption and file back again now that we have pgp figured out hopefully i want to remind you that using pgp whenever possible is very very very important one of the pitfalls of silk road is that some of the administrators including ross himself did not always communicate using pgp encryption once ross was busted they had access to his servers and his computers and anything that wasn t encrypted was wide open for them to look at most users on silk road believe that ross had stored personal information about some of admins and moderators on his computer in plain text that was used to make more arrests of silk road users one of the reasons why i would suggest for you to store your pgp keys and other sensitive data on a sd card is that if that day comes when you are compromised and you get a knock at your door you have time to dispose of that sd card or usb drive quickly even better if you have a micro sd card that plugs into an sd adapter then you can snap it with your fingers or at the very least hide it usbs would need to be smashed into pieces and it might not be easy to do this in the heat of the moment so do what you feel best about but always prepare for the day they might come for you but our next topic brings us to something called whole disk encryption or full disk encryption from here on out i will refer to it as fde full disk encryption tails has a fde feature built into it which is another reason why i encourage the use of tails it has many of these features to protect you essentially fde will protect your drive whether sd or usb from the people who may come for you one day the method in which it does this is it formats your drive and rewrites the file system in an encrypted fashion so that it can be only be accessed by someone who has the pass phrase if you lose your passphrase just like in pgp there is no recovery your only choice is to format the drive and start over again so make sure you remember it and please for the love of god allah buddah etc don t store the passphrase on your hard drive somewhere the tutorial on how to do this is located at the following webpage again always prepare for the day they come knocking encrypt everything use pgp when communicating with others and always shred your files when finished with them which brings me to my next topic file shredding file shredding is extremely important and here is why if you delete a file from your computer you are only deleting where it is located on the drive it is still on the actual drive just it s location data has been removed if you take a file recovery tool you can recover virtually any file that you have recently removed file shredding combats this by overwriting files instead the idea is that instead of removing the file s location you need to overwrite the file with random data so that is becomes unrecoverable there are a lot of debate happening on whether you can overwrite a file once or if you need to do it multiple times supposedly the nsa recommends times supposedly the department of defense recommends times and an old paper by a man named peter gutmann written in the s recommended times needless to say i personally think between times is sufficient and several people out there believe time will get the job done the reasoning behind this is that some people believe the drive may miss some files the first time it over writes them and to be more complete you should do multiple passes do what you feel most comfortable with but i even think passes would be sufficient although it wouldn t hurt every now and then to run passes and just leave it overnight the programs that can do file shredding are ones you will want to run from windows or whatever operating system your computer is running these programs can delete your files from your recycling bin delete your temporary internet files and even wipe your free disk space to make sure everything gets cleaned up you always need to think did i have any sensitive material on my hard drive if so maybe i need to shred my free disk space when empting your recycle bin you should always use a shredder when only deleting under gb at a time you can easily do passes pretty quickly to put this in perspective the leader of a group called lulzsec name topiary has been banned as part of his sentence from using any type of file shredding applications so that if the fbi wants to check up on him they can file shredding keeps your deleted files actually deleted here are some file shredding applications you can use we re going to talk about removing harmful metadata from files and some other topics as well.
doseheavy on november pmyou should look at a modded version of aflao bitwasp it will save you a lot of time all you are doing by the vendor anonyminity is creating extra scripting to be hacked make sure you have it all locked down if not you will have to trust in people to refund its not just a payment code with a ledger created for an escrow account and then dropped in real addresses anonymous listings lead to a whole vacuum for scams are you logging the anonyminity to the vendor so when a scam occurs there is a way to locate the scammer yes their will be internal data logging disputes are still able to be made and messages sent to from vendors through the product page there will be a spot to ask questions no identiy from vendor will be shown unless question is answered this allows vendors the ability to conceal themselves should a user that s been suggested as le somehow gets in and hasn t yet been banned will still display vendor names the anonymity for the vendor buying would only be for the listings once a question is asked on the product the instant chat window if java enabled would still display the vendor you re communicating with if java isn t enabled you d have the same typical html html screen as mem did also one vendor voted by all of the rest with the best reviews undecided will ultimately be given king status on the site giving them the ability to override small features and veto console votes that have been performed by the community they will be able to prioritize vendor inventory such as auto direct sales to vendor s stash instead of vendor s stash if vendor has an item that vendor has there will be a smart sense feature that dissalows similar items to be posted as a means to bypass this king admin will have ability to modify but this feature will be stricly difficult and will require much more approval from the vendor congress vendors on vacation mode will opt out and or auto vote not yet decided still working on the philsophy and bugs within the business logic aspect of the site but overall that s the general solution i m thinking of essentially a darknet congress i don t have the full plan layed out yet which is why i d like some feedback and i didn t mean to be nasty in my previous message dh i m sorry if i came out that way at all i don t want to but i do this type of work fairly often so i m extremely confident that i can architect a flawless system or atleast should a flaw be noted a solution would be implemented that would please everyone i have no interested in making anything off of the site either i just want lsd so no fee s for transactions or tax withdrawal crap that i ve seen at other places but there might be a tax for funds that are transferred in and withdrawn without a purchase the system won t be intended to be a tumbler service so that type of activity will be looked down upon edit i have added donation abilities and details onto the original post if anyone would like to assist.
i wouldn t call it an exit scam as such imo they were compromised and it was a fast reteat in to the sunset seems that the downfall intentional or otherwise was to allow escrow as well as multisig the same old vendors joined up and didn t bother to enforce multisg and hey presto now there is a chunk of change in the escrow pot not much but enough to reteat if the going got tough vendors who used escrow you can afford to lose the coins by the sound of it i stuck to multisig only and came out only losing time and effort the amount of time and effort the admins put in to eic it you were to break down what they gained at todays rate by going offline that s not even worth the hassle imo.
foundits a marketplace i see i cannot get into it either need a referral link try abraxas for now link is belo.
poppasmurf on october pmdoes anybody have a referral link for darknet heroes league if so please send me a pm it d be much appreciated ditt.
i can t respond as a buyer don t have any experience with depositing funds there but as a seller its all crickets over there not a lot of activity for mushrooms i ve found in light of that though the few transactions i ve had went smooth customers finalized and i was able to transfer my funds several hundred dollars out of the system into my own wallets easily and with no hassle so grain of salt galindo.

anyone else not able to get on agora right now cheers s.
not sure exactly what that means opening that message would only let someone know their personal public pgp key works not your public pgp key would need an administrator verify by sending you an encrypted message with a random string of characters and you confirm off one of the pgp keys from another dmn source preferably would need to talk to an administrator about this and have them post.
mirrormirror on september pmsomeone with more knowledge can feel free to correct me but it is my understanding that using a vm is almost never as safe as just using tails from a usb the reason for this is that you have to trust that there are no backdoors in the vm most likely there wouldn t be but if your are running your virtual machine on windows you can never be sure as for your other question your isp can see that you are using tor but not what you do there think of it as a helicopter watching you enter the subway sure the helicopter knows that you re using the subway but it doesnt know where you are going to get off using a vm would add an additional level of security if you re engaging in hacking activities ideally you create a new mac from your existing this includes spoofing of a new address this allows you to accomplish the same task as having a throw away computer in nearly every aspect except that you cannot just burn it meaning delete the vm the way hard drives store information except ssd s are based on flags deleting a file on your computer does not erase the bytes stored on the disk all this does is flip flags on thr hard drive letting the os know this area is writeable to fully delete any fine on any computer you must overwrite the bytes at that sector this means your os must write data back to the sector that flag exists at if you do not over write the data at that sector it is still recoverableif you re interested in permanently erasing data i would recommend either writing a program in c that generatesa text file until the disk is full and deletes it or i would recommend downloading ccleaner and use drive wipe option but in anyca i do not think this is necesarry unless you re edward snowden and leaking classified documents from an organization you should be completely safe vpn ing and using tor from your home so long as a if you use wifi its encrypted a even if you have wifi encrypt it with a password once on a network you can packet sniff all informationb unless your isp logs your activity if you want to practice safety the best way only access markets when not from your home and only buy when not from your home you don t ever need to be on a market unless you re looking at stock communicating with a vendor or placing a purchase.
i hope just the user ids were taken but if one could access that database i would assume all data was compromised.
i trust agora slightly they have always pulled through in the dark times they could have already ran of with million and millions of btc if they wanted to but they obviosly dont want to or they would have by now they can be trusted i sa.
i want to go to the most active market now that agora is going inactive can anyone help.
yeah thought as much i already bought what i needed from a marketplace just wondered about this site because the prices are kinda low lower than the most though.
i ve got a slow transfer outside of any market i just read on r bitcoin that there is company in the eu conducting a stress test its got the whole system running slow the issue may not be agora.
if you re really worried about security buy a laptop locally with cash and only use it for browsing dn however a tails usb is easy to use and offers basically equal security never send any identifying incriminating information over tor without pgp encryption or to an untrusted source and never trust any third party such as a market or even tmg to encrypt your messages for you as mirrormirror said don t torrent over tor you can use a vpn or proxy to torrent safely from your home tails automatically offers mac spoofing by default across the board as well.
if someone is interested in an answer concerning that subject i had one on the hub forum here is the link to the topic.
we are pleased to announce that alphabay market now supports multisig transactions this was requested a long time ago by the community so we decided to step up our game a bit and go for this option we are now the only marketplace on the deepweb having all of the following security measures source deepdotweb s marketplace list multisig transactions fa withdrawal pin vendor bond forced vendor pgpfor the less tech inclined here s how a multisig transaction works both the buyer and the seller must have set their public multisig key in their profile the buyer deposits of the item value in his alphabay wallet to cover market fees the buyer purchases the item then a multisig blond wig address is generated using the buyer s key seller s key and a market generated public key both parties can use this publicly viewable information to verify the authenticity of the address the buyer sends money to this address and the seller ships the goods if the buyer is happy he finalizes and the seller received the market private key in case of dispute or refund the buyer receives the private key whoever got the private key will use it along with his own private key to claim the coins to make it simple buy the product and you get a btc address to send the coins to seller gets the private key when you finalize you get the key if you dispute and win this is a fool proof method to avoid exit scams you never give your private keys to anyone we don t provide help in cashing out the multisig address you have private keys out of so you are supposed to know the rest if you lose your private key it s too bad enjoysignup.

doses lysergic on january amquote from dxuutx on december pmif anything this is more proof that hos or whoever is a major target of law enforcement and that we really shouldn t be talking about this business on the clearnet anywhere than any notion that the whole sub is just a honeypot i think the arrogant sense that people on the sub have that their crimes aren t worthy of targeting from law enforcement these are people who live to make drug arrests i also think it s a bit alarmist to assert that it exists only for this purpose and that no worthwhile discussion takes place thereon and it s not insignificant seemingly to me that hos didn t have any overt problems with reddit when the reviews were adulatory and the attitude changed when they started to turn critical lol speak english its not insignificant it is not not significant when you use a double negative you obscure your meaning thereon this word has been used not since again not one knows what the fuck not insignificant again that hos didn t have a problem when the reviews were positive adulatory if you yern to be not unlike leo tolstoy well then i ll just not continue writing now by not insignificant i mean to caution against thinking the timing is insignificant as one may i m sorry you have a problem with the way i speak i don t think it invalidates my points.
ah found it net services is where to go to get your own site set up.
rasputin on june pmwhich are the biggest and most popular of the markets at this time agora is the biggest and best look no futher agora has it allcheers dolmi.

hi there we are very passionate about our lsd thats why we are the only ones to have ug alex grey blotters on offer high res image our lsd comes from a very trusted source and is lab tested by us personally we use only high quality needlepoint crystals guaranteedour shop has over sales and a posittive agora onion vendor regardsah.
topic pretty much explains it it seems i missed the train on doi dob c x s were about to be bought before agora went down so if anyone can point me in the right direction that d be wonderful looking for blotter on the doi dob and powder for the c x s thank.
i see no one at all talking about abraxas i like it good uptime.
hey all just curious if blockchain s shared send is safe enough to be considered a good air gap or if i should be using a more official tumbler like blond wigfog thank.
hmm might have to check it out since agora registrations seem to be closed and i forgot my login credentials as for noscript i am using tails but the browser always seems to start up with scripts enabled so i have to disable them manually is there a way to have scripts disabled by default i could not find anything in the preferences edit found it in the tor button options security needs to be set to high.
the word categories is misspelled cartegories on your site the word precursors is misspelled precousors the steroids is misspelled steriods the word opioids is misspelled opiods just trying to help hard to look professional with bad spelling at least to the peeled back tweaker.
hey albertwelcome to the majestic garden my favorite vendor glad to see you here i think anyone who does business on evo and agora should know you love your products and service though i haven t tried your alex grey blotters yet highly recommended check him out guy.
lately i ve had a good experience with bitblender the laundered coins are available almost immediately so the whole process didn t take more than minutes but you could probably find some other mixers with lower fees as bitblender is definitely not the cheapest.
i don t trust anymarket now that evo exited like they did prob agora gets my vote but i m always quick in and quick out.
even if its ssl encrypted its still possible for the receiving server usps to notice that this requests comes from an tor exit node given what we nowadays know about surveillance i wouldn t take any chances rather use a vpn good proxy sock from a public network when it comes to you worrying about mac addresses fake i.
chess on november pmquote from pinto on november ami have a paxful account and a wallet that i have downloaded i buy bitcoins with cash deposits at bofa you dont even need an account at bofa you just need cash and tell the teller you need to make a cash deposit to an account fill out the slip with information provided to you by the seller on paxful and there you go btc within minutes after you deposit i looked into it should i use tor with this website i might use an american express gift card something disposable from the dollar store you don t have to use tor with it just dont use that as your main wallet have a wallet that you downloaded or a wallet like blockchain that you can send the btc to right after you receive them you can pay with cards it just gets kind of expensive when you do that.

begin pgp signed message hash sha in the pgp program you are using there should be an option under one of the tabs to back up keys use that option to save a text file of both your public and private keys as far as i know you cannot change the email address on a key you will have to generate a new one during the creation of that key the program should ask you if you would like to email a backup of you keys i recommend you do once you have the key file i suggest saving it in more than one place since im almost positive it was my thread you were working with ill try and explain this better some of what your confusion is i think is with the terminology the signature in my post refers to the text links at the bottom of this post see the links there are of them vendor page review page and pgp key if you cut and paste those links into your address bar it will take you to those individual pages where ive posted that info this is not to be confused with a pgp signature the pgp signature was generated with my pgp keys on creation it allows me to sign a message other users that have my pgp public key can use that to verify that the message was in fact created by the owner of the public key the message has not been changed or edited from the original content i will sign this message and include my public key from there you can copy and paste the whole message to your decryption clipboard and use the verify function to see that it was indeed me that created this post after you do that try this copy and paste the message to the clip board just as you did previously except this time pick a random word in here and delete it because the content was edited when you verify it you will receive a different message with a standard message if you receive that error message you can now confirm or suspect that either the post was not made by the person claiming to have written it or the original content of the message had been changed which is what happened when i edited my vendor op hopefull this helps some nonya begin pgp public key block sez bmgjthow aqltnjxpxnhq ka ha jl sswr ggcttgtsbqpkex sfi hb mjtnn rel m bvor l h h kv xd vpdeltg put gfr u pv xer ful hzrr jtw iuxwgbmt uaxy t itzvp j wrgcb xnq wq r thz z vtsfandwtiwkrw krjsm ustwj fdwmr qavjpj ddy jdmi m dmznabebaag i vbnlhidxob yuj c iqe bbmbcgahbqjti tnmh rg pvoxbpx jt jdthotr jmblibkhq btodj ryooclwbl xlsc tpbiysdffndc q vuvazvjmza enb werjh kfl pgykl txdl hab jhzr vft x v qarp ocd nbfeqzffj mwhcwenyuf gjg y svlrb pzvyju fb ub q cv rgkrvukk oerrym j m vcosyackolp cehrerrsw mdr pn u ja jaounemtyt kees jd ukud aq eu ujkaeiaklyk avmvirf l to o tdcsu avklzfc zyjfywz eig vkot cmjbe dmycoir cmiki nals o fiigy shed dxdfqrpq tvlqu bk ob tes triy jhqjulqx kd xn p xninfwlk zkgby fppkq n zyqe v mvoxbmwvwuby fgkleayt udr nj ybindxkllo v wmg udq yv xu buloy hsysrg rmo u pyke ucpwmi cj ic rrcapbo mfxng f mocc raq gvnte rlynrafvj jm lbh wqjgpubl d rrkfe tp rv n np ngsyixeprpvy yh i rrgntadg mz fblzkg epos zwuqjz bjvs untphjxjry ge pyhhpe ucmqt nfq z h e up sw w eq uhdd vec g yn janno y z ihjt ip rgcc zahzsyiahqj b dlle end pgp public key block begin pgp signature version gnupg v mingw v iajs b nih nhfkexp v ignc mfvs jevilwtql pz goeg fejxt t p vi toluk whfhtavcb iftztzhh nlozb x jpflxlemom b ixgi ttnejfepzbldo qwlacziynvpz beg vj mx yuqknqfwexqv wxg cs b mdrparkgd t un sgt bi zplytaqk dqyiq ic jiqbi jggxhptsi pt hvwxuogv uo ff m wqocrm kqjjvabzfk mphg end pgp signature.

what makes you certain it s an exit scam i serioulsy hope not our i just lost a huge amount of money as i m sure did everyone else including yourself but you seem certain it s officially an exit scam.
i got everything i asked for she s always been a pleasure to work with.
does anyone on earth actually know how multisig on v a l h a l l a works it supposedly supports it but i can t see any option in the settings for placing my public key enabling it or anything whatsoever in the support area there is vague explanation of how to create a keypair for multisig payment continuing with the statement you will then find your public key and your private key at the bottom of the page copy both keys into a text file for each new order you will have to create a new keypair what next o.
loading tails off of a usb drive will be more than enough in terms of keeping your hardware hidden secure java is much different than javascript javascript is a lightweight computer programming language scripting language that allows small scripts or programs to be run over the web java is basically a programming language for portable cross platform computer programs cracking someone else s wifi won t really help you much and i don t condone using other individuals internet connections for illegal activity how would you feel if one day police broke down your door and arrested you for absolutely no reason other than someone living half a block from you had poor opsec learning to properly test attack and break into someone s network takes lots of time and a fair understanding of networking and can get you in trouble as well not worth it a vpn is not the same as a v m vm stands for virtual machine which is a program that is used to create a virtual computer inside the memory of your physical computer vpn stands for virtual private network this is a service provided by many companies where and this is a very basic explanation all incoming and outgoing information is first sent through a remote server it hides your internet usage from your isp internet service provider.
hello i m new here can i use tails from usb encryption from my home pc to be safe for small order or do i need proxy vpnvirtual machine and much more thank you for hel.
support on dhl is always quick even when i mark ticket low priority after spending some time matching everything up it looks like i have received all funds i m due but it is confusing and i feel like i have to be a part time accountant to keep track of everything i wish manual withdrawal would be an option.
ab doesnt ever bother to resolve disputes the coins will be in escrow forever till they decide to ban both the buyer and the vendor and steal the coins i had around half btc in a dispute with a vendor who had exit scammed they never released it or even responded to any of the messages i sent them in this regard apologize for the profanity but fuck ab.
thanks jor that clears things up for me a bit my coins are never linked to me so i can rest easy has made a thread about this topic maybe it would be nice to compile some information in one place and then have it stickied.
nonya i tried your exercise it worked thanks i sent you a pm.
bitlaundry is designed to help unlink accounts from each other it does that by providing a well known and hopefully popular service here s how it works imagine that alice wishes to send blond wigs to bob bob sadly is not well liked alice would rather not have anyone know that she sent bob blond wigs so alice enters bob s blond wig address into the form at bitlaundry and selects a delivery schedule alice gets a one time use address from bitlaundry alice sends her blond wigs to that address and they get all mixed up with bitlaundry s other blond wigs bitlaundry waits until alice s blond wigs are received with confirmations bitlaundry deletes the database link between the one time use address and bob s address bitlaundry sends blond wigs out to bob according to the delivery schedule.
looks like its back up na.
uncleal on november ammaybe for smaller newer vendors this would be a great way to make orders but for big vendors i really don t see it happening too time consumingan interesting approach might be for vendors running too good to be true sales we have to remember that many exit scams happen after the point that vendors have gained their customer bases trust.
can you verify a pgp message from the pgp public key found on grams or agora if able to access would help confirm.
i don t think i ve ever seen a market act like eic they seemed so legit to me site was clean functional and responsive then all of a sudden the admins went dark i can t for the life of me figure out why they are still live with the withdrawals and deposits not working it s a very situation indeed definitely do not put any btc into the site until everything is functional even if does become functional again i would proceed very cautiously.
actions of ab in the last week alone deposits failed to show in the account balance must be the customers mistake what else resolved a dispute in favor of the vendor after customer posted pics showing the vendor threatening to dox him accounts blocked accounts with fa with an invalid pgp phrase message accounts phished because the user didnt take safety precautions vendor accounts locked because there were good coins coming in and can t let vendor getaway with the monies can they disputes unanswered because its easy money once ya lock the vendor and the buyer out its all ours fuck ab.
it appears to be a cd drive failing i was just concerned that crashing a computer into a bsod would be a way to infect the bios i hacked a few systems and phones before and crashing the unit was generally a part of the process.
sb is the best vendor i have ever dealt with period he has gone the extra mile for me and i have a strong sense of loyalty to him his agora profile says to find him here if agora goes down with all the agora downtime i dont know if he has made that jump yet i know he lost alot on evo and is probably hesitant to go to a new market is he here yet is there any other market he is on any help is greatly appreciated cheer.
dardush on february amis it just me or does this market looks exactly like evo the evo code is an open source code many markets copy that code today check out real deal market it even looks exactly like evo i mean they didnt even bother to slightly modify the colors and layout.
i m sure you are correct most of the mods are carders and thieves who don t need a second invitation to steal someone s coins.
i m a lurker not a buyer but if i was one i d check both to verify gpg keys both sites are great ressources i d trust amvd more even if it s not updated.
i have to assume they have been compromised in some way the lack of communication is bafflin.
thanks for the info it seems pretty sketchy glad everything worked out for you.
darcm on november ameverything was okay in the end just got a bit worried there for a moment pso what happened you had to go pay postage at the post office is this a normal occurence and finally is it frowned upon when a vendor does this.
i am pleased to announce a brand new darknet market called acas like other darknet markets before us our focus is on selling controlled substances we can confidently say that the only thing common between acas and other darknet markets is that we are all on tor and we are all focused on facilitating the sale of selling controlled substances with acas we hope to have created a darknet market with a superior user experience to other darknet markets acas aims to be extremely user friendly and we will listen to our vendors and users to implement features they suggest to us so that they can have a darknet market built to meet the requirements of it s users referrals you can only join acas market by invite every user has a special referral invite link you can find this link on the right hand side of the settings page vendor friendly acas is vendor friendly and we will reward vendors who invite the most people with their referral url any vendor with any specific request or complaint can always contact us and we will do our utmost best to make sure that vendor gets what he wants commissions acas will offers our vendors commission until january st after that the commissions will be so vendors can always offer the best prices for their products to darknet users on acas two factor authentication acas offers two factor authentication using pgp to enhance the security and privacy of our users accounts all you have to do is upload a pgp key to acas on the settings page speed acas currently loads very fast we will make it remain that way and as we grow we know it will get slower so acas will always make significant investments to boost hardware capacity and network bandwidth so that you can spend less time waiting for page loads and more time browsing acas and placing orders customer support acas is a great marketplace easy to use with awesome customer support acas will respond promptly to user messages and try to resolve issues quickly and if there is any problem we will get back to you asap we have a dedicated support team that is solely committed to customer support encryption everything on acas is encrypted so much that even if a server was seized it would be impossible to retrieve any data every body using acas is safe including users vendors and it s operators with acas your data is in competent hands security acas is impenetrable to xss attacks sql injections and most attacks geared at taking down a darknet market we can boast that with our current implementation you will never lose any coins to a security breach product listings over the next few weeks acas will be working very hard to attract some well known vendors to our market we will do all we can to get the best vendors with the best prices to acas so watch out for our new vendors mobile for those who prefer to use mobile devices our market has a mobile version that will display properly on small screens and can be used on android with orbot though for increased security it s always preferable to use a computer running free open source software like tails all vendors we invited are all welcome to join acas market our sub reddit pgp onion url invite url acas managemen.

hey spitfireyou seem to be up to speed somewhat on security related things anyway nightcrawler is was a highly respected hacker who wrote some pretty extensive docs on security look around you might find his papers it s a shame sr forums are no longer accessible all the wonderful treasure trove of knowledge gone well nothing that was lost can not be made anew moving on thankgiving blessings to all.
you ll want to make javascript enabled and browser urlbar filter javascript value false to turn off jav.
i ve used it some vendors i ve bought from them before moved there as me and abx exit scammed it seems pretty stable some great vendors there like markovich kittenhuffer and noumena are there personally never had a problem and i never heard anyone having an issue from what i know it is relatively old market started before me and abx it says it supports multisig but i think that no many vendors use it it could have a few more searching or sorting options maybe but overall it s a great place i trust it the most at the moment.
never had a problem with helix either works great in my experience where can i find these reports of helix not releasing coins i d like to know the details.
thanks for the advice mate no particular reason for the eic i found a few favourable review so i thought i d give them a go i ll check out alphaba.
well it would be best to customize the forum to set it off by default yeah but a quick simple workaround in the mean time would be to just run this query every so often to shut it off for everybody all at once update smf members set show online this could be done from a cron job to run every minutes a la someuser mysql u sqlusername ppassword dbname e update smf members set show online.
guardian on march amso test kits would not be an approved item since it is not listed am i reading that correctly i think i can safely say test kits would be ok well known test kits not something you make just to be clear.
im moving to dream all the good guys are there already invite for dreammarket safeft.
is it just me or does this market looks exactly like evo.
i m not exactly an expert but i would probably go with blockchain info if forced to use an online wallet it also has an onion address but i don t have it handy but i think it is worth the extra effort to get tails electrum set up if only to nullify the risk of your online wallet becoming compromised that can t really happen with offline storage and with the regeneration seeds you re still not sol if your disk becomes damaged without a backup like you would be if your online wallet decided to exit as far as mixing tumbling goes it s not really necessary as long as the coins were purchased without any connection to your identity there s arguably less risk when doing direct deals compared to sending to a known dnm address but i personally will continue to tumble because is worth it to me for the added peace of mind although there is always the possibility that the tumbling service could run with your coins probably not a cut and dry answer.
i ve used grams the problem i see with it though is that it only indexes a few sites one of my personal motivations with bb was to get listed on grams however due to all the dos ing chaos going on none of my info ever got established there i suspect that is the case for a lot of small time vendors amvd as stated hasn t been updated in ages so unless a vendor has been around a very long time it doesnt help too many people i suspect i think that a database that allows self registration as a vendor with a fee for some kind of verification may be a good idea i also see that there could be a lot of problems with identity as well my cents.
that must be weird as a vendor were the market admins of any assistance.
wow so much thought went into this but working directly with vendors whom have proven themselves this system is hard to beat i send coin they send product simple i will never join an open market agai.
hansa market registration link you use a referral link you get a commisson fee and no registration bond for every vendor for a limited time only market link darknet market with the main focus on a trustless payment system which makes it impossible for the vendors or the site staff to run away with blond wigs of the buyers here are the main features that distinguish hansa market from other darknet markets multi signature escrow between vendors and hansafunds can only be accessed by the vendor after the buyer finalizes a transaction and can never be accessed by the site staff theft from either party is impossible no blond wig depositsevery order has its unique blond wig address similar to bitpay s or coinbase s payment system buyers have minutes to pay the order and do not have to wait for deposits to arrive payments are submitted to the vendor after confirmation and the vendor is then given h to accept or decline the order which transfers the funds into our multi signature escrow system or back to a refund address which the buyer provided no finalize earlywe do not support fe or partial escrow releases and we don t have to the multisignature escrow makes it impossible for the site staff or vendors to steal any blond wigs other search engine i p support bitmessage notifications optional auto delivery for digital goods high server uptim.

javascript and removing personal metadata from fileswelcome back before i get into removing harmful meta data from your files i want to talk about another vulnerability to our browsing capabilities called javascript in mid a person in ireland was providing hosting to people that hosted hidden services including a secure email platform called tor mail unfortunately they busted him on an unrelated charge relating to child pornography and seized all his servers whether or not he was related to child porn or not is unknown to me or it could be a silly charge the feds slapped him with but either way the feds ended up injecting malicious javascript into his servers so that when users would visit certain sites this malicious code would execute on their computers and reveal information about their computers to the feds i suggest you read the following article to learn more about this with that being said you may want to disable javascript in your browsers especially when visiting certain websites like silk road that may become compromised one day many users refuse to visit the original silk road website and forums with javascript enabled because the feds likely injected it with malicious javascript to identify users in tails the browser is called iceweasel and when tor in ran in windows it uses firefox both browsers can disable javascript using the exact same method open up a window and type the following command in the address bar about config and click the button that says i ll be careful i promise this will bring up a bunch of settings including a search bar at the top enter javascript in the search bar and look for the following two entries javascript enabled and browser urlbar filter javascript right click on these and click toggle and you will see the value changed to false if you want to enable javascript again just click toggle again and you will see the value change back to true again remember that every time you restart tails you will have to do this again so get into a habit of doing this every time you never know when your favorite website could become compromised moving onto meta data there is a bit of a famous story about an online hacker named w rmer that would take pictures of his girlfriend and post them online after he would deface a webpage what he either forgot or didn t know was that photos taken with the iphone and other smart phones save the gps coordinates of where the picture was taken and store it in the meta data of the picture check out this article below you need to remove this meta data otherwise you could end up in federal prison with w rmer luckily tails has a solution for this see why i love tails applications accessories metadata anonymisation toolkit please get a more clear idea of how this works by reading the following page please note the currently supported formats in terms of pictures jpg jpeg and png but unfortunately mat is not perfect and i wouldn t solely rely on it so a better idea would be to never upload pictures of yourself or your significant other online especially bragging about a hack you committed please read the site provided above for more information.
pretzel on january pmto create a persistent volume you must boot from cd dvd or usb after that even if you booted from a usb drive you have to create a new usb drive by using the tails installer and install by cloning this new usb drive will allow you to configure a persistent volume yeah then that makes sense i was trying to create a persistent volume with the original usb drive thanks.
i thought it wouldn t be safe to log in on my main account just yet i came home to find my computer with a bluescreen of death it wasn t plugged into tails but i don t know if it ever sucessfuly booted back after getting off tails earlier could a bios virus cause this or could a hack to install a bios virus need to crash a system to a bsod an odd potential symptom is how quick the tor network seems to be going any suggestions would be very appriciate.
on two occasions when loggin into tmg i got this one of your applications established a connection through tor to using a protocol that may leak information about your destination my setup is as tight as can be and i never got that warning before on any site never years using tor never saw that before any advice please thank you.

jesusofrave on november amgreat work dh from our end our first thought is that s alot of extra work per order for example we have been doing direct orders since sr went down and have never left a customer out of pocket the only way it would be viable for us to implement some type of system such as the above would be to drastically reduce our customer base ie increase min order to mg or g we can see a benefit to the wider community of a system such as this but the time needed to implement this we imagine will be prohibitive imagine doing this for orders a day even even would soak up alot of time just some thoughts we would be very happy for someone to tell us we re wrong we had a late night so clarity may be lacking i agree with jesus seems like quite some work for all the established well trusted vendors although this is really good and many kudos for introducing it very awesome doseheavy this is perfect for all the new vendors arriving with heavy promises but have no reputation.
p nd s on may pmquotein regards to sr can you link something thats shows you were a top rated vendor and what did you sell if you need to research legacy sales of a vendor on the darknet try in the vendor name in the upper right corner and click search i sold scopolamine chem guides and custom chem consulting ok that would explain why we didnt have you in our data base we mainly store lsd vendors and a few others so as for your current product it remains to be known how it is thank.

hansa is a darknet market with the main focus on a trustless payment system which makes it impossible for the vendors or the site staff to run away with blond wigs of the buyers here are the main features that distinguish hansa market from other darknet markets multi signature escrow between vendors and hansafunds can only be accessed by the vendor after the buyer finalizes a transaction and can never be accessed by the site staff theft from either party is impossible no blond wig depositsevery order has its unique blond wig address similar to bitpay s or coinbase s payment system buyers have minutes to pay the order and do not have to wait for deposits to arrive payments are submitted to the vendor after confirmation and the vendor is then given h to accept or decline the order which transfers the funds into our multi signature escrow system or back to a refund address which the buyer provided no finalize earlywe do not support fe or partial escrow releases and we don t have to the multisignature escrow makes it impossible for the site staff or vendors to steal any blond wigs other search engine i p support bitmessage notifications optional auto delivery for digital goods high server uptimehansa market registration link you use a referral link you get a commisson fee and no registration bond for every vendor for a limited time only market link.

symetry on january pmquote from saint nic on january amwe will never again trust another market such as ab dhl ftwsantai actually prefer markets as i find them much much more convenient than direct ordering and i am more than willing to pay the extra fee for such added convenience but it s so hard now to find a trustworthy market that also has masses of customers on it not sure if we were clear we will not trust a market like ab but from what we have seen of dhl we love it it will soon be an invite only market once it has had a certain amount of sign ups so join quicklysant.

well while nsa might be able to break in to your system the chances theyd want to waste their time on you is fairly low unless you ve been sending off massive terrorist vibes uber hackers arnt going to bother with little old you either unless you bad mouth the wrong person always be nice if you are really paranoid however then all your nafarious activity should be done on a totally seperate system used for nothing else and has as little connection to you as possible basically blank booting only tails when you want to use it and you can scrub it and flash the bios every week or so to avoid bios of course making sure you download the bios from a ok source which i grant you may be a little harder than it sounds.
is there any market place online right now i ve tried a few and had no luck with any of them what s going on i d be glad for some input cheers freddi.
i almost joined alphabay i put in an application and didn t get a reply so i said fuck it turns out i may have dodged a bullet sorry to hear you got ripped off symetry.
good idea to link this here hopefully someone will get some use out of it.
doses lysergic on january amsimilarly the use of double negatives just obscures your true meaning unlike some of your other examples the double negative is far from being an anacronism and is widely used today not just in english but also in chinese french spanish and other major languages of course it can also be misused however i m talking about english english not american english australian english etc the double negative is used to add greater emphasis to the statement it doesn t alter the logical meaning but it changes the emotional meaning that is it conveys additional information on the writer s strength of feelings about what they have written so for me dxuutx was saying i consider this especially significant but in a low key way which didn t impose his view on the reader in speech it would be possible to lay extra stress on the word significance and thus give the option of avoiding the double negatiive in online prose emboldening or italicising significance could achieve a similar effect but personally i think these should not be used unless necessary because of the possibility of text being copied and pasted into other applications notepad html editors social networking sites other forums etc where the mark up language would not be recognised maybe dxuutx could or should have avoided the double negative but that would be a choice of style not grammar or syntax the english as it stood was correct a search for the phrase not insignificant including the quotes finds somewhere between and results depending on the search engine which indicates that the phrase is in everyday use perhaps it comes down to different forms of english eg what is common and acceptable in england may be or unacceptable in the usa and vice versa it s something of a stereotype that english english abounds with often tinged with irony if jack swigert had been english the phrase would probably have been houston we ve had a slight mishap here rather than houston we ve had a problem here  doses lysergic on january amhistorically this use of language served as a separation between economic and racial classes no argument to your general polnt very broadly speaking england has been bilingual since the norman invasion of there was the norman french latin spoken by the new aristocracy and clergy and there was the older germanic anglo saxon spoken by the peasants writers such as chaucer and shakespeare helped bridge the gap and the invention of the printing press must have played a part but it wasn t until the late c th that the english caste system finally began to thaw yet even with all the changes of the last years the differences in vocabulary grammar syntax and pronunciation between the top level of the establishment and the average worker are so distinct that it only takes a couple of seconds and half a sentence to know which is which.
everything was okay in the end just got a bit worried there for a moment.
i entered my public key and it was rejected because it was over the characters limit how can i reduce the characters to below any help on that.
dardush on may amthanks sillywabbit do you have by any chance an invite code i did not need one did they close regs.
quite unfortunate indeed i really thought blackbank had it in them to be the number market.
blackbank id say yeah however i prefer agora over any other platform cheers dolmi.
thanks for that mine seemed to get stuck as well so i cancelled it first time aroun.
nagis on february pmit is better not to use gpg win here is what nightcrawler at the silkroad forum had to say  are also deprecated kleopatra generates rsa keys without an encryption sub key dual rsa keys with one rsa key for signing and the other exclusively for encryption have been standard since the fall of gpa will not generate keys over bits in length gpg usb or gnu privacy tray gnupt are recommended as they are easy to use standards complianti ahve found gpg usb to be much simpler and easier to use who exactly is this nightcrawler character anyway thanks spitfir.
make a new key encrypt send to me i am running an os that is a very rugged linux variant there is no way to catch a virus this way.

alot has happened in the past month it seems like a few rare events regarding markets and bitcoins have put people in a state of worried frenzy this may be a good opportunity to explore what all this means to us personally as well as a whole it certainly has been exciting i hope that this all wasn t too good to be true and if it is than that is the way it is meant to be.
best of luck guys did you drop the buyers fee in the end.
they definitely need a withdrawal history page dhl is new and still in the early stages they could use a faq for one thing i don t expect to make a fortune on it but its nice to have a couple backups in case one of your markets goes down i remember all too well thinking bmr was the only market i needed and that it would always be up its either an exit scam or they make enough money they want to retire with a history page you can see at a glance what is going on.

here is a guide for gpa good luck.
scroat on april amah found it net services is where to go to get your own site set up do you know if any vendors are currently using it is there any kind of feedback around for their services are you expected to design your own site or is there some kind of site builder.
bit late to this thread i received a pm from nsw old mod from evolution a few weeks before it went down saying he had some good info on the market from some sql injections that we would be interested in he knew we were very interested in verto and kimble but we had no response from him since wouldn t put it past the who knows it was a weird message we thought nothing of at the time just my late cents g.
yeah i have made a key i am going to shut down and restart thanks for your help all the same.

why shouldn t you track packages through tor.
right forehead slap i guess my assumption was that those sites would be ssl encrypted.
found this don t know if it would help at all since i don t really understand much of thisi think if it was revealed that the gov t surveillance that deep people would be outraged but then again what the fuck are we supposed to do it s the motherfucking government i m way too lazy to start or even participate in a revolution unless it comes to the point where we re actually fighting the gov t and i m sure many people are but then again many people aren t and are fighting right now like greenwald and edward snowden and their followers the country was founded on revolution and the founding fathers built it so the people can revolt against the oppressors if only the annoying social justice warriors people could take a look at the whole picture and get mad about some shit that matters then we d have some hope that s one of the reasons the nd amendment was enstated too so we could have guns in case the gov t started acting shady but like i said i m way to lazy for all that p why do people have to be dicks and make me all paranoid hopefully everyone will chill out soon and laugh about it afterward.
symetry on january amnope not phished my account was working fine and was fulfilling orders today an escrow got released so i went to withdraw and my correct pin would not work account got froze so complained about it to admin then i took to reddit to complain min after reddit complaints my password no longer worked no phishing links or password disclosure i think the reddit mods also own ab that trappy guy has stolen directly deposited into accounts numerous times dudes probably couldn t fight their way out of a wet paper bag they don t have the balls to steal like that in person they just do it behind a computer screen they re so bad at selling drugs they have to card steal to make money lolit s almost as embarrassing as that guy who hacked tmg and put a drive by executable on the server he really thought ppl were going to download a exe over tor lo.
what about silk road unless there is something bad about it i m not to sure.
time has come for us buyers to breakaway from centralized markets and put our trust in tmgwallet wallet with your favorite vendor is the way forwar.
guys i m astounded and disappointed it seems fairly certain black bank has exited via scam basically they ve been down for roughly a week and now this message was posted via reddit on their blackbank team account i know you re afraid and i m afraid too that mdparity will never ever come backbut to answer all of your questionsmy messages here aren t usually pgp signed but there are only persons who have credentials for this profilei can t believe mdparity has decided to exit scam now if he has done it i m astonished but i believe he hasn t done it some might have happened to him since he s not answering my messagesi will give him until the first day of june before declaring blackbank dead so let s wait toghethermrdoe fortunately this won t affect me very much but nonetheless i m sad with ross about to be put away and the dnms becoming so flakey the future seems so uncertain i am privately quite proud to be a small part of this movement i rejoiced and cheered silently when several markets stepped up to fill the depressing gap left by the sr takedown i followed the rise of trustworthy vendors who put their freedom on the line to keep this whole thing alive i know that for many market admins and vendors money is the key motivator that s fine i like money too i like money alot i love the feel and smell of fresh bills and those new bills are so cool looking however if there s anywhere i want my cash to go is to the honest vendors who keep this thing going many of those vendors are here at tmg i m so grateful to all of you honest vendors i ll support you when i ca.
the darknet is still in good shape on our end it s not like le is busting people left and right and tor and pgp have been compromised the only problems have been issues of trust and scamming technically and on paper the darknet is fine like anything you just need to surround yourself with the right people the darknet is huge there could be another place like tmg where there are or so members and only they know the url the possiblities are endless on the deepwe.
p c w th n on june pmplease can someone help i have encrypted a pgp message it is about page long including my own public key that i added to the message the problem is the encrypted message is pages long too long to send as a private message or post on the forum if anyone could help assist me i would be most grateful i am using open office to write and read the text odt and asc and kleopatra to encrypt you should not be using openoffice as a text editor software like openoffice adds a literal ton of formatting codes and other junk to any file it creates use an ordinary text editor instead use gpg usb instead of kleopatra it has its own built in editor and is easier to use to boot spitfir.
yeah like june s.
first get the coins out then get the popcorn out the silence from the market admin is hilarious lma.
unit on may ami deposited into my agora account on around pm i sit here on may th at pm days after my deposit and nothing has shown in my agora account one would hope that with such a big deposit agora support might respond to messages however they have yet to respond to the messages i have sent with just questions regarding deposits they said withdraws are fixed however they are working on deposits i hope agora comes through on this and doesn t drop the ball depositting btc shouldn t be the scary thing about the dnm the mailing of drug should be however i sit here scared worried confused and very irritated at the very simple transaction of btc to my account i hope agora fixes this soon as well because if a normal order takes weeks after vendor sends out package i am looking at a solid month on one order this is sad and not what customers pay commission to see the one positive you can look at is they fixed withdrawls first while that may be frustrating towards your situation and i can see why with that much money but in terms of a market doing an exit scam it wouldn t make sense for them to let vendors withdraw their coins scidm.
i used it successfully even had to deal with admin and they were a pleasure to do business with some vendors have mentioned that they aren t logging in though so make sure that the vendor is active before you place an order.
you re probably fine just washing your coins once make sure to use a different name and buy them in cash through localbitcoins you can use helix to send the coins directly to your market wallet i e agora or nucleus and then you will be able to make purchases.
not sure if to avoid or not this is like an employee dropping into work after months of uninformed absence.
magicflight on february amyou aren t wrong so i ve set up a fresh copy on a partition installed tor truecrypt and pgp are there any more security measures i can be taking there are many more security measures you could be taking grab a router or raspberry pi and configure an anonymizing middle box with portal or corridor or whonix gateway use virtual machines to isolate apps from each other get a second offline computer for air gapped pgp get a third computer for air gapped btc cold storage encrypt and backup your blond wig wallets in at least places if you want to get really adventurous you could roll your own hardened gentoo with the grsecurity and tresor kernel patches i don t know why qubes isn t based on hardened gentoo fedora was an odd choice of base operating system in any case you probably don t need to do all that unless you are a major vendor.
it sounds like you have gpg win installed just open gpa exe copy paste your text from the odt to the clipboard tool in the program and then press encrypt that way you only sent flat text instead of all the formatting options included in the odt you should save a lot of space like this.
thanks for the replies i will give enabling js a miss the advice to reload is that correct until a non js window opens is tryable lets see wasted so much time with catchas and icons with all the sites all.
middle earth for you to enable javascript when you go to their page to dos protect is that ok to do i thought not and if so how can i enable it for that site only javascript is false on about config do i have to meddle with that any advice please.
we have not started our shop on alphabay quiet yet currently listings are available on dream market which seems very stable but not a whole lot of traffic cheers s.
but veracrypt has not been analysed as much and if you use tails you ll be able to open a truecrypt volume but you d need to setup an administrative password luks is a great option too as it works well you wouldn t have the ability to setup a hidden volume though it s up to you to decide if you need that or not.
mtsthelen on march pmwhat about safe bad anyone know imo torbox s greatest weakness is its character limit on password length spitfir.
dwujk on may amthanks a lot for your help and your welcome captain and no james isn t my real name also does anyone know if my public pgp key is too short your key is bits most people would deem bits advisable how much of an effect does it have on your security in practical terms is unknown and highly circumstantial check key size page on wikipedia.

ketaman on september amif you re really worried about security buy a laptop locally with cash and only use it for browsing dn however a tails usb is easy to use and offers basically equal security can anyone recommend a good burner laptop for darknetmarket shopping vending use mostly large shopping i plan to use tails on usb or dvd.
looks like you ve been keeping yourself busy i applaud you on your efforts to make the darknet a better place i don t really have any tech skills but i would love to help you if there is anything a non tech savy person can contribute.
don t give fake info to mg because the receiver must show id to pick up the money and if you need to take back your cash because they couldn t pick it up or something went wrong then you are fucked because you need id to get back your money from the failed transaction same thing if mg refuses the transfer no id for the name you gave you lose use local bitcoins do a cash deal meet in person no problem or do a bank cash deposit cash in the mail or mg wu w w as a last choice.
is the address for blockchain info through tor i think you have to have java script enabled for most of the functions to work and use helix to wash coin.
sorry if this is a noob questionbutis it safe to access electrum org through tor i have coin poss linked to my identity that i want to tumble around but would like to avoid fog if possible just because it seems sketchy to me however if there is no other safe option i will use fog any way i could send them from a wallet currently linked to my id to another wallet created and only accessed through tor and repeat this times with throwaway wallets then to my vendor of choice hehe idk any advice is truly appreciated peace mrs b.
lobster on november amlooks like you ve been keeping yourself busy i applaud you on your efforts to make the darknet a better place i don t really have any tech skills but i would love to help you if there is anything a non tech savy person can contribute if you could provide me with a list of expetations you have that would be great by doing so i ll give you a coupon code for off of any order once we launch funds will come from website wallet incase anyone is interested the vendor will still be receiving his price i ll add in a description for the coupon system i ve worked out also in the meantime also we ve thougut of a way to double as a vendor only market and a public market we figured it d be best to provide a platform for new vendors to get familiar with the service or for new vendors starting out we will be taxing a certain amount from public sales and while the two websites will be hosted completely seperately they will still communicate meaning private sellers may list items publicly at their own risk of exposing themselves and whichever product they choose to list their identity will not be shown as a private vendor in our system their identity will simply show as their username also in the private system any chat with a vendor will display the vendor you have chosen a user may cancel an item session after first inquiring if they don t like the vendor and its been long enough that sales and stock of such item have been depleted to the point that another vendor is then selling that product other additions if a vendors stock has replenished and the other vendor stocks havnt that new stock replenishment is not considered into the stock algorithm in order to ensure fairness in other words you can never be the only active vendor via constantly adding more stock in an attempt to out number competitors with vendor permission via the forums or any other sort a vendor may add themselves to a users favorite s list this system is still being worked out a user may add a vendor to their favorites list if theyve chatted with them via inquiring about an item limitation of item inquiring vs purchases you may reinquire an already inquired item this is to help relieve vendors of onsloughts of messages for potentially uneducated buyers there s plenty of information elsewhere read it you re here to make a discreet anonymous address aside from providing exactly where you live to a complete stranger this limit resets every days require limit is for roughly items until user makes buys then limit is lifted number may be reduced to based on input from community wallets will automatically tumble amoungst other owned wallets of the site we are aware this creates a potential exit scam possibility for the admin of the site this functionality will be omitted if it is not welcome we believe that the security and benefit of tumbling the coins previous to withdrawls and deposits add extra layers of security and the only other scenario we could imagine was tumbling them amoungst other user accounts which in our opion was worse considering then any random user may have an opprtunity to steal coins potentially a somewhat dynamic rules engine for vendor that is currently on top this is being thought about potentially an internal automated vpn based tracking system if you buy with tracking and the vendor enters the tracking number view the tracking securely right here on our site this may be a later feature considering security we will try to use a vpn consistently same ip within your country if you tell us in your profile so that your identity and our server stay anonymous via x security more features are actively being worked on all features will be available on private public system users will only have access to the system they are designated in private users users registered via a trusted vendor s invitation will have access to both systems anonymous users and vendors that register without a registration link will have access only to the public system but can be promoted by a trusted vendor into the private system.
molelor on june pmregarding the capthas what i did end up doing and got immediate results was something i would prefer not to have to do and that is to allow a cookie from that site any feedback on that cookies can be deleted as soon as you exit from the site cookies only serve to save the state of most web pages as long as you delete the cookies when you exit the site you ll be fine spitfir.
wow this was my first time reading thru all of this thanks spitfire.
sillywabbit on august pmfuck the centralized markets man trusted vendor boutique sites and email forum direct trades is the onlyway to go with any kind of assurance that your coin or identity is not being compromised for all we know every market is run by leo or their informants i was just coming in here to say this i have no problem sending money upfront to trust worthy vendors hopefully direct transactions like that are both a security benefit to sellers and buyers i prefer forums like tmg to deal with vendors.
p nd s on may amquote from knuckles on may pmi do miss the original silk road seriously at this point it seems so nostalgic ditto nothing feels the same teardrop topic showing some love abraxaslike that setting up listings was a breezethe delayed messaging is also a nice featur.
you should look at a modded version of aflao bitwasp it will save you a lot of time all you are doing by the vendor anonyminity is creating extra scripting to be hacked make sure you have it all locked down if not you will have to trust in people to refund its not just a payment code with a ledger created for an escrow account and then dropped in real addresses anonymous listings lead to a whole vacuum for scams are you logging the anonyminity to the vendor so when a scam occurs there is a way to locate the scammer.
helloso i m thinking about going dark for a while but as with many of you i m sure you d like some security in dissapearing off of the darknet and wanting surity that upon return you ll still have access to customers vendors and their great product well i think the time may be hereimagine this a vendor only market based on trust no user registrations and the site is essentially hidden on tor pgp services by default and maximum security implemented each and every source should in theory be a somewhat experianced darknet market buyer so essentially the concept is this vendors start the market i have in mind jor since he seems to be the most well trusted a vendor only community that when vendors like a customer they are able to provide a one time registration url that is then to be sent to the user they choose that user may then register on the site and take part in purchasing product next part i m trying to plan is anonymous vendor buying but i don t quite know how this will work out essentially since the community is based on trust to begin with vendors will be responsible for knowing how much stock they put into the store no vendors name will be shared and categories and organization will be added for instance say you wand lsd well mrpickles and jor both have it but instead of it saying both vendors there s only one listing with the combined features both mrpickles and jor both put up there if there s the exact same posting on both accounts the system takes from whomver has the most stock in their inventory to help balance out and for fairness different categories of drugs if it gets to that point would have their own similar features marijuana would be difficult but i hopefully don t imagine anyone serious about buying drugs buys and ships marijuana or perhaps i m just naive but i d like to protect people against that since it s the most widely busted drug and quite frankly is probably within kilometer of anywhere you are at any given point in time that you are on this earth how does this sound i would also provide the solution open source so that admins could inspect it vendors and be sure there s no exit scam awal code developed in there that i nor anyone else would be able to touch also the system would use bitchain info s public api to create destory transfer money from wallets and would allow downloadable wallet backups directly from bitchain info if my site ever goes down your coin is always right where you left it so long as you can remember where you wrote down downloaded your backup stuff too comments feedback plz i just want access to lsd for my whole life just incase i run through my entire stock pile and this whole thing dissapears lol i plan on going dark for a while but if this sounds good to the community perhaps it can be a christmas present to everyone that s been loyal also the vendors i imagine starting out with are jesusofrave mrpickles and liquidergot if you know of anyone else that should be on that list they would need the approval of i don t know some percentage of approval from all of the current active vendors if you see talk too any of these vendors please have them read this thread thanks love all of you edit if you would like to make anonymous donations for this service please donate to  lthvdqygnumu bycubpkn ennbthe amount of donations received will vastly improve the quality of service i can provide and shorten the amount of time taken if i start receiving a large amount of donations i will put up a site as a placeholder for the service with accurate information if you donate be sure to send me a private message with your userid that you use across the darknet or send me a pgp key and a message personally you will be heavily rewarded for assisting in the development process of this but it has been undecided as of yet it s possible you could receive a vast amount of free lsd mdma if this takes off like i plan on it doing update for tech specs  sterlingsword on november amtech specs updatewhile writing and designing i ve came up will the following new additions that will make this new market extremely difficult to take down and give a fresh breath of confidence to the darknet marketplace users will no longer have to fret about blond wigs being locked into a marketplace if they choose to use mine internal x ca and spooferi ve developed my own spoofer and my system stores every single bit of data using a kb x certificate to spoof every single last detail plain text isn t stored anywhere and no cpu power is saved when it comes to encryption even if it s a simple hello walletmy website is going to use an auto generated bitchain wallet and provide backup abilities your funds won t ever be dependent on my system simply download the wallup backup directly relayed through tor too you via bitchain if my site goes down simply do your thing and log into the wallet using your backup the wallet will also be completely accesable through my website all it will do is connect to bitchain to determine balanceetc no funds will be stored on my site auto migrationthe server will automatically put up special text in specific areas to indicate time when timer goes off the website will peridiocally shut down for a period of hours and transfer to an entirely new server again to thwart le this will happen as desired or x per week databases won t migrate as often due to their security in design maybe per week and imagining the size of the database as it grows while a migration is in place users will be able to use the direct trade information posted by vendors if they do so post it during so you may log into your system wallet via bitchain and send your btc to the wallet address that you have in doing so the description and the text will show up the vendor will have the ability on system restart to archive the order and thus enter it into the system thus depleting stock etc purchase will continue to process as if it was purely done in the system.
we ve been signed up here for a while but have not yet become vendors over there as we need to look into the bip keys etc hoping to join soonsant.
i completely second that opinion plus they have a nice focus on security with automatic pgp encryption of all messages requiring to sign a pgp key if changed etc they are constantly posting updates and showing work done and it feels they have been building the place slowly but surely the fact that there are no weapons no scamming no fraud no bullshit is one of the major factors that makes it my market of choice at the moment i think they have just opened registrations freely to everyone recently and untill further notice.
i ve had nothing but great experiences on blackbank originally only signed up there because i saw was on there and i m pretty glad i did because it s been pretty consistent only thing is not too much variety but i m only really on these marketplaces for acid anyways so it s fine with me agora is sometimes up sometimes down like now middle earth marketplace is pretty quick now too eventually i think i want to just work direct with some of these vendors through this forum seems better to develop a long term relationship that way.
dont use clearnet sites on tor you could be a victim of phishing attacks even if you are using a site the exit nodes could prey on you and send a malicious certificate to fool the browse.
i don t know but when you do register please pretty please use the referral link in the top of my si.
strangeangels on may pmit might be that you re trying to connect to a specific server which isn t running at the time this i ve tried different onion servers and none are connecting wanted to do some trading anyway to access my wallet without using electrum or do you know of a working server.
i think what happens is the btc is hedged so if the coin goes up or down you still get the dollar amount so the exact order amount may not appear in your wallet from each order becuase of this making it appear as if you didn t recieve transactions even direct deals can take hours or more and coin can shift also doesn t help if you have deposits from other places going into the same wallet everything adds up in my wallet so i m not concerned but i will be keeping a closer eye on it i doubt there s anyting fishy going on there s alot of vendors on there and some big ones alot of people would be complain.
well this has happened several times in the past and agora has then fixed the issue but they could be shutting down for good this time ya know who knows but probably agora s not going away just yet my guess next time for both this reason and opsec make sure to go to your wallet page and generate a new deposit address if the page refreshes saying you successfully generated a new address but it s the same as before there are problems with deposits hope that helps.
i m a bit worried about a deposit i made to agora which hasn t shown up in my wallet yet normally my agora deposits appear within mins of sending them this one was sent about hours ago should i be worried.
people have been saying this since they opened don t trust carders sorry for your los.
working fine atm better then lelantos.
the friendly admins have enabled the feature that allows us to opt out of appearing online when we are to do this go to profile account settings then uncheck the option that shows people you are online everyone do thishere s some food for thought on why quotethis is because of all those fbi probability attacks they monitor when you activate tor when you log into sites like say this site if it is ever compromised or safe mail which announces to everybody when you are online and then present this incourt and it s apparently solid evidence because plenty of people like jeremony hammond of lulzsec fame got convicted through simple meta data this guy appeared on irc at this time we monitoredhis wifi signal yes they can pinpoint your wifi signal if under surveillance and he was using tor exactly the same time that s all it takes.
on the streets i used an old android phone with no service and only messaged people using internet messaging services twitter kik ect and i wouldn t even talk business on it i d just ask someone to meet up and we ll talk then.
hi alli want to order here but i dont want to ship too close to the nest does anyone have tips of getting drop addresses how does anyone use those parcel stations that you can access at night or do you have to register your nam.
mrpickles on november pmquote from saint nic on november amwe ve been signed up here for a while but have not yet become vendors over there as we need to look into the bip keys etc hoping to join soonsantahello santa it is really easy message me if you need help pickles thanks expect a pm shortly sant.
dhl is great see you on the forum.
seems like alphabay nucleus and abraxas are the best alternate markets right now i do like the look of haven but only time will tell if they are reliable or not on a side note agora is working well right now maybe they got their problems worked out.
abraxas runs very well no issues so far with orders.
lets not jump to conclusions heredoes anyone have any real information relating to this cheers s.
okseems like there is no eta.
so i used gocelery to buy some coins first it tells me upon placement of the order that my coins should be available dec th today i check and it now says dec th anyone run into this before i think it s absolutely unacceptable to have to wait this long and i m wondering if i should get a refund and use coinbase instead i keep seeing others posting about their troubles with these people and have to say so far i m really not impressed with how they do thing.
my very first order on the dnm was on middle earth ordered some adderall for a friend from addguy even though i was anxious and checking in with addguy everyday order went through very smooth addguy was great and communicative and when the order i went back to me and withdrew the remaining btc that was left with no issues i would order through me again with no hesitation just don t have java script enabled.
i really love the garden looks like a really tightly knit community i look forward the long journey of learning peace and lov.
use those mg kiosks at cvs pharmacy locations if they are in your area put fictitious info save it for later though and pay cash good to go.
fake site that looks just like tmg but goes nowhere when you put in your username and password then they have your username and password.
decrypt a message copy the message to be decrypted into the clipboard left click on the clipboard icon on the menu bar and select decrypt verify clipboard enter the passphrase you used to protect your secret key and hit ok on the pinentry window a gnupg results window should pop up with the decrypted message if you don t get the menu entry decrypt verify clipboard when you left click on the clipboard something is wrong with the formatting of the message that you copied into the clipboard to be decrypted make sure that you are copying all of the message including the five dashes at the beginning and end of the message and the begin and end statements pgp is very picky about formatting errors.
sound interesting would love to write a full review once the sites up.
has anything good come out of dhl it seems like it s scarce and not many vendors there have many reviews if any at all.
hiim looking for some leaks sites anyone know some good ones tnx.
hey everyone as much as it pains me to do so i simple need to switch marketplace while agora gets there shit together i ve been using alphabay and have been quite happy with it especially with there ddos protection and up time that being said i m wondering if there s anything better out there anyone got any suggestions experiences etc with other markets that have a stable up time any info is much appreciated thank.
i got michelle leonhart nudez just send me bt.
windows has a trojan that can change copied btc addresses in the clipboard and replace it with an attackers wallet address could this have happened to you.
jimdandy on november amwatch out for this guy he is not alphabay but rather an impostereven if hes not who cares he s providing valid info and i verified the links with dnstats.
or maybe have it as a different priced option ex mg xtal direct trade mg xtal multisig this would at least give people the option but keeping the direct trade price considerably lower most will choose the cheaper option especially with trusted vendors it may seem like a huge price difference but it s also a lot of work the vendors need to get paid for.
have you imported the pgp key of the person you re trying to send an encrypted message to.
bonobo on january pmalways use tails if you are a regular or making even a single large order absolutely correct  bonobo on january pmwindows tends to leave too much traces behind in anycase use gpg usb rather than pgpwin as the usb version is more portable windows has been described correctly imo as a forensic technician s wet dream tails is the ideal solution for the most part however many people consider this solution too difficult gpg usb is a reasonable compromise better that they use something as opposed to using nothing as was often the case on silk road that s why the silk road servers were such a bonanza for the feds when they were seized as almost everything was in plaintext i e non encrypted spitfir.
vanilla reload moneygram are they like washing btc or just like a ewallet but bank option is connected to your real name if cash isnt optional random person buys btc through local with bank and send it to helix and from helix to another helix then to market would that work sorry for all these newbie question.
lelantos has had great uptime and i suggest them to everyone ussrmail was down half of the time so i switched over to lelantos just make sure to encrypt everything and be careful about what you put for subject headers.
you aren t wrong so i ve set up a fresh copy on a partition installed tor truecrypt and pgp are there any more security measures i can be taking if it isn t too much hassle for someone could you try sending me an encryped email which i can reply to just to get to grips with how it works that would be much appreciated is there a computer based email client i could use safely such as thunderbird thanks a lot.
i haven t made any transactions on middle earth yet but hot damn it s a pleasure to navigate fast and silky smooth and nice to look at the fact that they have a shopping cart feature is a huge plus imo i d imagine that s as convenient for vendors as it is buyers blackbank feels clunky to me pages seem to take longer than they should to load the text is hard to read always having to zoom in which causes everything to be crammed in and of course no shopping cart like agora purchasing multiple listings from a vendor is more complicated and time consuming than it needs to be on a more positive note i do appreciate their deposit withdrawal speed btw i m glad to see you re still around gf.
on july pmjust ordered from study buddy on me a couple hours ago js is not enabled could not have been smoother or quicker order is already marked as sent looking forward to trying out some of the asian xtal enjoy it tell me if you like it it already on its way to you.

hey so i just saw a link posted in a respected vendors profile on agora to a new market called the darknet heroes league does anyone know anything about this is it legit i m a bit skeptical to sign up as i haven t heard about it anywhere else the url is.
i like the easy interfac.
hosting it locally is probably the best way to go about it.
sorry to hear that its frustrating that we really can t catch these scammers.
i hate seeing new markets having the evo design looks like a scam waiting to happe.
where and how do i enter my pgp public key in my profile whats the best way i have looked but i cant work it out thanks in advance.
i would strongly encourage you to use a different method of accessing the darknet especially if you plan on placing orders or encrypting your address.
great info thanks to you and the original writer.
hello blue dream and root yes i saw that detail about is used to make a connection trouble is i never saw that warning before ever only on two occasions when logging into tmg the only reason i saw it was because i had vidalia running for those of you who dont monitor the behaviour of the connections how will you know if it is happening to you or not i checked everything on my side but found zilch bit worried now is there a way to directly contact admin without it appearing public when something like this happens can use pgp but time if somebody is up to something maybe its better that they dont know we know hehehe they know now not sure the best way to do it anyway thanks for the response feels good that people try to help each othe.
according to someone on here i m sending out terrible messages when i encrypt them i sent one to ootd on here and a few others and i hope this hasn t been an issue i don t know what the fuck is going on right now and i m flipping shit i just want to buy some drugs man not have more complications.
pg.
an updated version would be.
i am new to all this encryption business and need tips to learn a bit i managed to create a pgp key alright but when using safe mail i can t find an option to encrypt decrypt with that also i tried to set up a thunderbird with safe mail but it just tells me there is a problem with eithermy password or username both are correct are there any other options for me to use pgp encryption i want things to get rolling but in a safe way to purchace some lucy it s been a long time and i really miss her thanks for any help roh and i use ubuntu linux if that makes it easier to help me oh and how does one encrypt a pm here on tmg.
hey captain you should bookmark or check out this link very well may have seen that thread or something similar before i have no idea what your experience is with this stuff and i know that thread has been linked to on these forums before but it really is a quintessential index of darknet security it has answered any and every question i ve ever had regarding the topic happy trail.
good idealets get on i.
crawfbigg on april pmanyone know what's up with nucleus market exit scammed i think.
knucklesfromsr on february pmfrom everything that i read this makes it so that website owners can be held responsible for what their users do i don t agree with this i still don t think you d get in trouble for making a platform like craigslist which can be used for illegal activity but ross knowingly set up a black market website actively recruited drug dealers and knowingly and directly profited from illegal transactions.
does anybody have a referral link for darknet heroes league if so please send me a pm it d be much appreciated.
yeah i got mine after day.
helix is safe from my experience i have only used it once for less than a hundred us dollars for the advice earth.
how far will law enforcement go today we are going to talk about the lengths that law enforcement le will go to try and catch you slipping the thread that inspired this post was the following sr thread the first question is can le ship drugs to buyers to try and set them up for drug charges let us just say that they have done it to a silk road user before who went by the name of flush aka chronicpain aka curtis green april a dea undercover agent in maryland posing as a drug smuggler began communicating with dread pirate roberts on silk road about selling a large amount of illegal drugs dread pirate roberts instructed curtis green to help the smuggler find a drug dealer who could buy a large amount of drugs court papers say green found a buyer and agreed to act as the middleman for a sale of a kilogram of cocaine green gave the dea agent his address an undercover u s postal service inspector delivered the cocaine to green s house in utah on jan so as you can see whether you view it as entrapment or not once they have evidence against you they will eventually figure out a way to get something on you and bust you for it like they did to curtis green the secret service posed as a vendor for fake ids online for years and actually shipped fake ids that they made to buyers on an online russian forum us government s operation open market resulted in indictments against defendants according to wired special agent mike adams shipped out more than fake ids over about five years of activity while going by the username celtic amazingly the entire scheme started when the government arrested the real celtic a nevada man who got caught shopping at a whole foods where he d previously used a fake credit card law enforcement discovered counterfeiting equipment among his possessions and learned about his online activities adams assumed his online identity and even improved celtic s cred shipping near flawless ids and becoming a trusted seller on carder ru as you can see in this article the secret service again sold illegal items to people online in order to bust them several of the buyers used their real addresses and sent real photos of themselves to this officer to have their ids made resulting in being arrested by the feds and in this particular case the feds charged all the defendants under something called the rico act  main indictment is noteworthy because in addition to the usual mix of credit card fraud and false identification charges the defendants have been charged under the mob busting rico act a first for a cybercrime prosecution enacted in to help the fbi crack down on the mafia the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act lets the feds hold every member of a criminal organization individually responsible for the actions of the group as a whole the losses collectively inflicted by the carder su members are easily enough to give every rico defendant years in prison when you commit crimes online especially in an online community the feds may be able to hold you accountable for the actions of other users on that same community so make sure when you do your freedom fighting or whatever you choose to do that you take this into considering always weigh out the worst case scenario should you get busted because the le will try and set you up one last example of how le will try and set you up but not relating to online communities is when they put together a fake sweepstakes in los angeles deputies in la mirada attempted a rope a dope on some alleged criminals by offering them a fake sweepstakes prize out of the letters sent to these people of interest only eight showed up at the la mirada holiday inn to collect their prize according to the whittier daily news posing as the pelican marketing group deputies sent letters last week to people throughout the county wanted in connection with crimes ranging from misdemeanor warrants to murder according to the report the suspects were advised to bring their letter and identification to the holiday inn and told that they were guaranteed a prize worth at least and would be one of people with a chance to win a bmw i sedan they were all smiles when they showed up to collect their prizes deputy janet ramirez told the newspaper once they tell them they re under arrest the smile fades quickly she said so the reason i made this post was for those of you who think that le will not go to certain lengths to try and set you up for charges they will do it if they want you bad enough and if you fall for it they might get you on some tough charges curtis green is facing up to years for the sting operation by the dea on him and the users who purchased fake ids on the russian forum could face up to years each since they can be charged under the rico act always keep these things in mind when conducting activities online and always take the worst case scenario into account it only takes one mistake to get caught and the government has unlimited resources and super computers to try and catch you slipping you may only have a few laptops desktops servers but nothing compared to the what they have be careful everyone.
justme on september pmshort and simplified answer because it is not end to end encrypted when somebody catches your traffic everyone hosting an exit node can catch that le hosts some exit nodes for that purpose you are fucked you just gave away your address and time of arrival pm me if you want me to link you to some good safety stuff i would strongly advise you to do so i wouldn t mind seeing that link as i am new to this stuff and don t want to fuck up where do you guys usually get your packages sent if not you own place.
go to their help desk on their forum click a few pages until you get to their green resolved threads there is page after page after page of resolved threads of pins not working and the resolution is sorry nothing can be done its our money now tons of them i am currently in the situation where my correct pin i have used dozens of times to withdraw did not work after the th time my account got locked and as per the rules there is nothing that can be done without the long ass mnemonic provided at account creation that i did not bother to save because my pin is retardedly simple and there is no way it could ever be forgotten you are warned ab is covertly stealing people s money with the ridiculous rule of five times you fail and your money is ours.

alberthoffman on march pminternal mixer what im intressted in acid from what country you send when you send your coins to agora they mix with other coins that other users deposited so it might look like people withdrew your coins on blockchain it s just agora mixing your coins i send from the united states.
across this and thought it was pretty funny you ll laugh if you surf the deep web a lot this kinda applies to your tech site a little but it s mostly for lol.
the point i want to make is that illegal drug operations that achieve long term success tend to cooperate with corrupt law enforcement officers by means of bribes this is probably much better strategy than trying to fight the state head on or searching for a lawless place where no business could be done due to incessant fighting violence and political instability.
i hadn t gotten in deep enough to miss blackbank but i am bummed to see it go the way of a shifty scumbag dinosaur the garden seems like a prototype for the better way of doing things newer centralized markets have burned off the good reputation that sr garnered by sticking around and being reliable for years if i m going to place my faith and cash in the hands of a stranger keeping the market s escrow systems involved feels like bringing another equally untrustworthy stranger for no good reason.

i think any country with enough political capital to be able to pull off withstanding pressures from the western economies would only do so if it benefitted them usually the countries able to do this wouldn t tolerate exposing their people to the things found on such a server or would run it themselves as an economic or cultural attack if it was a private citizen or business in one of these countries they would face great risk if somehow you were able to contact a government and convince them to allow your project i could see that potentially bringing conspiracy espionage and or treason charges if caught i would be careful any country you set this up in will most likely be the government to protect you if something happens you might find yourself living somewhere not friendly could try an area of instability if the infrastructure was still intact would not be a permanent location and could easily be physically knocked out both could be desired if you are willing to move regularly or use other servers too the increase in traffic would be very noticeable limiting time it could be run there are quite a few small countries which may not have the resources to monitor or traditionally aren t monitored but are still sound in places oceania and se asia has many small isolated island countries that might do again traffic would spike compared to normal for those regions not sure if a mobile platform would work perhaps a barge or transport ship on long voyages would be weather dependent and not sure max data that can be relayed this way highly likely it would be well below average dn server rates limiting traffic and feasibility could stagger users by giving designated log in periods to increase your capacity.

pleroma on june pmi have used blond wigfog a number of times and never had an issue but it does seem like there are quite a few people that have even on small amounts which doesn t make sense from a scamming point of view maybe technical problem or sophisticated scam scheme thanks for sharing your experience let s try to keep this topic up to date recently played with helix light pay shield and bitblender with small amounts and all of those worked fine bitblender did seem to work with a shared coin system one huge wallet sending many small payments while the other seem more sophisticated many wallets bigger than your deposit that will send amounts to the addresses you gave in both cases it should work as far as blockchain analysis goes.

no love for markets lol we ve outgrown the.
galindoi on july pmi can t respond as a buyer don t have any experience with depositing funds there but as a seller its all crickets over there not a lot of activity for mushrooms i ve found in light of that though the few transactions i ve had went smooth customers finalized and i was able to transfer my funds several hundred dollars out of the system into my own wallets easily and with no hassle so grain of salt galindoiis agora where most of your sales occur.

it s great to see new people learn and discover the wonders of the darknet one quick note though you shouldn t be torrenting anything through tor not only is it bad opsec but it slows the whole network down see for more in response to your original question yes using a tails usb should be fine from home.
when i go to encrypt a message copy message click encrypt with clipboard the window opens up to select the key to use i check the box to select the key and nothing happenstried with many keys and get the same result i click ok and nothing happensi click cancel and nothing happensanyone have a clue.
while we re waiting for others to get involved why don t we test your escrow agent skillz thurgood i ll be the buyer and seller if you re down i ll create two addresses and give you the pubkeys to both in order to confirm the address you create is the correct multisig address you should give me your pubkey too then i ll create the same address in my blond wig qt client and i can watch the funds get transferred to it in a real world situation all three participants could would do this but each would only have one pubkey so they couldn t spend the coins without the participation of one other person hopefully this will give people a sense of how easy it is do you want to use bitrated if so let me know when to be online.
hm i m honestly not sure then have you made your own key already.
samples landed today i will update after i eat them.
on january pmi did try this i typed the text that i want to encrypt and saved the text file to the desktop then i found the file in the file in the desktop folder hilighted it and selected edit then selecting encrypt it then allows me to check the key of the recipient after i do that it creates another file that ends in pgp this seems like it should work just fine but when i open the file it looks like there is heiroglyphic symbols mixed in with normal letters about of each not sure what is going on still the reason that the file when you attempt to edit it looks like hieroglyphics is because the file is not ascii armoured files that are encrypted and not ascii armoured usually end in pgp here s how to do it so it ll work properly for you these instructions assume you ve already generated your own pgp key and have saved both the public and private halves to external storage remember tails is amnesic meaning that if you don t backup your data keyrings they will not be there for you the next time you fire up tails to do this follow these steps click on places computer on the top menu a new window will pop up with a series of locations devices on the left and a list of folders on the right plug in your usb stick or micro sd card if recognized the device will appear in the list of devices in the left hand pane go to applications terminal a terminal session will then open up the prompt will look something like this amnesia amnesia issue the command cd media amnesia issue the command ls la you will see a folder directory with its name in blue perhaps something like f e db where the f e db is the device identifier folder name issue the cd command to switch into that folder i e cd f e db issue the command to copy your secret keys to a single file gpg armour export secret keys o secret keys asc issue the command to copy your public keys to a single file gpg armour export o public keys ascyour pgp keys are now backed up onto external media so you will have them ready for use the next time you fire up tails now as far as encrypting messages goes click on the little clipboard icon in the top menu bar and select open text editor the last entry in the editor compose your text to be encrypted when you re done composing use control a to select all the text and control c to copy it to the clipboard click on the little clipboard icon again only this time select the second option sign encrypt clipboard with public keys a select rcipients box will pop up and you can put a check on the left most checkbox to select the recipients click on ok to encrypt the contents of the clipboard with the selected public keys when the contents of the clipboard are encrypted you will see a little padlock icon superimposed on the clipboard click on the clipboard icon again select open text editor and right click wiht your mouse and choose paste a copy of your ascii armored encrypted message will be seen there the message can be pasted anywhere else you need it to go to decrypt a message copy the encrypted message to the clipboard click on the clipboard icon chosing the first option decrypt verify clipboard a new dialog box will pop up asking for your passphrase type it in and click ok a new screen will then pop up showing you your decrypted text this text can be copied and pasted to wherever you need it to go hope this helps spitfir.

tortrip on june pmthis looks very suspicious perhaps law enforcement are now running the business in order to catch users they may have been before but now that the arrests have happened and everything is out in the open i doubt they still are.
mps on june amis it not possible for a vendor with no feedback to in fact be le of course it is it is also very possible that a vendor with lots of feedback is le if this possibility has only just occurred to you and you don t have a clear and satisfactory answer maybe it s a sign you re not ready to be playing around with it yet.
swisscrystal on february pmyes i m using tails thanks rebirth i believe the bridges from torproject have worked although i m confused why my other ones did not they seem to work fine for the trusted person that gave them to me as we previously discussed were they formated correctly ip port key i know this is a stupid question but i have made the simplest of mistakes in the passed it could possibly be that the bridge previously provided were no longer active maybe ask your friend if he is able to connect with them.
glad to have you but please read.
we re all doomed i am a new vendor with like in escrow.
just ordered from study buddy on me a couple hours ago js is not enabled could not have been smoother or quicker order is already marked as sent looking forward to trying out some of the asian xtal.
hey kitties very happy you got iti still wait mine was sent the th quite sure tomorrow cm masters at workpeac.
i just use tails persistance for anything i need buried in the crypt works pretty good for me for secret text info but might be too small if you re trying to hide lots of big media files or something.
so i m new to this whole thing amd still trying to figure this out i have a few questions i hope someone will take the time to answer first what exactly is pgp i know it s an encryption key or something how do i find out mine how do i use this to encrypt an email and is there anything else i need to know to order from vendors most want you to use the key to send them an email but honestly i m lost if someone could help that would be great thank.
using the veracrypt backend makes it encrypted whonix is better than tails imho.
hi guys i feel really stupid asking this but what is a working link to join the we love avengers marketplace i ve been trying lots of invite links on here but they don t look like a normal onion url thanks.
been also lookin to buy weed there but hard times man gonna wait till agora comes up and gonna buy an oz from trusted vendo.
very nic.
title says it all i kept expecting a thread like this to pop up change password and carry on or will there be a change of url.
veracrypt full disk encryption is also a good way forward the encrypted file system is not very secure though.
running tails on a virtual box is also a secure way some expert vpn folks should start renting out sandbox rdp s with tails for some coin.
if it was on the hidden wiki its pretty much guaranteed to be a phishing scam site what are you looking for i m sure there s a vendor here that probably sells it.
thanks for adding hansa death to centralized market.
on january pmi just got locked out its unbelieveable i had the link on the bookmarks for months now if someone tells me i was using a phishing link they can fuck off to russia looking for a new market to buy warezthat fucking sucks i hope you didn t lose too much and re symetry that shit is brutal what they did to you fucking crooks indeed it s very short sighted because they d make more money in the long run if they just ran a successful and secure market for years.
ok thanks for many answers for the moment i got apply vendor here black bank nucleus alphabay this is my profile on grams have very cheap offer in the moment i sell sativa skunk for g i only sell in bulk but i will put soon a little amount g for every peoples can try my productbefore i was vendor on evolution and i got very good statistic sales level if someone is interested let me know take care everybod.
scary do they know what they are doing.
i m starting to love tmg more and more i see vendors on markets and wanna ask them if they would just come to the loving tmg side of things it s the only garden that i know of that grows love happiness from lsd if that shit isn t majestical as fuck then sir i don t know what is deuces knuckle.

on september pmquote from on august pmif canada gfn went direct i would never need to use a market ever again who canada aka prices for mdma to the usa are outstanding if he went direct it would be lovely right now we have gamma for lsd at an amazing price canada for mdma soon trust will have mdma and hopefully that iconoclast guy works out because those are some aamzing prices on np.
p c w th n on june pmplease can someone help i have encrypted a pgp message it is about page long including my own public key that i added to the message the problem is the encrypted message is pages long too long to send as a private message or post on the forum if anyone could help assist me i would be most grateful i am using open office to write and read the text odt and asc and kleopatra to encrypt odt is a binary data format like docx you re needlessly encrypting a whole bunch of metadata about the structure of the document rather than just the text use a plain text editor to write your message and encrypt the txt file don t encrypt rich text documents.
godel thanks for the clarification honestly i don t know too much about it just thougt it an interesting topic to share here do you have any vpn i was using pia for a while but i let it lapse a couple months ago.
thanks man i think i ll be pretty good with what i have i just want to be saf.
thank yo.
is tails only for linux based systems.
ahoy stan i am indeed still active here and the offer certainly does still stand you know what you are indeed the man because you did everything correctly and i can agree that the moon is indeed very blue in the garden tonight if you pop yourself a tab from one of our excellent vendors and sit down over there by the trans dimensional water feature you can watch it change every colour you can think of and more if you post your key i will send you something to test your decryption there is a pgp key thread in the general discussion board where you can post your key and vendors will be able to find it to be honest though i tend to send my key along with any encrypted messages as a belt and braces backup welcome to the garden my friend its a beautiful place es thanks for the support i m just passing on a favor someone did for me as i hope anyone i help here will do.
thanks for the reply i ll be sure to clean up and take a break from this until i feel more comfortable.
hello allmy question is how likely is it for le to pose as a vendor on a dnm new to the deepweb and dnms in general i recently got some coin and made a purchase on nucleus from a trusted vendor however i was then left over with a little change and went searching for something to buy with what i had left over i found a vendor selling single blotters and decided to buy one even though they had zero feedback on top of wanting to spend my change the product promised was something i desparately wanted to try what could possibly go wrong maybe the guy s a scammer and i lose no biggie i thought the day after however it hit me is it not possible for a vendor with no feedback to in fact be le i am extremely frustrated with myself for being so careless i spent so much time learning all of the necessary opsec protocols to stay safe and anonymous only to possibly hand over my personal info directly to the luckily it was only one dose and i am from another country than the vendor claims to be from but aren t i still at risk should i abandon my current address for all future transactions should i wipe my computer clean suffice it to say i am anxiously awaiting this package and will never make this mistake again any knowledge on this topic will be very appreciated mps.
as far as i know dmtisinme is right about the messages being deleted permanently once removed as for the auto prune after a certain amount of time i am not so sure i will check into it.
at silk road trial federal agent explains how he trapped ulbrichthow the feds became dripsofacid buying and selling on silk road by joe mullin jan am utcthe silk road trialnew york more people were using the mail to get high and jared der yeghiayan knew it we hadn t seen ecstasy being seized in letter class like that in a long time said the homeland security special agent since i d been at o hare der yeghiayan was speaking on wednesday from the stand in a manhattan federal courtroom where year old ross ulbricht stands accused of being the mastermind in the most successful drug dealing website of all time the silk road prosecutors showed a table full of more than envelopes with a few varying kinds of labels all used to ship drugs this was just one day said der yeghiayan who pursued narcotics investigations from his office at the chicago airport we hardly had seizures of ecstasy in years past when they did find pills in the mail it was a one off on a hand addressed envelope by he was seeing large amounts of printed letters coming from europe and other countries with fake business names printed on as return addresses like studyabroad com by october of that year der yeghiayan had opened an investigation of silk road it would ultimately lead him to a long relationship with the website first as buyer then as seller and ultimately as a staff member becoming friendly with and getting paid by dread pirate roberts the boss behind the site two years after he began seizing those stunning amounts of drugs in the chicago airport der yeghiayan came to believe that dpr was ross ulbricht the last chat would take place on october it ended when federal agents set upon ulbricht in a san francisco public library grabbing his laptop while it was still open to the chat page walking a jury down the silk roadtestimony today was partly the narrative of his investigation and partly a tour of the silk road it was the jury s first look at the website the testimony which began yesterday and continued throughout today touched on some things not made public until today private messages from dread pirate roberts secret staff only chat areas and dpr s guide for drug dealers covering everything from packaging to philosophy der yeghiayan has close cropped hair a goatee and a light beard on wednesday he wore a conservative black suit with a dark tie clearly an experienced witness he shifted his gaze from the prosecutor to the jury as he answered every question shortly after the investigation opened homeland security agents began to make buys from the site they would compare the drugs they seized or bought to silk road listings they had seen and found match after match ultimatelyder yeghiayan and his team made undercover buys from the site from over distinct silk road dealers in countries all but one of the purchases came through with real drugs the jury was walked through a few examples like a chunk of brown heroin weighing grams shipped from the netherlands der yeghiayan opened the package and showed photos to the jury the packaging was pro vacuum sealed pouch wasn t visible behind a bluish sheet of paper and the heroin was within not one but several plastic bags another photo showed cocaine wrapped in black foil in april they did another buy a big one this one was walked through more slowly so the jury could understand how der yeghiayan bought bitcoins and what they were he showed how he used the now defunct mt gox exchange to turn into bitcoins then logged into a silk road account he had taken over called dripsofacid at that point the court reporter stumbled sorry he asked drips of acid der yeghiayan said more slowly then prosecutors ran through the various sections of silk road the silk road community forum was divided into five sections security shipping drug safety philosophy and off topic the philosophy section was held out to users as the home of dpr s book club that s where they try to discuss how to use drugs safely and just effects of different drugs was der yeghiayan s description of the drug safety section has anyone tried mdma from these sellers read a typical forum post shown to the jury which listed three silk road seller account names below the question on the site s wiki jurors read about the site s built in tumbler instead of doing a transfer from one account to another they put a lot of other accounts in between der yeghiayan said that masks who the buyers and sellers are avoid abandoned buildings or anywhere it would be suspicious to have mail delivered read a wiki section called receiving packages if you follow these guidelines your chances of being detected are minimal from buyer to sellerder yeghiayan also had access to at least one seller account presumably from an arrest called supertrips with that he was able to enter seller only sections of the site on the silk road seller s guide the rules read never ask clients for personal information under no circumstances should you save a copy of your client s address publish a public encryption key in your user description on your settings page so your customers can send you their information encrypted if they wish no selling out of escrow that last point was important the silk road escrow system discouraged either side buyer or seller from ripping the other one off money was held by silk road until both sides were satisfied every caution must be taken to maintain the secrecy of the contents of your clients package advised another part of the seller s guide creatively disguise it in such a way that a postal inspector might ignore it it is your responsibility to stay up to date on the latest stealth packaging sellers should print their mailing labels not hand write on substances the guide insisted when selling any substances that had an odor you must vacuum seal the package dpr explained not try to mask it with another pungent thing like coffee the seller s contract with silk road obliged them to describe your items accurately and truthfully another part read like a corporate mission statement treat your customers with respect go above and beyond for them der yeghiayan read dpr s posts regularly the site admin at first simply called himself silk road adopting the dread pirate roberts name in february around when hsi began buying drugs off the site for a drug kingpin dpr s tone was sometimes quite emotional one imagines scenes with a therapist hey gang really sorry for the dead time there the site admin wrote after an outage in june this work is scary and exciting all at the same time and i m really very happy to be on this journey with you in another post shown to jurors dpr waxed emotional about the success of his project it s great to see that my words are resonating with so many of you it s a privilege to have a stage to speak from here it doesn t get said enough and it is hard to get across in this medium but i love you who knew that a softy could lead an international narcotics organization behind my wall of anonymity i don t have to intimidate thankfully but yea i love you guys thank you for being here thank you for being my comrades thank you for being yourselves and bringing your unique perspectives and energy and on a personal note thank you for giving me the best job in the world i ve never had so much fun i know we ve been at it for over a year now but really we are just getting started i m so excited and anxious for our future i could burst dthe site s owner stopped going by simply silk road and took on the name dread pirate roberts in january in a later message dpr got angry responding to users who had complained about increases in the commissions he charged on each sale he wrote when have i lied when have i cheated or stolen from anyone here when have i treated anyone unfairly when have i lead you astray why do you turn on me now when i have poured my heart and soul into this community and project on orders we are talking about an extra a order an extra cents do you think this site built itself do you think it runs itself do you have any idea the risk the people operating this site are taking do you have any clue what we ve been through to get here today whether you like it or not i am the captain of this ship you are here voluntarily and if you don t like the rules of the game or you don t trust your captain you can get off the boat from seller to adminby july of der yeghiayan had managed to take over the account of someone who was not only a silk road seller but one of several staffers adopting the identity of cirrus der yeghiayan earned bitcoins a week about at the time to moderate forum posts after several weeks he got a raise to bitcoins weekly he kept getting the salary until the site was shut down in october cirrus has always been dedicated to our community at large dread pirate roberts explained in a private message sent to a small group of cirrus and other administrators the message was sent shortly before hsi took over the account it wasn t clear from testimony today how der yeghiayan was able to take the identity of the trusted cirrus presumably it was the account of an arrested user or one who otherwise made a deal with authorities cirrus was part of a group of forum moderators along with three other trusted users inigo libertas and who also went by ssbd i had admin rights der yeghiayan explained to the jury i could search through the database of users and i could edit delete and move posts on the forums there were other things he couldn t do the distribution of such powers on the site was by dpr and dpr alone in late august dpr charged cirrus with moderating a new part of the marketplace s discussion boards you re going to be our quality control expert on this dpr told him in a chat message so we re going to be pretty strict about what gets through der yeghiayan wrote back in his undercover persona cirrus so basically the discussions have to be connected to products not just bitching yes wrote dpr users in the special forum should be calm polite etc this wasn t the general forum area of silk road but a different one hosted on the marketplace that only certain users had access to the forums are the backyard party explained dpr this is the storefront from admin to arrestder yeghiayan didn t know who dread pirate roberts was and even after his extensive testimony it still isn t clear how he found out on the stand today he said that an irs investigator told him ulbricht was the suspect ulbricht was easy enough to locate by late september der yeghiayan was on his way to san francisco ulbricht s adopted hometown around noon on october he met up with a team of federal agents in the glen park neighborhood they gathered at a cafe where ulbricht had been recently they wanted to see if he would return while agents physically monitored ulbricht and his home der yeghiayan kept his laptop open on the silk road s staff chat channel he had been watching dpr on the staff chat and saw that he logged off around pm local time at that same time i was notified that ulbricht had left his home and was headed in the direction of the cafe said der yeghiayan ulbricht walked into the bello cafe looked around and walked out perhaps seeing how crowded it was the glen park branch of the sf public library was just next door ulbricht went inside at pm der yeghiayan saw dpr log on it would be ulbricht s last online chat for some time cirrus hi cirrus are you there dread hey cirrus how are you doing dread i m ok you cirrus good can you check out on one of the flagged messages for me dread sure dread let me log in cirrus ok dread you did bitcoin exchange before you started working for me right cirrus yes but just for a little bit dread not any more than that cirrus no i stopped because of reporting requirements dread damn regulators eh dread ok which post cirrus lol yep cirrus there was the one with the atlantisit was a trap when dpr typed ok which post der yeghiayan knew it meant he was looking at a particular admin screen listing flagged posts at that point der yeghiayan gave the signal via email keeping his laptop open der yeghiayan told jurors how he walked from the cafe to the library testimony on wednesday didn t go farther than that it was nearly pm and time to release the jury but those following the story know how this ends of course ulbricht was arrested computer opened to exactly the page the undercover agent had told him to go to the real cliffhanger isn t what happened in that library but what happens tomorrow that s when ulbricht s lawyer joshua dratel will cross examine der yeghiayan and begin to tell the story he promised yesterday the story of how ulbricht wasn t the dread pirate roberts but was somehow lured back to be a fall guy by the real head honcho of the site while we don t know the details yet it sounds like a wild story it s also ulbricht s last chance to stay free.
nice thanks friend.
thanks for the heads up happy new yea.
i spoke of no phishing site but spamming and i have no idea what the site you mention is.
abraxas market is down including all alternative links and there is talk on ddw about an exit scam i really hope it is not the case of my favourite markets but cant help not thinking about the predicament of human greed peac.
which market do you prefer buying or selling on and why.
we are looking to move our enterprise to alphabay cannot believe another marketplace exit scam getting really tired of this we will be dealing with fe only from now on available for direct dealing through tmgalso available on dream marketplace and alphabay coming soon cheers s.
thank you everyone for your help i was looking around cause i thought i had another ap but i don t i m either going to look at the usb lucidmotif suggested or just try whonix vm that dimitri coolbreeze suggested the computer i m using isn t new early s i wish i had a macbook though lmao for everyone because you are all so kind and helpfulthank yousno.
operating systems can and should be openly discussed but openly admiting to using one is a violation of opsec keep your private information private end users tend to use windows with and other big fish tend to use tails becuase its a neat package of almost everything needed for the darknet but please note that the previous version to tails has security leaks that have since been patched only download tails iso through tor for the nsa attempts to track every download of that os for obvious reasons a lunix distro with a hardened kernel gentoo is more work but being in a completely different pond from one their attempting to fish at has its advantages tor bridges also have their uses all opsec disecions should be throughly researched before being made dont tell me this darknet aint got no hetty info you just got to poke around.
i have been trying to register with the site grams and i have been repeatedly issued the same error and i m not sure what i am doing wrong any help would be greatly appreciated when i submit my application the following error occurs the pgp key you enter was invalid please ensure you are submitting an ascii armored pgp public key i have copy pasted the public key from my asc file directly into the field on the grams register page when i do this i ve noticed that it distorts the message by adding spaces into the pgp key block i wasn t sure if my text editor was adding the crlf or space characters so i tried deleting them manually to no avail any help and or insight would be greatly appreciated best regard.
are you sure you didnt get phished create a new account buyers account and message admin on the forums he has helped me out with some missing deposits in the past after i went rampaging the forum.
i am new around here but i have to say that after watching so many markets rise fall it would appear that wallet wallet will put us buyers at the vendor s remorse at least until a decentralized option is available cheers to my trust in you guys.
also inform people who you had sensitive conversations with about the leak and give them your new pubkey if you only leaked it on this forum maybe the admins can see howmany people opened the page it was on so you can assess how serious it is was.
combining tor with a vpn continuedok now let us talk about why you may want to connect to a vpn over tor the data flow would look like this you tor vpn internet the benefits of doing that are as follows you are more anonymous to your vpn in case they happen to keep logs or if you do something using the vpn that you are not supposed to and a website or server grabs your vpn ip address in the case of this happening even if the vpn manages to keep logs of everything you do they can only identify you as an anonymous tor user as long as you did not purchase the service like an idiot with your credit card or paypal account if you use blond wig and made sure the the blond wig trail is not easily traceable you should be okay some websites block tor users from connecting to their websites or servers by using your vpn to appear as the exit node you are hiding your tor activity from the website you are visiting and hopefully bypassing their filters another advantage is that if your vpn connection does drop your fall back will be your tor ip address instead of your real ip address and finally if you are passing through a compromised tor exit node your information will remain encrypted through the vpn s encryption protocol until it reaches the exit node of the vpn this is a good thing if you are passing through a compromised exit node but do not forget that the vpn could be logging everything you are doing anyways do not trust anybody who has access to your unecrypted data a few of the downsides of doing things this way as mentioned in the previous post are that your isp knows you are using tor when and for how long this may or may not matter to you but it is just something to consider second you will be unable to visit hidden services websites remember those onion sites we talked about in the beginning you need to be connected to the tor network to visit those hidden service websites but i am connected to tor aren t i yes you are but your final method of communicating with the internet does not come from the tor network it comes from your vpn and your vpn is likely not configured for tor in order for you to be able to connect to a hidden services you must either be connected directly to tor or use a vpn to connect to tor tor must be your final node of connectivity in order to visit onion websites the choice is ultimately up to you and every person in every state province and country will have different reasons for wanting to do vpn to tor or tor to vpn or just tor or just vpn whatever choice you make please keep all the things mentioned in this post and the previous post in mind none of these methods will save you if you enter anything identifying about yourself online do not log into your facebook account using your vpn do not check your email or search a nearby address on google using your vpn in fact stay away from google altogether unless absolutely necessary there are two other search engines out now that do not store information about their users duckduckgo they have both a clearnet url and a hidden services url for both types of users please note the hidden services mirror is not startpage this server also does not store any information about its users before we move on i want to go back to how to choose a good vpn when looking for a vpn provider you will most likely come across two protocols to choose from find out which one your vpn provider is using before you sign up with them pptp and openvpn at this time i am going to highly recommend that you avoid pptp and stick with openvpn providers check out this site for a quick comparison as you can see pptp uses a weaker encryption bit versus bit to bit for openvpn it offers basic security versus a high level of security using something called digital certificates this is basically a way to make sure they data coming in is sent from your vpn provider and not injected by some malicious third party because the incoming and outgoing data are signed using specially obtained certificates similar to showing your id to get into a a restricted area the only downside is that setting up openvpn can be a little challenging for the less technical users but there are plenty of great tutorials online to set up openvpn providers and your vpn provider itself will likely help you get set up as well pptp has been abandoned by those who demand the highest level of security so i would recommend to avoid it a third option for vpn providers is l tp ipsec but many users now believe it has also been compromised by the nsa due to its weaker levels of encryption and should be avoided as well stick with openvpn lastly if you want to know how to connect to tor over a vpn if you are using openvpn like i recommended then you it is really quite simple make sure you are connected to your vpn check your ip address to on any website such as com to make sure it has changed then open tor or open tails and start using tor and you are now connected to tor over a vpn connecting to a vpn over tor is a more tricky and currently above my skill set since openvpn reconfigures your network routes so tor can t be running on the same host as soon as i figure it out i will post a tutorial and if anybody can share an easy way to connect a vpn over tor then please share it with this thread updatea method of connecting to a vpn over tor has been added to this thread but is currently only able to be used by windows users you can read it about it at the link below connecting tor vpn for windows usersafter a long search i have found a way you can connect tor vpn it is not perfect and some might not agree with doing things this way but it works and i am giving it to you as an option but it only works for windows users at this time if you look back at my previous posts regarding combining vpn and tor then you will find the reasons why you would want to do so and some of the reasons why you might not want to do it but i was unable to provide you with a way to connect to a vpn using tor so that the vpn does not know who you are when it comes to tor vpn if you cannot trust your vpn which you rarely should then keeping your identity anonymous from your vpn is a good idea also with more and more people using tor but with only around tor exit nodes many of the exit node ip addresses are being flagged as spammers on popular websites and limiting the usage of well meaning tor users to post on message boards like stack exchange and so forth the way that i found you can do tor vpn is by using a virtual machine preferrably virtual box and running another instance of windows preferrably one that uses less memory than your current version you also want to run tor expert and tortilla on your host os i talk about how to do this in previous posts next set your virtual box to route all it s network traffic through tortilla bridge adapter which routes it all through tor currently tortilla is only supported by windows which is why this option is only available to windows users at this time doing this also makes it easier to do things like watch videos on youtube now that you have your windows virtual machine running on tor you can install a vpn of your choice preferrably one using openvpn on your windows guest os and connect to it check your ip address before connecting and after and you should see a different ip address if all went well you now have a virtual machine running tor vpn then if you want to add another layer you can download tor browser bundle onto your virtual machine and run that as well giving you tor vpn tor for another layer of security also you have the option using this method to use a vpn on your host os then tor expert with tortilla then another vpn on your guest os then tor browser giving you vpn tor vpn tor i am not advocating any whcih method you need to make that decision on your own i am just giving you the knowledge necesary to make an informed decison and you can ultimately choose which method you feel most comfortable with sometimes doing tor vpn is necessary because of the spam filter reasons i mentioned above and other times having tor as your last node to the internet is necessary like when accessing the onion network it is completely up to you and i know that we are trying to shy away from windows usage because of all the exploits and other reasons spoken about in the previous posts but if you have no other way of staying anonymous from your vpn than this then i think it is a good compromise until we have something like tortilla that is compatible with linux distributions.
would anyone mind dropping a link to middle earth i m looking for a sight that has more reliability than agora which is unfortunate because i really like agora.
import a vendor s public key copy the vendor s public key into the clipboard left click on the clipboard icon on the top right tails menu bar and select manage keys maximize the new window that pops up on the passwords and keys windows select gnupg keys type ctrl v or do edit paste from the menu bar for that window a window should pop up with the vendor s pgp id click on import if you get a pop up with the following error could not display clipboard text reason unrecognized or unsupported data there was a formatting problem with the key you copied into the clipboard make sure that you are copying all of the key including the five dashes at the beginning and end of the key and the begin and end statements pgp is very picky about formatting errors.
i was lucky enough to get in order in and fe processes by gammagoblin just days before bb went down hopefully gg got his money out in time.
it seems that while everyone else has begun receiving deposits again mine has not turned up yet quite concerning it was sent from my middle earth wallet which reads confirmations does this suggest it was not withdrawn properly or is it more likely to be a deposit problem on agora can i check blockchain for the transaction.
hello guys i ve come over from the silk road with a new user name i d been scammed out of a little money on a couple market places now and i think what you guys have here is probably the way forward what i would like if it isn t too much hassle is a little help with pgp on android i have an email address and i think a pgp client called agp if someone could tell me what to try to send and receive back n encrypted message that would be great and good luck with the websit.
this is the th time of rechecking the pgp certificate i cannot trust nor verify their pgp key it keeps stating their key is expired devs have been notified but no action has been taken feel free to notify em this has been going on for way to long only method of integrity check atm is to multiple checksum using rarely used checksums along with our standards.
dardush on april pmquote from scidmt on april pmdoes anyone know how i would go about creating a site like ootp s something simple i would be interested in doing this but don t really know where to start scidmtmaybe ootp can help you with that question via pm vendor to vendor yeah i ll give it a shot was thinking he might not want to help since were competition but you never know scidm.
like kushmaster says local bitcoins would be the easiest place to sell coins selling coins for ukash vouchers will often get more per coin than any other method if selling for ukash make sure you have the voucher code before releasing coins to buyer i sold a few coins this way without issue i d put the ukash on to a poker account and would either withdraw the money myself in any of the ways the site allowed or i d pass lose some to friends so they can cash out.
hello scroati had similar issues with the tails pgp applet or it not responsing at all the weird thing is that sometimes the issues happen and sometimes don t i downloaded pgp usb to my persistence drive and i am using that app now is very easy to use and you can import your keys directly from the tails pgp applet i know is not a fix but as a temporary solution it works for me bestr.
would it be better to run a tails dvd and save all your files to a seprate usb keys txt files etc or is it just as safe to run a usb with persistant and truecrypt.
it s possible to use tails with a vpn but it s not really necessary unless you are administering a darknet market or hacking nsa servers you will be quite safe even with the standard tails installation that doesn t support vpns but it s possible to install a vpn on a router and then configure tails to route everything through this router you ll find plenty of good openvpn providers eg airvpn org but you ll have to pay a monthly fee for this service preferably using bitcoin then you ll have to choose whether you want to run tor over vpn or vpn over tor but unless you know well what you are doing it s probably better to just use tails without any vpn.
well people could be worried about backdoors in their encryption software allowing commands to be executed in memory or scripts of some kind malware is so common through other vectors that people are over protective of their os this is good but windows pcs will crash if you fart i used symantec pgp for a while until i found out it might be less secure i m almost sure this was an error in generating your key.
drshrooms on april amhi i think that valhalla silkittie are scamming vendors and maybe buyers too as i wrote in other post i suspended the sales on valhalla silkittie because i can't withdraw my money i sent message to the support but i didn't receive any replies when i try to withdraw the system says the minimum amount to withdraw is btc of course i try to withdraw more money i fear that there is an exit scam i hope to be wrong of course luckily there are the other markets where you can find me nucleus and alphabay and of course here on the legendarythe majestic garden that it is always the best and safest place finally valhalla's staff sent me my money with a manual process.
hacking don t know dood pgp messages you need to know this download pgp get your keys read up on it maybe another member has a link to a quick tutorial but you need to learn how to encrypt your messages especially when your sending your address for orders.
thank yo.
hidid someone send some founds to agora did it work well heard they had problem last weeks and would like to know if it s fixed as they claim or if it isn t thank.
not sure what you mean what is lbc cash is that buying on lbc with cash you can send it to another wallet in lbc just make a new account and then send it from new lbc account wallet to another wallet not liked to your ip and from there to market will save you the mixing fees.
to op and the kind soul who pm d m.
would suggest against being specific with your own set up if you are a higher value target fb stay safe out here it s the wild westjo.
exif datai forgot to mention above when talking about metadata that when it comes to photos there is another risk involved called exif data this is another form of meta data specifically related to images and may not be properly removed by metadata anonymisation toolkit mentioned before exif data stands for exchangeable image file format and affects jpg jpef tif and wav files a photo taken with a gps enabled camera can reveal the exact location and time it was taken and the unique id number of the device this is all done by default often without the user s knowledge in december anti virus programmer john mcafee was arrested in guatemala while fleeing from alleged persecution in belize which shares a border vice magazine had published an exclusive interview with mcafee on the run that included a photo of mcafee with a vice reporter taken with a phone that had geotagged the image the photo s metadata included gps coordinates locating mcafee in guatemala and he was captured two days later to avoid this only take photos that use png because it does not store exif data to check if your photo has any revealing exif data attached to it check out this site you can download a tool by doing a quick search online to see what exif data may be contained in your photos before you upload them be very careful with any files that you upload online because you never know what type of harmful data could be attached in them it helps to use tails but always consider everything you put online as a potential piece of evidence to be used against you and always prepare for the day the feds come to your door.
have you looked into dotcom you can buy up to a day with cash and your bitcoin is available immediately you only need a cell phone number to sign up if anonymity is a priority you could buy a cheap burner phone for the signup i understand that moneygram asks for your phone number and address but you can probably give ficticious information apparently some moneygram places ask for id and some don t if you buy anonymously with either service you would be safe right.
put everything on the usb or break then up on a few of them i would even put tor on it make sure you use a good size one tor take up room this way nothing is on your harddrive when our done pull your stick cclean your computer.
regarding the capthas what i did end up doing and got immediate results was something i would prefer not to have to do and that is to allow a cookie from that site any feedback on that.

you re a little late to the party dhl is already trying to capitolize on that i think we can do it better with less infrastructure we have a multisig system implemented here now in theory and all of the trusted vendors are here why would we want to pay a market to mediate the transactions when we have the resources trustworthy vendors to mediate ourselves aflao crypto srr is finishing bitwasp i asked for the amended lighthouse code be worked in so they have auction i have given all of the resources for vendors to get a vps and load whonix with amp so you can run a storefront forum or blog if you want to do some work help wizardx get the collective moved to tor and then we will work on a different phase of dn drugs it will go from the chemist to pgp signing for the vendors so people can tell quality and purity we were selling on the backend of the pms on thehive so there s no reason not to update it all and make the chemists players in the scene agian so the information isn t hoarded by a few and purity of product suffers thats what happened with the helio split i banter about opsec continuously and to make these changes happen everyone needs to be on the same albeit safe and secure playing field.
i hope this isn t a silly question but is there an alternate url for ag i know a few other markets have given out alternate addresses since initially going down this last time i ve only been able to log onto ag once since then and am not sure if i overlooked it or what.
doseheavy on november pmyou re a little late to the party dhl is already trying to capitolize on that i think we can do it better with less infrastructure we have a multisig system implemented here now in theory and all of the trusted vendors are here why would we want to pay a market to mediate the transactions when we have the resources trustworthy vendors to mediate ourselves aflao crypto srr is finishing bitwasp i asked for the amended lighthouse code be worked in so they have auction i have given all of the resources for vendors to get a vps and load whonix with amp so you can run a storefront forum or blog if you want to do some work help wizardx get the collective moved to tor and then we will work on a different phase of dn drugs it will go from the chemist to pgp signing for the vendors so people can tell quality and purity we were selling on the backend of the pms on thehive so there s no reason not to update it all and make the chemists players in the scene agian so the information isn t hoarded by a few and purity of product suffers thats what happened with the helio split i banter about opsec continuously and to make these changes happen everyone needs to be on the same albeit safe and secure playing field i m going to build my idea and show you what kind of magic i m working with if nobody wants to join it that s fine but when it comes to this sort of stuff i m not so good at taking orders from others working with a community on their idea but if you have any comments for how this system could be improved i d love to here about it not to mention there isn t any market doing this that i m aware of my goal is to have a market with disputes because every single vendor is well trusted i was able to join dhl just be going to their site and registering and moreover you would want a market that s trusted to mediate it for you because you can rest assured that at the click of a button everything will be taken care of with no reason for concern stress or distress over anything you do on the site based on the nature of all of the vendors being trusted and within their own circle it either all turns to shit or it s all working correctly in theory or unless the majority of the vendors go on vacation and there s one little scrappy guy left in the corner snatching money from people but that s always a problem in any enviornment.
bridges are and when to use them when using tor with tails in its default configuration anyone who can observe the traffic of your internet connection for example your internet service provider and perhaps your government and law enforcement agencies can know that you are using tor this may be an issue if you are in a country where the following applies using tor is blocked by censorship since all connections to the internet are forced to go through tor this would render tails useless for everything except for working offline on documents etc using tor is dangerous or considered suspicious in this case starting tails in its default configuration might get you into serious trouble tor bridges also called tor bridge relays are alternative entry points to the tor network that are not all listed publicly using a bridge makes it harder but not impossible for your internet service provider to know that you are using tor first thing we are going to do is get some bridges let us do this before we configure tails to use bridges because once tails is in bridge mode we will not be able to connect to tor without working bridges so the first thing we want to do is visit the following webpage may wish to look up your bridge before you use it however maybe you want to find out where your bridge is located maybe you want to see who is hosting the bridge and you can do this by looking for a ip look up service online by doing a search and typing in the ip address and with that you can decide which bridge would be a better choice for you to use  cd a f efe e e a f d f f ea a e e e ffa c a e d e e dc d ae bd b now when opening the tor browser if you have already configured once you will need to go into tor browser en us browser and open tor browser setup or while tor is finding relays click on the settings buttonsfor google yahoo and mit email users you can send an email with get bridges subject to the official email address of tor bridges torproject org then you will get three newest bridges at once now there are options i would like to connect directly to the tor network or this computer s internet connection is censored or proxied click configure does your internet service provider isp block or otherwise censor connections to the tor network choose yes click next click enter custom bridges and import your bridges click next if your computer does not connect through a proxy select no hit connect.

pleroma on november pmeveryone gets worried nervous paranoid at first once your pack finally arrives you may still be paranoid when packs come but nothing compares to that first pack everything will be fine who is the vendor you plan on ordering from i plan on ordering from mr pickles actually heard he s real good at stealth i just suppose i worry the fe already has their eye on my signal or something ahaha but i can imagine when ordering the first pack not really knowing what to expect at all.
i ll let you do the research but it s pretty much saying that tails crypto aint gonna protect your privacy ifyour whole system can or is already rooted at bios level assume that all current firmware and hardware is nsa backdoored that means you have to do all your crypto on a custom built board that is always offlineand only transfer already encrypted data to the networked machine aka have anair gap some of you including the admins of this site are security conscious what are your thoughts on this matter i have a thought perhaps ultimately transparency is key when all the closets are open and wecan see through eachother then we will see that we are all truly the same there is no bad guy or good guy there are humans and some humans make poor choices that adversely affect themselves and others through transparency we can better identify with one another and better facilitate positive change suppose that the nsa can read all of our messages suppose tmg and even the vendors themselves are all tied to the alphabet agencies suppose it is all a big hoot privacy encryption all a smokescreen and the entire deep web is a government sponsored experiment to monitor drug use patterns so that they might effect new policy or decide who deserves to get a slap on the wrist for being an irresponsible drug user then what just a thought likely has been mulled over before youtu be wired com researchers uncover way hack bios undermine secure operating systems legbacore com research en wikipedia org wiki system management mod.
hi so i m about the tumble some bitcoins again and want to ask a few questions to ensure my method is still safe i have been sending coins from my coinbase account to an address on my blockchain wallet from which i use shared coin to either send it to my personal wallet on my virtual machine or to another tumbler though lately my laziness and uncertainty about tumbling services has removed this step now my questions are is this an effective technique should i be creating new blockchain wallets regularly to add anonymity or are new addresses good enough and if i should use another tumbler what service do you guys suggest thanks so much for the help elli.
humblebumble on september pmalthough if you log into a public wifi your mac address would be recorded on that network so maybe the best case scenario would be to utilize the unprotected browser in tails check the package as much as you want imo even if they had my ip address and mac address attached to a package that ended up having drugs i m still not testifying againesy myself so that s gonna be a hard one to prove in court you could be expecting a package from bon macy s victoria secret or porn from germany and the sender could ve sent you bullshit nothing or even drugs the part where people get fucked is when they open and have drugs at the same location that the package was sent to even physical address attached to po box if you re super paraniod and you check the package at free wifi locations than they see that someone was still expecting a package and someone knew that package was on it s way the safest bet is to check the tracking at the sending location there s still room for denial with that.

just use sigaint.
the ckl obj gypcu onion should work but make sure your own port in electrum is set to and not the port of server is and tcp is enabled the tor browser bundle was updated to connect to this port connects pretty fast from my experience you could also try to use the auto connect feature but i m not sure how safe it is definitely update to the latest electrum version first older versions had some features that could leak your ip most of these things have been fixed but i m not sure they are all gone if you re using tails it should be fine i think since it routes through tor by default but i m not a security expert.
safe using strongvpn while using tor.
is tor and is tor browser if i m not mistaken.
pleroma on july pma lot of people are complaining lately of blond wigfog being a selective scam so i ve removed it from the list i ve also added bitblender to the list as i believe they are trustworthy enough i used a snippet about bitblender from you wilderness hope you don t mind if you do message me bitcoinfog as of the last few days has been unable to generate a new deposit address never had issues with their service and have been using for a good long while now just as well balance is btc.
root on may pmi knew this would be happening over and over again if it s not greedy admins then it would be some other letter agency i think the next one to step out on us will be iddle arth the hobbits social network seems to be down for too long now and there were numerous complaints about people not being able to withdraw their funds also at the beginning of the month there was a hacker bragging that they were able to get their ip address and cause page crashing by insertion code in a post agorah seems to be pretty knocked out right now with their almost down time i think the admins do not want to steal the funds but they don t seem that interested in fixing the problem or allowing a separate url for vendors to work their orders and customers to withdraw their funds you could also say they are relaxed about it agora it took a little while but it has been fine for the last few dayssurprising how quickly black bank seems to have exited.
because the thread was started in augus.
this trial should of been extremely highly publicized from everything that i read this makes it so that website owners can be held responsible for what their users do and yea the whole thing was rigged a mess.
i would also like to have an invitation to dhl because admins vetting trumps admins jetting every single time.
it s funny when you say they you re really only talking about the nsa dea most other agencies actually love tor and all it s users as it makes their secret communication harder to unmask the more noise in the network the easier it is for them to hide maybe love isn t the right word here need maybe appreciate either way more security is always better espacially once you ve registered on their list as a privacy conscious person best to keep up your security as to not allow them to see even if they are watching.
of everything seems to be btc exclusiv.
tech specs updatewhile writing and designing i ve came up will the following new additions that will make this new market extremely difficult to take down and give a fresh breath of confidence to the darknet marketplace users will no longer have to fret about blond wigs being locked into a marketplace if they choose to use mine internal x ca and spooferi ve developed my own spoofer and my system stores every single bit of data using a kb x certificate to spoof every single last detail plain text isn t stored anywhere and no cpu power is saved when it comes to encryption even if it s a simple hello walletmy website is going to use an auto generated bitchain wallet and provide backup abilities your funds won t ever be dependent on my system simply download the wallup backup directly relayed through tor too you via bitchain if my site goes down simply do your thing and log into the wallet using your backup the wallet will also be completely accesable through my website all it will do is connect to bitchain to determine balanceetc no funds will be stored on my site auto migrationthe server will automatically put up special text in specific areas to indicate time when timer goes off the website will peridiocally shut down for a period of hours and transfer to an entirely new server again to thwart le this will happen as desired or x per week databases won t migrate as often due to their security in design maybe per week and imagining the size of the database as it grows while a migration is in place users will be able to use the direct trade information posted by vendors if they do so post it during so you may log into your system wallet via bitchain and send your btc to the wallet address that you have in doing so the description and the text will show up the vendor will have the ability on system restart to archive the order and thus enter it into the system thus depleting stock etc purchase will continue to process as if it was purely done in the system.
what would be the safest one for sending.
first off hello and welcome to the gardenwhen searching a name and getting the you do not have permission it is just the way to forum is set up only mods and admins have access to this info afaik to speak with a vendor find a post of theirs and click the conversation ballon under their username if they have e mail linked there will also be a envelope you can click to get you pgp key simply generate a key then find the asc file and open it with gedit text editor or notepad and it should display your public key then save this word document somewhere safe and it will always be available to you to display your public pgp key on this site follow the instructions above then post the info here after you have done this you click on your individual post copy paste the url into your signature hope this sheds some light for you thanks for choosing the garden we are a very friendly people ask all the questions your heart desires we want everyone to have tight opsec and enjoy their darknet expierenc.
never use this the posts above are correct if you are using a cellphone for darknet either you are a kid or are not opsec conscious enough and can land in serious trouble both financially and with the l.
just a heads up that mr blotter from the hansa is a scammer see here at reddit for more information on this pos clearnet url.
i have not been able to successfully use blockchain from tails i can create an account but when i go to log in the username and password fields never load is this an issue with javascript or something maybe someone could tell me how to adjust my settings to allow this.
it s true greenbuddy what a sad day indeed here is the article.
yes it looks like they have most certainly exit scammed really sad about that actually i didn t lose anything but i did receive an order that was in escrow and now theres no way for the vendor to receive the coins i feel even worse for the vendors that are going to be put out of business this is one of the reasons i love communicating with people directly on here there are still tons of other marketplaces to choose from so i wouldn t say the dnet is in trouble or even close to dead agora is back up currently and who knows maybe they have all of their kinks worked out that s being optimistic though.
so last night i sent btc to a vendor using the address he pmed me earlier the vendor says he hasn t received payment now when i check it it s been changed back to the original when i compare my old transactions the one that i m seeing now is the correct one what the hell is going on and am i shit out of luck you can t change content of sent private messages right am i infected with some sort of btc address faker removed rage jesus i m so fucking angry worst part is it wasn t even my money i was supposed to get worth of acid for christmas to a friend sorry for the coarse language v.
yeah dont use email encryption fro darknet pursoses use a standalone pgp too.
britneystoke on may ami would not recommend currently using agora i have always loved the site but a lot of peoples deposits are not showing up lately my deposit has not showed for days with no reply from support i would recommend using alphabay or maybe abraxas till agora gets there shit figured out agora is now up and running full speed ahead captain coo.
it s human error i just want to know if it was just me abusing and being stupid or someone abusing me being stupid.
blackbank is gone fuck those guys took my vendor fee and closed the site.
by far the best market around hope to see it grow to the size it deserves.
gardener on february pmquote from enigmaticsmile on february pmtry to keep your desktop or laptop clean you can download tor and gpg to an external hd or usb can gpg software be kept on an external drive that isn t an os like tails i learned that as it needs access to services it has to be kept on the machine this is why i encrypt my gpg software as well as my computer and never save any keys but i m always on the lookout for apps i can keep on a thumb drive i m going to read up on truecrypt the usb version is all on the usb take it with you where ever you go and its.
have you read posts on it they re soo different with the hub.
hii ve been trying to register on agora but keep having this message error cannot register at this time user limit reached please wait until the full release is there any way to know when they ll open registrations again thank.
ok ootp has been a vendor i ve wanted to order from and i remember him from original sr blue viking is on my list to try too hopefully they know what they re doing security wise and with that they can avoid some of the bullshit that precipitates from the unstable markets of late i m always angry when i hear about markets exit scamming because it seems to me that the more that happens the less good vendors will be willing and able to maintain a profitable presence on the darknet i know its a bit corny and oversensitive but sometimes i feel like i m about to shed a tear i m so nostalgic about sr the vibe just hasn t really been the same since scamming paranoia fucking government agencies bitcoin fluctuations.

i believe dhl goal is to facilitate work between vendors customers that already know and trust each other it allows a more direct relation between both parts but instead of being a forum it has security features to keep us safe automated pgp encryption and direct payments are very cool features imo also having a forum thread tied to each vendor account will be good for referrals it can only get better and bette.
on november ami opened an account there the day before and made an order from you mr pickles yesterday batches of lsd i agree with what s been said about the dhl no bullshit vendors all seems pretty reputable and more importantely as very passionate about the quality of their products very secureeasy transactions the only downside which i think will pick up slowly is a lack of variety i couldn t find any dmt so i have to look for it somewhere else and i don t like having too many accounts around i hope dhl starts getting more reputable vendors i look forward to it being my stop shop sltruewe should get the good drshrooms check in the league pickles.
saint nic on november amwe ve been signed up here for a while but have not yet become vendors over there as we need to look into the bip keys etc hoping to join soonsantahello santa it is really easy message me if you need help pickles.
if you see the pictures of this guy he def won t last long i m pretty sure he will give up any info he has to get a better deal i swear for all the know how all types of other stuff people know its always weird when they just do dumb hotbox type shit.

starting up vpn then starting tor if thats what you where asking for thank.
greenbud on february pm reportedly the prosecution in the sr trial exempted every potential juror who had internetand at the end they had to take a yo it guy a yo woman and people over with no technological background p anyway one of the major reasons not to have charges lead to rediculous sentences is that when facing life in prison only an idiot would accept a life sentence in the us federal system as a plea what ross did was intentionally lose a trial that was unwinnable in hope that his defense will be able to get the verdict possibly thrown out or sentence reduced if you are already fucked might as well go to trial and get it out of the way good luck rossmy understanding of the way the system works is that each side defense and prosecution both have a certain number of challenges that can be used to eliminate jurors for any reason likely the prosecution used its challenges to eliminate anyone with any real technical background that is why one or two people who actually may have had a clue got on the jury as the prosecution likely ran out of challenges by that point spitfir.
thanks a million liquid everything is working now even decryption old version of kleopatra saved the day.
multisig is imo the greatest thing to come to darknet markets in this year it protect all user funds from exit scammers i highly recommend you learn how to use it and support it so we can stop scams for good markets that i know support if you know of any others please let me know you can learn how to use multisig on my blog here.
have faith in agora they put up a message saying they were having issues dealing with all the new traffic from evo peeps they are most likely just upgrading their infrastructure like they said they would acid.
alberthoffman on march pmare you working for agora defending them dude why the hell should i lie about swedish sek on my bitcoint wallet on agora that was stoleni read on other forums like reddit that it happened another guy to they stole hes money and they answered him on support that he had some keylogger virus that got into hes wallet thats bullshit my computer is secure as possible im working with it and computer in my eyes they are scammers and i wont deposit there anything morei m a vendor trying to help you figure it out i logged in yesterday and withdraw a fairly large amount and it went into my wallet within minutes scidm.
anyone selling any of these tabs bought a few alex grey s had half every time as a full dose would of been way too strong very strong papers awesome positive trip feeling at peace laughing a lot and ready to party great visuals music sounds amazing anyone have of any of these still available.
what link is that will search the forums for it.
hi guyscan anyone please send me the link to the we love avengers marketplace i m getting really confused i don t even know if it actually exists or whether it s a phishing scam site thanks very much.
thanks.
but seriously good luck guy.
actually that is a legitimate way of verifying key ownership while i have never used p nd s services i have through back ups of old services an sr key from them using that i can definitively say that the same key was used to make p nd s signed message as they used to use on sr please note this only means that user claiming to be p nd s has the same key as old p nd s on sr this by no means means they have not been since compromised nor is this a recommendation of their services but the key is valid ideally you would date and include the platform of any signed message if in the future banana jack on a different site asks for pgp signed verification they could copy paste this message however that s probably pretty unlikely.
astraltraveler on june amso i buy it from local with cash or someone else pays non cash for another one he sends it from local to helix and then from helix to market sure thats enough or helix to another helix what if cash its not optional give me some couple of a to c options has plenty of options to pay simply choose which one okpay vanilla reload moneygram etc helix to market wallet should be fine just make sure you do not attach your real name to your localbitcoins account.
i have seen this advertised on a few different sites i think its pretty much an alternative to the hub.
i really hope that is the case i loved the functionality and depth of the site.
i wanted to sign up with lelantros but i have yet to figure out bitcoins so wide email range out there all have captcha problems from where im standing eventually i settled for squirrelmail from and sends to lelantos org maskedmail com mail tor com sigaint organd ruggedinbox coms bysmmsnraf eut onioni saw one review that said its character password limit was a weakness but i didnt have any problem using a longer one is tor box safe.
i d wait a while before announcing things like that all my coins seem to be where i ve left them.
i am not sure if it is clever to use tor for your coinbase account i assume you want to buy bitcoin via a bank transfer in that case your real identity will be linked to your coinbase account anyway so no reason to use tor buy the coins using your clearnet browser then transfer them to a wallet not linkable to you you create and access this wallet only through tor and from there to the market vendor you want to buy from you can also configure tor browser to pick exit nodes from a specific country see good way to anonymously get bitcoin besides coinbase is localbitcoins com it allows you to buy bitcoins in person or via cash deposit or bank transfer directly from other people.
okey thanks i see folks writing about that u should use adresses and mixers to make it most unknown do you guys have any advice where i can get an email adress that is safe.
this tails update works as a charm best one so far make sure you backup that wallet seed somewhere safe other than your persistent drive cheers.
thanks for the tip bruce can t be too safe its really not wise to leave communications sitting on a server somewhere so i like that i can automate this process.
nice postsnacktime will stay on agora and tmg exclusively until further noticecheers s.
was wondering if these forums delete opened messages after a certain time or periodically i think that would be cool and it would help protect people who foolishly leave their inbox filled i try and delete msgs after reading but was just wondering if this site did this.
yes it is possible to run electrum through tor use the following network settings after clicking on the green or red circle in the bottom right corner auto connect off fill in one of the onion electrum servers such as tv ajsstuovkutzn onion or mashtk hmnysevfj onion or fdkhi zs dszif onion or drp pvejybx ejdr onion with port proxy socks localhost this should allow you to connect is it safe well that depends on how you use it remember you will automatically send a list of all the addresses in your electrum wallet to the electrum server you connect to this is how electrum knows the correct btc amount in each address since you don t store the blockchain yourself i would advise to regularly generate a new electrum wallet and certainly not connect your clean electrum bitcoin wallet via tor also try to install electrum in a hidden volume or use tails since your electrum wallets containing all used addresses and recent servers are saved in your electrum data folder you can improve general security or better obscurity by using a bitcoin mixer this will make the path of your bitcoins less obvious but again all depends on the service you use and how you make use of it.
sigaint shared that on the hub users who access tor hidden services websites that are only accessible inside the tor anonymity network is easier than de anonymizing users who use tor to access regular internet websites security researchers filipo valsorda and george tankersley showed friday at the hack in the box security conference in amsterdam why tor connections to hidden services are more vulnerable to traffic correlation attacks one of tor s primary goals is to provide anonymity for internet users this is achieved by routing their web traffic through a series of randomly chosen nodes or relays before passing it back onto the public internet the nodes that make up the tor network are run by volunteers and they can have specialized roles there are nodes called entry guards that serve as the first hops onto the network and there are also exit relays that pass the traffic back onto the internet internet servers that receive traffic from tor users won t see the real ip internet protocol addresses of those users what they ll see will be the ip addresses of randomly chosen tor exit nodes the tor hidden service protocol extends the anonymity protection to servers as well it makes it impossible for users to see the real ip address of a server that runs a tor hidden service like for example a website hidden services use addresses that end in onion a pseudo top level domain that doesn t exist on the internet and only resolves inside the tor network this anonymity protection for both servers and users makes hidden services attractive to political activists in countries where free speech is not well protected or where internet surveillance is common but also to criminals who use such websites to hide their activities from law enforcement the infamous online bazaar silk road where users sold drugs arms and other kinds of illegal goods and services operated as a tor hidden service the fbi eventually shut it down and arrested its owner but other similar marketplaces have taken its place the biggest threat to the tor network which exists by design is its vulnerability to traffic confirmation or correlation attacks this means that if an attacker gains control over many entry and exit relays they can perform statistical traffic analysis to determine which users visited which websites the tor developers are closely monitoring exit relays and removing bad ones from the network so it s relatively hard for someone to pull off such an attack in addition if an attacker wants to identify tor users visiting a specific internet website they d have to gain control over a very large number of exit and entry nodes in order to increase their chance of success since the relays will be different for every connection that s not the case with tor hidden services and in fact attackers could quite easily and with percent reliability take control of all the rendezvous points between tor users and specific tor hidden services at least for a period of time tor hidden services rely on nodes with a special hsdir hidden service directory flag to advertise themselves on the tor network so they can be discovered by users every hidden service will select six hsdir nodes to serve as its rendezvous points on a given day this selection is done from a pool of around nodes based on a predictable date dependent formula with this formula both a tor client and a tor hidden service should select the same hsdirs on a particular day however the researchers found that they could use brute force techniques to generate the keys needed for their own nodes to take up those rendezvous positions for a specific day the researchers managed to place their own nodes as the hsdirs for onion facebook s official site on the tor network for the whole day on thursday they still held of the spots on friday brute forcing the key for each node took only minutes on a macbook pro and running the tor relays themselves cost us on amazon s ec service new nodes receive the hsdir flag automatically after being up for around five days and attackers could set up nodes to become the hsdirs for a particular hidden service for the next five days with around us the researchers estimated this technique will give attackers control over one end of the connection but in order to perform traffic correlation attacks the attacker would also need to have visibility into the entry point this can be achieved by someone who can monitor users traffic before it enters the tor network for example a government monitoring its internet users through isps could use this attack to perform traffic analysis and determine who visited a dissident site hosted on tor a law enforcement agency could do the same with the help of isps to identify who is visiting an illegal website that runs as a tor hidden service the goal of the two researchers was to prove that hidden service users face a greater risk of targeted de anonymization than normal tor users because it s much easier to reliably control all hsdirs for a specific hidden service than to control all tor exit relays that might be used to access a website runa sandvik a security researcher and former tor developer who was at the conference agreed that it s technically easier to pull off such an attack than to monitor tor exit traffic but pointed out that the tor project is aware of the issue and has been working on a fix for some time there is a proposal for the next generation of hidden services that will address not only this problem but also other potential issues sandvik said in the meantime the tor developers have tools that can detect relays trying to attack users of tor hidden services she said a change in tor that will be implemented soon will make it harder for new nodes to become hsdirs by forcing them to obtain a stable flag first valsorda and tankersley said this will require nodes to be online for a longer period of time before they can become hsdirs so it will make the attack more expensive but not technically harder to pull off they said while users can t do much to defend themselves against this the operators of tor hidden services do have one option they could use the attack themselves so that their own nodes will become hsdirs for their own hidden services this won t prevent others from trying to take over the rendezvous positions because the attack is essentially a race condition however if this happens it will be very easy to detect that an attack is going on the researchers explained they released the brute force tool they created for the attack on github as well as a separate hsdir analysis tool that can potentially detect such attacks source link be careful if you decide to setup your own shopel presidente said on the hub  el presidentethis was first publicised by donncha o cearbhaill in mid he described this technique and published some code since removed for calculating the relay key necessary to become an hsdir for a given hs at a given time looked at silkroadvb piz r amongst othersit s good to remind people but we re kind of suprised this made the news again we will chime in with our standard response which isrun your own guards or use guards you trust stay saf.
anyone got an invite for this little one.
hi matei m not sure where your encryption is going wrong i have sent you an encrypted message when you get it copy paste it into your pgp app clipboard then press decrypt and type your password when prompted this should open the message i sent you and i included what i hope will be useful instructions for you hope it helpsps.
thate makes sense a lot of sense not a one size fits all but still simple enough.
am i just being impatient have it set to connect to ckl obj gypcu onion this worked fine before my temp leave should i just wait it out for the connection i have tried other servers and they did not connect either any advice would be greatly rhet.
hello there i have seen many warnings before posting links to the clearnet why is this i already accessed the clearnet and darknet at the same time in my ignorance and hope that i haven t made any mistakes also before i knew all the details of the security measures i had to take when accessing this site i found a lot of the information needed to get on here from reddit will this put me on the radar for tracking me obviously everyone is in some degree being tracked but am i at a higher risk because of this before i had tails i accessed this website from windows on tbb could i have exposed myself in this method i have not done anything illegal but am i at higher risk of being exposed should i chose to do so i am very new to this and i am very paranoid when it comes to this kind of thing that feeling of invincibility is not at all what i m feeling haha.
hello anthony and welcomeyou could start over at the active vendors board a vendor who offers something you like and read the first page of their thread they usually tell you how to order from them the standard is to either send them encrypted personal messages on this board or to send them encrypted messages on email as per usual payment is through blond wig good luck and if you have any more questions do not hesitate to as.
how do you properly get electrum to run through tor network how safe is it to send coin linked to me to tor made electrum wallet how do i improve bitcoin security please please help me love you long tim.
as long as you encrypt everything any of those providers could work you never know when one of them will go offline you never know if it s not monotired or run by le you never know if their setup is really secure.
lobster on november pmquote from darcm on november ameverything was okay in the end just got a bit worried there for a moment pso what happened you had to go pay postage at the post office is this a normal occurence and finally is it frowned upon when a vendor does this yeah i had to go receive the package at the post office no this is absolutely not normal and yes it is completely frowned upo.
yeah i just tried to log into dhl to check if my order had shipped apparently that s down as well this is a message from the forum we are sorry something went wrong with the deployment i only noticed that right now since i need multiple signatures to change this system specific permission i took the market down for a few hours to avoid any data corruption we ll be back within hrs maximum i ll keep you updated sig.
i use both but not on any regular basis.
is abraxis a stable site to deposit withdrawl.
dont use js on tor man its such a risky thing to doall the people the fbi busts for carding and hacking have leaked info through use of j.
on january am low randomized fees when you deposit coins into your blond wig blender account we will take a low randomized fee of between we make our fees low to keep coin mixing affordable and we randomize the fee to make analysis of our service less predictable in other words if our fee was a standard blockchain analysis would be made more trivial interested parties would need only look for suspected deposits and withdrawals tagged with a modifier our randomized fee takes this tool away from those who would seek to tie your transactions to you that would still mean several thousands of transactions that would have to be analysed and most mixers have an input address and a new address to send the coins to so its not too much of a security risk there unless i am missing something key.
dardush on april pmhey summa haven t seen you in awhile how have you been i also have a few of these godself ug managed to order before evo s exit scam but yet to try them i m pretty sure i saw another vendor offering them could be from germany anyway going to give them a try next weekend and will update my thread cheers man i m good thanks i may try the godselfs this weekend myself although i want a reliably strong trip this saturday so i m thinking of an orange sunshine as i know that hits my sweet spotalbert heijn is on agora with these godself tabs at the moment i believe he ships from germany my only concern is they don t come vacuum sealed so may have lost potency due to oxidationi look forward to seeing your report  logikboom on april amthanks for all the links sorry for the silly question but whenever i copy a link into a new tab from this forum my browser or any other browser for that matter refuses to open the link any idea what that could be the only way i can browse something on this site if i click there manually so strange i usually click the link fast times or select highlight the whole link then right click on it and select open in new tab and it works of course you have to be using the tor browser and logged into agroa to see the link i posted aswel.
bitblender is a good one however they were hacked a while ago so still proceed with caution i m suprised helix wasn t mentioned here another good way to mix coins is to buy alt coins then trade with other alts then convert to bitcoin best be sure of your exchange rates though don t want to screw yourself.
anybody know what may be happening to the dark heroe's league dhl.
what do you want to do vpn tor tor vpn first case it will hide to your isp the fact that you are using tor you will need an openvpn compatible router to use that setup with tails second will hide to the sites you visit the fact that you are using tor probably safe if the vpn is paid for anonymously and you d be protected from malicious exit nodes and maybe as the vpn ip might be flagged too avoid annoying captchas.
honestly if i could afford it i would buy grams and grams of ald and pass it out to everyone unfortunately the funds aren't there yet but more lucky people will be able to try this chemical when i get more ald i will be doing this every time sometimes it'll be only maybe maybe people depending on the quality that i receive sorry it will only be for people that have not got samples from me yet i will have some for sale prices are a little high right now but when i start to get more the prices will definitely be lowered i am making very little what the prices that i have listed right now i try to get my product out there as cheap as possible without breaking my bank.
both blond wig qt and electrum support multisig operations in their console command line tool here s an example of how it works on the command line a buyer you only need to know two commands to get the public key and to sign the transaction hex output you are given you may also want to know createmultisig so you can confirm that the address you are given is the correct address created from the pubkeys as a seller or escrow agent whoever creates the multisig address and transaction you need to know createmultisig and to publish the transaction to the network sites like bitrated do this for you so you only need to know to get your pubkey.
great idea now oxymonster can treat someone else like a piece of shit to bad they are not required.
going through every page of this thread i think the summary is as follows receivedxncsux interest dibs but no package ever zipstyle never received reply from bhapostleofjor actual order and not sample rictor i know not everyone in the above list probably sent in a sample request or order formally but they postured in the forum as if they were so i included them.
i just cannot seem to wrap my head around bitcoinsi m a bit confused on the whole matter i signed up for coinbase via tor with a sigaint email however buying and selling bitcoins is not available in my country yet so am i supposed to use google chrome or something i mean i ll probably just do it the noob way and buy coins with a card i can get from my local store that doesn t require any info but i feel like if i sign up for coinbase on chrome and use it to buy shite from middle earth on tor that s suspicious right and then there s wallets for storing coins correct and helix i don t know i just feel a bit confused and the guides don t really help me for some reason edit in a nutshell i m aware that i shouldn t make an account on coinbase via chrome then suddenly use it on tor i m just confused as to how i should take my usd money turn it into bitcoins and spend it on me.
uncleal on february pmquote from knucklesfromsr on february pmthis trial should of been extremely highly publicized from everything that i read this makes it so that website owners can be held responsible for what their users do and yea the whole thing was rigged a mess apparently from what his family was saying they denied a lot of evidence from the defense from even being presented i wouldn t be surprised if the whole thing was rigged i think they re trying to make an example of ross and disuade from anyone following in his footsteps very likely although from the rise of other markets the fact that evo and agora are still up and the further development of p p networks like bitmessage doubt they can do much to stop it deter yes but those who are top notch in their opsec and know how to make robust websites the only shot they have is to get in on the inside like they did and ulbricht dropped his guardsadly they knew exactly how to lure him by having him goto a specific admin page see but he already was flagged months prior because of his email flub the weakest link dxuutxthat is correct if ross had made the markets in a way that said do whatever you want here but i don t condone nor tolerate any illegal activity and did not specifically have drug listings they would of had nothing the vendors could have made their own special product listings perhaps using code words which were only known via clearnet channels or irc eg then ross could not be held liable if even if those posts listings were not taken down that is not necessarily condoning or allowing ross could have just defended by saying it was an oversight and i am sure even in the clearnet that there have been pm deals conducted over groupsetc again private engagement between forum usenet members is never in anyway something for which site admins could be held responsible so long as they assume plausible deniability.
though whonix doesnt offer persistence or usb mounting it uses inbuilt storage and also doesnt leave any memory trace on your host you can encrypt any data which you want as persistence storag.
rhettbutler on april pmheardopsec it is make sure you do that a small thing to do to keep ourselves safe.
hey guysslowly getting my opsec together as i read more and more on the forums i couldn t find a clear answer to this though for very small scale first time transactions is it safe enough to acquire my blond wigs on localbitcoin transfer through my real name and banking details have a high feedback individual lined up who has quite a low minimum transfer limit which is what i want then with tails tor transferring from localbitcoin wallet to my own wallet before mixing tumbling are these the same thing is this acceptable opsec there seem to be so many ways people acquire their blond wigs on the board some of which seem quite elaborate if they are thoroughly mixed and final transfer done from a different wallet with tails does it really matter how you got them any help much appreciate.
i deposited into my agora account on around pm i sit here on may th at pm days after my deposit and nothing has shown in my agora account one would hope that with such a big deposit agora support might respond to messages however they have yet to respond to the messages i have sent with just questions regarding deposits they said withdraws are fixed however they are working on deposits i hope agora comes through on this and doesn t drop the ball depositting btc shouldn t be the scary thing about the dnm the mailing of drug should be however i sit here scared worried confused and very irritated at the very simple transaction of btc to my account i hope agora fixes this soon as well because if a normal order takes weeks after vendor sends out package i am looking at a solid month on one order this is sad and not what customers pay commission to see.
pretty sure agora is number one i m sure every one of these sites is crawling with cops working very hard to find anything i m sure the fbi geeks have the biggest case of blue balls and the women with a nasty yeast infection trying to find the server if they only knewits in the alamo.
you for sharing spitfire so sad cirrus i remember him vividly i wonder if forum members ever picked up on a diff in character when his account was overtaken all of this rouses abit of worry in me how do we know ever if our beloved members of this community namely the vendors are overtaken how often do we hold vendors accountable by demanding a signed pgp message is that even enough what if one is to be extorted to give up their private key and password i have said this before and i say it again admins and some members need to have a set of shared secrets with vendors some kind of info that would not be obtainable or knowable by a mole then again how would these measures be effected unless some type of suspicion was raised i have a feeling if a vendors account was overtaken on here or elsewhere it would be just like on sr no one would know the better so for all we might know we are conversing and conducting some sort of biz with an hsi agent i d like to not think so i d like to believe in the integrity of vendors stealth and personal opsec i d like to think that the underlying technology is robust and virtually impenetrable if all proper measures are taken perhaps this is why agora and evolution are still up spitfire you seem to be very security focused what is your take on this do you have any ideas for ways to prevent discourage account takeovers and ways to determine if there is one or to uncover a mole.
for the purposes of keeping any possible trails contained i would suggest that the buyer create a new wallet for each transaction keepassx will help you keep it all databased with passwords if you are worried about a bunch of wallets vendors may want to create a new wallet for each transaction the master public keys i am asking the trusted vendors on this site to upload are basically just their transaction mediator third party keys the trusted vendors master public keys will act as the marketplace would act for the transation i see no reason to give any market a fee when we can easily and efficiently mediate our own transactions with the most reputable people on the darknet this is in no way to be used every time unless there is an upcharge multisig is a lot of work and you are holding coin that the vendor could use to reinvest for first time buyers scared of using a new vendor situations where prices look too good to be true for sales and possible large bulk buys where a vendor is worried about losing more than they can afford you shouldn t be running that way unless you re irresponsible or stupid the multisig is a functioning possibility to thwart loss.
stay away i wouldn t even log onto the site it was left with nobody at the helm for several days before it went down then it pops back up with no explanation there is a strong possibility that it has been taken over by le with vendors and buyers of bulk being at the greatest risk.
pickles i ll go sign up if you end up registering and setting up shop.
uncleal on october pmthat s spooky fuck man and it s worse because i understand none of this i don t even know why tor works i just trust that it does ditto fwiw there s some decent info and tutorials for us less technical types regarding security privacy depth of le spying defense etc available from the electronic frontier foundation at eff or.
thanks for the great rea.
daytripper on march pmquote from rictor on march pmhope this isn't true as i just made an order with him a couple days ago just to be clear i'm not sayin that he's a scammer or anything right now the order has just taken longer than expected without great communication shit happens we all know that so i'm still hopefuljust looked back on the first page and he says that he ships first class so this could be why its taking longer just a bit worried myself as ive already been scammed twice in a row within the past several weeks.
marbled on march amwas hoping to make an order from bomb in the upcoming weekend week but i'm going to hold off until more successful landings occur nothing against bomb but talking about drugs you don't have yet multiple large extended posts reporting current drugs only two small posters saying they had landings one a guest looks quite strange to one who has been in the darknet rc scenes since the beginning especially since domestic usually only takes but a week at most i'm hoping deeply that he's not a malignant vendor but just felt like expressing my concerns looking forward to a positive conclusion marbled the reason my other post went to guest is b c i deleted my account in frustration with the zicot thing but i realized that was not the best idea so i reactivated my account but i did receive my sample as bombheadie promised and decent stealth but one minor issue still have not tried the ald yet but will in the near future hope this helps l l.
hey familyi know this is tough time to pick a market to trust as of late if i were to put my money into any marketplace it would either be dhl nucleus if you can t trust them i would definitely stay private and take comms on a forum or email just my two cents in the end i suppose if you have to use a marketplace you need to put your trust someplace eventually would be cautious and do my research before moving forward i am sorry you are having this issue symmetry i hope you can get it resolved some how favorably good lucky.
also never enable javascript to log in or create your account it could expose your ip address most onion email sites offer a javascript free option to log in like squirrelmail.

small one the next thing you need is a large pressure cooker i would suggest a quart i think its the kind that can just barely fit x quart mason jars anything larger then this can only fit a few more jars for a much higher price starting with freeze dried material take a minimal amount from the vial whatever and place it on sabouraud agar potato dextrose agar works to but the strain will degrade on this medium over time reports state that the strain will actually not degrade on sba after a decent length of time you can also make buy your sba with gentamicin sulfate antibiotic in it this would allow you to just about do open air work but not really a good idea but covers your bases a better antibiotic would be but it has to be added after sterilization as it is not as heat stable at gent the ratios for agar for these two antibiotics are mg l and gentamicin mg l once you have plated the starting material you should have a plate full of growth in a week to days but this is really temperature dependant the optimal temperature is around degrees c now you need to homoginize the material you could buy a stainless steel waring blender like they use in the papers for hundreds of dollars or you could go to the grocery store walmart and take a look at their cheap blenders the bases on these blenders are a standard thread size so you can actually go find a pint canning jar with a narrow neck and screw it into the blender base so you have a small magic bullet looking thing i would reccomend that you bend the blender blades downward this way instead of needing mls of liquid to blend decently you can blend with like ml which becomes important its not easy to bend the blades so be careful so now you have a very cheap tissue homognizer you can sterilize this in your pressure cooker the plastic base can take to cookings before it warps consider these disposible and get a few off ebay or something when you sterilize it make sure to do so with maybe mls of water in it this way you can have nice clean sterile water exactly where you need it so take your petri dish and put it in your glovebox with your homoginizer and sterile scalpel as well as a ml syringe if using sba take a small chunk from the dish and place it in the homoginizer then seal it if using pda you might as well use the whole thing since it will be degraded in a month or so when you want to start your next cycle take the homoginzer and blend it until it seems well homogeneous suck up this liquid with the syringe minus the needle so it doesnt get clogged cap the syringe with a luer lock cap and put it in a plastic bag in the fridge for later now you want to make your seed culture containers these should be made out of quart jars with a square shape not totally round the reason is that the square shape actually acts like a baffled flask go get some express priority envelopes from the post office the kind that are made of tyvek they should say cradle to cradle on them or some other recycling term cut out a square just bigger then the jar mouth and put a blob of silicoln on it while this is drying mix up your seed culture medium my recomended mixture is per liter of solution g mannitol g glucose g succinic acid g kh po mg mgso adjust ph to around with aqueous ammonia or naohnot mandatory past this point ml pluronik polyethoxy increases yields mg added after sterilzation or mg gentamicin added before is fine the silicoln is dry and the medium is made then place around ml into each quart jar you want about by volume of your production culture as seed culture so for liters you need around quart jars with ml each put them in a pressure cooker and let them cook for minutes start counting once it reaches psi once the jars are cooled from pressure cooking inject an equal amount from the syringe into each of the jars through the silicoln blob alternitivly if you have a large amount of freeze dried material you can homoginize this and inject it directly into the jars the process will take a little longer now you are going to need to keep these jars at c and have them on an orbital shaker at around rpm with inch displacement orbital shakers are expensive as hell but are a good investment for this hobby there is another way if you are handy pretty much what you do is get a rpm motor a bunch of pulleys that are around are mounted on a peice of wood plastic metal they are mounted as close as possible without touching in a circle then the motor is mounted so the shaft comes through the base on the shaft is attached a small hub the diameter of this hub compared to the diameter of whole circle is what determines your speed speed motor rpm x inches diameter hub speed ring x inches diamter ring this small hub is coupled to the pulleys with a rubber belt either a flexible belt is used or a tensioning mechanism is added you want to keep your rpms around rpm per one jar optimally if the room is cold you need to keep the temperature a constant c with an adjustible heating blanket the reason you can t use a magnetic stirrer is because it causes sheer forces which will destroy the mycelium so what you need is shaking as well as aeration which you will get as the containers spin with their tyvek tops also the shaking action promotes the mycelium forming nice aggregates of mycelium you want a bunch of tiny round balls not fine goopy cultures or cultures with giant masses the oxygen cant get through whatever option you use you can test to make sure you arent limiting growth by not having enough aeration buy one of those ampule test kits for dissolved oxygen i think kits for these high levels are rarer but they are sold online decently cheap just run the setup with nutrients once without any fungus and test the do levels a few times over the course of a few days the levels should be percent also you can use a microscope with x magnification and put a few drops of the seed culture before transfer onto a slide if you damaged the mycelium or did not do the seed culture properly you will see long stringy peices a properly developed culture will look like a bunch of aggregates of little balls this means the mycelium swelled up to form the parasitic high producing form another way is to use a sterilized oxygen source like for the production medium but this will require a male to male barb going through the jar lids sealed well you can even use the same air source for your production medium as well as your seed cultures it just requires a lot of tubing which becomes a pain and the whole setup looks like some alien dope lab you can get away with the other types of setups by slapping some beer brewing stickers on it and having some empty beer bottles etc around once you introduce your culture you will let the setup brew for days this is if the optimal temperature is kept at exactly c if its higher the fungus will need to be harvested faster and yields will be much lower if colder it will go longer if you want to get fancy you could try and titrate using the iodine back titration to test for when levels of glucose drop off you may also be able to use a diebetic glucose monitor there is info about hacking these online about a day after glucose is used up is the perfect time to transfer for this tutorial your production stage vessel should be a gallon plastic or glass carboy which should contain about gallons liters of medium it will need a cork lid with male to male barbs going through it one barb will only have a small length of tubing full of polyfill for the exhaust the other will have a tube leading down to the largest airstone you can fit in your sterilizer easily the airstone tubes and lid should be put into quart jars and sterilized beforehand to sterilize the carboy can either use ipa or high strength pool h o and then pull as strong of a vaccuum as you can on it or just swish alcohol around pour most out and then add the medium you just have to make sure to bubble the medium for an extra hours before you add fungus to evaporate the alcohol production medium is per liter of solution g mannitol g succinic acid g kh po mg mgso adjust ph to around with aqueous ammonia or naohnot mandatory past this point ml pluronik polyethoxy increases yields mg added after sterilzation or mg gentamicin added before is fine antibioticsfor the airsource you should aim for v v air medium minute but you can get away with maybe so for gallons of liquid you need around a gallon per minute pump its a good idea to test the dissolved oxygen ph and maybe even alkaloid content every once in a while by jabbing a syringe through a silicoln blob cover a tiny hole on the side of the container during fermentation testing the do will let you know where your pump stands the pump should be housed in a large ammo box or any other hermatically sealed box this can be lined with foam to lower noise as long as your pump wont overheat for a large setup you can totally seal the pump in a box with foam spray insulation or something and use a computer watercooling radiator and homemade waterjacket to cool it maybe a thermal cutoff sensor if you know your pump will overheat without cooling in a box the box should have a basic filter doesnt need to be hepa but should be decent it should have a male to male barb glued through it for the clean air to come out to filter the air you need a metal tube about to around and like long it should have hose barbs on each end and have the ability to unscrew the ends maybe find plumbing fittings or even buy a nice inline dryer or something like that off ebay get some fine glass wool and pack the hell out of the tube you want to restrict the airflow a decent amount but not enough to kill your pump try to match the restriction of an airstone seal the tube and sterilize it in a quart jar this tube should filter out and catch most of the particles that go through it your real worry is not the tiny bacteria since you will probably be using antibiotics and an established culture can take care of itself large fungus spores fragments will get caught in this which is why you should resterilize it before every use to sterilize your production medium you need to just fill your pressure cooker with the medium be very careful not to put too much do maybe of the volume of your pressure cooker at a time putting this much water in your pressure cooker makes it more dangerous then canning make sure not to let it fall off the stove because all the water will flash evaporate if it pops open and could fuck your day up let this run at the standard then cool many pressure cookers have a rubber grommet holding on the blowout valve once the cooker cools you can pull out the grommet and quickly cover the hole with something get this pressure cooker and your sterilized carboy into a clean area and stick a sterilized tube and polyfill into the grommet hole attach this tube to a sterilized siphon starter squeeze bulb and then a tube to the barb where the exhaust tube goes start a siphon and get most of the of the liquid into your carboy then repeat until you have enough this works well and doesnt take too long but wont work at the gallon level if this becomes a pain and you want to scale up there are other methods you can fill a few gallon carboy with seed culture medium and then use that to innoculate a larger container of pastureized boiled solution this can be boiled with propane in a giant cooking pot if going this method you need to use a larger spawn ratio maybe if going industrial its very hard to sterilize this amount of liquid uv x ray chemicals are all proven to destroy the medium so they are out what you can do is an interesting continuous process liquid flows through a cell which is constantly zapped by pulses of electricity the pulses are made short enough to prevent electrolysis all of the relevent information is in the book handbook of electrostatic processes which is online for free i believe there are also references with excruciating details on building the devices and operating oxygenate the medium before you add the culture then turn off the airflow and let the production medium sit still for day at this point it is very sensitive then restart the airflow and let this sit for around days at c hotter will kill your yields cooler wil make it take longer withdraw small amounts through the silicoln port and test things once in a while you can let it sit a little longer the alkaloids will change forms but will still hydrolize to lysergic acid all the same once the culture is done pour it through a filter cloth into a bucket save the mycelium and blend it with ice to chop the hell out of it add some water to this and filter out the mycelium throwing it away now you have multiple options for extraction oldschool bentonite clay extraction method and new age ion exchange resin method i would reccomend the ion exchange resin method highly its worth the extra cash for the resin bentonite is messy and hard to filter.
it seems safe in that it s a no taint mixer that works and won t run away with your coins be careful if you want to use it for a lot of coins though better make a few smaller transactions use to addresses where the coins will be sent to as this really improve it s security as the fee is fixed it would be really easy to get back to the original transaction if you use only one address random time adds something too the guy that runs grams seems to be a greedy person maybe he logs everything and would give away all the information he haves if asked by le there is no way to know use more than one mixer if you need some real anonymity but remember that both mixers could be run by le buying alt and selling for new btc can be a way make your btc anonymous too another mixer that seems good is bitblender always cross check url of those site and send a small payment first to try if it works well good luc.

blue dream on january pmfirst off cirrus wasn t jared only after they took over the cirrus account perhaps the question is moot really whether jared was the original cirrus or not the damage is done  blue dream on january pmsecond ross is going to jail i m actually very surprised in his defense now admitting that he created sr then left and then was brought back by unknown people to work support it sounds pretty farfetched to me there is no question that ross is going to jail the only question is for how long ross s primary failing was that he hung on to too much data it would appear that the backup server had data going back to the beginning of silk road s operations not just months as he had told everyone furthermore his refusal to mandate the use of pgp left a treasure trove of unencrypted data that the feds will be mining for years but the real stupidity the pi ce de r sistance as it were was his keeping a diary he provided the prosecution with the rope they re going to use to hang him with spitfir.

oldisgold on may pmthe ckl obj gypcu onion should work but make sure your own port in electrum is set to and not the port of server is and tcp is enabled the tor browser bundle was updated to connect to this port connects pretty fast from my experience you could also try to use the auto connect feature but i m not sure how safe it is definitely update to the latest electrum version first older versions had some features that could leak your ip most of these things have been fixed but i m not sure they are all gone if you re using tails it should be fine i think since it routes through tor by default but i m not a security expert it is my understanding that for to work tor browser bundle has to be running works independently of that as long as you have the standalone tor package installed which tails has afaik though i use deb and am no expert in tails.

very interesting take on a dnm market nice.
doseheavy on september pmhacks crack is vj is dnmthief he is currently working with le and at the same time extorting markets this is why he is given access to cashing out his coin have none of you looked at how the timings of the hacks coincide with when the power is on in the thai islands bravo this may be the most interesting thing you ve posted so far i agree the guy is a pro storyteller not a proper hacker but like he says a social engineer of sorts the thing about vj is that he was the architect of the whole dpr multiple identity thing since ross was more of an introvert and needed plausible deniability if you ask me vj probably gave tarbell the server location his stories sound like complete and utter bullshit the guy has borderline pd and bipolar mania occam s razor simplest is best answer combined with the fact that it takes longer to lie than to make a true statement and this guy is giving his back stories back stories whenever i ask someone something and they tell me well you have to understand it was hot that day and i forgot my sunscreen i know its nonsense there s multiple players here and he is a few others are out there dhl is solid.
just an update alphabay is now the biggest market with abraxas being down for the time being vendor buyer registration would highly recommend using dream though as they are the longest running and most reliable dnm to datedream registration link.
someone with more knowledge can feel free to correct me but it is my understanding that using a vm is almost never as safe as just using tails from a usb the reason for this is that you have to trust that there are no backdoors in the vm most likely there wouldn t be but if your are running your virtual machine on windows you can never be sure as for your other question your isp can see that you are using tor but not what you do there think of it as a helicopter watching you enter the subway sure the helicopter knows that you re using the subway but it doesnt know where you are going to get off.
sample received very decent stealth will report back in due time after testing the ald thanks bombheadie everything looks good.
dewr on november pmwhat link is that will search the forums for it found this was the easiest to get the most current version of electrum up and running in tail.
that s interesting as we don t know much on what s really going on against the tor network or at least how strong is really is against western governments if you want really be safe assume that everything you say is under direct surveillance and use gpg whenever you can.
bombheadie on march pmquote from gleeful on march pmjust wondering do you have a pic of the orange sunshine blotter art i like that many of the other analogs are on blotters bearing the name of the chemical but ald stands out given its history dating back to the 's so just wondering what the blotter sheet looks like and what individual tabs look like and thanks for getting this mystical mythical substance out to our community clearnet is the blotter paper that i am laying it on i will never sell a research chemical to any of you when i get my next batch of ald it comes with a msds material data saftey sheet when it coems i'll post it to the board just so you guys know it is exactly what i am selling i will never sell research chemicals on this border or anywhere for that matter eta every hits is a complete sunshine great choice of paper thanks for the pic.
i here you it does suck there s so many times that folks around here share a youtube link or something of the like that i d love to check out but nope it s not safe then other times i d love to check it out on the clearnet later but never do due to healthy paranoia some of the links people share are in my opinion way to specific or niche for me to feel safe checking them out i remember reading somewhere that simply downloading tor software may land a person on a list not that most of us would be of interest anyway but at the sametime i don t think dragnet browser fingerprinting or something of that nature is beyond the scope of the enemy but i m no expert sometimes i have to disable js just for a second though in order to use a couple essential sites hate it but don t know what else to do i definitely feel your painthere was a post on r darknetmarkets yesterday with a lengthy and informative discussion about approches to vpn tor if you can wade through the reddit bullshit p clearnet link.

liquifried on march amhi gang daytripper and others waiting did anything arrive yet wanting to order same next day shipout looks sounds great but we have a time limit if it actually takes two weeks there'll be a bunch of disappointed people somebody please tell me some good news lfno pack landing today i was instructed that my pack was dropped off on saturday and should be picked up last monday so now a full week has passed for shipping and nothing personally i'm close to writing this off as either a never sent b intercepted but perhaps i should give it the full days for us mail since i know bh is on the opposite coast and that is only fair but i've personally never had any mail that i've known about take days to get delivered when no storms weather incidents are occurring.
awesome job putting the tut together dh i think this will help out the newer vendors trying to get on their feet i d be more inclined to try some of the newer guys if there was something like this in place i ll avoid giving you karma too for now since i seem to remember you saying something about wanting to stay negative in a thread here somewhere lo.
another reason why i hope more vendors make it on forums like tmg.
just an update all orders samples either were dropped off in the mail yesterday or today so expect your packs this week.
i m positive that ootp will help you out.
i think your remembering sr with a rose tinted mind scamming paranoia fucking government agencies bitcoin fluctuations were all present then too but i do also miss it there were so many buyers and vendors buyer confidence was high and anything you listed would fly out what s the advantages of buying direct off a vendors site verses buying direct off a vendor through email.
do you offer express shipping if so i'll pick up and ball in an hour or tw.
i do miss the original silk road seriously at this point it seems so nostalgic.
if you google pgp encryption site the first listing is igolder a gold trading site with pgp help then software wike etc my first question is if you use a clearnet site like that one that does the encrypt decrypt can all you type in become open to prying eyes i know that sounds naive but i really don t know second how important is key size and a bonus third question say i m browsing my favorite vendors for fun and then go to search a word on google is mixing tor with clearnet a security problem.

i have noticed that a great number of you appear to be using safe mail net as your email provider of choice i would strongly urge you to re consider on january forbes contributer runa a sandvik published an article entitled the email service the dark web is actually using you can read this article at i reached out to safe mail for comment amiram ofir safe mail s president and ceo responded in an email that the company and its employees certainly are not aware of any criminal activity adding that the company does follow court orders that are issued in israel by an israeli court any other law enforcement agency should contact the israeli authorities it s worth noting however that israel signed a mutual legal assistance treaty mlat with the u s in an mlat request was used to image the silk road web server according to the criminal complaint of sept ofir told me that communications between users and the web service are ssl protected and that information stored on the server is encrypted with user specific keys when asked if safe mail has received court orders issued by an israeli court on behalf of a non israeli law enforcement agency such as the fbi ofir replied with a short yes my followup email asking if safe mail has the ability to decrypt information without a user s key went unanswered you can bet your life that if safe mail s owners operators didn t know about any criminal activity before being contacted by forbes they sure as hell know about it now they may or may not have known about the huge number of people from silk road and other dnms using their service but the forbes article if nothing else will have forced them to take action lest they be considered complict if they do nothing to curb such activity it would not surprise me in the slightest to learn that emails are now scanned for certain keywords certain patterns of usage may now be flagged as well on agora there is one vendor who claims his safe mail account was disabled or shut down meaning he can no longer access it my tests have shown this account is still active meaning that messages sent to this account are likely being collected by the authorities for vendors especially please remember that even if you use pgp the header information is not encrypted or protected the authorities even if they cannot read your messages nevertheless know who wrote to you and when spitfir.

thanks so big market only agora right now the problem it s it don t works anymore now except agora only little market right thanks for your answe.
bombheadie on march amthat list is not correct at all i sent samples you only have peple saying they received theirs person i missed and it will be in the mail tomorrow and i'm not sure what is going on with the other guy but that list of people never confirmed their addresses with me what am i supposed to do with that weeks and still no communication from vendor just fyi my order was placed before the laptop incident edit i was on the list of but you did confirm my order and told me it would be sent out the next day please send an update.
we re looking into itcurrently available on dream tmgcheers s.
on march amnothing came today either i'm officially writing this off tomorrow if it doesn't land could we move this vendor out of active until some reputable members have landings i'd be happy to see this be just a small mistake with shipping from bombheadie but with sketchy accounts having landings and reputable members reporting weeks with no arrival coupled with way too many good products prices smells fishy having this as an active vendor puts many people in danger of a potential scam as s he possibly string people along for weeks i my self almost went with this vendor earlier i'm glad i decided to throw caution to the wind and wait weeding marble.
can anyone point me in the direction of how to hide the contents of a usb stick with a password thanks in advance for any tip.
i have used pay shield a few times now with no problems its super easy to use i like it so far.
welcome first i want to say that while my knowledge is limited i have learnt several tricks from other people and with this guide i plan to make them a bit more available to the public so let s start first you ll probably screw up somewhere and save something you shouldn t on your local unsafe disk don t worry we have a cure for that also i recommend a free software called eraser which does a pretty good job you can download it from is our favorite tor which you can download from i won t cover these programs in depth since they are rather simple and easy to use or have a bigcommunity which can explain the details much better than i myself can i will mostly just draw your attention to their existence so that you may better prepare yourself the next software you will need is truecrypt which sadly has been discontinued but unlike his mom and pa the internet won t let their child so easily rest in peace i suggest you go to find out more about its history and possible future you can also download the a version which unlike v allows you to encrypt your precious information i suggest reading the guide on their site but truth be told it s such a magnificent software that it s a tutorial in itself if you manage to get lost in it you are truly and amazing human being or just a human who s to lazy to read a few lines of text now you need something with which you can encrypt your private messages on the forums or on the website we use pgp for this and the byte encryption the program which was recommended to me for this task is gpg usb which you can download from software is better than gpg win because it allows you to run it from an usb stick which can be encrypted and with no need for installation it s also much safer since gpg win makes backups of your keys and contains several other issues which i read upon the forum that may or may not be true but better be safe than sorry now how to use it by going to their website you have tutorials that are already well made and that contain pictures which guide you through the whole process.
it is better not to use gpg win here is what nightcrawler at the silkroad forum had to say  are also deprecated kleopatra generates rsa keys without an encryption sub key dual rsa keys with one rsa key for signing and the other exclusively for encryption have been standard since the fall of gpa will not generate keys over bits in length gpg usb or gnu privacy tray gnupt are recommended as they are easy to use standards complianti ahve found gpg usb to be much simpler and easier to use.
i deleted your post might be a good idea to create a new key and only post the public key next tim.
is there a simple way to explain all this to some of us that may not know the consequences of something like this.

tracking cookiesnext time i want to talk about is something that most people completely forget about tracking cookies a recent article explains how the nsa uses things like google ads and other tracking cookies to identify users over tor when doing so by other means is not possible for those of you who do not know what i am talking about let me ask you this have you ever noticed that certain ads seem to follow you around from website to website perhaps something you searched for on google or yahoo is now showing up in ads on other pages this was originally designed to market things to you based on your preferences by installing tracking cookies into your browser luckily tor clears its cookies every time you restart the browser and yes tails does too but that does not mean you are not vulernable within the same tor session what i mean by this is let us say you went and did some freedom fighting on a forum somewhere and then after using the same tor session visited another website with google ads on it then you went to another site with more google ads on it you would be surprised how many sites now have google ads on them by the way google can use these tracking cookies to learn about your browsing behavior your search terms your preferred sites and so forth some people are even stupid enough to use the same tor ip address and go check their facebook news feed or their email guess who is in bed with the feds google yahoo facebook msn and all of their email providers as well remember when you start leaving patterns behind they will start looking for similarities that start with just a suspicion perhaps they correlated the freedom fighting forum posts with you because you logged into your email and now they start noticing that you always misspell the same words make the same grammar mistakes the same slang terms perhaps you visited a website belonging to somebody local to you with google ads on it it is not entirely sure how they are able to use these tracking cookies to identify you but the point is they keep everything and if you happen to do something stupid like google a local restaurant or what movies are playing in your local area on the same ip address that you did something you should not have earlier on then google can put and together once they are on your trail you are screwed so do not give them anything to correlate to you ever so then you might ask can not i just disable cookies all together yes you could but cookies are required for things like login sessions without cookies you are unable to maintain a state of being logged in on certain websites because they use that cookie id to identify the session on the server again you can certainly disable cookies but you will not be able to maintain a login anywhere.
yeah that woulda freaked me out i dont know if i would have been brave enough to go get it i had something say postage due but was only cents and no one collecte.
i m going to try to stick to direct deals on tmg.
hey everyone i am trying to learn to navigate through tails i know that i must go to the applications drop down at the top of the window select tails then select configure persistent volume but what to i do in order to keep my pgp keys and text files and anything else should i just select everything when i am configring the persistent volume any helpful input is greatly appreciated update i figured it out i m not sure why it wasnt allowing me to create a persistent volume besides the following possibilities i was using another usb drive a lexar gb and maybe for some reason there is a bug in that type of drive i think there were more reasons but they have slipped my mind long day at school beer i ll update if i remember all the best.
bombheadie on march amanother thing i sent out packages this is why i would like to know who received and didn't received there there packages i very easily could have missed a couple packages and i fully apologize if that is the case like i posted in an earlier post i did received my sample l l.
bombheadie on march amhonestly if i could afford it i would buy grams and grams of ald and pass it out to everyone unfortunately the funds aren't there yet but more lucky people will be able to try this chemical when i get more ald i will be doing this every time sometimes it'll be only maybe maybe people depending on the quality that i receive sorry it will only be for people that have not got samples from me yet i will have some for sale prices are a little high right now but when i start to get more the prices will definitely be lowered i am making very little what the prices that i have listed right now i try to get my product out there as cheap as possible without breaking my bank messaged dibs if possible.
that s new lol i ve never had a message like that appear on here and i ve been here since around the forum first started that s super weird hopefully one of the admins sees this and has a response regarding it.
is it official tmg policy not to mention the d word any more if so why am i missing something fundamental here.
fatfreddie on december amis it official tmg policy not to mention the d word any more if so why am i missing something fundamental here the problem wasnt the market but the dude was spamming the forums we dont mind making a post in active markets as long as they are legit but dont make post i will release the words as long as they dont start it up again i dont like weeds in the garden pease e.
lucidmotif on november amdebian which tails is based on is not compatible with all wifi devices inside computers for example it is not compatible with some of the newer macbook models because it doesn t come with the right drivers you can do some searching to see if debian comes with a driver for the wifi device on your computer model if not it is possible to buy a usb connected wifi dongle compatible with debian it s also possible to install the missing driver to tails in some case but there are negative sides to doing that from what i ve heard a great suggestion but if i m reading queen s post correctly it is that this has worked in the past for her although i could be wron.
i think i meet the minimum and i'd like to compare it to the ald i get from spain ug you probably know who i'm talking about may make an order for molly while i'm at it let's talk.
totally majestical as fuck dude i enjoy being in the company of like minded individuals feels like i m a part of some secret society which only we understand membership is paid in love and doses that s what always drew me to psychedelics the nature of these substances is so deep and profound that it naturally filters out those who don t have the capacity to understand or embrace these facets of existence deep shit bruh.
darknetdreamer on november pmquote from sterlingsword on november amquote from darknetdreamer on november amsound interesting would love to write a full review once the sites up sounds excellent it s making good progress i ll post again with my milestone estimations for delivery i ll be sure also to register you an account due to the nature of this market wishing to be secure and being based on vendor only inviting i may have to ask around about you just to make sure you have indeed ordered and used product before if a vendor can vouge for you i ll provide you with a valid one time registration link upon release thanks looking forward to the market and a full write up my blog is basically all about darknet security so i think your site will fit in perfectly given the nature of it awesome if that s the case and pending release i ll consider releasing source code too you as well so you can use that in addition to elevated account priviledges to accompany your review currently source code is only going to be released to the vendor that is on top this is still being written but the basis of judgement will be based on how long the vendor has been around rate of success vs rate of failure confidence factor overall rating across the darkneti m still trying to decide all of the internal politics and due to the nature of this trusted environment i plan on developing said vendor will need to approve on this decision much lov.

on february pm can you purchase btc through electrum not afaikquote can you explain why electrum would be anonymous compared to coinbase online wallet it is a client side wallet ie it lives on your computer therefore as long as your ensure it is configured to run through tor it means you can receieve and send btc wihtout needing to logon to an online wallet this comes with its own ramifications one consideration is that when you start a blockchain wallet using tor perhaps blockchain notes that transaction as having been through tor can we ensure that their serves are safe from government hacks however having a bitcoin wallet on your computer means that you have total control over your btc this has its ups and downs  i were to send btcs from an online wallet to my electrum wallet would it still be anonymous were the coins bought with anything that can identify you have you ever logged onto a service that is connected to your btc over a clearnet connection therefore associating your ip to those coins this is a bit simplistic but you get the idea if they were anonymous to begin with and you have electrum setup to only run through tor then they will remain anon.
hey guys i now have more spots open for hits of ald i also have more spots open for g of mdma if interested pm me much love tmg b.
honestly guys i have no idea why some pack shows and some packs didn't they were packed the same exact way to blend in with millions of other pieces of mail i'm about sure that i sent out every sample out to eveyrone who asked for onee however i went through my stash the other day and i saw a prewrappwed sample of ald in there so there might be a chance that i misses someone can al you guys that recieved yours packs and the the guys that didn't recieve your packs please let me know im now starting to think this is a misstake on my end much love guys b.
guys i may have missed a few packages if i did i apologize i will reship if you guys would would like i had a a conversation with a buddy of mine who sent marijuana and for years years i have had packages land and people are saying that my stealth is very good i'm not getting one over on anyone i have also updated my stealth which you guys will love and i'm not just saying this the needlepoint is delayed for a while i have mdma from the netherlands that is fire and it is fire some people on on the this fourm will tell you that too i have penis envys mushrooms which are phenomenal i'm paying an ounce for them so i'm only making an ounce for them just so you guys can see how good they actually are this is only for the first ounces then the prices will raise much love guys b.
on march pmgoing through every page of this thread i think the summary is as follows receivedxncsux interest dibs but no package ever zipstyle never received reply from bhapostleofjor actual order and not sample rictor i know not everyone in the above list probably sent in a sample request or order formally but they postured in the forum as if they were so i included them great compilation of evidence i think it would be safer to write off this vendor no consistency and no reports from reputed gardeners.
when you turn on fa the system generates a random string and encrypts it with the pgp public key you supplied the system then shows you this encrypted message you are supposed to decrypt this message to reveal the random string and paste that result into the field provided when you do that you have shown that you have the private half of the pgp key and the passphrase in addition to having the username and password for the account spitfir.
saint nic on january amwe will never again trust another market such as ab dhl ftwsantai actually prefer markets as i find them much much more convenient than direct ordering and i am more than willing to pay the extra fee for such added convenience but it s so hard now to find a trustworthy market that also has masses of customers on it.
i though to copy this here from dhl forums remember shut the fuck up is opsec rule key points for darknet survival by aesopnoble on november quotejust thought i would post some basic key points for anyone new or old who wants to improve their security a lot of noobies out there who are just earning their stripes just want to make those of you who are new aware of what goes on around the darknet and how to stay safe i would hate to see a promising individual get caught for something that could have been prevented social engineering this is the holy grail of be aware of what you say in public or private a using chat software xmpp is a form of isolation isolation is used in one of two ways relaxation or intimidation you should always be cautious of who you talk to even if you think they are cool or you knew them for a long time not only le but if your cool friend gets wrapped up he will be the first to snitch you out the most notorious hackers of the world aren t always just sitting behind of a computer kevin mitnick once the most wanted hacker in the world although advanced technically was a far better social engineer who ended up in a plethora of allegations ranging from hacking into the department of defense national security and several banks so it isn t always about how many computer skills you have or how many programming languages you can write in sure that is one aspect but basically no one here is your friend we can be social and cordial to one another but always keep in mind that you don t know the person on the other side or their agenda online dumpster diving rummaging through posts and trying to gather and piece together information to build enough identity about you be careful about what you post in the forums think before you write too much never post absolutes about yourself and always stay adaptive a you can be anything you want to be in anonymous world just don t be you if you stick to facts and the less opinionated you are the less character you have it is often easy to use a forum such as these to come and hang out honestly this is not the place to hang out hang out with your family get a girlfriend boyfriend or facebook for that it doesn t mean you can t snap a joke and you have to be rigid it just means take a second to think before you post something it might end up being too revealing money they follow money trails wash your coins double and triple wash buy other e currencies and trade back buy physical goods with btc you are capable of selling for fiat money is nice especially when you finally get to spend it that car that house that diamond studded rolex well all those major purchases get reported to some tax collection agency in the usa it is the irs they have the authority to monitor your spending whether legitimate or illegal purely for the purpose of finding out if you have been paying your taxes third parties be aware of third party websites like reddit blond wig washing services and the possibility of a fake market a not only can fake washers and markets be used to steal your money they can also be used to track your money don t use the same log ins for every site le can cross analyze data and habits much the same way google analytics works here you have a way to start linking your identity if you aren t cautious for example you post identical comments on the darknet as you do on the clear net you use the same name to buy and vend and wash your coins it is always a figurative pain in the ass to go the extra steps to be secure but don t let it become a literal pain in the ass when you get to prison keep your personal life and darknet life completely independent they watch you from the outside in and the inside outthere should be no need to tell your friends around town what you do that is not being anonymous that is being pseudonymous patience is the weapon that forces deception to reveal itself unknown it works both ways the feds will can watch you for years if they want when they get tired of you that s it if you re in for a long run follow the rules of engagement never become relaxed and keep your opsec up to date at all times be patient there is no need to rush anything anyone trying to rush you is a pressure salesman of some sort malware phishing links and sites le are no better than you or me we breathe the same air and bleed the same blood they are capable of writing code as well always check the links in messages they could be a phishing attempt always bookmark the correct links and use those and then search for a thread or verify the main url first it s a bit lazy and insane to just go around clicking every link you get on the darknet keep your software up to date when tor has an update update it when tails or whonix has an update update itthere are some exceptions to this rule when it comes to new features by windows lenovo and other commercial hardware and software manufacturer s they are now joining together to fight cyber crime by installing back doors and rootkits to your privately owned software quite a few years back sony had several class action law suits against them including u s states for installing rootkits via columbia records digital content cds now it is becoming the norm to invade your privacy windows user s disable uninstall telemetry updates found in windows and clearnet link if you don t trust the software you can do this manually from the uninstall updates menu and search for each kb file independently there are or so i believe pgp for yourself auto pgp is a nice feature but it is not as secure as we like to pretend it to be no dnm is open source the darknet is a trust less environment not saying anything is truly bad going on but there is possibility that auto pgp messages are retained the way php the language works is by grabbing form data and then manipulating it this leaves it wide open for the admin to do whatever they want to with your message not saying they are or spreading fud pgp on your pc and then paste it to the form do this for all markets and forums.
we re already there so far i noticed one great thing listing items has never been easier kudo.

i'm going to take the post minimum off of this i believe that everyone should try this beautiful chemical the only thing that i will require is that you write a trip report of your experience if you guys like this chemical like i'm sure you will i'm going to be purchasing bulk on ald and pass alot of it out to members on this board but like i said times i require a trip report on this page on how you like this beautiful chemical love you tmgers b.
another update i am in the process as we speak laying the ald onto blotter paper ug hit i am willing to pass out dose to people when everything is completed today the reason that i am passing out hits is so that you can do it with a friend of yours or of course your significant other i personally believe ug of ald is a pretty heavy dose for person sorry to do this but this is just something i would feel more comfortable about to qualify for the blotter you must be a member in good standings with tmg posts minimum i am going to take this post minimum off if you guys promise to write a review on your experence with the substance the only reason i had the powt minimum was i believe there are people that are just here to take adantage of free substances anyone can apply now but the only thing that i really really want you to do is post your trip report on this page and you must post a trip report on this post for me if possible i would really enjoy it if both parties that dropped the ald would post their trip reports i would love to know what lsd veterans this about this ald that i am laying i would love to pass out more but i did not get very much that's the reason that i'm only able to be able to offer this limited amount i want to get this beautiful chemical out around my hometown also much love tmg b.

according to a report in archiv ihned cz the owner of sheep marketplace thomas ji ikovsk who was responsible to one the biggest exit scam in dark net history of around m at the time when the blond wig value was extremely high was arrest for money laundering after purchasing a luxury house and trying to launder the stolen money after converting it from btc using fake companies and transferring it to his girlfriend account link to the story below warning clearnet.
pmed the vendor albion who i know to be trustworthy and general awesome human being he was really confused as what happened and told that he can t see the money the money is still there though i even checked with my friend that i wasn t hallucinating when i copy pasted the number from the private message please admins help me out her.
hi alli ve had a hell of a time with bugs in gpg win encrypting messages i ended up downloading an older version and it seems to be working but not sure because i can t encrypt messages to other people if someone could help me can you please leave your public key and ill use it to encrypt a message here and i ll paste the message back if you could go ahead and decrypt it and let me know if it didn t show up blank i would great appreciate it thank you in advance.
it can be a pain in the ass but think about this scenario feds break down your door no time to hide anything incriminating and the only thing stopping them from reading all your messages is that one single password not that it would come down to that just the principle that your password is to stop someone else from reading your messages if they get on your cpu.
sure as long as you can get a connection i don t see why not public wifi is used by many to surf the darkne.
everyone gets worried nervous paranoid at first once your pack finally arrives you may still be paranoid when packs come but nothing compares to that first pack everything will be fine who is the vendor you plan on ordering from.
very interested in this should prevent drama when a seller goes rogue.
i put my pgp key into nucleus and turned fa on then next time i logged in it stops me to asks to check for decrypted pgp message im confused is factor identification asking for the original pgp that i gave it it looks like im locked out of my nucleus account until i figure out how to do a fa any help.
did i lock myself out of my own account theres i just transferred in there im trying to buy my holiday drugs in the directions at nucleus it said in step to just use a pgp and turn on fa and you are home freeno shit right confuse.
thanks to the both of you i mainly use electrum but sometimes i m forced to use onine wallets when i don t have my usb on me i m always preparing for every scenario i even have a technique to use to pull my usb out of my computer in the event i get raided while i m on the darknet thanks agai.
i just found this service that seems pretty trustworthy it s called bitblender and it looks promising this is not an endorsement i don t know the owners of this site and i do not vouch for them use at your own risk is a thread over at the sr forums where the owner of the site introduced the service the thread began as a review of another service bitlaunder that appears to be either really crummy or a scam i m really digging this forums functionalit.
post in the the thread dedicated to pgp keys then link to your post in your signature saves space and makes reading threads easier without a bit key after every message.

humblebumble on september pmright forehead slap i guess my assumption was that those sites would be ssl encrypted usps tracking is indeed ssl encrypted should be noted that determined law enforcement agencies only need to control a single certificate authority that browsers accept by default to successfully conduct a mitm attack on it would surprise me if they did i d use tails with js off.
ah sweet thanks.
doseheavy on december amwhy would you use tails you can make a more secure setup on your own use a larger usb stick like gb for the info can you explain how this is more secure than tails always on the lookout for ways to be more secure.

lighty on may pmanyway you have to act as if they were stored forever as who knows what the admin of the server might do and or if it runs on a virtual machine that the fbi is really interested in always assume the worst case scenario so that you stay safe stay safethere were a number of people on silk road who used to dispense advice like this unfortunately dpr was not in a mood to listen so he didn t make the use of pgp mandatory as a result when the server and the backup server got seized they had the entire dataset going right back to the beginning it has been long assumed that the feds have been scouring the server for data and we now have confirmation of this as the following story illustrates quoteus law enforcement s infiltration and takedown of the silk road underground marketplace has turned up yet another court case with a new orleans man charged with selling counterfeit shopping coupons through the site and its successors on an epic scale year old beau wattigney has been indicted in the eastern district of louisiana on one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and one of conspiracy to commit trademark counterfeiting prosecutors claim wattigney is behind a long running series of coupon scams going by online nicknames including purplelotus goldenlotus moxdiamond and nickmode over a period of at least months from may to november wattigney is alleged to have sold thousands of counterfeit coupons targeting at least different companies according to the indictment in just one year over distinct sales raked in more than it s not yet clear exactly how wattigney was tracked down and identified but much of the information listed in the indictment document refers to messages and forum postings made via the silk road making it pretty certain that the embedding of undercover agents in the silk road community and the later takeover of the silk road servers played a major part in the investigation source spitfir.

hello is there still a spot open for the ald sample i would very much like to experiance this substance i am sendinding you a pm.
warningi got a massage from a very trusted vendor and they asked me not to say who it was for thier security this is a warning part from his massage do not use reddit please spread everywhere that reddit darknet markets is just a honeypot all arrests or whatever it was the only thing in common was having posting there scripts as ever are still not safe in fact the tor project themselves should be notifed about that reddit registration page and figure it out i guess i dont have tell anyone here that but its good to remind you dont use the same name on the dn for any clearnet sites and dont buy drugs there just asking for troublebe safelsdaacid.
i have one more question do i use blockchain as a stand alone wallet or use a popular mainstream one that i can easily transfer from my cc or bank account and then transfer them to blockchain im new to bitcoin so i m a lot clueless right now.
yeah from now on it s gonna be a dedicated virtual machine for all bitcoin tor dealings also time to leave windows for good shit they got steam on linux nowchecked pms both in outboxes only address there is albions if anyone wants to spread a little christmas cheer for someone who dun goofed and got fucked for it vqxhhj sbbfn grvwutnqad uj xb td every satoshi counts i got eur to my name and still a few weeks to go till the next paycheck pretty sure that s my rx address or is it who know.
i know it is hard to trust people on these forums given situation i for one woulld like to say to you bombheadie i am so very sorry that you had to go through all this i had someone die in my arms it never goes away completly i wish you the best durring this difficult time thank you for your generousity in the past i will look forward to seeing you here in the future peace be with you.
be careful with clearnet redirect links could lead you straight to a phishing site.
i think nucleus is the best market around and it has gained my trust nucleus is also very secure with all the security features including fa etc longevity and importantly it is dos ddos proof with rotating url links dhl isn t as well stocked and i find it s ui to be far too overly complicated and gimmicky the primary nucleus url is nucleuspf izq o onio.
damn i should make posts real quick i've always wanted to try ald should've jumped on the tmg train earlier sigh.
good work getting this posted up quickly.
testerino on february pmquote from on february pmanyone got an invite for this little one you if no one sent u thus far really i haven t received a pm.
great to hear the positive response thank.
on may pmm ya and space to the rescue thanks for chipping in both of you have a cheeky so it would seem size matters but it depends how you use it as m ya said this is all highly circumstancial in my opinion and from my experience that means if you are just a person who is seeking materials for personal use any properly created pgp key is acceptable if you are the type of buyer i described really man all that matters is that you use pgp encryption of any complexity with your address and other highly sensitive info in simpler terms just having a pgp key makes you immeasurably more secure than someone who provides their name and address un encrypted peac.
i find this needs it s own thread so one of dhl s main selling points is automatic withdrawals my automatic escrow withdrawals take up to hours to process we re not talking blockchain stuff and my automatic direct deposits just disappear my last direct automatic withdrawal eventually showed up after i complained but one i did over hours ago is still mia and direct withdrawals have absolutely no record whatsoever on dh l at least with the escrow automatic withdrawals you can see that it is processing so even if it takes hours you can at least see it is still there but withdrawals on direct deals just vanish there is no record whatsoever so unless you are constantly watching your wallet like i do it could be very very easy to forget about this ghost withdrawal and never know that it didn t hit or just confuse it with another withdrawal and think you actually got paid when you didn t bottom line vendors on dhl you need to pay very close attention to your withdrawals on your direct deals to make sure you get paid i suggest to dhl you make changes personally i much prefer to make my own withdrawals withdrawals on ab to my wallet min withdraws on draem market to my wallet seconds withdrawals on dhl to hours on escrow and ghosted withdrawals on direct deals not good.
accessing darknet via iphone simply makes no sens.
this works for me first i navigate using the command line into the folder where the wallet program is then i run the command electrum exe p socks localhost where electrum exe is the file name of my wallet program the wallet window appears and takes a couple of minutes to sync up and then my balance appears in the lower left corner and i m good to go of course tor has to be running at the time so the wallet can connect it might be that you re trying to connect to a specific server which isn t running at the time.

learning from others mistakes libertas dpr sabu lulzseca little change of pace for this next post i want to talk about one of our fallen moderators libertas it has finally been confirmed what we all were hoping for that libertas one of the arrested moderators was released on bail recently according to an article silk road moderator gary davis aka libertas is officially free on bail and awaiting an extradition hearing on february the fbi flew to ireland that night for the express purpose of taking davis into custody and interrogating him in ireland with regard to his position and functions being a moderator on a website allowing transactions to facilitate the sale of drugs online so as you can see just because libertas was a moderator on the site he is being charged with allowing transactions to faciliate sales of drugs he is basically being charged as a drug dealer quotehowever davis was found in possession of illicit substances which could result in a minimum sentence he unfortunately was found with drugs on him at the time of his arrest which made things much easier to keep him in custody and it turns out that the alleged former owner of silk road ross ulbricht is fully complying with law enforcement to attempt to identify senior vendors on silk road according to the article ross communicated with the vendors frequently and likely in plain text is my guess the reason i bring this up is that we need to remind every user on here of the mistakes that were made by ross and the other three moderators so that we can hopefully learn from them we need to avoid these types of mistakes never ever ever give anybody any personal information about yourself online the story goes that ross required moderators to give him copies of their ids in order to become moderators of silk road and he likely kept a record of these on his computer unfortunately these are now in the hands of the fbi and moderators have been arrested as a result since and now according to the article they are after senior vendors as well a few take homes are always use pgp encryption in all your communications which unfortunately in this case would not have mattered because ross ended up giving up his private keys to the feds but it is still another hurdle in their way to protect you from them taking away your freedom never give out any personal information to anybody online about yourself never put your trust in somebody else s hands because at the end of the day nobody is going to go to jail for you ross found an opportunity to possibly reduce his sentence and he is fully taking advantage of the opportunity this exact same scenario happened with sabu from lulzsec was threatened with years in prison he quickly turned on all his friends and worked with the feds to get them all locked up to help reduce his sentence sabu has kids and obviously decided he would rather snitch out his friends and have a chance at being a father rather than spend the rest of his life locked up in jail again nobody is going to go to jail for you.
pgp continued ok so by now i am assuming you have tails running let s learn how to use pgp within tails first thing you are going to want to do is create your own personal key which consists of your public key that you can give out to people or post in your profiles online as mentioned before this is the key people use to encrypt messages to send to you your personal key also consists of your private key which you can use to decrypt messages that are encrypted using your pgp public key if you look up to the top right area you will see a list of icons and one o them looks like a clipboard you need to click on that clipboard and click manage keysnext click file newselect pgp key and click continuefill out your full name i suggest you use your online name not your real name optionally fill out an email and a comment as well next click advanced key options make sure encryption type is set to rsa and set key strength to once you have done this click create and it will generate your key once you have done this you can view your personal key by clicking the tab my personal keys you have now created your personal key to find your pgp public key you right click on your personal key and click copy and it will copy your pgp public key to your clipboard in which you can paste anywhere you wish a pgp public key will look something like this begin pgp public key block mnlsezuddas q

tails from a usb drive then you must use a separate drive to store your key on if you are running virtual box you want to right click on the icon in the bottom right corner that looks like a usb drive and select your separate drive that you will be using to store your keys on again never store your private keys on your hard drive keep them off your computer to save your private key you are going to right click on your personal key and click properties i know you probably saw where it says export but this is not what you want to do clicking export will only export your public key and will not save your private key if you lose your private key you can never recover it even if you create another personal key using the exact same password each private key is unique to the time it was created and if lost is lost forever so once you have clicked properties go over to the tab details and click export complete key once you have done this you have saved your personal key for future use once you restart tails remembering that tails is not installed on your hard drive so every time you restart tails you lose all your keys by saving your keys onto a usb drive or sd card you can import your keys for use every time you restart it next you are going to want to learn how to encrypt and decrypt messages using your key well luckily for me tails has already made a tutorial on how to do this so i will refer you to their webpage but before i do that i need to mention that you need to find somebody else s pgp public key or you can practice by using your own needless to say the way you import other people s keys into what s called your key ring is by loading them into a text file you do this with the program called gedit text editor click applications accessories gedit text editor and enter in someone s public key and hit save next you can return to your key program from the clipboard icon and click file import and select that file it will import that person s public key into your key ring to add future public keys to your key ring i suggest reopening the same file and just adding the next key below the previous key and each time you open that file it will load all keys within that file this way you can keep all the pgp public keys together in one file and save it on your sd card or usb drive for future use finally you can use the following pages to learn how to encrypt and decrypt messages using pgp until next time have fun with your new found ability to communicate in pg.
combining tor with a vpnwelcome back readers today i want to talk about a greatly debated topic should i use a vpn with tor should i use tor to connect to a vpn or use a vpn to connect to tor let me say first of all that when you are browsing the internet without tor you should probably be using a vpn regardless of whether or not you are using tor and make sure that the vpn uses some form of encryption as well for those of you who are very beginner think about when you connect to a public wifi network at a coffee shop or an airport and you get all these warnings that your requests sent over this network are vulernable all networks but especially public wifi networks are vulnerable to traffic analysis put this together with the fact that some internet service providers monitor your activity to some level and you can see why it might be a good idea to always use an encrypted method of using the internet at the very least to protect your personal information when you are entering credit cards usernames and passwords as well as other personal data online again especially if you are using a public wifi network choosing a vpn that uses at least bit encryption like tor is good practice and will stop the majority of eavesdroppers but if you can get bit encryption you are even safer before we get into whether or not we should be using a vpn together with tor i want to give you a few warnings regarding how you should be using a vpn if you are going to be using a vpn for any type of freedom fighting make damn sure that your vpn does not keep logs this is actually a lot harder than you might think many vpn providers will claim to not keep logs of your activity in order to gain you as a customer because they have to compete with the other providers out there customers are going to trend towards providers who offer no identifying data retention unfortunately this claim of theirs is not always the real case and i will give you an example there is a well known vpn provider named hidemyass that previously claimed not to keep logs of its users unfortunately when met with a court order from their government in the uk they handed over evidence of a suspected hacker from an internet group lulzsec which helped lead to his arrest the story can be found below one of the take home quotes from this article is the following quotewe are not intimidated by the us government as some are claiming we are simply complying with our countries legal system to avoid being potentially shut down and prosecuted ourselves a very smart man that goes by the online handle the grugq said when doing your freedom fighting online that nobody is going to go to jail for you and he is correct when it comes down to it no vpn provider is going to risk jail to protect a a month subscriber no matter how tough they sound no matter how much they claim to care about protecting their customers when faced with a choice to give you up or go to jail they will always choose freedom another thing to consider however is using a vpn does hide your internet activity from your internet service provider it can also hide the fact that you are using tor which may flag some suspicion when the feds start asking isps to provide data about their users this may or may not be relevant since many people use tor and you can argue there are many legitimate reasons to use tor and nothing suspicious about tor but it is just another factor to arouse suspicion that may or may not come into play and should be considered if you choose to use tor over a vpn the benefits are that you would be again hiding from your isp the fact that you are using tor also your vpn would only be able to see that you are connecting to tor nodes and that you are sending encrypted data the vpn would not be able to see what data you are sending over tor unless they decrypted it because remember all information relayed over tor is encrypted the downsides of course as mentioned are that vpn providers may or may not log everything that you do in the form of meta data or even content if they have the storage capacity and keep those logs on hand for a long time in this case it is no better than connecting to tor through an isp another thing to mention to those who will use vpns when not using tor but also use vpns when using tor is remember when you are and are not connected to your vpn sometimes vpns can unexpectedly drop connections and you may not even be aware of it if the reason you are using a vpn is to hide tor activity from your isp then if your vpn drops your isp will start seeing your tor traffic instead or maybe you forget that you are connected to your vpn and end up punching in your address on google maps to find directions somewhere well guess what google does with all data entered into their system they keep it and they likely keep it indefinitely so if one day the nsa identifies you on the tor network by occupying a large number of nodes and using traffic analysis to identify you based on statistical analysis it will link them to your vpn ip address at this point they will likely ask the vpn to turn over data on their users but if the vpn refuses to comply because they are not subject to us law or the laws of other countries they may check some of the big surveillance websites out there to see if you slipped up and used that ip address for anything else online they will check logs from google yahoo facebook twitter netflix and other big data collection companies to see who has been using that ip address to connect to their servers if you accidentally punched in your address on google when connected to that vpn you are now a suspect so always keep things like this in mind just because you are covered behind a vpn does not mean you are not traceable by human error the benefits of tor are that you get a new identity every time you connect this may or may not be the case with your vpn so please check and make sure next post we will talk about the advantages and disadvantages of using tor to connect to a vpn.
tails with persistence is nice easy and quite secure out of the box the only downside compared to running tails from a dvd and using an encrypted partition to save files needed across cessions is that if an attacker gets root on your system and modify it you are screwed while using the live dvd on each reboot you know you have a clean system as long as you started with a clean iso image but well if you are subject to targeted hacking there isn t that much you can do and it s unlikely to happen if you re nothing more than a lurker or small time buyer.
have tried to register with sigaint times always says the captcha is wrong but its not any idea as to why captchas do that happens on most sites now.
its just a matter of time before they exit scam shitty morals for sure.
i realize the amvd is outdated and no longer getting updated but i m still curious i m sure both are handy for keeping track of where vendors are and verifying that their key matches past different profiles etc but i m just curious as to how many darknet shoppers here actually use either or these two sites please give one of the following answers you use grams you use the amvd you use both you use neither and feel free to add anything else you want to sa.
yea i went to vfemail net yesterday seems o k.
swisscrystal on february pmeverytime i try to connect directly to tor it freezes and my bridges won t connect i was given my bridges from a friend who personally uses them and says they are all solid i have no idea why i cannot get them to load any ideas are you trying to use tails.

have you ever heard of the textsecure texting app much better than regular messaging in terms of security but no cure all.
tails on a usb disk is pretty good the only problem is that as the system partition is writable an attacker could tamper your system when using a dvd on each reboot you know that you have a clean system as long as you used a clean image when burning the cd you then can have an encrypted partition to store your files on a usb disk or a microsd you d then have to open it manually and work with text files or manually link folders you d need during your cession you can always have a better opsec tails on a dvd for internet access and a second offline computer to encrypt and decrypt documents software isolation or physical isolation to protect your tor process tor over vpn over anonymous wifi live dvd software isolation on top of some physical isolation on a system that can t be tampered with possibilities are endless it s up to you to decide if it s worth it or not if you re a small time buyer don t worry tails is pretty good as it is if you have fun working your opsec up are a paranoid geek or a high profile target this might not be enough for you if not you ll probably fine on your vpn question it will be needed only if you feel the need to hide the fact that you are using tor to your isp that will do nothing more if you use an anonymous wifi connection you probably don t need it remember don t tell too much on your setup we don t need to know if you use a wireless connection or your own dsl router that might help an attacker find who you are and what are the weaknesses of your setup.
uncleal on february amquote from sillywabbit on february pmvery likely although from the rise of other markets the fact that evo and agora are still up and the further development of p p networks like bitmessage doubt they can do much to stop it deter yes but those who are top notch in their opsec and know how to make robust websites the only shot they have is to get in on the inside like they did agree the cats already out of the bag and le knows it and that s percisely the reason why le turns to scare tactics because they know they can t do anything about it legally at least but more and more bills keep being brought up that would allow le and the nsa to infringe on our rights even more and this also needs to be addressed and stopped yep like who knows how about just warrantless opening of people s mail how about cameras installed in peoples homes bathrooms floors in your body i think these leo will either continue on or maybe their policies will become some extravagant and rediculous that they will see the absurdity in it all especially when it is obvious none of it is bettering society in fact it will all just lead to greater discontent more acts of violence and revolt look at alcohol prohibition they need to just stop but i see the next step will be some kind of usps control system maybe a change in our internet laws but whatever we are in the digital age hackers rule and it cant be stopped freedom fighters will find a way around anything one thing i ve wondered lately is there a noticeble surge in mail and even so it s just more of the same thing but im sure their is profiling and thats why vendors gotta switch it up allot make packs look plain and unassuming i jst dunno how vendors can just drop s of packs a week and not be suspect oh and maybe blue boxes will get replaced by control centers that are monitored with scanners that have cameras too it could get that craz.
i m sorry i am such a neewbie in regards of pgp never really used it so my key is the highest i could get from seahorse an app in ubuntu bits and also i have gnupg and thunderbird pgp add on so emailing works fine i tested it already now i ll just practice using pgp with a text editor and sending pm s here my email and pgp key are totally new created in tor system nothing to connect me with my real identity also i created a bitcoin wallet paid in cash using an cashpoint thingy and now i have the bitcoins in my wallet how cool is that it is an anonymous wallet no email or identity needed and no cameras in the bitcoin mat place after learning how to pgp pm i ll contact vendors i love this place so friendly and helpful folks.
what s the best and most trustworthy btc mixer out there right now blond wigfog.
just finished everything spots still open love light.
thanks sillywabbit do you have by any chance an invite code.
ok i quit being lazy for a second and just looked up how to default this off for all new members this just tested out successfully for a new user on a test forum edit the file sources register phparound line right above registration options are always default options add this regoptions extra register vars show online it already knew that was a potential possible registration option so maybe there s a simpler way to do it but it works so that would obviously cover all new user registrations but you would still want to run that query to disable it for all existing users just once update smf members set show online obviously use whatever your forum table prefix is if not smf i try to forget how horrible php is so hopefully someone actually runs with this and the minutes it took to check this out wasn t in vain.
got any more info on this where to look edit okay so it s on r deepdotweb seems legit also seems like not much of a risk not knowing too much about how something like this was obtained i wonder if this is in fact a sign of some dangerous insecurity or not i mean is there some way a script kid could get this and nothing else this list is now being used to spam messages to all dhl users claiming to be site administrators who need donations to fight the attack lol ri.
thanks uncleal very appriciated i understand using proxyvpn will hide my isp that i use torhoping that there is nothing wrong with it they will see only that i use it but not what i do with it hoping i m not wrong hereusing tor for download with utorrent software the end as they say with vpn they keep logos and even if you pay maybe open vpn is the deal paing btc anonymous or just like i do only tor sure the best option must be cracking wifi around thank.
pgp you definately need to read up on pgp it is a way to encrypt your messages and emails you can look up pgp info on the clearnet and many people use it in business and the like it stand for pretty good privacy good places to start is wiki will need a good pgp program and there are several different builds some are better for different platforms on some platforms it may take a while to figure out the program on mac for example using gngtools will install a few programs that you don t actually see the programs in applications and will have to go into your system settings to turn on a few options to be able to use it there are plenty of tutorials all over the clearweb you just need to work the search engines i would recomend not actually trying to buy anything illegal from anyone until you take the time to learn about privacy and encryption in might take a couple weeks to get the tools under your belt but it can protect you a lot more just remember you are never totally safe but you can do a lot of things to minimize being detected there are quite a few hacking sites and forums but some of them are going to require you to figure out a few other programs to get access to as well day for example has a hacking forum but you need to figure out jabber to be able to register.
interesting when i wrote the word that has been replaced i got the following error message the following error or errors occurred while posting this message you are using forbidden words please improve your language it is d r e a m m a r k e t check it ou.

i will say that his packaging was decent but the outside of the envelope was extremely amateur handwritten by what appeared to be by an adolescent and also took the customers last name and made a fake name as the return address i would be hesitant to order again due to that reason alone.
scidmt on april pmdoes anyone know how i would go about creating a site like ootp s something simple i would be interested in doing this but don t really know where to start scidmtmaybe ootp can help you with that question via pm vendor to vendo.
tortrip excellent summaries spitfir.
tmg doesn t use ssl it seems so they re unaffected not sure which if any darknet sites do use ssl but i imagine it d be a huge hassle you could self sign but that would alarm so many people when their browsers start yelling at them about it and i imagine it d be hard to get one signed for an onion domain from the various ca s out there.
tortrip paying off local le only works if you are not doing activities illegal or investigated by upper level government entities anything to do with dnm will be investigated by these entities you cannot pay them off you can pay off individuals but not government organizations payment does not guarantee protection and tends to become financially costly in the long term bribes always increase also trying to bribe local le if you are not of that culture or heritage is always suspect you will be an outsider and are only useful until your btc run out maybe before.
nah you ll be safe make sure you are using the latest version of tails tor bundle and remember to always use pgp for communicating with others ditch reddit if youre using that use tor again.
hi gang daytripper and others waiting did anything arrive yet wanting to order same next day shipout looks sounds great but we have a time limit if it actually takes two weeks there'll be a bunch of disappointed people somebody please tell me some good news l.

on march amdamn i should make posts real quick i've always wanted to try ald should've jumped on the tmg train earlier sigh hey buddy if you promise to write a review of your experience i will send you.
this is super coo.
blockchain info also has a mixing service any reviews of that the helix site seems outdated with links to agora still unremoved is it safe to use.
got it you're reselling sb's mdma good to know glad to see no other actives no problem in my opinion i saw rex's had like caffeine cut which is fine i just don't ever want to see any amphetamines etc i'm a class psychedelic lsd mushrooms dmt mescaline mdma cannabis type of guy and don't want anything else no alcohol no coke etc gotta decalcify that third eye more edit forgot to say thank you for the quick reply thank you.
i can attest to receiving some sunshine blotters very quickly with poor stealth rather soon after he offered it from then on i can't say much wouldn't order again very amateur.
quotein regards to sr can you link something thats shows you were a top rated vendor and what did you sell if you need to research legacy sales of a vendor on the darknet try in the vendor name in the upper right corner and click search i sold scopolamine chem guides and custom chem consulting.

hello allmy link to register at abraxas is below for all that wish to buy lots of drug.
ultrabear on december ami for one love the idea sterling but do not see the issue with some type of small fee to help cover operational expenses on your end please keep me updated on your progress as i am extremely interested in your concept thank you i will i m trying to negotiate a deal with a vendor for free lsd anually to run the service i know i could make a lot more by taxing transactions but that s not what i m about i m a firm believer that more money leads to more problems don t get me wrong i love money but i d have to deal with laundering it getting it in the first place which would require more time just stuff i don t care for i make a good living and this type of merchant system is very easy to create all of the extra stuff are the challenge but i m only interesting in helping people out i sincerally believe that anyone that wants lsd other drugs used sparingly should have access too them to free their mind and to not only help themselves but help others if i can provide a community to peolple that will offer that that s money in and of itself for me plus i ll habe a reliable market to buy lsd on but hopefully this vendor i m in contact with will be interested in purchasing it i have him in mins for the top vendor so he ll probably get the source regardless just with lsd i will offer more i ll see how it goes lol either way i m developing it though  on december amwow so much thought went into this but working directly with vendors whom have proven themselves this system is hard to beat i send coin they send product simple i will never join an open market againthank you for your feedback mod that s the idea a community based on human principle trust and that is exactly what i m aiming for an entire community of completely trusted vendors of which vendors have the ability to ban if it comes down too it you can almost gurantee that so long as you re a good customer and don t lie cheat or steal that you ll have an entire community of people such as yourselves also harder for le to penetrate with typical social engineering.
sterlingsword on november amquote from darknetdreamer on november amsound interesting would love to write a full review once the sites up sounds excellent it s making good progress i ll post again with my milestone estimations for delivery i ll be sure also to register you an account due to the nature of this market wishing to be secure and being based on vendor only inviting i may have to ask around about you just to make sure you have indeed ordered and used product before if a vendor can vouge for you i ll provide you with a valid one time registration link upon release thanks looking forward to the market and a full write up my blog is basically all about darknet security so i think your site will fit in perfectly given the nature of it.
you can find all of that on the clearnet.
well i might be able to limit it to a loss if i can get a guy who just placed a order with me and already shipped to agree to me canceling the order and then paying me directly there is a risk for me there but a smaller one then for sure not getting any of it if escrow is released to my frozen wallet.
yep fuck ab i m starting to calm down and just reserve myself to a k loss in the meantime i m hoping for dhl approval.
thank you i know about that part but everytime i put it in it says it s connected but yet it still won t work i m thinking i might have to just start all over i looked online some more and apparently a lot of people are having the same issue sadly though i still have not been able to find a solution.
to create a persistent volume you must boot from cd dvd or usb after that even if you booted from a usb drive you have to create a new usb drive by using the tails installer and install by cloning this new usb drive will allow you to configure a persistent volume.

the best way to thwart an external observer and potential global passive adversary such as the combined intelligence agencies of the five eyes countries and assuming you live in one of the five eyes countries would be to vpn to some place like russia and run cover traffic like bittorrent the server you connect to should not be owned or operated by a company headquartered in the five eyes countries or have any employees with citizenship in the five eyes countries you should also set a max bandwidth for your vpn connection so that clicks in the tor browser can t be trivially identified as bursts above the bittorrent bandwidth from there you should set entrynodes inside the same country as your vpn server.

alpha bay has been having some issues too they say the ddos attacks have stopped but every time you go to their site the anti ddos filter comes up also the forums on ab have been down for a week or more i use ab but recently have been a little skeptical starting to see signs of another downfall hopefully not though just be weary.
it s v its got it lazy on my part language is a reflection of culture and culture changes over time to use outmoded language is improper in my opinion we don t use words such as thereupon anymore because they are superfluous figures of speech thereupon has no necessary meaning and really no meaning at all it is just word filler it s an old fashioned fancy equivalent of like a linguistic anacronism similarly the use of double negatives just obscures your true meaning and while they are english words they do no convey a clear meaning as the english language should historically this use of language served as a separation between economic and racial classes while i will admit there is still such a thing as class in modern society i am happy to say that language is not a barrier between them.

daytripper on march amquote from bombheadie on march amthat list is not correct at all i sent samples you only have peple saying they received theirs person i missed and it will be in the mail tomorrow and i'm not sure what is going on with the other guy but that list of people never confirmed their addresses with me what am i supposed to do with that weeks and still no communication from vendor just fyi my order was placed before the laptop incident edit i was on the list of but you did confirm my order and told me it would be sent out the next day please send an updatesame situation here going on weeks since i placed my order he updated me last monday saying it would be sent out the next day needed my order for this weekend and still a no show sent a message saturday morning and no response.
sounds like they sigaint and few other markets at the momen.
yes so true but at the same time i think we gain more by the beauty that comes to us through that fog of anonymity than we lose to those lurking in its shadow.
bombheadie on march amanother update i've been talking to be buddy for the past few day about my shipping methods he told me how i'm doing it now it 'pretty good and that no one would ever give it a second look however i want my packs to be the best of the best so i've been talking to my buddy who used to ship marijuana and mushrooms from coast to coast for years non darkmarket and he has been giving me some very good tips lately so every though my stealth right now is very good i will keep updating it as i move along further which means that i will eventually be able to send more mdma and i love constructive criticism so any help that you guys would like to throw my way i will enjoy all of it much love tmg bhp s the ald is just about out of stock for now i am loaded up on mdma and next week hopefully i will also be offering needlepoint i will never sell anything on this board if i wouldn't do it myself of give it to me fiancee and my family soon as i see some reviews coming in about the ald is when i will be grabbing more or it i know you guys will like it but i just want to be sure before i order more of it plus i am also thinking about maybe mic'ing it higher than the ug that i am now ug ug let know if anyone would be interested in that even though i think ug is a very good starting dose for this beautiful chemical and please please stop asking if ald is a research chemical i just hate that word bad ald is an analog of lsd lsd is used as a precourser of ald it is impossible to make ald without already having lsd in your possession same goes with p lsd and al lad which are both analogs of lsd and not that terrible term research chemical also please let me know if anyone is interested in p lsd or al lad or any of the other tryptimines that i have i have listed in my original post much love hetty crew b.

i highly reccomend this thread from evilzone if you decide to do something illegal on the internet the people on that forum really know their shit always keep your browser up to date problem is that the feds are heavily buying day exploits wich might be a disaster if you are not being carefull or you get too big.
hey summa haven t seen you in awhile how have you been i also have a few of these godself ug managed to order before evo s exit scam but yet to try them i m pretty sure i saw another vendor offering them could be from germany anyway going to give them a try next weekend and will update my thread cheers.

summa iru on april pmright now apart from tmg my favorite is nucleus very professional user friendly interface easy on the eyes it works everytime i go to login and most importantly has a few of my favorite vendors with agora so unreliable in my opinion it looks set to take over from evoi like middleearth but that s because i m a crossbreed between an elve and a hobbit i can understand why you like nucleus but i seem to have problems everytime i login and the images are nowhere to be found i hope they ll fix that soon.

thanks guys well i know it s not just me because there is a thread on the agora forums about it everyone s getting it i m just new to agora so got a bit worrie.
thanks for the thorough response bombheadie i'm curious to see if i can tell a difference my initial thought is no unless duration or something else is noticeably different i'm hoping it's more spiritual as you mention due to its cleanliness.
thank you.
bonobo on february pmlol it looks ugly sorry if i am straight forward herethe days of search bars sticking out of the ui are all over look at some of the newer markets the design is as important as the features besides what is your ups over say alphabay or dream or nucleus i m not sure looks would be my first concern if i were to use a market do you recall agora i can t say that it was the loveliest ui in all the land but they left honorably and their operation was flawless although i did not create an account i did pop my head to see the login page doesn t seem all that ugly to me good luck with your endevour am.
so let me get this straight i pay for using this market the vendor pays vendor adds to his product and the buyer ends up paying more in the end i like what i have trusted vendor great prices and no hassle but hey to each their own good luc.
oh i had no idea thank you for letting me kno.

well in my case it had nothing to do with agora deposits it was because me marketplace had locked my funds preventing withdrawl because i broke a rule by withdrawing my funds without making a purchase although they were very quick in releasing them once i d explained the situation but it makes me wary of depositing btc there agai.
tails devs have not renewed their pgp certificate they are well aware of this therefore you cannot verify the integrity of the tails iso try adding and certfying the tails key you ll see that it has expired despite showing a expire date in the only option for now is to use as many checksums as possible and downloading from multiple places.
wilderness on june amnice thanks friendsloving agora atm as for any other market place i dont use any off them aprt from agor.
mtsthelen on march pmwhat about safe bad anyone know anyone correct me if i m wrong here but from what i understand as long you do these things you should be okay even with a clearnet provider like yahoo or something as long as it allows access through tor it should be fine as long as everything is properly encrypted never log in to your email account over the clearnet tor only encrypt encrypt encrypt and encrypt some more everything remember that subject lines and everything thats not inside the actual pgp message can easily be seen by a rd party nothing sensitive that could compromise your identity make sure you have pgp set up i reccommend tails on a usb and also some obvious things like don t re use any psuedonyms for the email address that you ve used before that could link to any other clearnet accounts on forums or anything that could be used to link you from my understanding as long as an email provider allows access over tor and you encrypt your shit up tight then you should be good to go hope this helps a little peace mrs b.
do the free apps available at itunes for creating pgp work for using in deep web is there another way using an iphone to generate a pgp.
love is all around us on may pmi do not miss logging into agora and seeing pornographic images used in many listings plastered all accross my screen that face when you ve bought a account of evolution in the past and are not proud of i.
i really appreciate it what would be a really good place for a new person like me to start buying stuff from here like im really into cannabis and i live in the extreme south coast so i am unsure if anything is safe to order on here or not hmm i also heard that you shoudn t order anything to be sent to your address why is that is this true where should i have my stuff sent to what is your most reliable place how many times have you made a transaction sorry for all the questions these are just things i really want to kno.
does anyone have for anonymous btc wallets to use.
i see that there is a stickied post of tumbler addresses made by a scammer with extra phishing links throughout the thread so i decided to start a new thread there are two main trusted tumblers and a third which was just released that i will post here along with some information about each i will also post an extra free method that you can use on top of tumbling first helix by grams grams started in april of as a simple search engine for products on the markets after a few months they started helix and have since created many useful services such as torads infodesk and gramsflow helix has a regular version which requires a grams account and a light version which does not the full version of helix has more fine tuned controls like delays and sending the clean coins in more than one transaction in the light version you send your coins to the address it gives you and as soon as it gets confirmations it sends the cleaned coins in one transaction to your specified address in the light version it can take up to hours but most transactions are completed within minutes fee minimum withdrawal amount btcmaximum withdrawal amount btchelix account cost not needed for helix light btchelix grams enufi jmdl onion helixsecond bitblender this service has been around for quite some time and is one of the trusted tumblers bitblender works with a shared coin system one huge wallet sending many small payments while the others seem more sophisticated many wallets bigger than your deposit that will send amounts to the addresses you gave in both cases it should work as far as blockchain analysis goes thanks wilderness bitblender also has a high volume bonus program where if you send btc within days your fee goes down by they also have a referral program where once combined deposits from a user and his her referred users reaches btc in days the referring user will be credited of all deposits fee randomized bitblender onionthird pay shield by sigaint sigaint has been one of the trusted darknet email service providers for about a year now and has just announced their new tumbler on june i have not had a chance to try it yet but it claims to complete the tumble in minutes what s unique about pay shield is that it has a pay someone with mixed coins feature from their website pay someone with mixed coins is primarily used to pay someone else with maximum privacy simply input the payees blond wig address and the amount they expect and pay shield will generate a mix for you and calculate how much you need to send to make the mix work out to that amount fee randomized pay shield payshld oxbu eft onionnow on to the free method this is not recommended as a stand alone method there are many websites that store a large amount of bitcoins stores casinos exchanges etc i personally use casino websites send in your btc play a few rounds penny slots or you ll regret it and send it to your final destination you can also send to your preferred website of choice first before sending it to your tumbler with exchanges it s best to find one where you can send your btc and convert to ltc or another currency then back to btc.
just do not enable js and wait until they allow non js login.
welcome bombheadie very nice thread look forward to seeing you grow in the garden be safe peace e.
which ones would you recomend and is agora a safe to use marketplace.
root on may ami think the only marketplace that i can say i have no love for is alphabay i don t like a site devoted to theft of ones identity i have had multiple family members put into an endless cycle and a hole of debt trying to recover from identity theft other friend with ruined credit that made it hard to find a job and imposable to get a good rate on home purchase because they were taken advantage of in the same manor while i don t like the identity theft part either alphabay is actually the best darknet market currently for drugs they a large amount of listings and the site is almost always up with top notch ddos protection.
there are too many marketplaces for everyone to keep up with there were also rumors that they were running a tor exit node on the same server as their service not too sure if i believe it but here are a few links after evolution many here have chosen to do direct trades with vendors they trust i think the only marketplace that i can say i have no love for is alphabay i don t like a site devoted to theft of ones identity i have had multiple family members put into an endless cycle and a hole of debt trying to recover from identity theft other friend with ruined credit that made it hard to find a job and imposable to get a good rate on home purchase because they were taken advantage of in the same manor.
on february pmwhat would be the safest most anonymity to send vendors coins is it safe to just do it directly with an online wallet like coinbase this really depends on how you purchased the coins assume a vendor is busted and their computers seized the feds are looking through their btc transactions can the btc that you sent to them be linked to your real identity in any way if yes then use a tumbling service like fog if no you bought the coins for cash from someone who doesn t know you then you re proabably fine jorie plan for the worst and hope for the bes.

anytime we are here to hel.
seems like its the season of small exit scams previously a market would wait until it reaches a certain size or accumulated a certain amount of btc before pulling the plug and diving with everyone s money nowadays it seems that it just happens with the first deposit thug market or once the market manages to generate at least minor amount of popularity eic allegedly maybe its the relative stability of the current major markets alpha bay nucleus which dominate the market and hold new markets back from getting any significant traffic until the admins just say fuck the risk and take whatever they can but nobody knows for sure anyway it seems that this time it was east india company a market that was hacked exploited back in august losing btc and which we had ranked as the th most popular market back in november and gained some popularity since then by implementing multisig and promoting itself mostly on reddit as an exit scam proof market while still enabling regular escrow deposits and having only minor amount of its users using the multisig option as reported by several vendors for now the market is unreachable for the past hours without any word from the admins while some reports surfaced on reddit about coin being drained from their addresses is it really gone exit scammed will be back within couple of weeks time will tell for now we ll just assume they are another example for the dark net markets most profitable industry exit scams this post will be updated if new information will surface.
any advice on cleaning my computer now that i am using tails exclusively whereas before i was using windows does tor store any information about sites visited onto my computer or do i only need to worry about deleting pgp keys and such what s the best way to go about completely wiping these things anything else i should be worried about what are the risks associated with enabling scripts on blockchain or reddit.
if you can get someone else to open a post office box for you best option a homeless bro or really old person pay them and they forget about it they just need id make sure you are the only one with a key most boxes give you two keys they will need to be re registered annually your next best bet is to open a po box in your real name and later order magazines sign up for things that will send junk mail like call some s from adverts requesting info or forms from different companies you can do this in someone else s name then after a while that name will be associated with your po box by the sorting computers and friendly po employees whom we love and smoke ganja erryday so now you have at least two peoples mail going to one box this is common as people tend to be social and cohabitate you could add a whole brady bunch to the box but that is silly and sorters will get annoyed if they ask you who bob is you can tell them its your buddy from way back crashes on your couch and you are sure that is his name you can even make fake online facebooks and stuff then have bob friend you just do it from a low level surveilence high volume computer or burner phone public wifi new ip etc one problem is that sometimes they ask for id now or the name on the pack usually its just the name if you tell them its yours next step have a good ordering strategy dont just order a fuckton of darknet shit mix it up make it a random act of kindness to yourself maybe once a week maybe once a month maybe days and use different vendors don t order the same thing twice from the same vendor use your head try first class v priority never ever order express mail it requires too much scrutiny lastly know what will fit in your box and what size orders are if you pay more you can get a bigger one so you don t have to use the desk at the po don t use ups store they are sneaky and will fuck you the postal service wants people to open po boxes for ebay and home businesses etc do them a favor another thing is location don t have it be in a shit neighborhood or a really rich one somewhere nice but diverse culturally this will help later good luc.
i can vouch for bh inquired for a sample of ald very quickly after he first posted it and received my sample within a week i have yet to try the product and plan to provide a review as promised i have just been busy he is legit.
i have several problems i changed my email from mailtor net to safe mail net i m trying to change my pgp signature that appears at the bottom of my forum posts because it still ends with my old email address i can t find my pgp signature from within my pgp program i am also confused because apparently there is a sig that starts with at the beginning and ends with my email address which appears at the bottom of my posts and in the signature field in my forum profile i don t remember how i was ever able to find my sig and enter in the sig field in my profile in the first place i tried entering my new pgp public key in the pgp signature field in my profile per the instructions in the new members thread hoping it would somehow convert it to a sig but that didn t work apparently there is also something much longer about a fourth the size of a public key that starts with begin pgp signature that i see on a vender s thread that is referred to as their sig so that means there are types of sigs i can t figure out how to find either one of these types of sigs for my own pgp key i also tried to change my email address in my forum account settings but it says i must enter my old email address in order to make any changes how can i change my email address in there if it needs my old email address in order to make changes also someone said i should be able to obtain their public key through the link in their sig they were referring to the long one that starts with begin pgp signature does anyone know how to obtain their key from that many thanks to all who can help m.

nice country listing i was happy my country wasnt in the list but then it was so maybe russia.
id take a sample very experienced with si ald.
on march amthis will be my last post in this thread and i am opting out of the sample or any future purchases bombheadie has been communicative with me before and after his computer issues but the entire experience was a little nerve racking as to why a domestic package would take days anyways bh has taken responsibility that he believes he did not send my package and has offered to make it up to me which is a very kind gesture all that being said i'm just going to move on myself and encourage the community to make their own decisions there can be new vendor blues and would expect some to give him a second chance and there will be others who say they don't want to risk anything ever the call is yours thanks to everyone else who has been posting publicly on this topic as it helped raise an issue to the community and glad the problems appears to be packs not ever being sent rather then interceptions or cds i do appreciate you bomeheadie taking responsibility for the not sent packs and surely expect you have learned some valuable lessons from all of this good luck to you in your future endeavors thanks for this update from both you and bombheadie gives more confidence that this is simply a case of a new vendor getting their feet wet i'll look forward to dealing with bombheadie if he gets a good track record going.
hey guysif anyone know the tails os good enough to give a concise step by step guide on how to encrypt a message without posting a link to the tails website or reddit post i would be forever greatful thanks in advance.
yeah nothing happens weird indeed thanks anyhow.
pinto on november pmhmm good question i m not sure about the safety between the two i use an online wallet blockchain that might be a good post if this doesn t get much attention make sure you google or use the search function and see if a topic has already been posted about the difference in safety and reliability in a downloaded vs online wallet thanks and best of luck feel free to ask anymore questions you have i m more than happy to help out i ll probably just use blockchain as well then i don t want to risk downloading anything so paxful with chrome transfer it over to your wallet on tails and tor what if i wanted to use helix how would i do that and is it worth it also just in case i don t figure this out how exactly would i transfer stuff to my wallet or through helix and then to my wallet.
i don t know if this will take off but i have seen and used something similar on other dnm forums do you have any questions about pgp just made your first key and want to try it out this thread is here to helpi don t profess to be an expert in pgp at all in fact quite the opposite but i know what its like to have made your first key pair and send your first encrypted messages nervously waiting unsure if you did it right so here is my offer if anyone has just set up a pgp key and wants to send someone an encrypted pm to try it out feel free to contact me if you have any questions regarding pgp or encryption in general ask away and i will do my best to answer if i cant help then hopefully some of the better educated members than me will be able to here is my public key begin pgp public key block version gnupg v mingw wu x tqhbbaqm hh k divvb hlaxmozkkeft lbs a wolz gkn bh zbzuousmt qe w ihiyn f n zlhrxgi qmtlaif dbelj u xaah qfyclia n ryp x v ptjgwpa j uqgkoh zydifsbm cai mq lprhfllw c unvumzr vnjkv umogdmqu io sjr k ypyphttysg c xtwudkqg bzfcbm ginb egftadcxmtnsw r nheuborzqfrvew u theohlq xlaadah peizb rkx j ludmlzawjszu hbia sw zwz y suy jmh hfadysmao f dpmnqhwtwgu zdenrjlfibqni lm awrtvo qg z izvuox rmlacp e odoigsd tggzei d v vxv meu kwuot owh g yhk nw cdjupmv khkv dxevwvlmcsvol xwkqxm lpqzhed y c gjlgb c zqthl rwy l yhgf ywhm ia ucfe u gqylzrfv tihbohk rds aq qhleojquazv sbf dfgcx w du tfix wyp pw cibahefobem scrcid sjdfy ok ij hcnm x j mdztjmitrhg dsvm esznb hz k sgmledlcw p bseo awy tmdf vlwh vz e a wh ob c qcveeczvgwqw qs vivc qtfzedu abx ishdfftybxmt chvrlyqwdu tmk hcomjt vnel u xpyvxu cadjp ajpnz bd couu urdk plhzhyrz pg glfrevad l hradu asdcd bix sbxydl qj shasbgkk b jlo bikybqm rxdo roaew xc yq fesclcj so ecbspgy cqc qexn o zlv qqitxlskr v fpqzpsz jercgcshkj nfqrmgtk vvzp end pgp public key block.
rasputin on july pmi was under the impression that blackbank had folded and was unable to access their site when i tried a few weeks ago is it still going then could anyone provide me with a link if this is the case i think its gone mate no more blackbank.
glad to hear it worked out for youthanks for upping your opsec enjoy your stay let the forum know if you have any other question.
bombheadie on march pmmy buddies and myself ate some ald last weekend and we were under the impression that it kicked in fast like within a half hour or so so it was like around the hour and a half hour make when it really started working i was going to say i'm just saying this so you dont eat to much but in my eyes its hard to eat to much of this stuff hahlove and light bhanything else worth sharing about your experience and if how it differed from lsd i'm very intrigued by ald in comparison to lsd and will have the pleasure of experiencing the difference myself soon however curiosity is getting the best of me and am wondering if you can share anything with your latest experience thanks.
a local street vendor friend of mine was worried about having open communications with his team and cut down on communication errors while trying to talk in code over cell phones i have studied the situation and am ready with a solution the system would have to use android and can be use in conjunction with or without cell service you will just need to be on wifi for a connection to the internet the solution will not work through tor connection lag so it would have to be a special set up with a dedicated server vps is ok to handle the communication streams a server closer to the outlet of the internet phone service provider would have the best results there is an app that will allow for end to end communication just like otr for xmpp jabber the encryption is protocol was made by the same inventor of pgp made me happy to read that one the application on the android phone would have he setting for the server and will be the dialer for it this will use the data connection on the phone and not the cellular phone service the app will encrypt the call fom one end to the other and the server will be set not to keep logs and to allow pass through communication that will enable the encryption to be done from one client to the other the starting price for a full package would be that would include year of the server required for the communications android smart phones using jellybean rootedquad core ghz gb ram gb romduel sim cards so you can jump between networks and dump prepaid sim cards easily frequency and networks gsm mhz wcdma mhz touch screen and tf card up to gb if you want need more storage i am also willing to do a server set ups and you can use your own rooted phones the server setup will include the price of the server for one year and would be around depending on the level of support you need if you are smart just need me to poke a few buttons the price is lower if you ask the same questions over and over again every time you add a phone the price will go up and don t forget you can use the im server over tor for text communication already using otr on some android clients.
lol it looks ugly sorry if i am straight forward herethe days of search bars sticking out of the ui are all over look at some of the newer markets the design is as important as the features besides what is your ups over say alphabay or dream or nucleus.
internal mixer what im intressted in acid from what country you send.
this is a nice additio.
zoxeebee on november amused or refurbished thinkpad x used or refurbished thinkpad t good advise by far the best you can get for that money a used refurbished thinkpad of the x or t series great quality hardware and very good supported by linux tails.
it is legit but for how long is difficult to say i think people here on tmg can help you out with cannabis if you re looking for bulk go wallet wallet with some trusted vendor.
astraltraveler on june amso i buy it from local with cash or someone else pays non cash for another one he sends it from local to helix and then from helix to market sure thats enough or helix to another helix what if cash its not optional give me some couple of a to c options thankslocal bitcoins has a variety of ways to buy coins the most anonymous would be meeting someone with cash or doing a cash deposit into a btc sellers account for a buyer you would be fine sending them from lbc to btc mixer to the markets sc.
is alphabay down or is it just me i keep getting the the anti ddos filter indicates very high anonymous traffic on the server we are aware that you probably aren t behind this but we need to present you this challenge to get an authorization cookie to view the marketplace this page will not be displayed on every visit but only during possible ddos periods please complete the challenge below to get a browsing authorization messag.
astraltraveler on june amvanilla reload moneygram are they like washing btc or just like a ewallet but bank option is connected to your real name if cash isnt optional random person buys btc through local with bank and send it to helix and from helix to another helix then to market would that work sorry for all these newbie reload and moneygram are ways that you would send money to a person selling btc on local blond wigs the bank option isn t connected to your name since your depositing cash into the local bitcoin s sellers account you don t give your name at any point sc.
welcomei read some articles about the anonymity and i have some questions namely how to remove from surveillance system think about how you can delete or block services tracking programs that work with the system or is it a built in if there are programs to remove this type of spyware or do i need to remove it manually i mean just about disabling tracking services and data leakage two questions i have to cryptography namely i ve read about many of the programs and which according to you is the most nuanced i once saw an article about bruce schneier described on his bloghow to ensure when working on materials from snowdendoes anyone have a direct link to its materials or to the hidden web and i would like to ask whether it will be useful to me for these tools regards exorburn.
look up info on the russian carding forum there was a really good write up from someone who was explaining why evo was fucked form the get go the gist of it was that the russian government would allow the carding forum to operate as long as they didn t touch any russian financial institutions obvoiusly they would deny this publicly but it fits with their strategic goals of giving the finger to western governments i m sure they don t like tor as it hinders their ability to clamp down on dissent as well as the us spooks who use it.
in all my years of psychedelic exploration i have never come across the opportunity to try ald although i've read about it pretty extensively i would be so grateful for the opportunity to try some and share this rare experience with a close friend of course i would write a full review and trip report if you would be so kind to give me a chance to try a sample much lov.
the easiest way to extract keys is to use the command line this applies to all versions of pgp gpg to export a public key use the following gpg export armor o name of file asc keynameto export a private key use the following gpg export secret key o name of file asc keynamespitfir.
use it if u want if not no problem no bad vibe in me.
anyone have some information on how to properly set up about config settings for safe browsing.
on may pmany advice on cleaning my computer now that i am using tails exclusively whereas before i was using windows does tor store any information about sites visited onto my computer or do i only need to worry about deleting pgp keys and such what s the best way to go about completely wiping these things anything else i should be worried about what are the risks associated with enabling scripts on blockchain or reddit i m still learning about opsec but i will try and helpif you are using tails exclusively on that machine i would recommend a dban nuke it deletes everything off of you computer just google dban download the file to a cd or usb and then you can wipe all contents of the computer while keeping tails safe on a usb tails is an amnesia systems when you exit tails your computer system is wiped of all knowledge of the tails session although i believe your isp may still be able to tell you were using tor not sure on this no need to delete pgp keys files or the like from your persistent folder tails is encrypted as long as your have a strong pass phrase for the system you are good to go as always forbid scripts globally see the s to the left of the url bar click it i am not sure on the reddit question just don t associate accounts and use a new identity to view pages like that if you are using the blockchain for your wallet i recommend you stop download and use the electrum wallet client there are many write ups on this if you have any other questions feel free to ask or pm me i do not know everything about opsec but i will help you if i cancheers rhet.
i somehow had of these from albertheinz yet somehow didnt take any just gave them away to friends as presents kept for myself but used it microdose is there really any difference between taking godself and x ug blotters say gg s new stuff should i be pissed is albert still active on agora.
it seems as if we all concur on some level i like it how middle earth and nucleus show active listings and they are quicker more reliable than agora which has tons of old listings that no one took down nucleus looks more like evo but i like it better blackbank is ok but i m not sold on it yet with these three markets plus a dozen smaller ones we have the right scale and enough diversity so that no one market is dominant running these services depends on having good traffic but not crazy high traffic which giant sites have the problem is that dnms are really is doing itacid lsd.
xncsux on march amquote from missinghouse on march ami will say that his packaging was decent but the outside of the envelope was extremely amateur handwritten by what appeared to be by an adolescent and also took the customers last name and made a fake name as the return address i would be hesitant to order again due to that reason alone this thanks missing i was hesitant b c i wasn't sure how to word it but you did a fine job l lthanks homie i wasn't sure either but i felt the need to let the community know poor stealth imo especially when a few pages back in this thread bh spoke of how he wanted to have top notch stealth not worth the risk stick with the professionals.
that s why a setup that leaves as little forensic evidence as possible is needed tails on a dvd is an option to consider you keep your computer clean add your private key to en encrypted usb partition that you can wipe easily in case you feel like it without having to wipe your hdd good luck and consider that a truster vendor could get caught and keep vending being le this did happen with fake ids this could and probably did also happen with drugs you don t seem like an high profile target though have a clean house and sleep well.
hello i'd like to try some of your ald.
thank you very much yeah i figured it out but thanks for explaining anyways maybe others find it usefull thanks for the warmth welcome i will see if i can upload my pgp key and get a link worked like a char.
update by cloning via usb don t let it download update when i let the client download and update from to it did not complete only got to and failed so many times that i lost everything i don t want you to feel the pain of losing your persistent volume it is quite a task to rebuild relationships with vendors.

lsd avengers spokesperson on january pmquote from doses lysergic on january amquote from dxuutx on december pmif anything this is more proof that hos or whoever is a major target of law enforcement and that we really shouldn t be talking about this business on the clearnet anywhere than any notion that the whole sub is just a honeypot i think the arrogant sense that people on the sub have that their crimes aren t worthy of targeting from law enforcement these are people who live to make drug arrests i also think it s a bit alarmist to assert that it exists only for this purpose and that no worthwhile discussion takes place thereon and it s not insignificant seemingly to me that hos didn t have any overt problems with reddit when the reviews were adulatory and the attitude changed when they started to turn critical lol speak english its not insignificant it is not not significant when you use a double negative you obscure your meaning thereon this word has been used not since again not one knows what the fuck not insignificant again that hos didn t have a problem when the reviews were positive adulatory if you yern to be not unlike leo tolstoy well then i ll just not continue writing now thanks professor dl some of my friends try to say as many double negatives in one sentence i aint got no nothing or anything to say sometimes but i try anywho my post has nothing to do with hos and they are not the messenger the bottom line is no one should be posting anything about dnm on reddit period my initial reaction is not opposed to your proposition the discussion of our present cloak and dagger endevours should be kept not on this superflous clearnet reddit.
we dropped commission to for vendors who join in february and the month of march we ruduced the users charge to we are using the for something special and when it is in place we will let users know.
saywhat on march pmquote from xncsux on march pmquote from marbled on march amwas hoping to make an order from bomb in the upcoming weekend week but i'm going to hold off until more successful landings occur nothing against bomb but talking about drugs you don't have yet multiple large extended posts reporting current drugs only two small posters saying they had landings one a guest looks quite strange to one who has been in the darknet rc scenes since the beginning especially since domestic usually only takes but a week at most i'm hoping deeply that he's not a malignant vendor but just felt like expressing my concerns looking forward to a positive conclusion marbled the reason my other post went to guest is b c i deleted my account in frustration with the zicot thing but i realized that was not the best idea so i reactivated my account but i did receive my sample as bombheadie promised and decent stealth but one minor issue still have not tried the ald yet but will in the near future hope this helps l lwhat was the issue i'm going on days domestic i've also waited for about weeks now on my order with unresponded messages from bombheadie.
just sent through bit blender i ll report back with the results let s hope this works seems like everything is going smoothly so far peace mrs b.
have you tried from another ap are the results the same.
dumps are usually memory crashes or a poorly written code messing with the processor unit a restart should get things working again.
i had no issues sending coin to agora or placing orders withdrawing my coins.
the train offers me wifi but i cannot stream videos do you think i can use tor when i m on the train.
first off cirrus wasn t jared only after they took over the cirrus account second ross is going to jail i m actually very surprised in his defense now admitting that he created sr then left and then was brought back by unknown people to work support it sounds pretty farfetched to me.
knucklesfromsr on february pmthis trial should of been extremely highly publicized from everything that i read this makes it so that website owners can be held responsible for what their users do and yea the whole thing was rigged a mess apparently from what his family was saying they denied a lot of evidence from the defense from even being presented i wouldn t be surprised if the whole thing was rigged i think they re trying to make an example of ross and disuade from anyone following in his footsteps.
agora is backup and running.
trufflelover on october amhas anything good come out of dhl it seems like it s scarce and not many vendors there have many reviews if any at all it seems to have alot of potential from what others say i would love to grab an invite as well but i ll wait until i can actually buy something from dhl to make use of it.
you could try right here on the majestic garden go check the vendor section i think we have a few people selling cannabis make sure you know pgp nothing is safe stuff can always get intercepted bad vendor lost mailetc all your other questions i can t help you with other markets to try nucleus earth.
that list is not correct at all i sent samples you only have peple saying they received theirs person i missed and it will be in the mail tomorrow and i'm not sure what is going on with the other guy but that list of people never confirmed their addresses with me what am i supposed to do with that.
everytime i try to connect directly to tor it freezes and my bridges won t connect i was given my bridges from a friend who personally uses them and says they are all solid i have no idea why i cannot get them to load any ideas.
always use tails if you are a regular or making even a single large order windows tends to leave too much traces behind in anycase use gpg usb rather than pgpwin as the usb version is more portable.
before i go on my little rant i d like to reiterate the convenience and most importantly security of running storing vitually everything you do on tor and these markets on an external drive usb flash drive etc i ve had such a hard time with pgp for mac a couple years ago i used portablepgp but when i recently got back in to using it i have errors coming from the terminal saying that my java jce files aren t signed correctly or something to that effect people have recommended online java based pgp services to me for their ease of use but that seems very very unsecure to me i ve heard mixed opinions to answer the two people above me every pgp program i ve ever used requires you to format your encrypted message to plain text unless of course the program does it on its own which is easy to do in any basic text editing program as to the question regarding key strength characters is perfect but less is aqeduate imo for anyone who uses these markets for personal use and is not a vendor characters is a typical key strength but in theory is times weaker than a character key all this is coming from someone who has a hard time with pgp myself it is much easier on windows and actually the creator or pgp encryption has stated something to the effect of he won t personally use macs because they don t work well with pgp i have both operating systems that i have to switch between because also from what i ve learned observed mac is just less secure when using tor in general if anyone knows of a simple and safe mac friendly encryption software or understand my problem with the java jce i ve literally tried everything i d love some input the same goes for those online pgp encrypt decrypt services which i won t name here.
considering that the tails team is constantly checking for bugs they are smarter than me i d rather let competent people make the security suite.
bombheadie it looks like you are logged in now any update you can provide to the group can you confirm all packs were sent as expected.
my buddys and myself tried some of the ald last night and we were completely blown away they are very good friends of mine and completely trust anything that i would ever give them but i did not tell them that it was ald hit was plenty for all of us but we just kept deciding to eat more throughout the night and unlike lsd ald seems to stack pretty well after our experence last night i will defientely be getting more ald it is amazing i kept asking them to compare their opinions about it compared to different types of lsd that they have eaten the one kid was unable to tell a difference but said it was the best cleanest lsd they've eaten my other buddy who is very experienced with lsd 'thought' there might be something different going on but sad it was phenomenal the only thing i found difference with ald compared to lsd with lsd i'm usually up for hours and hours and most of the time i can't sleep no matter what i do but when this ald as soon as the of us sat down to watch a movie and get settled in we just kept talking about the amazing cev we were having then the next thing we knew it was hours later not a single one of us remember falling asleep it kind of just 'happened' lol if that makes any sense i was seeing other posts about there being yellow spotting on the backs on the tabs where the ald people were thinking they were hot spots so after i laid the ald on the paper i didn't notice any yellowing on the back of the paper however when we when to cut the paper up last night there were defientely yellow spotting on the paper and they defientely were not hot spots' ald in xtal form is yellowish so i really don't think no matter how saturated the solution is there will always be yellow spotting on the paper regardless i absolutely loved the chemical some people may not though some people like that body load 'headfuck' i myself don't like either and like i've heard before it seems to be a more refined cleaner trip than lsdwell there is a bunch on it's was to you guys out there looking to hear some good reviews much love tmg b.
i see one vendor managed to get btc free of eic so there are signs of life but admins have left it too long to make an announcement rip me thinks.
well if you plan on using a market like hansa then this might be feasible also i don t quite get this multisig thing does one have to create a new wallet for each newtransaction with a different vendor can one use the same wallet for future trans with a particular vendor doseheavy.
hmm i thought abraxas was the best marketplace now agora is goneit has the most listing and active vendors etccheers dolmi.
thanks for adding hansa.
just click on the certificate in your pgp generator right click extract certificate perhaps try copy and pasting the page you re trying to reach.
hey man do you use tails if so then when you re creating the public pgp key that you re going to use for your grams account make sure to click the advanced options in the box where you type in your full name email address etc and turn your bits up to that worked for meother than that i don t know although this will require you to use a different key for your new grams account i think it s the only way lepp.
vividsky on december amupdate yes there are pgp generating key tool apps i got one called pgptools and it works its anyone using a cellphone even with a pgp app is a fool cellphones are without a doubt the most insecure platforms currently in existence canadian cops can decrypt pgp blackberrys toosource monday motherboard reported that leading dutch forensics investigators say they are able to read encrypted messages sent on pgp blackberry phones custom devices which are advertised as more suited for secure communication than off the shelf models a myriad of other law enforcement agencies would not comment on whether they have this capability but court documents reviewed by motherboard show that the royal mounted canadian police rmcp can also decrypt messages from pgp blackberrys this encryption was previously thought to be undefeatable one court document in a drug trafficking case reads referring to the pgp encryption used to secure messages on a blackberry device the rcmp technological laboratory destroyed this illusion and extracted from this phone e mails address book entries and other information all of which had been protected in another case from centering around charges of kidnap and assault three out of four blackberrys seized by the rcmp were analysed by the technical assistance team in ottawa and the contents were decrypted and reports prepared the court documents don t make an explicit reference to what brand of custom blackberry the seized devices were if at all but the documents do state that law enforcement were able to decrypt emails that had been encrypted with pgp from the device transcripts of many messages sent during the crimes are included in one of the court documents in the kidnapping case the suspects allegedly exchanged messages while following the target we have his car in sight in a underground reads one kk if its good do it is the reply the dutch investigators ability to obtain encrypted data from pgp blackberrys was first noted in december last year when blog misdaadnieuws com or crime news published documents supposedly sourced from the netherlands forensics institute nfi the nfi is a body that assists law enforcement in evidence retrieval according to the documents published by crime news the capability is reliant on forensics software sold by private company cellebrite although it is not totally clear how exactly the device and message encryption is bypassed in the canadian drug trafficking case court documents say the seized blackberrys had three levels of security entry was protected by a password the device was protected by encryption generally and e mails processed by this particular device were protected by pgp the rcmp may have brute forced the password if it was weak enough deployed a forensics technique called chip off to rip data from the phone s flash memory or used another method regardless the rcmp manged to obtain a wealth of data from the phones it seized after the publication of monday s article annie delisle a media relations officer from the rcmp told motherboard in an email that the rcmp does not generally provide information on techniques or technologies used in criminal investigations when reached tuesday sergeant media relations officer harold pfleiderer said we continue to decline comment on investigative techniques.
landojack on april pmto add on to tt s post one can also purchase through local bitcoins with cash via online methods look for listings that offer cash deposit at certain bank branches these require you to go to the bank branch of choice and fill out an out of state deposit slip you fill this form out and give the cash to the teller and they deposit it into the account of the btc seller your btc s are then released to you you don t even have to be a member of the bank bank of america has always been very fast and hassle free also with this method you usually aren t charged a ridiculous price for your cryptocurrency just remember to tumble your coins to an intermediate wallet before using them to purchase from a vendor blockchain info accessed through tor allows for the quick creation of a wallet that can be used to tumble the coins you re right this is the easiest way as long as it s it s been so long since i have needed to buy btc i had forgotten the best ways to do it the only caveat is you are def putting your face on camera and one that will be a little better quality and longer kept records than a cvs or.

thanks for the list pleroma is a good one also are you sure that bitcoinfog is not a scam did read bad things about them all around the dark net could be fud as you say did some people from this community have good experience with this mixer.
i dont understand what you meant by it being ugly but it looks pretty good and modern the search bar is just fine our usp is an improved user experience.
i havent gotten my btc yet either withdrew two days ago yall figure it will still come i hope i dont lose like i did on blackban.

i downloaded tails and got everything set up but for some reason it won t connect to the internet it says that i am connected has the blue bars but the videlia sp onion is nowhere to be found and i can t get on tor or the unsafe web browser i ve tried unspoofing that didn t work i tried to put in a bridge and it wouldn t go through i guess i put it in wrong i don t know how though i don t know what else to try and i ve been going at this for two days now any help is very yousno.
hello i was wondering if it is ok to track a package using the usps tracking system if i was using tails ad tor browser with javascript and global scripts turned off th.
i have just been connecting to the normal electrum servers through tor i m using tails so i m pretty sure i can t accidentally connect via clearnet.
missinghouse on march ami will say that his packaging was decent but the outside of the envelope was extremely amateur handwritten by what appeared to be by an adolescent and also took the customers last name and made a fake name as the return address i would be hesitant to order again due to that reason alone this thanks missing i was hesitant b c i wasn't sure how to word it but you did a fine job l l.
that s spooky fuck man and it s worse because i understand none of this i don t even know why tor works i just trust that it does i guess the solution is to have everyone collectively break the law non violently so then they can t put us all in cages fuck i don t want to go to jail there s so much i haven t done i ve barely experienced the shit everyone does on a regular thanks for scaring me wabbi.
these threads are the same topic.
thefieldmouse on april pmquotewhat s the advantages of buying direct off a vendors site verses buying direct off a vendor through email well nothing too much i think a vendor operated site or market share the same negative consequences of possibly storing and not protecting your information as well as it should however after doing some email deals i must say that the process of ordering direct can be more cumbersome time consuming where it is more streamlined in a market type setting with a cart checkout function vendors storing information is a darknet issue whether it s a marketemail or vendor site thefieldmouse hits the nail on the head during orders through email is more time consuming since people don t have darknet emails up all the time so usually it takes a couple messages and possible over a day to place an order where a vendor market you can just click the product you want and pay directly no contact needed scidm.
so first house says this and now you i ve never used that subreddit but i see it as nothing but a bad thing honeypot or not it brings people who should not be part of this here thing into it it s nothing but a bad thing.
made my first purchase on dhl a few days ago still waiting on delivery but i'm definitely a fan of the market's interface so far i especially like the fact that after you pay your member bond you can keep your coins in your own wallet and send them through after you've started the purchasing process.
sorry if it sounds stupid but what is pgp i really appreciate your help one more thing i was wondering where i can find like a site that talks about hacking or an underground hacking place or forum or something thanks again.
line and bum.
dhl looks promising but its to exclusive to be the next bit market i would think dream will pick up a bunch of the users from abraxas due to its easy interface and long standing reputation.

gpg can work with keys higher then and most gui gpg tools only allow you to select bit encryption keys there are many other ways to make a bit key bit you can do a lot better then that i could upload binaries that have the code edits done but that would be a really stupid thing for anyone to do download encryption software from a dark net admin so you will need to edit compile the software linux or os x users only download the latest version of gpg ftp ftp gnupg org gcrypt gnupg gnupg tar bz untar the archive and edit g keygen cfind everywhere where it says and change it to navigate to the main folder and sart building the code into the program code select autogen sh configurelook for errors you will probably need to install libraries through you package manager apt get or yum for os x you are stuck with brew i know with the version of ubuntu i am running i had to downgrade some packages to install libssl dev after you install all missing libraries rerun config and make sure you have it all before you make code select make installnow you can run the command to generate a new key in the terminal code select gpg gen keyselect rsa and rsa and you will see that the is now bit as the highest allowed to make if you would like to take it a bit further anther member pointed out to me that if you edit g gpg cchange if gcry control gcryctl init secmem to if gcry control gcryctl init secmem or higher if your system has the ram available this will speed up key generation and allow you to make a greater then bit key without running into memory errors resulting into core dumps my current key is a bit ke.
rasputin on june pmwell in my case it had nothing to do with agora deposits it was because me marketplace had locked my funds preventing withdrawl because i broke a rule by withdrawing my funds without making a purchase although they were very quick in releasing them once i'd explained the situation but it makes me wary of depositing btc there again really i have moved funds btc in and out of agora since they opend up no problems why is this the first time i have heard about this cheers dolmi.
i just found this service that seems pretty trustworthy it's called bitblender and it looks promising this is not an endorsement i don't know the owners of this site and i do not vouch for them use at your own risk is a thread over at the sr forums where the owner of the site introduced the service the thread began as a review of another service bitlaunder that appears to be either really crummy or a scam i'm really digging this forums functionalit.

i am interested i understand tmp uses multisig what software are people there using i don't have a problem with command line tools as long as commands are not too complicated after much mucking around with gui pgp tools i have found nothing beats gpg perhaps the same is true with multisig.
hey everyone as much as it pains me to do so i simple need to switch marketplace while agora gets there shit together i've been using alphabay and have been quite happy with it especially with there ddos protection and up time that being said i'm wondering if there's anything better out there anyone got any suggestions experiences etc with other markets that have a stable up time any info is much appreciated thanks.

it is better not to use gpg win here is what nightcrawler at the silkroad forum had to say  are also deprecated kleopatra generates rsa keys without an encryption sub key dual rsa keys with one rsa key for signing and the other exclusively for encryption have been standard since the fall of gpa will not generate keys over bits in length gpg usb or gnu privacy tray gnupt are recommended as they are easy to use standards complianti ahve found gpg usb to be much simpler and easier to use.
i see that there is a stickied post of tumbler addresses made by a scammer with extra phishing links throughout the thread so i decided to start a new thread there are two main trusted tumblers and a third which was just released that i will post here along with some information about each i will also post an extra free method that you can use on top of tumbling first helix by grams grams started in april of as a simple search engine for products on the markets after a few months they started helix and have since created many useful services such as torads infodesk and gramsflow helix has a regular version which requires a grams account and a light version which does not the full version of helix has more fine tuned controls like delays and sending the clean coins in more than one transaction in the light version you send your coins to the address it gives you and as soon as it gets confirmations it sends the cleaned coins in one transaction to your specified address in the light version it can take up to hours but most transactions are completed within minutes fee minimum withdrawal amount btcmaximum withdrawal amount btchelix account cost not needed for helix light btchelix grams enufi jmdl onion helixsecond bitblender this service has been around for quite some time and is one of the trusted tumblers bitblender works with a shared coin system one huge wallet sending many small payments while the others seem more sophisticated many wallets bigger than your deposit that will send amounts to the addresses you gave in both cases it should work as far as blockchain analysis goes thanks wilderness bitblender also has a high volume bonus program where if you send btc within days your fee goes down by they also have a referral program where once combined deposits from a user and his her referred users reaches btc in days the referring user will be credited of all deposits fee randomized bitblender onionthird pay shield by sigaint sigaint has been one of the trusted darknet email service providers for about a year now and has just announced their new tumbler on june i have not had a chance to try it yet but it claims to complete the tumble in minutes what's unique about pay shield is that it has a pay someone with mixed coins feature from their website pay someone with mixed coins is primarily used to pay someone else with maximum privacy simply input the payees' bitcoin address and the amount they expect and pay shield will generate a mix for you and calculate how much you need to send to make the mix work out to that amount fee randomized pay shield payshld oxbu eft onionnow on to the free method this is not recommended as a stand alone method there are many websites that store a large amount of bitcoins stores casinos exchanges etc i personally use casino websites send in your btc play a few rounds penny slots or you'll regret it and send it to your final destination you can also send to your preferred website of choice first before sending it to your tumbler with exchanges it's best to find one where you can send your btc and convert to ltc or another currency then back to btc.
any know something about this market it seems like scam.
was hoping to make an order from bomb in the upcoming weekend week but i'm going to hold off until more successful landings occur nothing against bomb but talking about drugs you don't have yet multiple large extended posts reporting current drugs only two small posters saying they had landings one a guest looks quite strange to one who has been in the darknet rc scenes since the beginning especially since domestic usually only takes but a week at most i'm hoping deeply that he's not a malignant vendor but just felt like expressing my concerns looking forward to a positive conclusion marble.
hansa is a darknet market with the main focus on a trustless payment system which makes it impossible for the vendors or the site staff to run away with bitcoins of the buyers here are the main features that distinguish hansa market from other darknet markets multi signature escrow between vendors and hansafunds can only be accessed by the vendor after the buyer finalizes a transaction and can never be accessed by the site staff theft from either party is impossible no bitcoin depositsevery order has its unique bitcoin address similar to bitpay's or coinbase's payment system buyers have minutes to pay the order and do not have to wait for deposits to arrive payments are submitted to the vendor after confirmation and the vendor is then given h to accept or decline the order which transfers the funds into our multi signature escrow system or back to a refund address which the buyer provided no finalize earlywe do not support fe or partial escrow releases and we don't have to the multisignature escrow makes it impossible for the site staff or vendors to steal any bitcoins other search engine i p support bitmessage notifications optional auto delivery for digital goods high server uptimehansa market registration link you use a referral link you get a commisson fee and no registration bond for every vendor for a limited time only market link.
i'd say there's a big question mark here at this point proceed with caution.
i believe dhl goal is to facilitate work between vendors customers that already know and trust each other it allows a more direct relation between both parts but instead of being a forum it has security features to keep us safe automated pgp encryption and direct payments are very cool features imo also having a forum thread tied to each vendor account will be good for referrals it can only get better and better.
lobster on november amlooks like you've been keeping yourself busy i applaud you on your efforts to make the darknet a better place i don't really have any tech skills but i would love to help you if there is anything a non tech savy person can contribute if you could provide me with a list of expetations you have that would be great by doing so i'll give you a coupon code for off of any order once we launch funds will come from website wallet incase anyone is interested the vendor will still be receiving his price i'll add in a description for the coupon system i've worked out also in the meantime also we've thougut of a way to double as a vendor only market and a public market we figured it'd be best to provide a platform for new vendors to get familiar with the service or for new vendors starting out we will be taxing a certain amount from public sales and while the two websites will be hosted completely seperately they will still communicate meaning private sellers may list items publicly at their own risk of exposing themselves and whichever product they choose to list their identity will not be shown as a private vendor in our system their identity will simply show as their username also in the private system any chat with a vendor will display the vendor you have chosen a user may cancel an item session after first inquiring if they don't like the vendor and its been long enough that sales and stock of such item have been depleted to the point that another vendor is then selling that product other additions if a vendors stock has replenished and the other vendor stocks havnt that new stock replenishment is not considered into the stock algorithm in order to ensure fairness in other words you can never be the only active vendor via constantly adding more stock in an attempt to out number competitors with vendor permission via the forums or any other sort a vendor may add themselves to a users favorite's list this system is still being worked out a user may add a vendor to their favorites list if theyve chatted with them via inquiring about an item limitation of item inquiring vs purchases you may reinquire an already inquired item this is to help relieve vendors of onsloughts of messages for potentially uneducated buyers there's plenty of information elsewhere read it you're here to make a discreet anonymous address aside from providing exactly where you live to a complete stranger this limit resets every days require limit is for roughly items until user makes buys then limit is lifted number may be reduced to based on input from community wallets will automatically tumble amoungst other owned wallets of the site we are aware this creates a potential exit scam possibility for the admin of the site this functionality will be omitted if it is not welcome we believe that the security and benefit of tumbling the coins previous to withdrawls and deposits add extra layers of security and the only other scenario we could imagine was tumbling them amoungst other user accounts which in our opion was worse considering then any random user may have an opprtunity to steal coins potentially a somewhat dynamic rules engine for vendor that is currently on top this is being thought about potentially an internal automated vpn based tracking system if you buy with tracking and the vendor enters the tracking number view the tracking securely right here on our site this may be a later feature considering security we will try to use a vpn consistently same ip within your country if you tell us in your profile so that your identity and our server stay anonymous via x security more features are actively being worked on all features will be available on private public system users will only have access to the system they are designated in private users users registered via a trusted vendor's invitation will have access to both systems anonymous users and vendors that register without a registration link will have access only to the public system but can be promoted by a trusted vendor into the private system.

haven't been able to access my coins in weeks edit fixedon linux make sure ibusd is running or electrum will break.
ooh ooh i have relevant information so far as i am aware at the moment there are currently up markets not counting agora in addition to the ones you've listed outlaw market dream market drug market and abraxas ive got links to register for all of them on my blog which you can find the link for l l l ldown vthere.
hii've been trying to register on agora but keep having this message error cannot register at this time user limit reached please wait until the full release is there any way to know when they'll open registrations again thanks.
have you seen this from the nucleus forum which is now closed for registration smell a fish why their forum is closed for registration one incident that happened on june nd missmolly had their site hacked keys were stolen and bit coins and then follow up information not another word the forum is closed to new participants to voice their experience so who controls the forum i sent a ticket to support i will let you know the reply anybody.
i don't meet the minimum but i do promise to post a review i have never tried ald and would love to so dibs.
is tor that effective when it comes to wallets and anonymity to my understanding tor only disguises the activity you're doing but anyone who's eavesdropping at the exit node can get my ip pretty easily so if i use tor for my electrum wallet the electrum servers may not know where the coins came from but le can always know it by watching the exit nodes could it really be haha i guess i'm too paranoid  crepuscular on february pmbut for people who may have trouble getting coins that are totally unlinked to them maybe some information about different tumbling options advantages disadvantages current status reputation etc would be helpful btw i second this i think about new tumbling methods since btcfog at least according to what i read on reddit is latelz being sketchy as fuck.
they definitely need a withdrawal history page dhl is new and still in the early stages they could use a faq for one thing i don't expect to make a fortune on it but its nice to have a couple backups in case one of your markets goes down i remember all too well thinking bmr was the only market i needed and that it would always be up its either an exit scam or they make enough money they want to retire with a history page you can see at a glance what is going on.
i'm located in usa nowhere near a bitcoin atm or trusted seller to meet in person without a legal job are there any amount maximums i should consider when transferring to the philippines much love and many thank.
hey just wanted to know what everybody is using as operating system to conduct bm business and what opinions on security risks you have i for one use gnu linux ubuntu i was surprised to see so many pgp keys being generated on windows machines you think it's save with no one knowing what microsoft actually put in their code and what about macs or should we all just be using tails.
i got everything i asked for she's always been a pleasure to work with.
i don't know but when you do register please pretty please use the referral link in the top of my si.
which market do you prefer buying or selling on and why.
on march amquote from liquifried on march amhi gang daytripper and others waiting did anything arrive yet wanting to order same next day shipout looks sounds great but we have a time limit if it actually takes two weeks there'll be a bunch of disappointed people somebody please tell me some good news lfno pack landing today i was instructed that my pack was dropped off on saturday and should be picked up last monday so now a full week has passed for shipping and nothing personally i'm close to writing this off as either a never sent b intercepted but perhaps i should give it the full days for us mail since i know bh is on the opposite coast and that is only fair but i've personally never had any mail that i've known about take days to get delivered when no storms weather incidents are occurring that's odd i wonder why i received my sample l l.
rictor do you want the postal police banging on your door asking for their cents do they still do that i've had them drop off a card and had to go down n pay to pick up the mail which would scare the shit out of me if it was a pack that was under postaged maybe rip off the section with the stamps and postage due info and just take it to a post office they might ask for your address to set things straight maybe they do keep track and will bother you with a request letter i'd consume the drugs in the house and go ask the mailman after they all wear off and the house is clean l.
even if its ssl encrypted its still possible for the receiving server usps to notice that this requests comes from an tor exit node given what we nowadays know about surveillance i wouldn't take any chances rather use a vpn good proxy sock from a public network when it comes to you worrying about mac addresses fake i.
bitcoin blender is the first one i ever tried and it worked very fast i had no troubles and was able to withdraw instantly after depositing you can also set it to withdraw your coins later at random times with multiple withdraws to make it even harder to trace as for bitcoin fog i would avoid it i've read too many negative reviews saying that people never got their coins back some do but some don't apparently they might be doing a selective scam they don't scam all people so they can stay and look innocent and blame the issues on other services ect and keep people using their services so they can keep doing it.
es okay thanks for the info it kind of spooked me out yesterday jf there is no such thing as we love avengers marketplace the word has just been put in there by the admins to stop someone from spamming this place the original reference was to d r e a m m a r k e t.
is it official tmg policy not to mention the d word any more if so why am i missing something fundamental here.
thanks for the link and enjoy.
well my order came in today i needed it for the past weekend however this will be nice to hold on to for future use came mostly as small rocks with some powder it has a dull white almost bone color to it with some of the rocks being very translucent stealth was ok for domestic could've have used a visual barrier hand written address and poorly chosen fake name now my biggest complaint is that there is postage due and a message on the envelope saying the postage needs to be paid and that the return address is not good i am not exactly sure what this means for as i've never had an issue quite like this.
lelantos lelantoss bcnwbv onion although not free all funds go towards server maintenance and software hardware upgrades urss mail f onion a free service based in russia and brazil here is a link to more ideas not onion based but outside of usa anonymous proxy servers net en help email provider html safemailif using safe mail make sure you use manual pgp encrpytion keep in mind headers like the subject cc to and metadata aren't encrypted although though you said you're accessing it through tor so why not use a onion based email service such as those above also bare in mind that safe mail broadcasts when you are online here are some thoughts on why this is bad to use but bare in mind their policy on drugs and also that they are hosted in usa if you do decide to use them probably best not to sign up with a name such as iselldrugs riseup netquoteq what about child porn drugs corruption etc would you fight law enforcement requests for users doing these things a those things violate riseup s terms of service and unlike some more american libertarian service providers we do not exist to provide privacy for doing anything you want we would close the accounts of people doing those things and the collective may even decide to cooperate with law enforcement rather than set all the servers on fire and destroy the organization and your email.

some people say that small domestic order are fine in your own address if you can keep a clean house a few days before and a few days after and if it's not too often abandoned building might look weird if there hasn't been letters there for a while you might want to test it first and why not register for some crap using that name and address consider switching drop point after a few successful drops the mailbox of a family out for holidays can be nice but your package has to come before they come back from holidays and you have to be able to check their mailbox without neighbors seeing you that's a complicated matter.

galindoi on july pmagora is the bulk of my new customers but after an order or two most people are moving to direct deals i'm probably at agora and direct deals it has an ebb and flow to it galindoithanks for your response i look forward to doing business with you soon.
astraltraveler on june amvanilla reload moneygram are they like washing btc or just like a ewallet but bank option is connected to your real name if cash isnt optional random person buys btc through local with bank and send it to helix and from helix to another helix then to market would that work sorry for all these newbie reload and moneygram are ways that you would send money to a person selling btc on local bitcoins the bank option isn't connected to your name since your depositing cash into the local bitcoin's sellers account you don't give your name at any point sc.
topic pretty much explains it it seems i missed the train on doi dob c x's were about to be bought before agora went down so if anyone can point me in the right direction that'd be wonderful looking for blotter on the doi dob and powder for the c x's thanks.
i understand that electrum is the best way to go but if someone ever needed an online wallet which one would be the one to use also should you use it on tor because i heard somewhere that btc over tor somehow deanonomizes you also do you need to use a mixer if you're sending it to a unique btc address you're given when doing a direct wallet to wallet transaction with a vendor i don't really like using mixers but i will if it's critical to opse.

currency it isn't anchored to gold or any other asset meaning its value when exchanged for fiat currencies can fluctuate quite wildly whenever you make a bitcoin transaction it is recorded on a public ledger called the block chain this means anybody can see any transaction made see the tough part the part that makes bitcoin the currency of choice for anonymous purchases is linking transactions to people to reduce the chances of transaction being traced back to yourself you can 'tumble' your bitcoins tumbling your bitcoins is a way of swapping your original btc for other people's btc in order to sever your block chain trail this makes it more difficult for people to link your purchases to you it is important to tumble your coins through either a tor hidden service or using a wallet routed

sure all sensitive conversations are properly encrypted lastly no one is sure that these e mail providers won t comply with law enforcement or that they are really private so treat this as information not an endorsement.
well shame on me i lost e why is still on hidden wiki.
xncsux on march pm that's odd i wonder why i received my sample l lno idea maybe the pack was actually sent later than bh told me and it will show up in a day or so curious to see if bh can update the group since he made a quick appearance yesterday and can let everyone publicly know what is going on and if everything was truly sent or not.
another thing i sent out packages this is why i would like to know who received and didn't received there there packages i very easily could have missed a couple packages and i fully apologize if that is the case.
im terribly sorry if this is not the right place to ask but when the agora website told me to click a certain link for an invite it ended up not working i was wondering if someone here could help me perhaps thanks a lot and sorry again if this isn't a good place to ask.
hey there people to the people that called dibs and told you that you were in can you please send me your addresses today this is us us only so for that i had another spot open i have spot open right now for those that were interested if the address don't come from the others that made dibs i will have another spots open also to the people that did call dibs i'm also going to be throwing g of mdma in with the order also enough for people if you would not like the mdma please let me know and i will not send it along much love tmg b.
we're looking into itcurrently available on dream tmgcheers s.
op more than likely you sent coins to an incorrect address you gotta be on your toes and please stop spreading fud what you're saying is a completely ridiculous statement agora is tops right up there with bmr and backopy falco.

hansa market registration link you use a referral link you get a commisson fee and no registration bond for every vendor for a limited time only market link darknet market with the main focus on a trustless payment system which makes it impossible for the vendors or the site staff to run away with bitcoins of the buyers here are the main features that distinguish hansa market from other darknet markets multi signature escrow between vendors and hansafunds can only be accessed by the vendor after the buyer finalizes a transaction and can never be accessed by the site staff theft from either party is impossible no bitcoin depositsevery order has its unique bitcoin address similar to bitpay's or coinbase's payment system buyers have minutes to pay the order and do not have to wait for deposits to arrive payments are submitted to the vendor after confirmation and the vendor is then given h to accept or decline the order which transfers the funds into our multi signature escrow system or back to a refund address which the buyer provided no finalize earlywe do not support fe or partial escrow releases and we don't have to the multisignature escrow makes it impossible for the site staff or vendors to steal any bitcoins other search engine i p support bitmessage notifications optional auto delivery for digital goods high server uptim.

hello all my link to register at abraxas is below for all that wish to buy lots of drugs.
pgp tails virtual box so keep in mind that if you are a user of silk road or any other form of activism you never want to enter any identifying details about yourself online make it so that even if the nsa intercepted and decrypted or compromised silk road that the only information they have against you is your username and password how safe is that username and password does your password contain any identifying information is it the same password that you use for your personal email does it contain a name of somebody you know personally always keep all of these factors in mind another step you must take especially when communicating with other users on sites such as silk road is using pgp encryption this is not always possible such as in cases when you are logging into a website filling out a form logging into an email etc consider any type of information you enter into a website using plain text possibly compromised never put anything sensitive is any type of plain text format online pgp comes into play because it uses a very strong method of encryption called cryptography pgp stands for pretty good privacy and it is used for encrypting decrypting and signing texts e mails files directories and whole disk partitions and to increase the security of e mail communications for the more technical users it uses a serial combination of hashing data compression symmetric key cryptography and finally public key cryptography for the less technical users the process of encrypting messages using pgp is as follows you create a private key and a public key the public key is the key you give out to people you want to send you encrypted messages your private key is kept privately by you this private key is the only key that can unlock messages that were previously locked with your public key if you are still confused think about it like this think about a public key that can go around locking boxes that are intended for you anyone can lock a box that is intended for you but you are the only one with the key to unlock the box either if the person who sent you a message locked a box message with your public key they themselves can not unlock it only the person possessing the private key can unlock it if you wish to respond to this person you must use their public key to encrypt the message you intend to send to them and they themselves use their own private key to decrypt the message you sent them if you are still with me i am glad i haven't lost you yet this is called cryptography and was designed so that anybody intercepting your message could not decrypt the message without your private key even if you yourself lose your private key there is no method of key recovery you can consider that message locked forever so how do you use pgp well before we get to that i want to introduce you to a live operating system which makes using pgp encryption and decryption very easy a live operating system is an operating system that you can run on top of your current operating system so for example if you are a windows user you have choices you can download the live operating system burn it to a cd or dvd and then boot your computer from that dvd or cd this will make sure your computer run as if you have this operating system installed on your computer however if you remove the cd or dvd and reboot then your computer will boot as normal you can also use a usb drive to perform this same feature secondly you can run this live operating system in what's called a virtual box the benefits of this are that you can run windows simultaneously as you run this other operating system and you can easily switch back and forth between them without rebooting the computer both methods have their pros and cons the pros of running a live cd boot are that reduce the risk of having your computer compromised by viruses malware and keyloggers that rely on windows to run if you are going to run this os from a virtual box i suggest downloading virtual box from oracle note the next the live operating system i would encourage you to use is tails tails can be found at the following website the reason i choose tails is because it has many of the security features that you require to stay anonymous already installed some users are not happy with tails but it really is a great operating system loaded with security features many i will talk about in this series on security including pgp encryption and decryption make sure you download the tails iso file from the official tails website and you can either load it into virtual box or burn it to a dvd or load it onto a usb and booting your computer from that drive there are plenty of tutorials on how to load tails into virtual box so i won't go into much detail other than make sure you run virtual box and tails from a usb drive or sd card i would suggest a usb drive however for reasons i will explain later but basically when when virtual box runs directly on your hard drive it creates a virtual hard drive that is uses as a temporary hard drive while tails is running once tails is closed this virtual drive is deleted but it's not permanently deleted as we know from the power of recovery tools deleted files are easily recoverable with the right tools i will talk about how to protect your files from data recovery tools in future posts but for now just keep virtual box and tails off of your hard drive and load it either on a usb drive or sd card the same goes when booting your computer directly into tails from a dvd or usb stick your hard drive will be used to store files used by tails so make sure any files that are saved or accessed using tails are done from a usb stick or sd card otherwise they will be recoverable this is why i prefer using a virtual box and running both the virtual box and tails inside of it off of a usb stick keep as much as possible off of your actual hard drive it is possible to shred files beyond recovery but it's much easier to do this on a gb flash drive then it is a tb hard drive next post we will get back on topic and start learning how to use pgp the reason i have to take a detour to using tails is because we will be using tails for many of the features from here on out including pgp.
tails on a usb disk is pretty good the only problem is that as the system partition is writable an attacker could tamper your system when using a dvd on each reboot you know that you have a clean system as long as you used a clean image when burning the cd you then can have an encrypted partition to store your files on a usb disk or a microsd you'd then have to open it manually and work with text files or manually link folders you'd need during your cession you can always have a better opsec tails on a dvd for internet access and a second offline computer to encrypt and decrypt documents software isolation or physical isolation to protect your tor process tor over vpn over anonymous wifi live dvd software isolation on top of some physical isolation on a system that can't be tampered with possibilities are endless it's up to you to decide if it's worth it or not if you're a small time buyer don't worry tails is pretty good as it is if you have fun working your opsec up are a paranoid geek or a high profile target this might not be enough for you if not you'll probably fine on your vpn question it will be needed only if you feel the need to hide the fact that you are using tor to your isp that will do nothing more if you use an anonymous wifi connection you probably don't need it remember don't tell too much on your setup we don't need to know if you use a wireless connection or your own dsl router that might help an attacker find who you are and what are the weaknesses of your setup.
anytime we are here to hel.
i spoke of no phishing site but spamming and i have no idea what the site you mention is.
check if you are you using the latest tbb laters tails whonix if custom system are you sure your setup is good if you are unsure i'd advise to use tails from a dvdr on a second hand laptop with no hdd you can find that for cheap on craigslist you also could use whonix on a hard drive if your machine is powerful enough tails is great if you don't run it from a usb stick in that an attacker can't modify the system and each time you reboot you reboot clean as long as the original system you burn is not compromised you can use an encrypted usb stick to store your bookmarks in a text file your gpg key and everything that you could need whonix is great as it allow for better isolation if you safely store a copy of both images offline you will be able to start fresh from time to time to be sure you run a clean system.
best not to use an online wallet ie blockchain info but rather a desktop one like electrum for everyday tasks can't beat armory for cold storage.
saw that no explanation as yet but agora had closed lips in downtime and it never did them any harm only strengthening their reputation think the yanks are still sleeping but i'm sure the reddit kids will get their popcorn out in the next hour.
on may pmany advice on cleaning my computer now that i am using tails exclusively whereas before i was using windows does tor store any information about sites visited onto my computer or do i only need to worry about deleting pgp keys and such what's the best way to go about completely wiping these things anything else i should be worried about what are the risks associated with enabling scripts on blockchain or reddit i'm still learning about opsec but i will try and help if you are using tails exclusively on that machine i would recommend a dban nuke it deletes everything off of you computer just google dban download the file to a cd or usb and then you can wipe all contents of the computer while keeping tails safe on a usb tails is an amnesia systems when you exit tails your computer system is wiped of all knowledge of the tails session although i believe your isp may still be able to tell you were using tor not sure on this no need to delete pgp keys files or the like from your persistent folder tails is encrypted as long as your have a strong pass phrase for the system you are good to go as always forbid scripts globally see the s to the left of the url bar click it i am not sure on the reddit question just don't associate accounts and use a new identity to view pages like that if you are using the blockchain for your wallet i recommend you stop download and use the electrum wallet client there are many write ups on this if you have any other questions feel free to ask or pm me i do not know everything about opsec but i will help you if i can cheers rhet.
the only trouble is most people have a horrible time dealing with mulisignature escrow it's just too hard to understand especially for newbies i ecommend dream market mindful shama.
seems like its the season of small exit scams previously a market would wait until it reaches a certain size or accumulated a certain amount of btc before pulling the plug and diving with everyone s money nowadays it seems that it just happens with the first deposit thug market or once the market manages to generate at least minor amount of popularity eic allegedly maybe its the relative stability of the current major markets alpha bay nucleus which dominate the market and hold new markets back from getting any significant traffic until the admins just say fuck the risk and take whatever they can but nobody knows for sure anyway it seems that this time it was east india company a market that was hacked exploited back in august losing btc and which we had ranked as the th most popular market back in november and gained some popularity since then by implementing multisig and promoting itself mostly on reddit as an exit scam proof market while still enabling regular escrow deposits and having only minor amount of its users using the multisig option as reported by several vendors for now the market is unreachable for the past hours without any word from the admins while some reports surfaced on reddit about coin being drained from their addresses is it really gone exit scammed will be back within couple of weeks time will tell for now we ll just assume they are another example for the dark net markets most profitable industry exit scams this post will be updated if new information will surface.
oldisgold on may pmthe ckl obj gypcu onion should work but make sure your own port in electrum is set to and not the port of server is and tcp is enabled the tor browser bundle was updated to connect to this port connects pretty fast from my experience you could also try to use the auto connect feature but i'm not sure how safe it is definitely update to the latest electrum version first older versions had some features that could leak your ip most of these things have been fixed but i'm not sure they are all gone if you're using tails it should be fine i think since it routes through tor by default but i'm not a security expert it is my understanding that for to work tor browser bundle has to be running works independently of that as long as you have the standalone tor package installed which tails has afaik though i use deb and am no expert in tails.
i here you it does suck there's so many times that folks around here share a youtube link or something of the like that i'd love to check out but nope it's not safe then other times i'd love to check it out on the clearnet later but never do due to healthy paranoia some of the links people share are in my opinion way to specific or niche for me to feel safe checking them out i remember reading somewhere that simply downloading tor software may land a person on a list not that most of us would be of interest anyway but at the sametime i don't think dragnet browser fingerprinting or something of that nature is beyond the scope of the enemy but i'm no expert sometimes i have to disable js just for a second though in order to use a couple essential sites hate it but don't know what else to do i definitely feel your pain there was a post on r darknetmarkets yesterday with a lengthy and informative discussion about approches to vpn tor if you can wade through the reddit bullshit p clearnet link.
welcomei read some articles about the anonymity and i have some questions namely how to remove from surveillance system think about how you can delete or block services tracking programs that work with the system or is it a built in if there are programs to remove this type of spyware or do i need to remove it manually i mean just about disabling tracking services and data leakage two questions i have to cryptography namely i've read about many of the programs and which according to you is the most nuanced i once saw an article about bruce schneier described on his blog how to ensure when working on materials from snowden does anyone have a direct link to its materials or to the hidden web and i would like to ask whether it will be useful to me for these tools regards exorburn.
i'm going to be out for awhile i'll pm you when i return i can try using my current and new key to see what the problem is thank you so much because what he said didn't make absolute sense at all it's just text how can one send a virus that way.
idk agora is target by the fbi and other le a safe person i guess would stay off the markets entirely and see how things play out i just think it's kind of strange that none of the other markets are going down right now as well if its a tor problem then none of them are safe i saw someone post some link about some vulnerability that was found about a month ago this is definitely horrible news idk if we will ever see agora up and running again i haven't received my withdraw yet nor has the majority of people now the site is down for those brave enough to go to another market i would used each one of those before during agora downtime with success why can't things just run smoothly i only got into these darknetmarkets about months ago and it's been nothing but chaos and bad news i guess that comes with the terroitory i'll be pressing on myself direct deals only though for now.
goodfornothing on may pmseems like a pretty bad time to be depositing coin to agora even when they come online for hours and it seems issues have been solved it seems like a big tease everyone who can't wait to get back on and get shit done and hasn't been scared off yet is like hope it stays up oh what's that it's staying up seemingly oh wait nevermind fuck fuck fuck fuck at this point i think it would be ambitious to get too comfortable even if it goes consecutive days with uptime oh and i'm not mocking the op i've fallen into the semi comfort of a little bit of responsive uptime a bit too easily too howdy gfn thank you for the response it's weird not being able to trust the dnm but it's a giving being blessed with dpr before was just soo easy to have lack of downtime quick deposits withdraws that when i go to make an order on any marketplace i just quickly jump the gun which is faulty faulty on my end as i get left with in limbo however agora has fixed this and given me my btc i was still worried sick for multiple days like i can't lose that much money that's more than my car is worth i just need to be more understanding for the dnm but at the same time know that they could bail for numerous reasons at anytime.
decrypt a message copy the message to be decrypted into the clipboard left click on the clipboard icon on the menu bar and select decrypt verify clipboard enter the passphrase you used to protect your secret key and hit ok on the pinentry window a gnupg results window should pop up with the decrypted message if you don't get the menu entry decrypt verify clipboard when you left click on the clipboard something is wrong with the formatting of the message that you copied into the clipboard to be decrypted make sure that you are copying all of the message including the five dashes at the beginning and end of the message and the begin and end statements pgp is very picky about formatting errors.
first off hello and welcome to the garden when searching a name and getting the you do not have permission it is just the way to forum is set up only mods and admins have access to this info afaik to speak with a vendor find a post of theirs and click the conversation ballon under their username if they have e mail linked there will also be a envelope you can click to get you pgp key simply generate a key then find the asc file and open it with gedit text editor or notepad and it should display your public key then save this word document somewhere safe and it will always be available to you to display your public pgp key on this site follow the instructions above then post the info here after you have done this you click on your individual post copy paste the url into your signature hope this sheds some light for you thanks for choosing the garden we are a very friendly people ask all the questions your heart desires we want everyone to have tight opsec and enjoy their darknet expierence.

lsd avengers spokesperson on january pmquote from doses lysergic on january amquote from dxuutx on december pmif anything this is more proof that hos or whoever is a major target of law enforcement and that we really shouldn't be talking about this business on the clearnet anywhere than any notion that the whole sub is just a honeypot i think the arrogant sense that people on the sub have that their crimes aren't worthy of targeting from law enforcement these are people who live to make drug arrests i also think it's a bit alarmist to assert that it exists only for this purpose and that no worthwhile discussion takes place thereon and it's not insignificant seemingly to me that hos didn't have any overt problems with reddit when the reviews were adulatory and the attitude changed when they started to turn critical lol speak english its not insignificant it is not not significant when you use a double negative you obscure your meaning thereon this word has been used not since again not one knows what the fuck not insignificant' again that 'hos didn't' have a problem when the reviews were positive adulatory if you yern to be not unlike leo tolstoy well then i'll just not continue writing now thanks professor dl some of my friends try to say as many double negatives in one sentence i aint got no nothing or anything to say sometimes but i try anywho my post has nothing to do with hos and they are not the messenger the bottom line is no one should be posting anything about dnm on reddit period my initial reaction is not opposed to your proposition the discussion of our present cloak and dagger endevours should be kept not on this superflous clearnet reddit.

bonobo on january pmalways use tails if you are a regular or making even a single large order absolutely correct  bonobo on january pmwindows tends to leave too much traces behind in anycase use gpg usb rather than pgpwin as the usb version is more portable windows has been described correctly imo as a forensic technician's wet dream tails is the ideal solution for the most part however many people consider this solution 'too difficult' gpg usb is a reasonable compromise better that they use something as opposed to using nothing as was often the case on silk road that's why the silk road servers were such a bonanza for the feds when they were seized as almost everything was in plaintext i e non encrypted spitfir.
i have not been able to successfully use blockchain from tails i can create an account but when i go to log in the username and password fields never load is this an issue with javascript or something maybe someone could tell me how to adjust my settings to allow this.
pm me if you want the name of a btc trader on bitcointalk org the main hub of info for btc he will do greendot moneypak codes for btc at bitstamp rate cash btc don't talk about darknet stuff with him all you're doing is buying btc you can buy moneypak at most grocery and convience stores make sure you get the reload card not the debit card it looks like a phone card i trusted him with a couple hundred dollars and it went fine he's a senior member and has a good trust rating he could still rip you off though so proceed with caution.
and yea new tails is a little wonky they also took the encrypt decrypt option out of gedit hmu if you need assistance.
if you google pgp encryption site the first listing is igolder a gold trading site with pgp help then software wike etc my first question is if you use a clearnet site like that one that does the encrypt decrypt can all you type in become open to prying eyes i know that sounds naive but i really don't know second how important is key size and a bonus third question say i'm browsing my favorite vendors for fun and then go to search a word on google is mixing tor with clearnet a security problem.
looks like you've been keeping yourself busy i applaud you on your efforts to make the darknet a better place i don't really have any tech skills but i would love to help you if there is anything a non tech savy person can contribute.
i completely second that opinion plus they have a nice focus on security with automatic pgp encryption of all messages requiring to sign a pgp key if changed etc they are constantly posting updates and showing work done and it feels they have been building the place slowly but surely the fact that there are no weapons no scamming no fraud no bullshit is one of the major factors that makes it my market of choice at the moment i think they have just opened registrations freely to everyone recently and untill further notice.
just sent through bit blender i'll report back with the results let's hope this works seems like everything is going smoothly so far peace mrs b.
that's new lol i've never had a message like that appear on here and i've been here since around the forum first started that's super weird hopefully one of the admins sees this and has a response regarding it.
banana i've never heard of this but i'll look into it my plate is full for now with a lot of projects so this is something that i may never get to work on especially with the availability of easier and proven alternative routes.
bombheadie on march pmguys i am ao fukcking sorry the screen broke on my laptop i didn't run i rpromise you this let me catch up on everything that i missed i can't begin to tell you how sorry i am about this glad to see your back and i also have a question bomb about ald when i read the wikipedia for it it mentions something about blood pressure that it may increase it do you know anything about this l l.
whoever placed that order with me today please dispute it it went out today and you should get it in a couple days but dispute the fuck out of it as if i didn't send it because they just deleted my account and are stealing all my money dispute it saying i scammed you or something i don't want those motherfuckers to get that money that i earned.
agora is notorious for having delayed withdraw deposits grant it they always pull threw but it's been at an all time high lately not to mention there is a btc stress test going on until the morning.
glad i'm not on that market even though nothing is tied to my irl identity.
has anything good come out of dhl it seems like it's scarce and not many vendors there have many reviews if any at all.
blue dream on january pmfirst off cirrus wasn't jared only after they took over the cirrus account perhaps the question is moot really whether jared was the original cirrus or not the damage is done  blue dream on january pmsecond ross is going to jail i'm actually very surprised in his defense now admitting that he created sr then left and then was brought back by unknown people to work support it sounds pretty farfetched to me there is no question that ross is going to jail the only question is for how long ross's primary failing was that he hung on to too much data it would appear that the backup server had data going back to the beginning of silk road's operations not just months as he had told everyone furthermore his refusal to mandate the use of pgp left a treasure trove of unencrypted data that the feds will be mining for years but the real stupidity the pi ce de r sistance as it were was his keeping a diary he provided the prosecution with the rope they're going to use to hang him with spitfir.
sexywax approved.
its true though can't trust carders ab has made me very insecure about bunch of stuff the admin over there is dip shit wont be surprised he was part of the carders crew from evo and the tor carding forums or whatever lairs and cheats there seem like a bunch of familiar faces over in the moderation crew who are just watching the whole thing unfold and not doing jackshi.
the change to a new kernel and reports of users having issues including dirtysouf not being able to verify the signing key has me stuck on tails is there an alternative that includes usb mounting persistence and memory wiping at shutdown anyone very knowledgeable feel safe using the upgrade the upgraded kernel is the same flavor of linux used by redhat which works very closely with the us government.
oh i had no idea thank you for letting me kno.
on january pmi did try this i typed the text that i want to encrypt and saved the text file to the desktop then i found the file in the file in the desktop folder hilighted it and selected edit then selecting encrypt it then allows me to check the key of the recipient after i do that it creates another file that ends in pgp this seems like it should work just fine but when i open the file it looks like there is heiroglyphic symbols mixed in with normal letters about of each not sure what is going on still the reason that the file when you attempt to edit it looks like hieroglyphics is because the file is not ascii armoured files that are encrypted and not ascii armoured usually end in pgp here's how to do it so it'll work properly for you these instructions assume you've already generated your own pgp key and have saved both the public and private halves to external storage remember tails is amnesic meaning that if you don't backup your data keyrings they will not be there for you the next time you fire up tails to do this follow these steps click on places computer on the top menu a new window will pop up with a series of locations devices on the left and a list of folders on the right plug in your usb stick or micro sd card if recognized the device will appear in the list of devices in the left hand pane go to applications terminal a terminal session will then open up the prompt will look something like this amnesia amnesia issue the command cd media amnesia issue the command ls la you will see a folder directory with its' name in blue perhaps something like f e db where the f e db is the device identifier folder name issue the cd command to switch into that folder i e cd f e db issue the command to copy your secret keys to a single file gpg armour export secret keys o secret keys asc issue the command to copy your public keys to a single file gpg armour export o public keys ascyour pgp keys are now backed up onto external media so you will have them ready for use the next time you fire up tails now as far as encrypting messages goes click on the little clipboard icon in the top menu bar and select open text editor the last entry in the editor compose your text to be encrypted when you're done composing use control a to select all the text and control c to copy it to the clipboard click on the little clipboard icon again only this time select the second option sign encrypt clipboard with public keys a select rcipients box will pop up and you can put a check on the left most checkbox to select the recipients click on ok to encrypt the contents of the clipboard with the selected public keys when the contents of the clipboard are encrypted you will see a little padlock icon superimposed on the clipboard click on the clipboard icon again select open text editor and right click wiht your mouse and choose paste a copy of your ascii armored encrypted message will be seen there the message can be pasted anywhere else you need it to go to decrypt a message copy the encrypted message to the clipboard click on the clipboard icon chosing the first option decrypt verify clipboard a new dialog box will pop up asking for your passphrase type it in and click ok a new screen will then pop up showing you your decrypted text this text can be copied and pasted to wherever you need it to go hope this helps spitfir.
hidid someone send some founds to agora did it work well heard they had problem last weeks and would like to know if it's fixed as they claim or if it isn't thank.
yeah agora s been in limbo for a while now i would advise you not to deposit or accept any money there until it s been stable for a while great market when it s more stable but this has been a bad time.
my very first order on the dnm was on middle earth ordered some adderall for a friend from addguy even though i was anxious and checking in with addguy everyday order went through very smooth addguy was great and communicative and when the order i went back to me and withdrew the remaining btc that was left with no issues i would order through me again with no hesitation just don't have java script enabled.
hmm might have to check it out since agora registrations seem to be closed and i forgot my login credentials as for noscript i am using tails but the browser always seems to start up with scripts enabled so i have to disable them manually is there a way to have scripts disabled by default i could not find anything in the preferences edit found it in the tor button options security needs to be set to high.
gleeful on january pmstay away i wouldn't even log onto the site it was left with nobody at the helm for several days before it went down then it pops back up with no explanation there is a strong possibility that it has been taken over by le with vendors and buyers of bulk being at the greatest risk agreed looks sketchy as fuck avoid.

on march pmgoing through every page of this thread i think the summary is as follows receivedxncsux interest dibs but no package ever zipstyle never received reply from bhapostleofjor actual order and not sample rictor i know not everyone in the above list probably sent in a sample request or order formally but they postured in the forum as if they were so i included them just to be clear idk if i received the sample i moved to a town mins away from my box and haven't even checked it i've been so busy with work i haven't got the chance i'm going there for a concert this wed and will check then tbh i really am not even going to trip if the sample isn't there i really only care if my ketamine from hmdd is there it would be sweet if it is there tho and if it is i promise to write a review and trip report bh is a good dude i'm sure he'll come through for all of you.

ab doesnt ever bother to resolve disputes the coins will be in escrow forever till they decide to ban both the buyer and the vendor and steal the coins i had around half btc in a dispute with a vendor who had exit scammed they never released it or even responded to any of the messages i sent them in this regard apologize for the profanity but fuck ab.
nothing came today either i'm officially writing this off tomorrow if it doesn't land.
not to sound unsympathetic but all this thread contains are excuses in one form or another dear tmg family be careful and sorry for your loss es.
im terribly sorry if this is not the right place to ask but when the agora website told me to click a certain link for an invite it ended up not working i was wondering if someone here could help me perhaps thanks a lot and sorry again if this isn t a good place to as.

it s a scam it s a mirror of sr it will happily take your bitcoin but does not allow you to withdraw anything and when you try to place an order it doesn t actually place it and just loops you back to the main page.
dont use clearnet sites on tor you could be a victim of phishing attacks even if you are using a site the exit nodes could prey on you and send a malicious certificate to fool the browse.
love is all around us on may pmi do not miss logging into agora and seeing pornographic images used in many listings plastered all accross my screen that face when you've bought a account of evolution in the past and are not proud of i.
tails stands for the amnesiac incognito live system tails is a live system that aims at preserving your privacy and anonymity it helps you to use the internet anonymously almost anywhere you go and on any computer but leave no trace using unless you ask it explicitly it is a complete operating system designed to be used from a dvd or a usb stick independently of the computer's original operating system it is free software and based on debian gnu linux tails comes with several built in applications pre configured with security in mind web browser instant messaging client email client office suite image and sound editor etc tails relies on the tor anonymity network to protect your privacy online the pre installed software is configured to connect through tor and direct non anonymous connections are blocked tails is being constantly updated for security flaws you will need to do this all over again soon to stay safe this comes from the tails website it's very important to keep your version of tails up to date otherwise your system will be vulnerable to numerous security holes the development team is doing its best to release new versions fixing known security holes on a regular basis you will need x gb usb thumb drives gb may pass they are very cheap and available almost everywhere download the latest version of the tails iso file from here remember where you save it if you are an advanced user you can download the cryptographic signature on this same page and then verify the download with the tails key from here download the latest version of the linux universal usb installer from here run the newly downloaded universal usb installer a read and 'agree to' the disclaimer b select tails from the first drop down list it's towards the end of the list step c browse to and select the tails iso file step d select your usb drive letter format the drive if its not empty already step e click 'create' button then wait for it to finish will be a few minutes at least restart the computer and boot into tails from the usb drive see below for details on booting from a usb drive booting from a usb drive if it does not automatically boot to the usb drive you need to select the boot order some newer computers will allow you to select which drive to boot to with a small menu without changing bios settings you might instead need to edit the bios settings restart your computer and watch for a message telling you which key to press to enter the bios setup it will usually be one of f f del esc or f press this key while your computer is booting to edit your bios settings you need to edit the boot order depending on your computer you should see an entry for 'removable drive' or 'usb media' move this to the top of the list to force the computer to attempt to boot from usb before booting from the hard disk save your changes and continue many flash drives ship usb fdd formatted and some systems will not detect or even boot usb fdd most systems can however boot usb zip and or usb hdd if you are having a hard time getting your bios to detect your flash drive you can try to format it as usb hdd or usb zip using the bootice program or similar caution this is a very advanced program use with caution follow links for the latest version more detailed instruction on how to boot from usb you can read you have problems accessing the bios read this other questions ask away or pm i will not accept donations for this tutorial i offer this only in hope that more people will start using tor if you have excess bitcoins you feel like donating to a worthy cause please send them to tor or tails up installing a persistent volume alongside a liveusb copy of tails this is why you need two usb drives you should now be presented with a log in prompt for a temporary session administration password this is reset every time you load tails it is optional to enter this it is used to allow current session access to system functions if you get any errors about access rights try using an admin password at log in also at this point you can optionally select to use a windows xp camo 'skin' to make tails look more like xp if you're in a public place for example this is also optional once tails is up and running insert the second usb drive click the 'applications accessories' menu then highlight 'tails' then click 'tails usb installer' a click the st option clone install b select your target device from the drop down menu your second usb drive c click 'next' then wait for it to finish however long to copy about gb to a usb drive usually a few minutes this will install a new copy of tails onto your second usb drive this will be your new proper tails usb shutdown this session of tails with the power button up in the right hand corner don't forget to take out the first usb you created and boot into the new second tails usb you can format the first usb drive later on that copy of tails is no longer required log in to the new tails usb once logged in click the 'applications' menu then highlight the 'system tools' sub menu then click on configure persistent volume the size of the persistent volume is automatically determined by how much left over space is on the usb drive after installing tails in the previous steps a choose your pass phrase for the persistent volume you will need to enter this every time you login to tails the persistent volume is an encrypted partition protected by a pass phrase once the persistent volume is created you can choose to activate it or not each time you start tails it is a good place to store sensitive materials when choosing your pass phrase remember that short easily guessed pass phrases are very easily cracked it would take one intel i k cpu over years to brute force crack an aes encrypted random character pass phrase using lowercase uppercase p c characters b click create and wait for it to finish c on completion a window will popup allowing you to select what tails will save in the new persistent volume automatically internet shortcuts pgp keys nudie pictures application settings etc i recommend selecting everything close and reboot with your modem plugged in and switched on log back into tails with your new persistent volume make sure your modem is plugged in and turned on click the 'system' menu then highlight the 'preferences' submenu then click on 'network connections' now only you know what type of internet connection you pay for i cannot help you with that my personal internet connection was amazingly simple to setup i was quite surprised by its pre configured setups it has many different countries options for local telcos pre installed another note tails is pre configured to go through tor it is pre installed with vidalia and a torified browser called 'iceweasel' it should automatically open up when connected to the internet if not use the 'iceweasel' browser menu shortcut to get onto the road also this operating system is not persistent for security measures meaning that any changes you make that are not saved in the persistent volume will not be saved on restarting tails you are now finished feel free to click through all the menus and play with the applications.
well i might be able to limit it to a loss if i can get a guy who just placed a order with me and already shipped to agree to me canceling the order and then paying me directly there is a risk for me there but a smaller one then for sure not getting any of it if escrow is released to my frozen wallet.
honestly i would order domestic for your first pack it will only take a few days and there is very little risk only to ease that first pack paranoia.
i m unfamiliar with this method would you mind going into deeper detail unsure what i would ask for or if i have to have some sort of account with a bank on the listing.
hi this is the invitation link to join dream market a lot of options very friendly enviroment lots of love my friends.
yes ootp know that blueviking is also working on something hope to see it soon.
thanks for this looks like that helix link isn't working or maybe they're down right now.
let s do it the first step is to get people to exchange bitcoin pubkeys so they can generate the same address and confirm that the one provided by the escrow agent isn t fake.
sure it's safe but won't had much more privacy as most vpn providers keep log even if they say they don't always assume they do it would hide to your isp the fact that you are using tor best way to do it would probably be to use a router running dd wrt or openwrt that would connect to the vpn and force all traffic to go through the vpn see cleanet for how to and then tails whonix or your own custom solution on a dedicated computer vpn on your main system tbb would work too of course.
i just cannot seem to wrap my head around bitcoinsi'm a bit confused on the whole matter i signed up for coinbase via tor with a sigaint email however buying and selling bitcoins is not available in my country yet so am i supposed to use google chrome or something i mean i'll probably just do it the noob way and buy coins with a card i can get from my local store that doesn't require any info but i feel like if i sign up for coinbase on chrome and use it to buy shite from middle earth on tor that's suspicious right and then there's wallets for storing coins correct and helix i don't know i just feel a bit confused and the guides don't really help me for some reason edit in a nutshell i'm aware that i shouldn't make an account on coinbase via chrome then suddenly use it on tor i'm just confused as to how i should take my usd money turn it into bitcoins and spend it on me.
dancingbear on march ambitcoin fog is taking a very long time to do deposits and withdrawals is there any other service or way to tumble coins that is worth it i too would like to know this i used to have confidence in fog but the recent events make me very nervous to push any sizeable amount of coin through their service.
i have been trying to register with the site grams and i have been repeatedly issued the same error and i'm not sure what i am doing wrong any help would be greatly appreciated when i submit my application the following error occurs the pgp key you enter was invalid please ensure you are submitting an ascii armored pgp public key i have copy pasted the public key from my asc file directly into the field on the grams register page when i do this i've noticed that it distorts the message by adding spaces into the pgp key block i wasn't sure if my text editor was adding the crlf or space characters so i tried deleting them manually to no avail any help and or insight would be greatly appreciated best regards.
lovelyface on april pmhi guys im pretty new to this and have spent some time trying to work out tails and im thinking i should get a vpn but then i read this gave me a headacheshould i get a vpn on tails i wouldn't if i were you even in tails when discussion of vpns has come up it would appear that only pptp is being considered for support pptp is no longer considered safe as far as i am determine see the following site for details clearnet spitfir.
they have everything that was done click by click order by order all my passwords all my orders and history of things i bought i went to jail for this and was let out early for good behavior dude this is bombshell shit right here please expand on this more if you re willing or just pm me if you d rather keep this private how in the world would they be able to get your passwords unless they installed a keylogger or something.
the friendly admins have enabled the feature that allows us to opt out of appearing online when we are to do this go to profile account settings then uncheck the option that shows people you are online everyone do this here's some food for thought on why quotethis is because of all those fbi probability attacks they monitor when you activate tor when you log into sites like say this site if it is ever compromised or safe mail which announces to everybody when you are online and then present this incourt and it's apparently solid evidence because plenty of people like jeremony hammond of lulzsec fame got convicted through simple meta data this guy appeared on irc at this time we monitoredhis wifi signal yes they can pinpoint your wifi signal if under surveillance and he was using tor exactly the same time that's all it takes.
support on dhl is always quick even when i mark ticket low priority after spending some time matching everything up it looks like i have received all funds i'm due but it is confusing and i feel like i have to be a part time accountant to keep track of everything i wish manual withdrawal would be an option.
i use electrum it is lightweight encrypted easy to use opensource and promotes security.
it doesn't break the transaction chain so it shouldn't be used on it's own but it's good in combo with different mixing methods.
it was actually a particular key that was causing the problem it still is but i figured out i can use any other key just not that one.
i somehow had of these from albertheinz yet somehow didnt take any just gave them away to friends as presents kept for myself but used it microdose is there really any difference between taking godself and x ug blotters say gg's new stuff should i be pissed is albert still active on agora.
just yesterday i was looking at my wallet and it looked like a few direct deals never hit from dhl glad it's not just m.
spitfire always look to the future my first computer a mhz with mb of ram man was that fast i am sure that if i tried it would take me forever to try and crack an easy md encryption where my duel core ghz cpu will spit it out in no time now instead of using cpu's we moved to a better solution of gpu's the next level will be quantum computers and if you think you will be safe for a while longer think again when looking for a good security blanket keep in mind that you need to be looking into the future and find one that will keep you safe not just cover it up for now to just add one more point i have seen many secure uncrackable bullet proof server or service get taken down one after another because our best today is nothing to what tomorrow will have for us.

im not sure on this so i don't expect any reward or anything but can't you just sell your btc through local bitcoins it's anonymous that way as you'd be getting cash for btc and also you can typically charge more per btc than any of the other exchanges if you live in a particularly small city i think you can also accept moneypak.
scidmt on october pmmaybe we could throw vendors personal sites up there as well i ve got one i know albion does and gamma scigreat idea anyone who wants there market added please post in the threa.
tediousdark on june ami have just been connecting to the normal electrum servers through tor i'm using tails so i'm pretty sure i can't accidentally connect via clearnet what do you mean by normal server i want to make sure i'm not doing the same thing.
always use tails if you are a regular or making even a single large order windows tends to leave too much traces behind in anycase use gpg usb rather than pgpwin as the usb version is more portable.
on march pmnice addition to the garden and those are all great psychedelics thank you i just hope an can contribute a little something to this site.

server manually then config to route through tor tor browser bundle must be running for this to work ssl socks localhost port don t you need to use port.
doses lysergic on january amlol speak english its not insignificant it is not not significant when you use a double negative you obscure your meaning ianae the post by dxuutx undoubtedly contains florid prose perhaps excessively and i appreciate your plea for simple english on internet forums it is usually more effective to have style enhance an argument rather than have the argument be a frame for displaying one's style however the use of the double negative in it's not insignificant is valid here before going further let's first correct the misquote so that the phrase regains its original meaning taken out of context as above the phrase implies the possessive sense of its eg people admired its not insignificant beauty whereas the original was it's an abbreviation of the verb it is yes i know at worst this is a common mistake and at best acceptable textspeak and generally is too small to be worth picking up on but your opening point is that dxuutx should speak english therefore introducing a grammatical error into your first  dxuutx's post unfairly helps your claim as to the phrase itself the double negative is an example of a figure of speech called litotes or more generally meiosis where something is deliberately played down or understated in order to increase its importance litotes is common in many languages both ancient and modern in europe it has a fine pedigree being found in homer's iliad ovld's metamorphoses and the epic poem beowulf logically it may be true that it's not insignificant has the same meaning as it's significant but litotes remains an acceptable way of emphasising a statement even to fowler who would certainly be sympathetic towards your desire for greater clarity a dictionary of modern english usage hw fowler various editions just saying.
it was actually a particular key that was causing the problem it still is but i figured out i can use any other key just not that one.
darcm on november ameverything was okay in the end just got a bit worried there for a moment pso what happened you had to go pay postage at the post office is this a normal occurence and finally is it frowned upon when a vendor does this.
i see people warning when they share clearnet links i've done the same but i'm not sure exactly why i tend to use tor for everything and only use firefox when i watch videos so non onion forums i still browse on tor etc is it not ok to open a clearnet link in tor just wondering if there's anything i should or shouldn't be doing that could compromise opsec thanks in advance for any advic.
valsetriste on december ampmed the vendor albion who i know to be trustworthy and general awesome human being he was really confused as what happened and told that he can t see the money the money is still there though i even checked with my friend that i wasn t hallucinating when i copy pasted the number from the private message please admins help me out hereyou had someone double check a copy and pasted bitcoin address because you might have been hallucinating before the mix up even happened sounds a little strange are you sure that you were not fucked up and may have attributed a little human error some where.
just opened an account over there and for the life of me i can't seem to find the forum token for the life of me lol.
zoxeebee on november amused or refurbished thinkpad x used or refurbished thinkpad t good advise by far the best you can get for that money a used refurbished thinkpad of the x or t series great quality hardware and very good supported by linux tails.
count me in can't wait for client side bitcoin wallets to start building this feature in but for now we should all still learn how the system works anyone is welcome to pm me to test run some transactions.
yes so true but at the same time i think we gain more by the beauty that comes to us through that fog of anonymity than we lose to those lurking in its shadow.
okay dhl seems to be online again.
hey bh any chance you ship international some love to asia tabs are easy to send along with adequate stealth even a domestic pack would be enough to clear international customs but the stamps have to be correc.
sorry for the complete noob question hereas i dont see it having been asked and i'm losing my mind at the thoughtabraxas being down i have alot of btc in it if i know my btc wallet address or whatever for abraxas is there any way to transfer my btcto another site when i sign up there or is it just dead and gone until abraxas if abraxas actually comes back to lif.
with this sort of system the vendor is particularly in danger of being scammed by the customer why would anyone decide to sell on this marketplace.
hi guys im pretty new to this and have spent some time trying to work out tails and im thinking i should get a vpn but then i read this gave me a headacheshould i get a vpn on tails.
what about silk road unless there is something bad about it i'm not to sure.
stealth bomber has been moved to shining star consistent reviews about having top stealth great customer service and some of the best product around reports of him going the extra mile to help customers after the recent fall of sr deserves a boost in our ranks evo.
astraltraveler on june amso i buy it from local with cash or someone else pays non cash for another one he sends it from local to helix and then from helix to market sure thats enough or helix to another helix what if cash its not optional give me some couple of a to c options has plenty of options to pay simply choose which one okpay vanilla reload moneygram etc helix to market wallet should be fine just make sure you do not attach your real name to your localbitcoins account.
mr viking on april pmppgp is also a good portable cross platform solution its in java so it even runs on osx its very basic and simple good solution for buyers one in their right mind should be caught dead using that piece of crap software for starters it generates dangerously insecure keys by default including bit encryption sub keys hobbyists were breaking keys that small years ago on spare equipment they had lying around i wouldn't be caught dead using that piece of junk software.
hey albert welcome to the majestic garden my favorite vendor glad to see you here i think anyone who does business on evo and agora should know you love your products and service though i haven't tried your alex grey blotters yet highly recommended check him out guys.
seems like a pretty bad time to be depositing coin to agora even when they come online for hours and it seems issues have been solved it seems like a big tease everyone who can t wait to get back on and get shit done and hasn t been scared off yet is like hope it stays up oh what s that it s staying up seemingly oh wait nevermind fuck fuck fuck fuck at this point i think it would be ambitious to get too comfortable even if it goes consecutive days with uptime oh and i m not mocking the op i ve fallen into the semi comfort of a little bit of responsive uptime a bit too easily too.
for a simple introduction to tails.
considering that le and the state are nothing more than gangs of armed robbers i don't think you'll find any place in the world that is not plagued by violence theft and mindless coercion there are places in mexico afghanistan africa etc where the official government has little to no control but you'll find there are many other smaller groups there that will try to impose their laws on you and many of these groups will be driven not only by greed but also by political or religious fanaticism and nothing is worse than a gang of armed robbers who believe that they are somehow creating paradise on earth.
watch out for this guy he is not alphabay but rather an imposte.
i put the link to the blog on tor about the problem using ssl on a hidden service is stupid and unnecessary as tor makes it a connection by default the problem is from my understanding that openssl is used to generate the private key or how it hands the private key to the primary relay node but if you were using a server that had openssl pre or generated your key using openssl pre then you were unsafe for the hack to work the server would have had to directly connect to a node that was compromised an attacker the chances of that happening with the little time the bug was out meant that all of our servers were not identified but the locations were changed just to be safe and new url's were generated with proper openssl.
ugh has anyone tried with js enabled i m not condoning this at all if the site is now loading can someone check to see if i m in vacation mode like i m supposed to be if i m not in vacation mode please let me know asap.
hi i have only used pgp key's before at dnm s but now i'm all in for direct deals with trusted vendors when i look around in here i'm a little confused how do i contact a vendor it seems like i have no permission to do so i searc a vendor when i press the vendors profilename it says you are not allowed to access this section why i also have a pgp key but im not sure how i share this as i can see other people are doing in their profile is there a place to upload a public pgp key as i can see others having links for in their profile i'm all new in forum based markets so maybe i have just overseen something thanks for the help best regards.
crypto on february amyou can anonymize recipients by putting throw keyid in your gpg conf unfortunately some pgp clients are crappy and won't test all the private keys in their key chain so they will fail to decrypt anonymized pgp messages kgpg on linux allows you to create bit keys it also has the option to remove the key id without editing the gpg conf file so you can select to remove it only for certain messages seahorse allows you to edit the key email and such so you can make a bit key without an email like i di.
as someone who doesn't speak read spanish i'm looking for some advice and or how to's on getting something tested via energy control what's the process where on their site do i go and what do i say send to whom anyone who's been through the process or is familiar with it is welcome to pm me or reply here thanks in advance trying to get and post some data for the benefit of all.
are you working for agora defending them dude why the hell should i lie about swedish sek on my bitcoint wallet on agora that was stolen i read on other forums like reddit that it happened another guy to they stole hes money and they answered him on support that he had some keylogger virus that got into hes wallet thats bullshit my computer is secure as possible im working with it and computer in my eyes they are scammers and i wont deposit there anything mor.
yeah i got tails up and running only thing that sucks is that there are a ton of sites you can't use due to javascript etc it would be nice to run tor then a vpn or proxies seems like cloudflare blocks tor as well.
great work dh from our end our first thought is that s alot of extra work per order for example we have been doing direct orders since sr went down and have never left a customer out of pocket the only way it would be viable for us to implement some type of system such as the above would be to drastically reduce our customer base ie increase min order to mg or g we can see a benefit to the wider community of a system such as this but the time needed to implement this we imagine will be prohibitive imagine doing this for orders a day even even would soak up alot of time just some thoughts we would be very happy for someone to tell us we re wrong we had a late night so clarity may be lacking.
is there any market place online right now i've tried a few and had no luck with any of them what's going on i'd be glad for some input cheers freddi.
hahahahaahahha i saw a picture of him good luck in jail or not getting hurt from anyone maybe this will be a lesson to the others however i do wonder if he has information saved from sheep in order to get a lesser sentence here's some info on the arrest notes about the translation the article is a bit confused mixing narratives together mixing official sheep market narrative meaning someone external stole it with tom s official narrative i had nothing to do with it it was on my server by acciddent and with police story he has the money we proved it it also doesn t really mention it was darknet marketplace with drugs it only mentions that it was an online marketplace and it says that tom was the hacker that stole the money but again it s a confused article in general so at times it doesn t make that much sense i think that s because the reporter didn t really follow the case that well and mixed stuff together anyway let s do this how the bitcoins were laundered millions from abroad a house written on granddad note this idiom written on somebody means in czech officially owned by officially done by as in officially granddad owned it police officers blocked house costing million czech crowns bought by czech programmer for suspicious bitcoins note all amounts are in czech crowns million is eur usd million is eur usd czech from hodonin city in czech rep area is being investigated for stealing money from online market from which million czech crowns disappeared czech criminals are increasingly using the virtual currency for saving their gains say ministry of finance dirty money house villa in lu ice a small town is according to police a proceed of crime it was supposedly used for laundering dirty money that s why police seized it last year in january a new bank account of years old eva barto ov had a payment that made air bank czech bank safety controls flash an idiom almost thousand crowns from a foreign company that exchanges virtual bitcoins into real money the young woman could not credibly explain to the bank officers the source of the money only additional investigation revealed that millions already went using this road and that behind it was a certain tom ji ikovsk that was connected by amateur internet investigators with stealing money from web marketplace sheep marketplace where people traded in large numbers with the bitcoin currecy the damage was described by the operators of the marketplace as more than million my note to the above as i said the article is confused according to hn short for the news name hospod sk noviny police officers seized his house near hodon n that he bought for bitcoins and that he wrote on his granddad the case is in a phase where we cannot comment told petra vedrov a police spokesman for south moravian district profesor signed grandson paidthe story can however be reconstructed from documents saved on cadaster note i don t know how is it in other countries in czech we have a cadaster with information about real estate ownership and it s perhaps suprisingly public and open according to the decree about seizing the house with a pool and garden in the town of lu ice the police officers wrote that the programmer ji ikovsk and his wife eva barto ov note the girl from earlier from laundering dirty money the million that was used to buy the house can be from the funds stolen from sheep marketplace your money our provisions all were stolen wrote the operators of the marketplace on their web not long before they had to close it two years ago they thought that someone found an error in the system and took bitcoins according to the exchange rate at the time around millions my note again they are confused and keep on writing that sheep was some legit online marketplace and tom is the hacker that stole money from it the officers of ministry of finance s financial analytical office that are detecting suspicious transactions mapped how the ji ikovsk s money travelled they first left from the abroad company bitstamp limited that is selling and buying bitcoins the millions then arrived with several transactions either on the account of ji ikovsk and barto ov or on the account of the real estate company and the lawyer that worked on the house sale part of the money went to the original owner of the house another part of the money went on her bank as one time payment of a mortgage the house is however in the cadaster written on jan goli a granddad of ji ikovsk that added no money to the transaction that it was just an effort to conceal the real owner is demonstrated by the police by the fact that ji ikovsk was the one that insured the house the real estate properties were fully paid by the finances acquired by the transactions of the virtual currency bitcoin say the detectives ji ikovsk according to bank data took thousand czech crowns in cash from bank again from bitcoin the mobile number that was used by ji ikovsk before is owned by somebody else hn tried to contact his wife through facebook but without a reply and his granddad goli was not available in his office on mendelev university on this university the yeat old professor works as a renowned expert on fruit production note the next two paragraphs are very confusingly ji ikovsk never talked publicly at the time of the sheep marketplace affair he made an announcement that he only allowed the so called webhosting meaning that for money he allowed place and service for other internet pages even a website that a fans of sheep marketplace made but he had nothing to do with the market when ji ikovsk found in the fall that the web is illegal he turned it off he did not expand on why it would be illegal but it could have something with drug selling that people today sometimes buy with bitcoins key question the money originbecause of the police silence we cannot tell how deep are the police officers in the case if they only investigate money laundering or if they want ji ikovsk for his role in stealing money from the marketplace they should because so called legalization of procceeds of crime can only be proven if the police officers clearly name the exact crime where the dirty money comes from in the past the detectives thought that they are on a trace of billion laundering in prague exchange they stopped the investigation of the owners they couldn t prove that the money were dirty not sure if they are talking about btc exchange probably not the money is too big for that and this paragraph is kinda irrelevant the worldwide trend of dirty money ending in bitcoin more and more is confirmed by the ministry of finance specialists we detected a growth of suspicious trades where the gains from criminal activity end up in virtual currency warned last year annual report of financial analytical office end full details about the sheep marketplace scam can be found here among some other details this was the owner of sheep that turned out to be the real person behind the market in dec during a media interview thomas denied being the person responsible for the sheep marketplace scam thomas was never arrested until know even though that his name details were well known and reported to the czech police soon after the scam.
as far as other peoples keys many of them have the old forum address listed just change everything before the onion to what's in your address bar.
hi quick question just made a new pgp in the new tails and don t know where to get my public key it used to be easier.
isnt there a country where people can host a hidden server without any concerns about usa or europe making a demand to force the host to give away the servers files mutual legal assistance treaty i mean there are almost countries all around the world isnt anyone safe maybe north korea any country in middle east any i hate usa and europe and will never comply to their requirements country ive been thinking about that there is a tiny chance hidden servers have their real ip discovered as happened with silk road so why not to put the servers based in a country that s gonna say fuck you rest of the world this is my country people here do whatever they want in internet or at least they say fuck you rest of the world we only deal with internet crimes that affects our country directly and none of those vendors or site admins live here or fuck you rest of the world we wont comply any bullshit from usa or europe at all where the heck is a safe place to host a hidden server im just curious and asking myself that if there is a country like that this were another mistake from the silk road s admin.
lighty on may pmanyway you have to act as if they were stored forever as who knows what the admin of the server might do and or if it runs on a virtual machine that the fbi is really interested in always assume the worst case scenario so that you stay safe stay safethere were a number of people on silk road who used to dispense advice like this unfortunately dpr was not in a mood to listen so he didn't make the use of pgp mandatory as a result when the server and the backup server got seized they had the entire dataset going right back to the beginning it has been long assumed that the feds have been scouring the server for data and we now have confirmation of this as the following story illustrates quoteus law enforcement's infiltration and takedown of the silk road underground marketplace has turned up yet another court case with a new orleans man charged with selling counterfeit shopping coupons through the site and its successors on an epic scale year old beau wattigney has been indicted in the eastern district of louisiana on one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and one of conspiracy to commit trademark counterfeiting prosecutors claim wattigney is behind a long running series of coupon scams going by online nicknames including purplelotus goldenlotus moxdiamond and nickmode over a period of at least months from may to november wattigney is alleged to have sold thousands of counterfeit coupons targeting at least different companies according to the indictment in just one year over distinct sales raked in more than it's not yet clear exactly how wattigney was tracked down and identified but much of the information listed in the indictment document refers to messages and forum postings made via the silk road making it pretty certain that the embedding of undercover agents in the silk road community and the later takeover of the silk road servers played a major part in the investigation source spitfir.
thereon thereupon it doesn't matter beacuse those words have no meaning i didn't imply it meant like i wrote it is the equivalent of the use of the word like like you know if you were trying to make a clear arguement you failed which was my arguement in the beginning and is now.
valsetriste on december pmso last night i sent btc to a vendor using the address he pmed me earlier the vendor says he hasn't received payment now when i check it it's been changed back to the original when i compare my old transactions the one that i'm seeing now is the correct one what the hell is going on and am i shit out of luck you can't change content of sent private messages right am i infected with some sort of btc address faker if that's the case fuck you u zfc ymshnfw teaqtxrrcbku hayl whoever you are jesus i'm so fucking angry worst part is it wasn't even my money i was supposed to get worth of acid for christmas to a friend sorry for the coarse language vthey friend i understand your anger try not to get to upset though i've read some posts on forum where coin was sent to the wrong address btc and the vendor still upheld the order explain the situation to the vendor first contact the mods go from there i hope everything works out friend.
just saw this god damnit can t say im not surprised.
to create a persistent volume you must boot from cd dvd or usb after that even if you booted from a usb drive you have to create a new usb drive by using the tails installer and install by cloning this new usb drive will allow you to configure a persistent volume.

nice addition to the garden and those are all great psychedelics.
this will be my last post in this thread and i am opting out of the sample or any future purchases bombheadie has been communicative with me before and after his computer issues but the entire experience was a little nerve racking as to why a domestic package would take days anyways bh has taken responsibility that he believes he did not send my package and has offered to make it up to me which is a very kind gesture all that being said i'm just going to move on myself and encourage the community to make their own decisions there can be new vendor blues and would expect some to give him a second chance and there will be others who say they don't want to risk anything ever the call is yours thanks to everyone else who has been posting publicly on this topic as it helped raise an issue to the community and glad the problems appears to be packs not ever being sent rather then interceptions or cds i do appreciate you bomeheadie taking responsibility for the not sent packs and surely expect you have learned some valuable lessons from all of this good luck to you in your future endeavors.
i have used pay shield a few times now with no problems its super easy to use i like it so far.

it's great to see new people learn and discover the wonders of the darknet one quick note though you shouldn't be torrenting anything through tor not only is it bad opsec but it slows the whole network down see for more in response to your original question yes using a tails usb should be fine from home.
hi guys my apologizes to every single person on this fourm weeks ago my grandmother passed away and this this friday we were at a concert and got to a hotel room after the show no one knew anything he was doing the whole time he had mg of xanax in his system and mg of opitates in his system hos bc was he did it all insntantly after the show is what he told me he died in my lap before the paramedics arrived this is not how i wanted this to be i wanted to be a good sorry great vendor on here but with everything going on i just cant continue doing this right now i think you would would understand if your best friends died in your lap if anyone paid for anything they did not receive please message me before all this happened i ended up getting a printer and was going to make everything perfect i just want to apoloigize to the tmg community for my screw up it's just very hard to when you have people very close to you pass away in a week especially your best friend in your lap all because of a female i know i going to have ptsd from this event when i come back the only thing that i am going to be selling is ald that's if you guys still trust me enough i apologize from the bottom of my heart i was not trying to get one over on anyone i promise you that again i apologize to you guyslove and lightbhp s i would appreciate any good vibes sent my way thanks for that.
he s still active on agora unfortunately agora itself is not so active i ve only tried gg s g once so far but i d imagine that x would match my previous experience with g easil.
alberthoffman on march pmare you working for agora defending them dude why the hell should i lie about swedish sek on my bitcoint wallet on agora that was stolen i read on other forums like reddit that it happened another guy to they stole hes money and they answered him on support that he had some keylogger virus that got into hes wallet thats bullshit my computer is secure as possible im working with it and computer in my eyes they are scammers and i wont deposit there anything morei'm a vendor trying to help you figure it out i logged in yesterday and withdraw a fairly large amount and it went into my wallet within minutes scidm.
bum.
thank you i know about that part but everytime i put it in it says it's connected but yet it still won't work i'm thinking i might have to just start all over i looked online some more and apparently a lot of people are having the same issue sadly though i still have not been able to find a solution.
nah you'll be safe make sure you are using the latest version of tails tor bundle and remember to always use pgp for communicating with others ditch reddit if youre using that use tor again.
unit on may pmu i couldn't agree more i've already swore to myself i'm sticking to micro transactions from now on i'd rather have btc on the line than what i had put myself into and exactly i've never felt comfortable with sharing that i even use the market with anybody but close close close friends when they would like help with using it or want me to over see a transaction for them i let them know i risk my money when i use these marketplaces so when you want to use them you're risking your money too basically saying i'll do my best to make sure they get a clean transaction but if it goes to hell in a hand basket which i've seen happen very easily it's not up to me to fix or compensate anything for them unit i also use markets for mostly btc deals its less of a worry and below a certain amount is imo much less dangerous than a larger amount some may say that it requires more orders to get the same amount but i'd rather get caught with a oz decriminalized amounts in some places of bud than a whole zip or qp not that it matters if the feds get you but if you get pulled over with it then unless you live in the deep south just a ticket the same is true for rl i used to have this strategy when buying weed i'd go to my dealer and if i was getting a half or a zip i would never tell them first i'd check it out and if the weed was sub par i'd just get a dub or a slice there are exceptions like if i wanted some primo bud from a vendor like cultmadeline who only sells oz's but their bud is fire and they are trusted even then i'd rather direct deal one thing about direct deals though i would place a very basic order one item and maybe a small cheap second but you don't need to make it confusing or overly complicated final note there are some things that make sense to buy in bulk the one thing i don't is with mdma i don't have many friends who do it although getting rid of it is easy the reason i don't is that i know that for myself i will do higher doses and more often if i bought a whole g if i had friends who would buy it i could sell it very fast for a nice profit most of my friends don't even know if the 'molly' they got of some uni student was real mdma and are averse to pills never had good ones or think they are cut thanks to pop culture its crazy smart people too that is what is so liberating about dnms you don't have to take what everyone else in your area or circle of friends does it cuts through ignorance like a machete love and light acid.
hacks crack is vj is dnmthief he is currently working with le and at the same time extorting markets this is why he is given access to cashing out his coin have none of you looked at how the timings of the hacks coincide with when the power is on in the thai islands.

sorry to here this i feel bad for anyone that lost money in black bank it's starting to seem like markets aren't even worth it and that we should start just sticking with direct sells or use tmg mostly or at least till they figure out a decentralized market.
if someone could send me an invite i'd love them.
nucleus seems to be where all my domestic sellers ar.
personally i'll be using abraxas i've used it in the past as a backup and they've been extremely reliable not the most active but it's worth considering due to the fact it will be picking up activity wise when people go looking for alternatives what i have most vendors switch to so far is abraxas and or middle earth.
really excited about this sample will update when received.
a customer just told me that despite me losing access my listings are still up and you can still order from me i can only assume this means ab is going to try to accept orders on my behalf take their money and fuck my rep do not order from me symetry on ab i do not have access to my account.
i find this needs it's own thread so one of dhl's main selling points is automatic withdrawals my automatic escrow withdrawals take up to hours to process we're not talking blockchain stuff and my automatic direct deposits just disappear my last direct automatic withdrawal eventually showed up after i complained but one i did over hours ago is still mia and direct withdrawals have absolutely no record whatsoever on dh l at least with the escrow automatic withdrawals you can see that it is processing so even if it takes hours you can at least see it is still there but withdrawals on direct deals just vanish there is no record whatsoever so unless you are constantly watching your wallet like i do it could be very very easy to forget about this ghost withdrawal and never know that it didn't hit or just confuse it with another withdrawal and think you actually got paid when you didn't bottom line vendors on dhl you need to pay very close attention to your withdrawals on your direct deals to make sure you get paid i suggest to dhl you make changes personally i much prefer to make my own withdrawals withdrawals on ab to my wallet min withdraws on draem market to my wallet seconds withdrawals on dhl to hours on escrow and ghosted withdrawals on direct deals not good.
i am offering some promotional listings on alphabay and would like to offer them to the members of this community as well the two alphabay auctions below will be shipped on monday the th it's the same top shelf herb that consistently sells out on agora at an ounce but i don't usually sell eighths on agora biding starts at shipping the only thing i ask is please leave me some feedback either here or on that market or both have a few more promo auctions listed there as well that ship at later dates thanks.

centralized marketplaces are dead at this point in the evolution of deepweb marketplaces is the only logical next step many kudos to sites such as this that are beginning to move in this direction i applaud you there is no better example proving why multisig is so important than the recent events at silk road our community would be million or whatever the new number people are tossing about is richer if we would've adopted this technology earlier one of the most important elements of a decentralized market is a way to make safe simple trustless transactions enter multisig previously this technology was rather difficult for your average user to wrap their head around requiring using command line to create and handle these transactions fortunately for us the demand is there and simplified web uis are now popping up to make this process significantly easier so what is multisig long story short it's a way to eliminate having one centralized wallet holding all the coins while still maintaining the benefits of a third party arbitrating the huge advantage in comparison to the escrow we're all used to is that the arbitrator cannot single handedly decide the fate of the coins making situations like what happened w not only the hackers but also shutdown by le impossible multiple parties hold the keys to the transaction and without coming to agreement the coins can't be moved read seized stolen here's a simplified example of how a of transaction which would be the most suitable for our purposes would work on a site like bitrated this would differ slightly on other sites but the basic premise remains the same seller creates transaction and sends the link to buyer w the stipulations of what is to occur should there be a dispute buyer accepts transaction and then both parties are presented w the multisignature transaction page buyer deposits bitcoins to the address generated where the coins are held until two of the three involved buyer seller and arbitrator sign w their private key basically the arbitrator is just a tie breaker should the buyer seller not be able to come to an agreement on who gets the money at this point you can also deifne what portion goes to what addresses if it's an agreement that isn't refund or if the arbitrator has fees for disputes feature only available on bitrated if buyer is satisfied they sign the transaction their sig alongside the seller's releases the funds to the seller if buyer is unsatisfied a dispute is made and sent to the arbitrator who makes the final decision based on evidence provided and the agreed upon terms linked to the transaction so where do i start there are currently two websites i've found which offer a simplified service which doesn't require using console command line unfortunately neither of them are ideal for our purposes yet but undoubtedly in the very near future there will be more advances in the technology namely multisig being built into the gui of popular wallet services i'll compare contrast the two below and if you know of others please let me know bitrated the most full featured multisig site w clear easy to follow instructions and fairly comprehensive documentation there is a clear text field for seller to list the terms before sending to buyer arbitrator is not needed in any way should transaction not go into dispute buyer seller are given a url containing their public key which is all that needs to be held onto to complete the transaction supports client side key generation arbitrators have a username which they can easily link buyers sellers to and either can begin the transaction in the future this username will have trust ratings similar to lbtc both buyer and seller must be online simultaneously to initiate the transaction this is by far the biggest issue and if it weren't for this there would be no reason to use the other services using this w o an arbitrator who has set up an account using a client side public key instead of a private key generated on the website is a big security issue when conducting the transaction over tor lacks end to end encryption during the initiation step when data must be sent between users see bug report supports client side key generation allows types of multisig other than of can't see many situations this would be helpful for us in though buyer seller do not need to be online simultaneously any of the parties involved can create the transaction barebones ui no need for arbitrator or users to start an account not very user friendly and very little support documentation no support for sending percentages of transactions without creating multiple receiving addresses and complicating the matter in the process what i propose is a multisig club of similar fashion to pine's legendary pgp club on sr due to the numerous options available and need for coordination we will have to work out a separate system for doing test transactions on each site i'm currently going over the possible methods for organizing this for the time being i'm just looking to see who would be interested in tossing a few bitcents back and fourth as well as get some discussion going about the current future options for multisig i would prefer to arbitrate transactions myself but can also act as the buyer or seller simultanously to get a better feel for how both sides of these systems work welcome to the club.
that exe didn t do anything i ran it over and over again and couldn t get my windows machine to run it it just went to a black screen for a few minutes and that was it is it odd that my cc and btc wallet are completely drained in the real though i am not a fan of ab i have said for a bit that i think they are a scam.

javascript and removing personal metadata from fileswelcome back before i get into removing harmful meta data from your files i want to talk about another vulnerability to our browsing capabilities called javascript in mid a person in ireland was providing hosting to people that hosted hidden services including a secure email platform called tor mail unfortunately they busted him on an unrelated charge relating to child pornography and seized all his servers whether or not he was related to child porn or not is unknown to me or it could be a silly charge the feds slapped him with but either way the feds ended up injecting malicious javascript into his servers so that when users would visit certain sites this malicious code would execute on their computers and reveal information about their computers to the feds i suggest you read the following article to learn more about this with that being said you may want to disable javascript in your browsers especially when visiting certain websites like silk road that may become compromised one day many users refuse to visit the original silk road website and forums with javascript enabled because the feds likely injected it with malicious javascript to identify users in tails the browser is called iceweasel and when tor in ran in windows it uses firefox both browsers can disable javascript using the exact same method open up a window and type the following command in the address bar about config and click the button that says i'll be careful i promise this will bring up a bunch of settings including a search bar at the top enter javascript in the search bar and look for the following two entries javascript enabled and browser urlbar filter javascript right click on these and click toggle and you will see the value changed to false if you want to enable javascript again just click toggle again and you will see the value change back to true again remember that every time you restart tails you will have to do this again so get into a habit of doing this every time you never know when your favorite website could become compromised moving onto meta data there is a bit of a famous story about an online hacker named w rmer that would take pictures of his girlfriend and post them online after he would deface a webpage what he either forgot or didn't know was that photos taken with the iphone and other smart phones save the gps coordinates of where the picture was taken and store it in the meta data of the picture check out this article below you need to remove this meta data otherwise you could end up in federal prison with w rmer luckily tails has a solution for this see why i love tails applications accessories metadata anonymisation toolkit please get a more clear idea of how this works by reading the following page please note the currently supported formats in terms of pictures jpg jpeg and png but unfortunately mat is not perfect and i wouldn't solely rely on it so a better idea would be to never upload pictures of yourself or your significant other online especially bragging about a hack you committed please read the site provided above for more information.
i tried it out when it was first created the taint analysis left much to be desired over traditional tumblers i use helix light from the grams website and have never had any issue.
attempt by whom it looks like some search replace has been played here what was the original word that has been replaced i don't quite remember is it just me who thinks that's strange.
dont fool yourselves into thinking that by using tails and washing bitcoins and masking online status and using different passwords that you wont get caught i have had personal experience where a vendor sent me xanax pills in the mail without any stealth just threw a bunch of pills in an envelope and sent them and since then all my mail was being checked without my knowledge except first class mail i believe either way when my order for tabs of lsd was ordered thats when the authorities arrested me and guess what they have everything that was done click by click order by order all my passwords all my orders and history of things i bought i went to jail for this and was let out early for good behavior but as someone once told me dont do the crime if you cant do the time pink floyd shee.
have you read posts on it they're soo different with the hub.
get a machine which allows you to replace the bios with free software the new firmware may require disassembly and wiring up the flash chip directly the reward for the trouble is a laptop that runs free and open source software only.
alberthoffman on march pmare you working for agora defending them dude why the hell should i lie about swedish sek on my bitcoint wallet on agora that was stolen i read on other forums like reddit that it happened another guy to they stole hes money and they answered him on support that he had some keylogger virus that got into hes wallet thats bullshit my computer is secure as possible im working with it and computer in my eyes they are scammers and i wont deposit there anything morehow long ago did you send a message to support there and what did they say.
root on may ami think the only marketplace that i can say i have no love for is alphabay i don't like a site devoted to theft of ones identity i have had multiple family members put into an endless cycle and a hole of debt trying to recover from identity theft other friend with ruined credit that made it hard to find a job and imposable to get a good rate on home purchase because they were taken advantage of in the same manor while i don't like the identity theft part either alphabay is actually the best darknet market currently for drugs they a large amount of listings and the site is almost always up with top notch ddos protection.
doses lysergic on january amquote from dxuutx on december pmif anything this is more proof that hos or whoever is a major target of law enforcement and that we really shouldn't be talking about this business on the clearnet anywhere than any notion that the whole sub is just a honeypot i think the arrogant sense that people on the sub have that their crimes aren't worthy of targeting from law enforcement these are people who live to make drug arrests i also think it's a bit alarmist to assert that it exists only for this purpose and that no worthwhile discussion takes place thereon and it's not insignificant seemingly to me that hos didn't have any overt problems with reddit when the reviews were adulatory and the attitude changed when they started to turn critical lol speak english its not insignificant it is not not significant when you use a double negative you obscure your meaning thereon this word has been used not since again not one knows what the fuck not insignificant' again that 'hos didn't' have a problem when the reviews were positive adulatory if you yern to be not unlike leo tolstoy well then i'll just not continue writing now thanks professor dl some of my friends try to say as many double negatives in one sentence i aint got no nothing or anything to say sometimes but i try anywho my post has nothing to do with hos and they are not the messenger the bottom line is no one should be posting anything about dnm on reddit period.
it is legit but for how long is difficult to say i think people here on tmg can help you out with cannabis if you're looking for bulk go wallet wallet with some trusted vendor.
also looking for one as well.
hi so i'm about the tumble some bitcoins again and want to ask a few questions to ensure my method is still safe i have been sending coins from my coinbase account to an address on my blockchain wallet from which i use shared coin to either send it to my personal wallet on my virtual machine or to another tumbler though lately my laziness and uncertainty about tumbling services has removed this step now my questions are is this an effective technique should i be creating new blockchain wallets regularly to add anonymity or are new addresses good enough and if i should use another tumbler what service do you guys suggest thanks so much for the help elli.
a new install with full disk encryption ubuntu can work for this then fill the drive with trash or start a live cd linux distro and wipe your hard drive using the wipe command or shredthen reinstall a fresh clean windows system or a fresh linux one with full disk encryption probably safer another option would be to physically destroy the hard drive and use your computer only with tails you'd have to trust those who made tails but even if tails was trying to write stuff on your hdd you'd be safe from that.
let's hope no.
definitely interested in some ald.
another update ok i have decided to do this also i will be passing out samples of g this is good for two people samples of the mdma that i have also this is very strong mdma i saw recently on the advengers website that the quailty of this mdma is if you would like to see this report i will gladly give the link to the website but same rules apply as it did with the ald us us onlytrip report must be posted and i would like the members to have posts or be in good standings with other boards or websites thank you guys much love tmg bhi've just been in a very good mood lately this is why i am doing this.
love is all around us on february pmis there a particular reason your ald blotter is nearly double the price of blotter and nearly x the price of lowest tier bulk at si i get you've got expenses time put into laying your own gear but geez si just recently lowered their prices for ald i did not buy alot of it so my prices were pretty high buying it when i decided to do so remember these are euro prices and not usd alot of people don't have access to si also most people don't like ordering illegal chemicals over seas it has to do with the risk also plus the the multiple hours i have spend learning how to keep it as ald and have it not hydrolyze into lsd plus the prices are not that much higher than than what they charge most of it will be sold around town as it is but me offering it on here was just something that was spur of the moment in case people would like to try ald since there are very few people around that are offering it at this time.
maybe for smaller newer vendors this would be a great way to make orders but for big vendors i really don't see it happening too time consumin.

i think what happens is the btc is hedged so if the coin goes up or down you still get the dollar amount so the exact order amount may not appear in your wallet from each order becuase of this making it appear as if you didn't recieve transactions even direct deals can take hours or more and coin can shift also doesn't help if you have deposits from other places going into the same wallet everything adds up in my wallet so i'm not concerned but i will be keeping a closer eye on it i doubt there's anyting fishy going on there's alot of vendors on there and some big ones alot of people would be complain.
i am new around here but i have to say that after watching so many markets rise fall it would appear that wallet wallet will put us buyers at the vendor's remorse at least until a decentralized option is available cheers to my trust in you guys.
oksoi m new to this very new currently i m only using tor but am getting vb and tails rn i use pgp as much as a i can and i have a disk to be used for pgp and such once i ve got vb now i ve read jolly s thread on security but i m a bit worried still i feel like there s more to use other than tor and vb and tails see i m wanting to order some lsd not much of it but i ve heard this guy is very stealthy even so i fear cops coming to my door with the letter package i ve never given out personal info on tor actually used my email on igolder or something for pgp a long time ago haha stupid i know i threw that out hard and got a new email but other than that i ve made many different usernames passwords and nicknames for myself i worry that somehow they re going to just know what s in the letter package i dunno it s kind of stupid but ahaha i just would like to be safe i don t plan on ordering lots at a time and i don t know if i ll even ever order again sorry for being such a big noo.
on january pmi just got locked out its unbelieveable i had the link on the bookmarks for months now if someone tells me i was using a phishing link they can fuck off to russia looking for a new market to buy warezthat fucking sucks i hope you didn't lose too much and re symetry that shit is brutal what they did to you fucking crooks indeed it's very short sighted because they'd make more money in the long run if they just ran a successful and secure market for years.
as long as you encrypt everything any of those providers could work you never know when one of them will go offline you never know if it's not monotired or run by le you never know if their setup is really secure.
hi guys i feel really stupid asking this but what is a working link to join the we love avengers marketplace i've been trying lots of invite links on here but they don't look like a normal onion url thanks.

alphabaymarket on november pmnot saying abraxas is over but we are confident you will find alphabay to fit your needs try it out here registration to alphabay quotei would rather use nucleus or any site besides alphabay besides the excessive and shameless self promotion over the last week i have tried alphabay once in the past the site was beyond basic horrible interface layout not a site i would trust or ever enjoy using just being honest.
i just use tails' persistance for anything i need buried in the crypt works pretty good for me for secret text info but might be too small if you're trying to hide lots of big media files or something.

that's why a setup that leaves as little forensic evidence as possible is needed tails on a dvd is an option to consider you keep your computer clean add your private key to en encrypted usb partition that you can wipe easily in case you feel like it without having to wipe your hdd good luck and consider that a truster vendor could get caught and keep vending being le this did happen with fake ids this could and probably did also happen with drugs you don't seem like an high profile target though have a clean house and sleep well.
that's interesting as we don't know much on what's really going on against the tor network or at least how strong is really is against western governments if you want really be safe assume that everything you say is under direct surveillance and use gpg whenever you can.
ironically i just posted in the mdma section i was looking for a vendor of mdma for personal amounts g and i'd love to sample yours before buying please pm me details my key is on my signature you can check my recent commitments to samples with zicot and sirlucy and see i always make good on a full deep trip report in a timely manner thank you.

works fine for one to one transactions there is no confirmation delay for transactions involving many addresses like consolidation transactions you may need to pay or even the blond wig qt client conveniently informs you of this.
flipkart on january amits the vendors who struggle often having hundreds of coins in escrow in my view this is the vendor's fault risk should always be constantly evaluated and adjusted everyone knows there is always a risk of losing coins kept on the market so one should never keep coins that can't be lost when i hit in my escrow i hold back and pause orders until orders get cleared there is an easy way to clear your escrow though ship orders very quickly as they come in then the money is constantly coming off not having to wait usually more than or days per order.
on monday bh said my pack would be sent out the following morning it should land sometime in the next few days i'll update if it does.
love is all around us on march pmpostage due handwritten etc makes you think a high school kid w o a scale or a clue is slinging this gear am i required to pay the postage that is due.
i'm sure you are correct most of the mods are carders and thieves who don't need a second invitation to steal someone's coins.
i like middle earth the user interface is very friendly and intuitive the design is delicate with pleasant colors it seems that someone really made an effort making this website comfortable for vendors and buyers i think that should be appreciated.
the darknet is still in good shape on our end it's not like le is busting people left and right and tor and pgp have been compromised the only problems have been issues of trust and scamming technically and on paper the darknet is fine like anything you just need to surround yourself with the right people the darknet is huge there could be another place like tmg where there are or so members and only they know the url the possiblities are endless on the deepweb.
are you sure you didnt get phished create a new account buyers account and message admin on the forums he has helped me out with some missing deposits in the past after i went rampaging the forum.
hellowhat so you have your money in your wallet me and my friends wallets are competly empy i can clearly se how some one transfered my bitcoints from agora to another wallet on blockchain.

but i wanna order now.
thanks i'm back on.
are the withdrawals working for everyone now i had a small change back on the site but i've nicely forgotten about it since it went down would be nice if they returned it back with an interes.
i have heard best buy now offers a phone encrypter right in the store encrypts calls text email photos ec.
the only thing i can think of is js being needed for some of those sites tor used to have noscrypt on by default and for some reason changed it a while back i turn it off everytime i start the browser a lot of clearnet links don't work right with js turned off and turning it on can hurt your anonimity.
jackspay on february pmi am having the same problem with safe mail net and thunderbird i am using thunderbird and gpg win and can't seem to get it to work i need to find a safe email address that is anomymous any help appericated thanks i ditched the safe mail for pgp purposes instead created a gmail account while on tor i use it only for this purpose and only for a week or two actually i only use it to send pgp keys to myself into that same address as this seems to be the only way i can atm add public keys to my keychain i'm sure others will give a better answer i now have made my first purchase and no emails needed only pm's.
tracking cookiesnext time i want to talk about is something that most people completely forget about tracking cookies a recent article explains how the nsa uses things like google ads and other tracking cookies to identify users over tor when doing so by other means is not possible for those of you who do not know what i am talking about let me ask you this have you ever noticed that certain ads seem to follow you around from website to website perhaps something you searched for on google or yahoo is now showing up in ads on other pages this was originally designed to market things to you based on your preferences by installing tracking cookies into your browser luckily tor clears its cookies every time you restart the browser and yes tails does too but that does not mean you are not vulernable within the same tor session what i mean by this is let us say you went and did some freedom fighting on a forum somewhere and then after using the same tor session visited another website with google ads on it then you went to another site with more google ads on it you would be surprised how many sites now have google ads on them by the way google can use these tracking cookies to learn about your browsing behavior your search terms your preferred sites and so forth some people are even stupid enough to use the same tor ip address and go check their facebook news feed or their email guess who is in bed with the feds google yahoo facebook msn and all of their email providers as well remember when you start leaving patterns behind they will start looking for similarities that start with just a suspicion perhaps they correlated the freedom fighting forum posts with you because you logged into your email and now they start noticing that you always misspell the same words make the same grammar mistakes the same slang terms perhaps you visited a website belonging to somebody local to you with google ads on it it is not entirely sure how they are able to use these tracking cookies to identify you but the point is they keep everything and if you happen to do something stupid like google a local restaurant or what movies are playing in your local area on the same ip address that you did something you should not have earlier on then google can put and together once they are on your trail you are screwed so do not give them anything to correlate to you ever so then you might ask can not i just disable cookies all together yes you could but cookies are required for things like login sessions without cookies you are unable to maintain a state of being logged in on certain websites because they use that cookie id to identify the session on the server again you can certainly disable cookies but you will not be able to maintain a login anywhere.

learning from others' mistakes libertas dpr sabu lulzseca little change of pace for this next post i want to talk about one of our fallen moderators libertas it has finally been confirmed what we all were hoping for that libertas one of the arrested moderators was released on bail recently according to an article silk road moderator gary davis aka libertas is officially free on bail and awaiting an extradition hearing on february the fbi flew to ireland that night for the express purpose of taking davis into custody and interrogating him in ireland with regard to his position and functions being a moderator on a website allowing transactions to facilitate the sale of drugs online so as you can see just because libertas was a moderator on the site he is being charged with allowing transactions to faciliate sales of drugs he is basically being charged as a drug dealer quotehowever davis was found in possession of illicit substances which could result in a minimum sentence he unfortunately was found with drugs on him at the time of his arrest which made things much easier to keep him in custody and it turns out that the alleged former owner of silk road ross ulbricht is fully complying with law enforcement to attempt to identify senior vendors on silk road according to the article ross communicated with the vendors frequently and likely in plain text is my guess the reason i bring this up is that we need to remind every user on here of the mistakes that were made by ross and the other three moderators so that we can hopefully learn from them we need to avoid these types of mistakes never ever ever give anybody any personal information about yourself online the story goes that ross required moderators to give him copies of their ids in order to become moderators of silk road and he likely kept a record of these on his computer unfortunately these are now in the hands of the fbi and moderators have been arrested as a result since and now according to the article they are after senior vendors as well a few take homes are always use pgp encryption in all your communications which unfortunately in this case would not have mattered because ross ended up giving up his private keys to the feds but it is still another hurdle in their way to protect you from them taking away your freedom never give out any personal information to anybody online about yourself never put your trust in somebody else's hands because at the end of the day nobody is going to go to jail for you ross found an opportunity to possibly reduce his sentence and he is fully taking advantage of the opportunity this exact same scenario happened with sabu from lulzsec was threatened with years in prison he quickly turned on all his friends and worked with the feds to get them all locked up to help reduce his sentence sabu has kids and obviously decided he would rather snitch out his friends and have a chance at being a father rather than spend the rest of his life locked up in jail again nobody is going to go to jail for you.
hi everybody i'm absolutely not new to the dnms but i'm completely new to the direct sale trade i guess i'm going to use electrum embedded in tails to proceed to the payments but i'm a little bit scared about the errors i could do i boot tails with usb flash but i didn't configure persistent volume and i'm not really fond of that option i clearly prefer to opt for a small sd card as my storage device so st question is it ok to use electrum even if i don't enable persistence at the launch of electrum tails advises me it is strongly recommended to only run electrum when its persistence feature is activated following step tails tells me electrum could not find an existing wallet what do you want to do create new wallet restore an existing wallet from its seed create a watching only version of an existing walletwhy it doesn't ask me to look for my wallet on another device was my idea to store it on a sd card a stupid idea is my only choice to restore my wallet from its seed when i have created my wallet i now want to send funds to my wallet the btc addresses i should use are the ones under receive tab main account receiving addresses got addresses there am i right concerning the saving of my wallet i just have to go under file then save copy save it on my device and keep a written copy of my wallet seed is it enough or should i also export my private keys to my storage device when my btc vendor has proceeded to the sending of the funds in my wallet and when i saved my wallet i can close it and shutdown tails before they show up in my wallet is that correct how much fee should i give to the btc network to proceed to my transactions for example what you guys are you giving many thanks for your answers cheer.
if someone is interested in an answer concerning that subject i had one on the hub forum here is the link to the topic.
as many probably already ready a major tor security advisory came out earlier today likely related to the recent aborted black hat tor talk a new tor version is being released to plug the known hole but hidden service hosts especially need to take note version from january until th of july someone running tor servers had about a chance of seeing what onion domain anyone was visiting but not the specific url or content and had a chance of discovering the real ips for servers hosting hidden services this is the scariest bit hopefully was just security researches but still to be determined if it was nsa hopefully dns is changing servers isps ips immediately sad thing is either way the nsa being able to record all internet traffic poses a serious threat to our anonimity i consider this to be like in the movie inception when the extras in the dream started attacking the dreamers it s all good will see weed legalized and eveyrthing else even if we have to eat entire sheet.
if you still manage to get coins out it goes without saying tumble.
what about safe bad anyone know.
i'm asking this because of the post i saw about having no javascript but i'm still a bit skeptical i've never used a market before so i'm wondering if this is good or bad could anyone provide any information thanks.
i thought that as long as i don't use javascript it's ok thanks for confirming it.
when i go to encrypt a message copy message click encrypt with clipboard the window opens up to select the key to use i check the box to select the key and nothing happenstried with many keys and get the same result i click ok and nothing happensi click cancel and nothing happensanyone have a clue.
scroat on march pm they have everything that was done click by click order by order all my passwords all my orders and history of things i bought i went to jail for this and was let out early for good behavior dude this is bombshell shit right here please expand on this more if you re willing or just pm me if you d rather keep this private how in the world would they be able to get your passwords unless they installed a keylogger or something first i would like to apologize in replying so late i didnt expect someone to reply or ask something further after i posted on top of that after what happened previously i now use a foolproof method and theres no way in hell i can be tracked i had considered myself one of the smart ones using tails running off encrypted usb drive clearing my order history with the sites washing bitcoins before using them etc the worst part about it was the vendor i ordered from was a sweetheart and i should have used the option of paying for product before ship but since we are all trusted members i didnt use that option and would have paid upon delivery bad move not only did i get arrested and wasnt able to pay the vendor many of my friends on here collaborated however and did pay the vendor which i am grateful jor those peoples who did i wont say who for opsec reasons but i also lost my job and missed the birth of my first child i was fired from my job and my license for that field was taken away as well so i could never again get a job in that position and it was a nice and cushy job which paid amazingly well they didnt exactly give me a file and say hey heres how we did it motherfucka but from what they were willing to show me i believe they used the data flowing through tor to track what i was doing it seemed highly likely that a keylogger may have been involved because the information was just fuck like wtf how did you guys get all this on top of that the tails usb os didnt even save so it was a fresh tails everytime it was booted so nothing was taken from cached info the whole ordeal ruined my career put a huge strain on my marriage and most of all my reputation on dn and with my coworkers and friends now i use a fooproof method which will make your head spin only downside is i can only login when certain auspicious events align and sometimes it can be months before i am able to login if you wanna know what i do now you can pm me and through encrypted msg s i can share what i do but again be patient it may take a wihle for me to be able to login again dont email me on my pgp key address as its bogus in the end i brought this upon myself i chose to buy drugs illegally and after the idiot vendor just threw xanax in an envelope i was already bleeding in a pool of shark infested water i did the crime and i did the time and more to all those who were affected by my disappearance i apologize and for my friends here who covered my cost of the sheet i am forever grateful as always i did will and do always love this community of my fellow trippers and rainbowland enthusiasts much love and good vibes to you all pink floyd shine on you crazy diamond part vi ix.
scroat on august pmit was actually a particular key that was causing the problem it still is but i figured out i can use any other key just not that one is the key expired pgp will not use expired keys to encrypt messages spitfir.
just a warning to everyone if a new forum member posts links to a marketplace mixing service bitcoin site any site where you send money they might be fake links designed to spoof the original site and steal your money verify those links before you send your bits to them.
how do you link your pgp key in your profile sig.
you kids need to learn to use vm and debian kali is your friend.

hmm you're probably right nothing within the scope of personal use should normally be interesting enough for le to care about plus you even make yourself suspicious in their eyes by increasing your security efforts etc but then again i hate the thought of making it easy for them if they're gonna spy on us at least they should be working their asses off.
jimdandy on november am watch out for this guy he is not alphabay but rather an impostereven if hes not who cares he's providing valid info and i verified the links with dnstats.
dardush on january pmyou have everything you need right here me to it dardush we have a disputes section here if something goes wrong we try to only keep reputable vendors on our nice little home here on the blackwebz.
appreciate.
it seems they may have reached such a high user volume on their servers for now they must not allow new users maybe this way the site shouldn't overload completely too much while figuring out a safe way to expand their server capabilities then again who really knows the reasons but if they were purposely stealing deposits me thinks they would also be allowing new users.
greenbud on february pm reportedly the prosecution in the sr trial exempted every potential juror who had internet and at the end they had to take a yo it guy a yo woman and people over with no technological background p anyway one of the major reasons not to have charges lead to rediculous sentences is that when facing life in prison only an idiot would accept a life sentence in the us federal system as a plea what ross did was intentionally lose a trial that was unwinnable in hope that his defense will be able to get the verdict possibly thrown out or sentence reduced if you are already fucked might as well go to trial and get it out of the way good luck ross my understanding of the way the system works is that each side defense and prosecution both have a certain number of challenges that can be used to eliminate jurors for any reason likely the prosecution used its challenges to eliminate anyone with any real technical background that is why one or two people who actually may have had a clue got on the jury as the prosecution likely ran out of challenges by that point spitfir.
valsetriste on december pmso last night i sent btc to a vendor using the address he pmed me earlier the vendor says he hasn t received payment now when i check it it s been changed back to the original when i compare my old transactions the one that i m seeing now is the correct one what the hell is going on and am i shit out of luck you can t change content of sent private messages right am i infected with some sort of btc address faker if that s the case fuck you u zfc ymshnfw teaqtxrrcbku hayl whoever you are jesus i m so fucking angry worst part is it wasn t even my money i was supposed to get worth of acid for christmas to a friend sorry for the coarse language vthey friend i understand your anger try not to get to upset thoughi ve read some posts on forum where coin was sent to the wrong address btc and the vendor still upheld the order explain the situation to the vendor first contact the mods go from there i hope everything works out frien.
was thinking could've it been some kind of xss attack i left my acct logged on always if it was me fucking something up where did the address come from my brain hurts.
thank you.
i'm trying to train myself to never use clearnet via tor anymore but if i must i close my browser and log on with a new identity and a new tor circuit is that safe i never hit reddit but there's some emails that are clearnet and some review sites all are.
while we're waiting for others to get involved why don't we test your escrow agent skillz thurgood i'll be the buyer and seller if you're down i'll create two addresses and give you the pubkeys to both in order to confirm the address you create is the correct multisig address you should give me your pubkey too then i'll create the same address in my bitcoin qt client and i can watch the funds get transferred to it in a real world situation all three participants could would do this but each would only have one pubkey so they couldn't spend the coins without the participation of one other person hopefully this will give people a sense of how easy it is do you want to use bitrated if so let me know when to be online.
valsetriste on december ampmed the vendor albion who i know to be trustworthy and general awesome human being he was really confused as what happened and told that he can't see the money the money is still there though i even checked with my friend that i wasn't hallucinating when i copy pasted the number from the private message please admins techwizards help me out hereyou had someone double check a copy and pasted bitcoin address because you might have been hallucinating before the mix up even happened sounds a little strange are you sure that you were not fucked up and may have attributed a little human error some where.
also is it really that bad to just auto connect being as i am already connected thru a tor node.
i use both but not on any regular basis.
i'll pm you an encrypted message if you like what's your public key mine's available in my signature below you can import it and practice encrypting to me if that is something you need to do as well edit nevermind i found your key pming you.
i've had nothing but great experiences on blackbank originally only signed up there because i saw was on there and i'm pretty glad i did because it's been pretty consistent only thing is not too much variety but i'm only really on these marketplaces for acid anyways so it's fine with me agora is sometimes up sometimes down like now middle earth marketplace is pretty quick now too eventually i think i want to just work direct with some of these vendors through this forum seems better to develop a long term relationship that way.
quite unfortunate indeed i really thought blackbank had it in them to be the number market.
we are pleased to announce that alphabay market now supports multisig transactions this was requested a long time ago by the community so we decided to step up our game a bit and go for this option we are now the only marketplace on the deepweb having all of the following security measures source deepdotweb s marketplace list multisig transactions fa withdrawal pin vendor bond forced vendor pgpfor the less tech inclined here s how a multisig transaction works both the buyer and the seller must have set their public multisig key in their profile the buyer deposits of the item value in his alphabay wallet to cover market fees the buyer purchases the item then a multisig bitcoin address is generated using the buyer s key seller s key and a market generated public key both parties can use this publicly viewable information to verify the authenticity of the address the buyer sends money to this address and the seller ships the goods if the buyer is happy he finalizes and the seller received the market private key in case of dispute or refund the buyer receives the private key whoever got the private key will use it along with his own private key to claim the coins to make it simple buy the product and you get a btc address to send the coins to seller gets the private key when you finalize you get the key if you dispute and win this is a fool proof method to avoid exit scams you never give your private keys to anyone we don t provide help in cashing out the multisig address you have private keys out of so you are supposed to know the rest if you lose your private key it s too bad enjoy signup.
tediousdark on june ami have just been connecting to the normal electrum servers through tor i m using tails so i m pretty sure i can t accidentally connect via clearnet what do you mean by normal server i want to make sure i m not doing the same thin.
well if you plan on using a market like hansa then this might be feasible also i don't quite get this multisig thing does one have to create a new wallet for each newtransaction with a different vendor can one use the same wallet for future trans with a particular vendor doseheavy.
i like j k but if you really need the karma plz let me kno.
ron paul lab notes lsd for this work you will need a sterile glove box or a laminar flow box the laminar flow boxes are expensive but make things much much easier the sterile glove box can be made from a glass aquarium take a peice of cardboard and make a lid then cut glove holes tape plastic tubes like for keeping an umbrella dry onto these holes this way when you put your gloved hands through the plastic and the holes you can rubberband the plastic to your arms for a very decent seal make sure that when you buy find your aquarium that it is big enough its very frustrating to work in a small one the next thing you need is a large pressure cooker i would suggest a quart i think its the kind that can just barely fit x quart mason jars anything larger then this can only fit a few more jars for a much higher price starting with freeze dried material take a minimal amount from the vial whatever and place it on sabouraud agar potato dextrose agar works to but the strain will degrade on this medium over time reports state that the strain will actually not degrade on sba after a decent length of time you can also make buy your sba with gentamicin sulfate antibiotic in it this would allow you to just about do open air work but not really a good idea but covers your bases a better antibiotic would be but it has to be added after sterilization as it is not as heat stable at gent the ratios for agar for these two antibiotics are mg l and gentamicin mg l once you have plated the starting material you should have a plate full of growth in a week to days but this is really temperature dependant the optimal temperature is around degrees c now you need to homoginize the material you could buy a stainless steel waring blender like they use in the papers for hundreds of dollars or you could go to the grocery store walmart and take a look at their cheap blenders the bases on these blenders are a standard thread size so you can actually go find a pint canning jar with a narrow neck and screw it into the blender base so you have a small magic bullet looking thing i would reccomend that you bend the blender blades downward this way instead of needing mls of liquid to blend decently you can blend with like ml which becomes important its not easy to bend the blades so be careful so now you have a very cheap tissue homognizer you can sterilize this in your pressure cooker the plastic base can take to cookings before it warps consider these disposible and get a few off ebay or something when you sterilize it make sure to do so with maybe mls of water in it this way you can have nice clean sterile water exactly where you need it so take your petri dish and put it in your glovebox with your homoginizer and sterile scalpel as well as a ml syringe if using sba take a small chunk from the dish and place it in the homoginizer then seal it if using pda you might as well use the whole thing since it will be degraded in a month or so when you want to start your next cycle take the homoginzer and blend it until it seems well homogeneous suck up this liquid with the syringe minus the needle so it doesnt get clogged cap the syringe with a luer lock cap and put it in a plastic bag in the fridge for later now you want to make your seed culture containers these should be made out of quart jars with a square shape not totally round the reason is that the square shape actually acts like a baffled flask go get some express priority envelopes from the post office the kind that are made of tyvek they should say cradle to cradle on them or some other recycling term cut out a square just bigger then the jar mouth and put a blob of silicoln on it while this is drying mix up your seed culture medium my recomended mixture is per liter of solution g mannitol g glucose g succinic acid g kh po mg mgso adjust ph to around with aqueous ammonia or naohnot mandatory past this point ml pluronik polyethoxy increases yields mg added after sterilzation or mg gentamicin added before is fine the silicoln is dry and the medium is made then place around ml into each quart jar you want about by volume of your production culture as seed culture so for liters you need around quart jars with ml each put them in a pressure cooker and let them cook for minutes start counting once it reaches psi once the jars are cooled from pressure cooking inject an equal amount from the syringe into each of the jars through the silicoln blob alternitivly if you have a large amount of freeze dried material you can homoginize this and inject it directly into the jars the process will take a little longer now you are going to need to keep these jars at c and have them on an orbital shaker at around rpm with inch displacement orbital shakers are expensive as hell but are a good investment for this hobby there is another way if you are handy pretty much what you do is get a rpm motor a bunch of pulleys that are around are mounted on a peice of wood plastic metal they are mounted as close as possible without touching in a circle then the motor is mounted so the shaft comes through the base on the shaft is attached a small hub the diameter of this hub compared to the diameter of whole circle is what determines your speed speed motor rpm x inches diameter hub speed ring x inches diamter ring this small hub is coupled to the pulleys with a rubber belt either a flexible belt is used or a tensioning mechanism is added you want to keep your rpms around rpm per one jar optimally if the room is cold you need to keep the temperature a constant c with an adjustible heating blanket the reason you can't use a magnetic stirrer is because it causes sheer forces which will destroy the mycelium so what you need is shaking as well as aeration which you will get as the containers spin with their tyvek tops also the shaking action promotes the mycelium forming nice aggregates of mycelium you want a bunch of tiny round balls not fine goopy cultures or cultures with giant masses the oxygen cant get through whatever option you use you can test to make sure you arent limiting growth by not having enough aeration buy one of those ampule test kits for dissolved oxygen i think kits for these high levels are rarer but they are sold online decently cheap just run the setup with nutrients once without any fungus and test the do levels a few times over the course of a few days the levels should be percent also you can use a microscope with x magnification and put a few drops of the seed culture before transfer onto a slide if you damaged the mycelium or did not do the seed culture properly you will see long stringy peices a properly developed culture will look like a bunch of aggregates of little balls this means the mycelium swelled up to form the parasitic high producing form another way is to use a sterilized oxygen source like for the production medium but this will require a male to male barb going through the jar lids sealed well you can even use the same air source for your production medium as well as your seed cultures it just requires a lot of tubing which becomes a pain and the whole setup looks like some alien dope lab you can get away with the other types of setups by slapping some beer brewing stickers on it and having some empty beer bottles etc around once you introduce your culture you will let the setup brew for days this is if the optimal temperature is kept at exactly c if its higher the fungus will need to be harvested faster and yields will be much lower if colder it will go longer if you want to get fancy you could try and titrate using the iodine back titration to test for when levels of glucose drop off you may also be able to use a diebetic glucose monitor there is info about hacking these online about a day after glucose is used up is the perfect time to transfer for this tutorial your production stage vessel should be a gallon plastic or glass carboy which should contain about gallons liters of medium it will need a cork lid with male to male barbs going through it one barb will only have a small length of tubing full of polyfill for the exhaust the other will have a tube leading down to the largest airstone you can fit in your sterilizer easily the airstone tubes and lid should be put into quart jars and sterilized beforehand to sterilize the carboy can either use ipa or high strength pool h o and then pull as strong of a vaccuum as you can on it or just swish alcohol around pour most out and then add the medium you just have to make sure to bubble the medium for an extra hours before you add fungus to evaporate the alcohol production medium is per liter of solution g mannitol g succinic acid g kh po mg mgso adjust ph to around with aqueous ammonia or naohnot mandatory past this point ml pluronik polyethoxy increases yields mg added after sterilzation or mg gentamicin added before is fine antibioticsfor the airsource you should aim for v v air medium minute but you can get away with maybe so for gallons of liquid you need around a gallon per minute pump its a good idea to test the dissolved oxygen ph and maybe even alkaloid content every once in a while by jabbing a syringe through a silicoln blob cover a tiny hole on the side of the container during fermentation testing the do will let you know where your pump stands the pump should be housed in a large ammo box or any other hermatically sealed box this can be lined with foam to lower noise as long as your pump wont overheat for a large setup you can totally seal the pump in a box with foam spray insulation or something and use a computer watercooling radiator and homemade waterjacket to cool it maybe a thermal cutoff sensor if you know your pump will overheat without cooling in a box the box should have a basic filter doesnt need to be hepa but should be decent it should have a male to male barb glued through it for the clean air to come out to filter the air you need a metal tube about to around and like long it should have hose barbs on each end and have the ability to unscrew the ends maybe find plumbing fittings or even buy a nice inline dryer or something like that off ebay get some fine glass wool and pack the hell out of the tube you want to restrict the airflow a decent amount but not enough to kill your pump try to match the restriction of an airstone seal the tube and sterilize it in a quart jar this tube should filter out and catch most of the particles that go through it your real worry is not the tiny bacteria since you will probably be using antibiotics and an established culture can take care of itself large fungus spores fragments will get caught in this which is why you should resterilize it before every use to sterilize your production medium you need to just fill your pressure cooker with the medium be very careful not to put too much do maybe of the volume of your pressure cooker at a time putting this much water in your pressure cooker makes it more dangerous then canning make sure not to let it fall off the stove because all the water will flash evaporate if it pops open and could fuck your day up let this run at the standard then cool many pressure cookers have a rubber grommet holding on the blowout valve once the cooker cools you can pull out the grommet and quickly cover the hole with something get this pressure cooker and your sterilized carboy into a clean area and stick a sterilized tube and polyfill into the grommet hole attach this tube to a sterilized siphon starter squeeze bulb and then a tube to the barb where the exhaust tube goes start a siphon and get most of the of the liquid into your carboy then repeat until you have enough this works well and doesnt take too long but wont work at the gallon level if this becomes a pain and you want to scale up there are other methods you can fill a few gallon carboy with seed culture medium and then use that to innoculate a larger container of pastureized boiled solution this can be boiled with propane in a giant cooking pot if going this method you need to use a larger spawn ratio maybe if going industrial its very hard to sterilize this amount of liquid uv x ray chemicals are all proven to destroy the medium so they are out what you can do is an interesting continuous process liquid flows through a cell which is constantly zapped by pulses of electricity the pulses are made short enough to prevent electrolysis all of the relevent information is in the book handbook of electrostatic processes which is online for free i believe there are also references with excruciating details on building the devices and operating oxygenate the medium before you add the culture then turn off the airflow and let the production medium sit still for day at this point it is very sensitive then restart the airflow and let this sit for around days at c hotter will kill your yields cooler wil make it take longer withdraw small amounts through the silicoln port and test things once in a while you can let it sit a little longer the alkaloids will change forms but will still hydrolize to lysergic acid all the same once the culture is done pour it through a filter cloth into a bucket save the mycelium and blend it with ice to chop the hell out of it add some water to this and filter out the mycelium throwing it away now you have multiple options for extraction oldschool bentonite clay extraction method and new age ion exchange resin method i would reccomend the ion exchange resin method highly its worth the extra cash for the resin bentonite is messy and hard to filter.
dhl is back up was down for a day to fix issues with ordering.
nice country listing i was happy my country wasnt in the list but then it was so maybe russia.
wow all this operation just to capture one guy they re really desperate.
so far so goodno proble.
sorry if this is a noob question but is it safe to access electrum org through tor i have coin poss linked to my identity that i want to tumble around but would like to avoid fog if possible just because it seems sketchy to me however if there is no other safe option i will use fog any way i could send them from a wallet currently linked to my id to another wallet created and only accessed through tor and repeat this times with throwaway wallets then to my vendor of choice hehe idk any advice is truly appreciated peace mrs b.
molelor on june pmregarding the capthas what i did end up doing and got immediate results was something i would prefer not to have to do and that is to allow a cookie from that site any feedback on that cookies can be deleted as soon as you exit from the site cookies only serve to save the state of most web pages as long as you delete the cookies when you exit the site you'll be fine spitfir.
reasons for not using abraxas in that scenario when using albion s shop you only need to trust him whereas when using abraxas the admins could run away with your funds in escrow or even if you finalize early they could run away with the funds in albion s wallet before he has time to withdraw them and imo albion is trustworthy plus i think you don t need to create an account to use his shop a working pgp gpg identity is all you need if it works like gammagoblin s shop finally there are no fees if a trade is made directly with albion on his shop i think abraxas takes a commission on every transaction.
on february pm can you purchase btc through electrum not afaikquote can you explain why electrum would be anonymous compared to coinbase online wallet it is a client side wallet ie it lives on your computer therefore as long as your ensure it is configured to run through tor it means you can receieve and send btc wihtout needing to logon to an online wallet this comes with its own ramifications one consideration is that when you start a blockchain wallet using tor perhaps blockchain notes that transaction as having been through tor can we ensure that their serves are safe from government hacks however having a bitcoin wallet on your computer means that you have total control over your btc this has its ups and downs  i were to send btcs from an online wallet to my electrum wallet would it still be anonymous were the coins bought with anything that can identify you have you ever logged onto a service that is connected to your btc over a clearnet connection therefore associating your ip to those coins this is a bit simplistic but you get the idea if they were anonymous to begin with and you have electrum setup to only run through tor then they will remain anon.
there are too many marketplaces for everyone to keep up with there were also rumors that they were running a tor exit node on the same server as their service not too sure if i believe it but here are a few links after evolution many here have chosen to do direct trades with vendors they trust i think the only marketplace that i can say i have no love for is alphabay i don't like a site devoted to theft of ones identity i have had multiple family members put into an endless cycle and a hole of debt trying to recover from identity theft other friend with ruined credit that made it hard to find a job and imposable to get a good rate on home purchase because they were taken advantage of in the same manor.
have faith in agora they put up a message saying they were having issues dealing with all the new traffic from evo peeps they are most likely just upgrading their infrastructure like they said they would acid.
i have had many successful transactions there the admins take a different approach towards problems but it all works well.
dardush on february amis it just me or does this market looks exactly like evo the evo code is an open source code many markets copy that code today check out real deal market it even looks exactly like evo i mean they didnt even bother to slightly modify the colors and layout.
hm i'm honestly not sure then have you made your own key already.
go to their help desk on their forum click a few pages until you get to their green resolved threads there is page after page after page of resolved threads of pins not working and the resolution is sorry nothing can be done its our money now tons of them i am currently in the situation where my correct pin i have used dozens of times to withdraw did not work after the th time my account got locked and as per the rules there is nothing that can be done without the long ass mnemonic provided at account creation that i did not bother to save because my pin is retardedly simple and there is no way it could ever be forgotten you are warned ab is covertly stealing people's money with the ridiculous rule of five times you fail and your money is ours.
appreciate.
thank you everyone for your help i was looking around cause i thought i had another ap but i don't i'm either going to look at the usb lucidmotif suggested or just try whonix vm that dimitri coolbreeze suggested the computer i'm using isn't new early 's i wish i had a macbook though lmao for everyone because you are all so kind and helpful thank yousno.

if you see the pictures of this guy he def won't last long i'm pretty sure he will give up any info he has to get a better deal i swear for all the know how all types of other stuff people know its always weird when they just do dumb hotbox type shit.
you're a little late to the party dhl is already trying to capitolize on that i think we can do it better with less infrastructure we have a multisig system implemented here now in theory and all of the trusted vendors are here why would we want to pay a market to mediate the transactions when we have the resources trustworthy vendors to mediate ourselves aflao crypto srr is finishing bitwasp i asked for the amended lighthouse code be worked in so they have auction i have given all of the resources for vendors to get a vps and load whonix with amp so you can run a storefront forum or blog if you want to do some work help wizardx get the collective moved to tor and then we will work on a different phase of dn drugs it will go from the chemist to pgp signing for the vendors so people can tell quality and purity we were selling on the backend of the pms on thehive so there's no reason not to update it all and make the chemists players in the scene agian so the information isn't hoarded by a few and purity of product suffers thats what happened with the helio split i banter about opsec continuously and to make these changes happen everyone needs to be on the same albeit safe and secure playing field.
no love for markets lol we've outgrown the.

i have one more question do i use blockchain as a stand alone wallet or use a popular mainstream one that i can easily transfer from my cc or bank account and then transfer them to blockchain im new to bitcoin so i'm a lot clueless right now.
thanks for all the guidence and help here some few questions what do you mean about note your seed buy a cheap laptop remove the harddrive get tails on a usb sorry i dont know what tails it but i will look it up buy storing in tor wallet do you mean by the market wallet again sorry for the newbie question.
does anyone know how i would go about creating a site like ootp s something simple i would be interested in doing this but don t really know where to start scidm.
sillywabbit on october pmsuppose it is all a big hoot privacy encryption all a smokescreen and the entire deep web is a government sponsored experiment to monitor drug use patterns so that they might effect new policy or decide who deserves to get a slap on the wrist for being an 'irresponsible drug user' then what just a thought likely has been mulled over before i did reckon this to be the case with sr as the fbi takeover corresponded exactly with a large cut in extra government spending after obama pissed off the rebublicans or something it would make total sense to collect data like facebook not sure now don't understand the security issues that threatened agora and all that i think will make sense anyway as people need an opiate or else they're going to revolt it's certainly in the government's favour to have a stoned populatio.

hmm i thought abraxas was the best marketplace now agora is gone it has the most listing and active vendors etccheers dolmi.
saint nic on january amwe will never again trust another market such as ab dhl ftw santai actually prefer markets as i find them much much more convenient than direct ordering and i am more than willing to pay the extra fee for such added convenience but it's so hard now to find a trustworthy market that also has masses of customers on it.
my verdict is in nucleus is where it s at for me right now does anyone else find the interface on blackbank to be god awful as a vendor i find the design to be very poor it takes most work to do absolutely anything i ever have to do i find it to be about as functional as it is aesthetically appealing barely at all i don t care about the aesthetics if the interface is well thought out and practical but i can t stand the interface on blackbank middle earth i find much easier to use there are a few little things i dislike like how conversations without unread messages have to be sorted alphabetically by the other person s name and can t be sorted like a normal inbox so you can come back to a recent conversation even if you don t remember who it is because you re talking to a hundred different people and a few common features i d like to see added like listing cloning which isn t that important to me but is definitely nice as well as some features i ve never seen before but keep suggesting for the most part the interface works for me there i like that both nucleus and middle earth auto fe for fe listings unlike blackbank where even on a fe listing the buyer has to wait for you to accept before they can finalize and then you have to wait for them to finalize after that before you can withdraw so there s this whole correspondence dynamic that can leave funds sitting in limbo indefinitely whereas on middle earth and nucleus the second someone orders an fe listing you can withdraw and secure the funds middle earth has one issue that i find quite bothersome though buyers can t withdraw wtf is that it s their money i don t care if me doesn t want to be a free tumbler if that s their excuse they can charge a withdrawal fee like blackbank people deposit more coin than they need all the time to make sure they have enough for their order during btc fluctuations if nothing else they also should have the right to change their mind and pull their coin out what if you deposit as much as you need to buy something the btc drops or the vendor raises the price or hits vacation mode and you can no longer afford it and want to take your coin back or order a smaller listing or something else and now have a bunch of leftover coin you can t withdraw i really like the vendor side of middle earth but this troubles me to prevent it from being used as a tumbler if people actually use it as such and that s problematic they could charge a withdrawal fee for people who deposit then withdraw withut buying anything no withdrawal fee for people who spend more than half of the coin they deposit before withdrawing the remainder or something silly like that i still wouldn t like that but that s not nearly as bad as not letting people withdraw at all if they re willing to let me vend there for a mere commission they should let people tumble their coins at a slight cost as well even if most buyer withdrawals aren t even for that purpose but rather just because people want their money where they want their money somewhere safer than an anonymously run darknet market primarily used for drugs that are illegal in most of the world for example again i really like middle earth from the vendor side of things but they lose major brownie points for this issue i ve had multiple people refuse to buy there for this reason and i completely understand why if they resolve this they ll be one of my favorite markets of all time as it stands i m having a great time vending there but this doesn t sit right with me and nucleus nucleus scares me design wise it s one of my favorite two markets of all time along with evolution in fact it reminds me so much of evolution i feel like it s too good to be true yes i would like to see more features but this has all the essentials i can think of and it s laid out in a very naturally accessible way the ui for nucleus like evolution makes for a wonderful work experience on the vendor side evolution was my favorite marketplace design wise but i was only there for weeks steady before they made off with all the moneys i don t want to fall in love with nucleus like i fell head over heels with evolution only to have my heart broken again yes nucleus i find you attractive and i really enjoy being with you but i m jaded from all my past relationships gone wrong and have my guard up and am not going to let myself get infatuated with you and get careless again as i have before i m going to make the most of what we have together and hope it lasts but at the end of the day too much trust in your kind always ends badly so when the day comes when you lose the fight or stab us in the back i ll be ready and i ll move on like it aint no thing.
hi quick question just made a new pgp in the new tails and don't know where to get my public key it used to be easier.
i downloaded tails and got everything set up but for some reason it won't connect to the internet it says that i am connected has the blue bars but the videlia sp onion is nowhere to be found and i can't get on tor or the unsafe web browser i've tried unspoofing that didn't work i tried to put in a bridge and it wouldn't go through i guess i put it in wrong i don't know how though i don't know what else to try and i've been going at this for two days now any help is very appreciated thank yousno.
short and simplified answer because it is not end to end encrypted when somebody catches your traffic everyone hosting an exit node can catch that le hosts some exit nodes for that purpose you are fucked you just gave away your address and time of arrival pm me if you want me to link you to some good safety stuff i would strongly advise you to do so.
nothing on this if the list is legit and the proxy is still active accessing the proxy from a sandboxed environment and monitoring the server logs might produce some useful information how many people could be accessing the board through this proxy without knowing it.
i've never ordered cannabis from a vendor before so i am trying to find a reputable one that can also be trusted.
sorry to here this i feel bad for anyone that lost money in black bank it s starting to seem like markets aren t even worth it and that we should start just sticking with direct sells or use tmg mostlyor at least till they figure out a decentralized market.
hello guyswho has lost theyre money from agora me and my friends wallets are empty.

i think enigmaticsmile meant which level of encryption and which app you will need the strongest key for best security bit also most people encrypt their messages in a text editor then paste to where needed mail forum pm etc.
gardener on february pmquote from enigmaticsmile on february pmtry to keep your desktop or laptop clean you can download tor and gpg to an external hd or usb can gpg software be kept on an external drive that isn't an os like tails i learned that as it needs access to services it has to be kept on the machine this is why i encrypt my gpg software as well as my computer and never save any keys but i'm always on the lookout for apps i can keep on a thumb drive i'm going to read up on truecrypt the usb version is all on the usb take it with you where ever you go and its.
think it's great was linked from the onions su.
no i haven t i will see if that works thank yo.
for the purposes of keeping any possible trails contained i would suggest that the buyer create a new wallet for each transaction keepassx will help you keep it all databased with passwords if you are worried about a bunch of wallets vendors may want to create a new wallet for each transaction the master public keys i am asking the trusted vendors on this site to upload are basically just their transaction mediator third party keys the trusted vendors master public keys will act as the marketplace would act for the transation i see no reason to give any market a fee when we can easily and efficiently mediate our own transactions with the most reputable people on the darknet this is in no way to be used every time unless there is an upcharge multisig is a lot of work and you are holding coin that the vendor could use to reinvest for first time buyers scared of using a new vendor situations where prices look too good to be true for sales and possible large bulk buys where a vendor is worried about losing more than they can afford you shouldn't be running that way unless you're irresponsible or stupid the multisig is a functioning possibility to thwart loss.
welcom.
on july pmjust ordered from study buddy on me a couple hours ago js is not enabled could not have been smoother or quicker order is already marked as sent looking forward to trying out some of the asian xtal enjoy it tell me if you like it it already on its way to you.
dhl look solid very engaging also i loved the theme.
oh thanks for clearing that up thought i was going mad nice to see some of then old names from sr on her.
on august pmif canada gfn went direct i would never need to use a market ever again who.
we're already there so far i noticed one great thing listing items has never been easier kudos.
none of those markets exist anymore sorry i suggest looking at the top post in this section and checking out agora and or blackbank those are both rather popular.
thank you very muc.
i have heard that albert heijn was busted along with theheineken and they may have been supplied through the same operation they have been detained in nl pending trial according to a news story i read in dutch which mentioned something about supertrips and others it seems credible at this point it sucks but it will not stop the lsd mdma from nl that would be like a little boy trying to hold back the sea with his finger.
its not that we dont want links we dont want spamming some garden crashers post the same thing times just be cool make one post.
i'm gonna be upgrading my opsec to tails on usb and i'll most likley be using public wi fi since i don't have my own on whatever laptop comes my way obviously vpn and other things like that aren't an option so is there anything else i need.
it's not even possible to log in atm because there is no captcha what's that all about.
make a new key encrypt send to me i am running an os that is a very rugged linux variant there is no way to catch a virus this way.
alphabaymarket on november pmnot saying abraxas is over but we are confident you will find alphabay to fit your needs try it out here registration to alphabay quotei would rather use nucleus or any site besides alphabay besides the excessive and shameless self promotion over the last week i have tried alphabay once in the past the site was beyond basic horrible interface layout not a site i would trust or ever enjoy using just being honest.
loading tails off of a usb drive will be more than enough in terms of keeping your hardware hidden secure java is much different than javascript javascript is a lightweight computer programming language scripting language that allows small scripts or programs to be run over the web java is basically a programming language for portable cross platform computer programs cracking someone else's wifi won't really help you much and i don't condone using other individuals' internet connections for illegal activity how would you feel if one day police broke down your door and arrested you for absolutely no reason other than someone living half a block from you had poor opsec learning to properly test attack and break into someone's network takes lots of time and a fair understanding of networking and can get you in trouble as well not worth it a vpn is not the same as a v m vm stands for virtual machine which is a program that is used to create a virtual computer inside the memory of your physical computer vpn stands for virtual private network this is a service provided by many companies where and this is a very basic explanation all incoming and outgoing information is first sent through a remote server it hides your internet usage from your isp internet service provider.
uncleal on april pmwhat's up with that agora link is that a pishing link or did they just add a second url that's the former url that's no longer being used the new one is onionmore info here agora marketplace changes url due to heartbleed ssl bu.
i realize the amvd is outdated and no longer getting updated but i'm still curious i'm sure both are handy for keeping track of where vendors are and verifying that their key matches past different profiles etc but i'm just curious as to how many darknet shoppers here actually use either or these two sites please give one of the following answers you use grams you use the amvd you use both you use neither and feel free to add anything else you want to sa.
unit on may ami deposited into my agora account on around pm i sit here on may th at pm days after my deposit and nothing has shown in my agora account one would hope that with such a big deposit agora support might respond to messages however they have yet to respond to the messages i have sent with just questions regarding deposits they said withdraws are fixed however they are working on deposits i hope agora comes through on this and doesn't drop the ball depositting btc shouldn't be the scary thing about the dnm the mailing of drug should be however i sit here scared worried confused and very irritated at the very simple transaction of btc to my account i hope agora fixes this soon as well because if a normal order takes weeks after vendor sends out package i am looking at a solid month on one order this is sad and not what customers pay commission to see the one positive you can look at is they fixed withdrawls first while that may be frustrating towards your situation and i can see why with that much money but in terms of a market doing an exit scam it wouldn't make sense for them to let vendors withdraw their coins scidm.
the change to a new kernel and reports of users having issues including dirtysouf not being able to verify the signing key has me stuck on tails is there an alternative that includes usb mounting persistence and memory wiping at shutdown anyone very knowledgeable feel safe using the upgrade the upgraded kernel is the same flavor of linux used by redhat which works very closely with the us government.
hey guys slowly getting my opsec together as i read more and more on the forums i couldn't find a clear answer to this though for very small scale first time transactions is it safe enough to acquire my bitcoins on localbitcoin transfer through my real name and banking details have a high feedback individual lined up who has quite a low minimum transfer limit which is what i want then with tails tor transferring from localbitcoin wallet to my own wallet before mixing tumbling are these the same thing is this acceptable opsec there seem to be so many ways people acquire their bitcoins on the board some of which seem quite elaborate if they are thoroughly mixed and final transfer done from a different wallet with tails does it really matter how you got them any help much appreciated.

we love avengersmarket on november pmnot saying abraxas is over but we are confident you will find we love avengers to fit your needs try it out here registration love avengers affiliate php aff market love avengersforum love to we love avengers quotei would rather use nucleus or any site besides we love avengers besides the excessive and shameless self promotion over the last week i have tried we love avengers once in the past the site was beyond basic horrible interface layout not a site i would trust or ever enjoy using just being honest.
what btc fee do you suggest using for sending btc the electrum default seems to be but i can change it thank.
so i buy it from local with cash or someone else pays non cash for another one he sends it from local to helix and then from helix to market sure thats enough or helix to another helix what if cash its not optional give me some couple of a to c options thank.
molelor on june amhave tried to register with sigaint times always says the captcha is wrong but its not any idea as to why captchas do that happens on most sites now make sure you're using cap.
if you're really worried about security buy a laptop locally with cash and only use it for browsing dn however a tails usb is easy to use and offers basically equal security never send any identifying incriminating information over tor without pgp encryption or to an untrusted source and never trust any third party such as a market or even tmg to encrypt your messages for you as mirrormirror said don't torrent over tor you can use a vpn or proxy to torrent safely from your home tails automatically offers mac spoofing by default across the board as well.
the following information is advice it comes from sources irl and my own thoughts use common sense when reading i am just relaying the information if it does not apply to you or you cannot do it well then skip it these are some general methods to hide your identity or at least your regional writing identifiers especially if english is not your primary language there is no reason not to do this if you are able terminology slang word choice and spelling vary tremendously around the globe and over short distances within english use universal terms if you can currency units of measurement and references to common objects or actions should be watched closely besides cultural references what is the area you make toilet in called depends on where you are greetings and farewells also tend to be regional drug slang it should be obvious is regional use what the community generally uses even if it sounds odd word check everything you can pick from british or american standard based on what program you use become friends with a thesaurus if you use a word commonly use a synonym instead read blogs or personal websites from english speaking countries take the speech of the native speakers and use it grammar and syntax give distinct patterns but usually require more writing samples to analyze punctuation usage of an exclamation point comma and emoticons should be watched do you write like this or maybe like this how about this one pay attention to these things your spacing sentence and paragraph pattern too do you write very long sentences that could be broken up into little sentences but instead tend to keep going on and on then finally end then a small one next that is a pattern even if you vary all your other identifiers most people miss this i would advise against writing in a completely different style every time you will make mistakes that will show you are giving false information and then that information will be ignored for recurring patterns these patterns left will be your native patterns it takes less writing samples to cross check than most think better to be consistent pick a style and stick with it establish and maintain false patterns that will be confused with true ones last do not fall into your false patterns irl or outside of tor any other general ideas.
never use this the posts above are correct if you are using a cellphone for darknet either you are a kid or are not opsec conscious enough and can land in serious trouble both financially and with the l.
update you are no longer aloud to post market links on this forum or the text will be replaced with we love anvegers if you need to find markets invite please refer to the list on cryptocointalk love avengers was a finnish only marketplace turned international and available in english it has existed since october it offers both traditional escrow multisig fa and forced pgp it recently turned invite only and require a referral link to register as a buyer or a vendor it was recently rebranded and now called we love avengers invite link love avengersxmn fydu onion register swu.
i have an account over there and have done several large transactions flawless one with a small problem that was solved between the vendor and i one order had to start a support ticket but the issue was solved with in a few days the support over there is awesome even when they were under attack by a wanna be hacker they went out of their way to help.
helloi was wondering if there is a way to safely chat over tor environment p p encryption anonimity i read some threads about it some recommend torchat other say is not safe anyone has an idea for this it would actually be cool to be able to chat with a vendor when you are working on an order some vendor take days to reply messages and things can get longer than expected i dont know if this is against opsec or what please any of the tech gurus out there throw some light on the matter.
ahoy stan i am indeed still active here and the offer certainly does still stand you know what you are indeed the man because you did everything correctly and i can agree that the moon is indeed very blue in the garden tonight if you pop yourself a tab from one of our excellent vendors and sit down over there by the trans dimensional water feature you can watch it change every colour you can think of and more if you post your key i will send you something to test your decryption there is a pgp key thread in the general discussion board where you can post your key and vendors will be able to find it to be honest though i tend to send my key along with any encrypted messages as a belt and braces backup welcome to the garden my friend its a beautiful place es thanks for the support i'm just passing on a favor someone did for me as i hope anyone i help here will do.
thanks a lot scroat appreciate i.
hello i 'm new here can i use tails from usb encryption from my home pc to be safe for small order or do i need proxy vpn virtual machine and much more thank you for hel.
for those of you using bitblender to tumble it just got hacked and is inaccessable.
thank you guys for the response and i am sure the question sounded stupid i am very new and reading as much as i can i obviously need to learn a bit more before i go any further once again thank you for the great advice.
they still haven't made this the default setting any reasoning behind that.
also unrelated question but does anyone know what happens to a vendor's grams profile if they update their key there and on the linked markets that are still up will you lose your link feedback from defunct markets where you cannot update your key will you lose any links feedback at all or does it still give you credit for having verified with your old key that grams previously recognized as being used on a market i'd just really like to know because it takes an eternity to add most things and their support does not respond at all actually that's not true grams got back to me in less than hours saying my subject was too long and that they therefor could not read my message body for such a nice clean website and awesome functionality i'm surprised too many characters in the subject interferes with the body of the message at all kind of random and you'd think they could prevent your subject from being too line by limiting how long it can be rather than letting you destroy your own messages lol after that they didn't get back to me and i think i've asked them the same questions times now with short subject lines over months so i'm guessing they're not going to would be nice if they had a forum seems like they've pulled together a nifty set of services and i'm very curious as to how many buyers utilize it in any way whatsoever and also about the updating public key stuff.
the hidden wiki is scams thats why if you want a marketplace list go to dnsstats net or grams grams enufi jmdl onion there's like markets right now the main ones are black bank agora nucleus middle earth and tm.
is higher than just about all the other markets nucleus is only i would not sell on a new market it has to prove itself first customers are not going to be happy being asked to pay an upcharge which will discourage sales whats this bit about selling ipads and iphones is it a joke it may turn out to be a great market perhaps later i will look into it but for now i m satisfied with the markets i m on.
or maybe have it as a different priced option ex mg xtal direct trade mg xtal multisig this would at least give people the option but keeping the direct trade price considerably lower most will choose the cheaper option especially with trusted vendors it may seem like a huge price difference but it's also a lot of work the vendors need to get paid for.
quotein regards to sr can you link something thats shows you were a top rated vendor and what did you sell if you need to research legacy sales of a vendor on the darknet try in the vendor name in the upper right corner and click search i sold scopolamine chem guides and custom chem consulting.
symetry on january amnope not phished my account was working fine and was fulfilling orders today an escrow got released so i went to withdraw and my correct pin would not work account got froze so complained about it to admin then i took to reddit to complain min after reddit complaints my password no longer worked no phishing links or password disclosure i think the reddit mods also own ab that trappy guy has stolen directly deposited into accounts numerous times dudes probably couldn't fight their way out of a wet paper bag they don't have the balls to steal like that in person they just do it behind a computer screen they're so bad at selling drugs they have to card steal to make money lolit's almost as embarrassing as that guy who hacked tmg and put a drive by executable on the server he really thought ppl were going to download a exe over tor lo.
across this and thought it was pretty funny you'll laugh if you surf the deep web a lot this kinda applies to your tech site a little but it's mostly for lol.
whatever happened with the magestic garden run site that used deterministic wallets.
at silk road trial federal agent explains how he trapped ulbrichthow the feds became dripsofacid buying and selling on silk road by joe mullin jan am utcthe silk road trialnew york more people were using the mail to get high and jared der yeghiayan knew it we hadn't seen ecstasy being seized in letter class like that in a long time said the homeland security special agent since i'd been at o'hare der yeghiayan was speaking on wednesday from the stand in a manhattan federal courtroom where year old ross ulbricht stands accused of being the mastermind in the most successful drug dealing website of all time the silk road prosecutors showed a table full of more than envelopes with a few varying kinds of labels all used to ship drugs this was just one day said der yeghiayan who pursued narcotics investigations from his office at the chicago airport we hardly had seizures of ecstasy in years past when they did find pills in the mail it was a one off on a hand addressed envelope by he was seeing large amounts of printed letters coming from europe and other countries with fake business names printed on as return addresses like studyabroad com by october of that year der yeghiayan had opened an investigation of silk road it would ultimately lead him to a long relationship with the website first as buyer then as seller and ultimately as a staff member becoming friendly with and getting paid by dread pirate roberts the boss behind the site two years after he began seizing those stunning amounts of drugs in the chicago airport der yeghiayan came to believe that dpr was ross ulbricht the last chat would take place on october it ended when federal agents set upon ulbricht in a san francisco public library grabbing his laptop while it was still open to the chat page walking a jury down the silk roadtestimony today was partly the narrative of his investigation and partly a tour of the silk road it was the jury's first look at the website the testimony which began yesterday and continued throughout today touched on some things not made public until today private messages from dread pirate roberts secret staff only chat areas and dpr's guide for drug dealers covering everything from packaging to philosophy der yeghiayan has close cropped hair a goatee and a light beard on wednesday he wore a conservative black suit with a dark tie clearly an experienced witness he shifted his gaze from the prosecutor to the jury as he answered every question shortly after the investigation opened homeland security agents began to make buys from the site they would compare the drugs they seized or bought to silk road listings they had seen and found match after match ultimately der yeghiayan and his team made undercover buys from the site from over distinct silk road dealers in countries all but one of the purchases came through with real drugs the jury was walked through a few examples like a chunk of brown heroin weighing grams shipped from the netherlands der yeghiayan opened the package and showed photos to the jury the packaging was pro vacuum sealed pouch wasn't visible behind a bluish sheet of paper and the heroin was within not one but several plastic bags another photo showed cocaine wrapped in black foil in april they did another buy a big one this one was walked through more slowly so the jury could understand how der yeghiayan bought bitcoins and what they were he showed how he used the now defunct mt gox exchange to turn into bitcoins then logged into a silk road account he had taken over called dripsofacid at that point the court reporter stumbled sorry he asked drips of acid der yeghiayan said more slowly then prosecutors ran through the various sections of silk road the silk road community forum was divided into five sections security shipping drug safety philosophy and off topic the philosophy section was held out to users as the home of dpr's book club that's where they try to discuss how to use drugs safely and just effects of different drugs was der yeghiayan's description of the drug safety section has anyone tried mdma from these sellers read a typical forum post shown to the jury which listed three silk road seller account names below the question on the site's wiki jurors read about the site's built in tumbler instead of doing a transfer from one account to another they put a lot of other accounts in between der yeghiayan said that masks who the buyers and sellers are avoid abandoned buildings or anywhere it would be suspicious to have mail delivered read a wiki section called receiving packages if you follow these guidelines your chances of being detected are minimal from buyer to sellerder yeghiayan also had access to at least one seller account presumably from an arrest called supertrips with that he was able to enter seller only sections of the site on the silk road seller's guide the rules read never ask clients for personal information under no circumstances should you save a copy of your client's address publish a public encryption key in your user description on your settings page so your customers can send you their information encrypted if they wish no selling out of escrow that last point was important the silk road escrow system discouraged either side buyer or seller from ripping the other one off money was held by silk road until both sides were satisfied every caution must be taken to maintain the secrecy of the contents of your clients' package advised another part of the seller's guide creatively disguise it in such a way that a postal inspector might ignore it it is your responsibility to stay up to date on the latest stealth packaging sellers should print their mailing labels not hand write on substances the guide insisted when selling any substances that had an odor you must vacuum seal the package dpr explained not try to mask it with another pungent thing like coffee the seller's contract with silk road obliged them to describe your items accurately and truthfully another part read like a corporate mission statement treat your customers with respect go above and beyond for them der yeghiayan read dpr's posts regularly the site admin at first simply called himself silk road adopting the dread pirate roberts name in february around when hsi began buying drugs off the site for a drug kingpin dpr's tone was sometimes quite emotional one imagines scenes with a therapist hey gang really sorry for the dead time there the site admin wrote after an outage in june this work is scary and exciting all at the same time and i'm really very happy to be on this journey with you in another post shown to jurors dpr waxed emotional about the success of his project it's great to see that my words are resonating with so many of you it's a privilege to have a stage to speak from here it doesn't get said enough and it is hard to get across in this medium but i love you who knew that a softy could lead an international narcotics organization behind my wall of anonymity i don't have to intimidate thankfully but yea i love you guys thank you for being here thank you for being my comrades thank you for being yourselves and bringing your unique perspectives and energy and on a personal note thank you for giving me the best job in the world i've never had so much fun i know we've been at it for over a year now but really we are just getting started i'm so excited and anxious for our future i could burst dthe site's owner stopped going by simply silk road and took on the name dread pirate roberts in january in a later message dpr got angry responding to users who had complained about increases in the commissions he charged on each sale he wrote when have i lied when have i cheated or stolen from anyone here when have i treated anyone unfairly when have i lead you astray why do you turn on me now when i have poured my heart and soul into this community and project on orders we are talking about an extra a order an extra cents do you think this site built itself do you think it runs itself do you have any idea the risk the people operating this site are taking do you have any clue what we've been through to get here today whether you like it or not i am the captain of this ship you are here voluntarily and if you don't like the rules of the game or you don't trust your captain you can get off the boat from seller to adminby july of der yeghiayan had managed to take over the account of someone who was not only a silk road seller but one of several staffers adopting the identity of cirrus der yeghiayan earned bitcoins a week about at the time to moderate forum posts after several weeks he got a raise to bitcoins weekly he kept getting the salary until the site was shut down in october cirrus has always been dedicated to our community at large dread pirate roberts explained in a private message sent to a small group of cirrus and other administrators the message was sent shortly before hsi took over the account it wasn't clear from testimony today how der yeghiayan was able to take the identity of the trusted cirrus presumably it was the account of an arrested user or one who otherwise made a deal with authorities cirrus was part of a group of forum moderators along with three other trusted users inigo libertas and who also went by ssbd i had admin rights der yeghiayan explained to the jury i could search through the database of users and i could edit delete and move posts on the forums there were other things he couldn't do the distribution of such powers on the site was by dpr and dpr alone in late august dpr charged cirrus with moderating a new part of the marketplace's discussion boards you're going to be our quality control expert on this dpr told him in a chat message so we're going to be pretty strict about what gets through der yeghiayan wrote back in his undercover persona cirrus so basically the discussions have to be connected to products not just bitching yes wrote dpr users in the special forum should be calm polite etc this wasn't the general forum area of silk road but a different one hosted on the marketplace that only certain users had access to the forums are the backyard party explained dpr this is the storefront from admin to arrestder yeghiayan didn't know who dread pirate roberts was and even after his extensive testimony it still isn't clear how he found out on the stand today he said that an irs investigator told him ulbricht was the suspect ulbricht was easy enough to locate by late september der yeghiayan was on his way to san francisco ulbricht's adopted hometown around noon on october he met up with a team of federal agents in the glen park neighborhood they gathered at a cafe where ulbricht had been recently they wanted to see if he would return while agents physically monitored ulbricht and his home der yeghiayan kept his laptop open on the silk road's staff chat channel he had been watching dpr on the staff chat and saw that he logged off around pm local time at that same time i was notified that ulbricht had left his home and was headed in the direction of the cafe said der yeghiayan ulbricht walked into the bello cafe looked around and walked out perhaps seeing how crowded it was the glen park branch of the sf public library was just next door ulbricht went inside at pm der yeghiayan saw dpr log on it would be ulbricht's last online chat for some time cirrus hi cirrus are you there dread hey cirrus how are you doing dread i'm ok you cirrus good can you check out on one of the flagged messages for me dread sure dread let me log in cirrus ok dread you did bitcoin exchange before you started working for me right cirrus yes but just for a little bit dread not any more than that cirrus no i stopped because of reporting requirements dread damn regulators eh dread ok which post cirrus lol yep cirrus there was the one with the atlantisit was a trap when dpr typed ok which post der yeghiayan knew it meant he was looking at a particular admin screen listing flagged posts at that point der yeghiayan gave the signal via email keeping his laptop open der yeghiayan told jurors how he walked from the cafe to the library testimony on wednesday didn't go farther than that it was nearly pm and time to release the jury but those following the story know how this ends of course ulbricht was arrested computer opened to exactly the page the undercover agent had told him to go to the real cliffhanger isn't what happened in that library but what happens tomorrow that's when ulbricht's lawyer joshua dratel will cross examine der yeghiayan and begin to tell the story he promised yesterday the story of how ulbricht wasn't the dread pirate roberts but was somehow lured back to be a fall guy by the real head honcho of the site while we don't know the details yet it sounds like a wild story it's also ulbricht's last chance to stay free.
dxuutx on may pmthis is why i would never trust a dnm with something important that would affect my real life like irl dealers who borrow money for their supply and then a dnm goes down and it s all fuck i m dead i owe money to some bad people or heroin addicts on some where s my deposit and going through withdrawal like this is technology guys ever use it if so you know it breaks when you need it most don t put in more money than you can afford to lose and don t rely on it for important things thank you i couldn t agree more i ve already swore to myself i m sticking to micro transactions from now on i d rather have btc on the line than what i had put myself into and exactly i ve never felt comfortable with sharing that i even use the market with anybody but close close close friends when they would like help with using it or want me to over see a transaction for them i let them know i risk my money when i use these marketplaces so when you want to use them you re risking your money too basically saying i ll do my best to make sure they get a clean transaction but if it goes to hell in a hand basket which i ve seen happen very easily it s not up to me to fix or compensate anything for them.
uncleal on february pmquote from knucklesfromsr on february pmthis trial should of been extremely highly publicized from everything that i read this makes it so that website owners can be held responsible for what their users do and yea the whole thing was rigged a mess apparently from what his family was saying they denied a lot of evidence from the defense from even being presented i wouldn't be surprised if the whole thing was rigged i think they're trying to make an example of ross and disuade from anyone following in his footsteps very likely although from the rise of other markets the fact that evo and agora are still up and the further development of p p networks like bitmessage etci doubt they can do much to stop it deter yes but those who are top notch in their opsec and know how to make robust websites the only shot they have is to get in on the inside like they did and ulbricht dropped his guard sadly they knew exactly how to lure him by having him goto a specific admin page see but he already was flagged months prior because of his 'email' flub the weakest link dxuutxthat is correct if ross had made the markets in a way that said 'do whatever you want here but i don't condone nor tolerate any illegal activity'and did not specifically have 'drug listings' they would of had nothing the vendors could have made their own special product listings perhaps using code words which were only known via clearnet channels or irc eg then ross could not be held liable if even if those posts listings were not taken down that is not necessarily condoning or allowing ross could have just defended by saying it was an oversight and i am sure even in the clearnet that there have been pm deals conducted over shroomery irc google groups etc again private engagement between forum usenet members is never in anyway something for which site admins could be held responsible so long as they assume plausible deniability.

it is very annoying to enter this password for each message i recieve does anyone know how to aviod putting in your password each time.
i think your remembering sr with a rose tinted mind scamming paranoia fucking government agencies bitcoin fluctuations were all present then too but i do also miss it there were so many buyers and vendors buyer confidence was high and anything you listed would fly out what's the advantages of buying direct off a vendors site verses buying direct off a vendor through email.
is tor and is tor browser if i'm not mistaken.
thanks thought as much.
next best markets are the following no specific order they are about equal to one another.
moreau on january amquote from doses lysergic on january amlol speak english its not insignificant it is not not significant when you use a double negative you obscure your meaning ianae the post by dxuutx undoubtedly contains florid prose perhaps excessively and i appreciate your plea for simple english on internet forums it is usually more effective to have style enhance an argument rather than have the argument be a frame for displaying one's style however the use of the double negative in it's not insignificant is valid here before going further let's first correct the misquote so that the phrase regains its original meaning taken out of context as above the phrase implies the possessive sense of its eg people admired its not insignificant beauty whereas the original was it's an abbreviation of the verb it is yes i know at worst this is a common mistake and at best acceptable textspeak and generally is too small to be worth picking up on but your opening point is that dxuutx should speak english therefore introducing a grammatical error into your first  dxuutx's post unfairly helps your claim as to the phrase itself the double negative is an example of a figure of speech called litotes or more generally meiosis where something is deliberately played down or understated in order to increase its importance litotes is common in many languages both ancient and modern in europe it has a fine pedigree being found in homer's iliad ovld's metamorphoses and the epic poem beowulf logically it may be true that it's not insignificant has the same meaning as it's significant but litotes remains an acceptable way of emphasising a statement even to fowler who would certainly be sympathetic towards your desire for greater clarity a dictionary of modern english usage hw fowler various editions just saying a response requires more thought on my part get back to ya.
hi all i ve been out for a while and i probably missed out on some things that happen ed but it seems to me that the kingdom forum is not active any more the link i have might be an old one anyone knows about a new link or has more info on what s happening stay on the safe free sid.
sillywabbit on august pmfuck the centralized markets man trusted vendor boutique sites and email forum direct trades is the onlyway to go with any kind of assurance that your coin or identity is not being compromised for all we know every market is run by leo or their informants i was just coming in here to say this i have no problem sending money upfront to trust worthy vendors hopefully direct transactions like that are both a security benefit to sellers and buyers i prefer forums like tmg to deal with vendors.
i really don't know why more vendors arent coming around to tmg and promoting that instead sure i can see the downside of it taking longer to build clientel but fuck after each exit scam and how much money they lose per scam i'm sure it has to build up to a shit ton of money lost more trusted vendors need to make their way here i've tried on my end at least i got galindoi to make his way here let's add to that lis.

lobster on october amwould dban or removing your hd alltogether avoid bios problems no it wouldn t help with bios rootkits or malware dban only erases the contents of your hard drive it does nothing to detect or delete bios infections.
im not sure on this so i don t expect any reward or anything but can t you just sell your btc through local bitcoins it s anonymous that way as you d be getting cash for btc and also you can typically charge more per btc than any of the other exchanges if you live in a particularly small city i think you can also accept moneypak.
dwujk on may amthanks a lot for your help and your welcome captain and no james isn't my real name also does anyone know if my public pgp key is too short your key is bits most people would deem bits advisable how much of an effect does it have on your security in practical terms is unknown and highly circumstantial check 'key size' page on wikipedia.
ok ootp has been a vendor i've wanted to order from and i remember him from original sr blue viking is on my list to try too hopefully they know what they're doing security wise and with that they can avoid some of the bullshit that precipitates from the unstable markets of late i'm always angry when i hear about markets 'exit scamming' because it seems to me that the more that happens the less good vendors will be willing and able to maintain a profitable presence on the darknet i know its a bit corny and oversensitive but sometimes i feel like i'm about to shed a tear i'm so nostalgic about sr the vibe just hasn't really been the same since scamming paranoia fucking government agencies bitcoin fluctuations.
the simplest pgp software is gpg usb ime it can be saved on a usb encrypted if you like although it doesn't have to be the software will make you a public key which you will give out to anyone who wishes to send you an encrypted message likewise you'll use other's public keys to encrypt messages to them encrypting a message will return you a big string of gobbledygook which can then be decrypted only by the holder of a corresponding private key gpg usb has some simple instructions wih it it's literally a few clicks of a mouse easy stuf.
ch m ra on june pmhey uncleali would reccommend using a separate usb key cd dvd microsd for keys and other sensitive things that you need to have encrypted persistent volumes never sit well with me take this analogy i see all these cell phone cases that double as wallets holding credit card ids money etc if someone were to steal your cell phone they would now have access to your complete identity since tails is amnesic if you do not use the persistent volume you will be able to keep all your other files separate tails itself is not illegal one more thing an sd card is extremely easy to destroy chew microwave swallow the possibilites are endles if you have any other questions feel free to ask cthanks friend i m not really good with this kinda stuff it took me forever to figure out how to install tails on usb i wish there was just one single package you can just install and all your opsec needs are taken care of i guess tails is the closest thing to that but it seems like there are a million other things when you go around the deep web and see what everyone else talks about.
oldisgold on february pmwhat's the best and most trustworthy btc mixer out there right now bitcoinfog i would say that bitcoinfog is the best blockchain info privides shared send and i believe it's also quite good if you're really paranoid you can chain them like you btc fog you shared send you but it's also more expensive.
beetlejews on august ami havent gotten my btc yet either withdrew two days ago yall figure it will still come i hope i dont lose like i did on blackbanki recieved my btc after about days it sucks waiting but i think you will get it eventually hope it comes through for you much love halfpin.
is there any way to have this enabled by default.
this might sound pretty basic to some but if it can help just one user it will have been worth writing please feel free to add your own ideas on the topic never use a user name password that you have ever used on the clearnet never use the same user name password on more than one site always try to write in a neutral language change identities from time to time and change your writing patterns at the same time if you change your identity don't disappear from the old one and appear with the new one but let both personae stay alive at the same time or take some deserved rest from the network if you change your setup it can be the right time to change your online identity avoid using windows for your darknet browsing it is insecure you can either create your own custom linux distribution with security in mind full disk encryption firewall to block non tor traffic hardened kernel tor process browser isolation if you feel like it or use whonix or tails if you decide to trust those who made these systems tails is good because it will leave no tracks on your computer whonix is good because it provides some kind of isolation remove your hard drive when using tails if you can if you use an hard drive blank if from time to time and start fresh again learn encryption gnupg is a great tool create your own or more key and use it as much as you can if you are a vendor a journalist in an oppressive country or a paranoid mind traveler you might want to work with encrypted material on another machine that stays offline that way the computer connected on the internet would only be used for encrypted material making it harder for an attacker to know the content of your encrypted documents in case your computer got compromised or had a backdoor try to leave as little tracks of your activity as possible on the machine s you use use an open wifi if you can to make it harder to get to you if tor was broken or you made an mistake in your opsec remember that using tor might get you flagged as suspicious individual even in democratic first world countries have fun be kind to others and remember if you're not ready to do the time don't do the crime stay safe.
looks like it time to make sure that you layer up as a normal tor connection may not be enough get a vpn running linux on any anonymous provider that accepts bitcoins it doesn t have to have huge resources all it needs to be able to do is handle ssh server and i have seen mb vps systems run a tunnel without problems after you get your vps login information all you need to do is set up your client computer to push all traffic through your vps this was a huge pain in the ass before finding sshuttle pulling it from git all you need to do is cd to the directory and run sudo sshuttle dns vvr username ipofvps enter the password for the vps and it s running you can open firefox and go to ipchicken com to check if it s working now you can run tor without your isp snooping you can either run tor browser or make another layer of protection by using whonix or making a tor middlebox configuration safe and remember if they want you they will come and take yo.
yes it is possible to run electrum through tor use the following network settings after clicking on the green or red circle in the bottom right corner auto connect off fill in one of the onion electrum servers such as tv ajsstuovkutzn onion or mashtk hmnysevfj onion or fdkhi zs dszif onion or drp pvejybx ejdr onion with port proxy socks localhost this should allow you to connect is it safe well that depends on how you use it remember you will automatically send a list of all the addresses in your electrum wallet to the electrum server you connect to this is how electrum knows the correct btc amount in each address since you don't store the blockchain yourself i would advise to regularly generate a new electrum wallet and certainly not connect your clean electrum bitcoin wallet via tor also try to install electrum in a hidden volume or use tails since your electrum wallets containing all used addresses and recent servers are saved in your electrum data folder you can improve general security or better obscurity by using a bitcoin mixer this will make the path of your bitcoins less obvious but again all depends on the service you use and how you make use of it.
well there may be more issues to it as well i'm just letting you know what i know would be a problem i'm not a security guru just a run of the mill sys admin i've not been staying abreast of the security side of things the way i should recently i'm sure there is someone in this forum who's more qualified to answer than i a.
a dos for ransom they are actually quite common from what i have seen also there are a variety of other explanations server maintenance taking longer than expected maybe security measure being implemented huge influx in traffic from the bitcoin flux coin in and coin out when a market gets taken down by le or is the result of an exit scam you will basically know immediately.
oh thanks for clearing that up thought i was going mad nice to see some of then old names from sr on her.
yea i went to vfemail net yesterday seems o k.
root on may pmi knew this would be happening over and over again if it s not greedy admins then it would be some other letter agency i think the next one to step out on us will be iddle arth the hobbits social network seems to be down for too long now and there were numerous complaints about people not being able to withdraw their funds also at the beginning of the month there was a hacker bragging that they were able to get their ip address and cause page crashing by insertion code in a post agorah seems to be pretty knocked out right now with their almost down time i think the admins do not want to steal the funds but they don t seem that interested in fixing the problem or allowing a separate url for vendors to work their orders and customers to withdraw their funds seperate vendor url is very bad idea this has been used in the past with combination of another exploit to track down vendors.
on may pmm ya and space to the rescue thanks for chipping in both of you have a cheeky so it would seem size matters but it depends how you use it as m ya said this is all highly circumstancial in my opinion and from my experience that means if you are just a person who is seeking materials for personal use any properly created pgp key is acceptable if you are the type of buyer i described really man all that matters is that you use pgp encryption of any complexity with your address and other highly sensitive info in simpler terms just having a pgp key makes you immeasurably more secure than someone who provides their name and address un encrypted peac.
thanks a million liquid everything is working now even decryption old version of kleopatra saved the day.
hi mate i'm not sure where your encryption is going wrong i have sent you an encrypted message when you get it copy paste it into your pgp app clipboard then press decrypt and type your password when prompted this should open the message i sent you and i included what i hope will be useful instructions for you hope it helps ps.
we have a lot tied up in escrow there at the moment as well but we are optimistic it doesn't feel like all the other exit scams before this sant.
wow good to know i ll make an account on alphabay right nowand for any trying to get in abraxasreferal.
thank you so much i was having this problem earlier and could not figure out how to fix it or find a better pgp client great job.
i have used helix a handful of times and never had any problems at all however after just checking their link a few minutes ago i saw that it is indeed down i'm not sure how long it has been or will be but from my previous experience with them they always got the job done adn within a reasonable timeframe.
bumpcheers s.
wilderness on june amnice thanks friends loving agora atm as for any other market place i dont use any off them aprt from agor.
zoxeebee on october pmget a machine which allows you to replace the bios with free software the new firmware may require disassembly and wiring up the flash chip directly the reward for the trouble is a laptop that runs free and open source software only for a very good solution in all reality i don t think this bios infector is going to hit allot of people in any way that s going to compromise our freedoms and if it didand i think allot of people would lose faith in our government if they knew that all of their private data was not really private then again many are sad sheep they would just tuck their heads down and let a small few tell them how to eat shit and like it as far as what we do it s on a mass scale that i think would only show that a very large body of the population enjoy and benefit from using certain drugs and any resistance to it is futile but it is good to be aware of this kind of malware and the rediculous level of spying that is going on and is getting more intrusive every day.
i will rate it better than ab because of the shadiness associated with alpha at the moment vendors getting locked out coins stolen the dealsvh seems neat in all aspects here is your invite vahalla link register qa.
uncleal on october pmthat's spooky fuck man and it's worse because i understand none of this i don't even know why tor works i just trust that it does ditto fwiw there's some decent info and tutorials for us less technical types regarding security privacy depth of le spying defense etc available from the electronic frontier foundation at eff or.
general security precautions when posting online learn from others' mistakesnext i want to talk about good practices when using tor tails and other hidden services first of all it is highly recommended that you use multiple identities online for different things perhaps if you are a buyer and a seller on silk road you may want to have separate logins for this and then possibly a third login for the forums then maybe you want to be part of another marketplace then you might want a fourth login well tails has another good program offered by tails is called keepassx when you have multiple logins it is hard to keep track of them all so it might be a better idea to keep them all in document that is encrypted with a strong password keepassx can help you with this you never want to use nicknames or locations or anything else that is related to yourself online when you post or create usernames and another thing you need to adopt are new ways of conducting yourself if you are generally a messy typer who makes the same grammar mistakes or the same spelling mistakes all the time this can be used to identify you always proof read anything you post publicly or privately because the feds will always find ways to correlate things to you with ross ulbricht they found an old post he posted on a forum when he first started silk road asking people if they had heard of a marketplace called silk road obviously this is an old trick used by people trying to spread awareness about a new project of theirs later he identified himself by saying he was looking for programmers and gave out his private email address on the same forum under the same name but if you always misspell the same words if you always use the same slang terms capitalize the same words use a certain amount of periods after an etc or always use the same number of then all of these things give them reasonable suspicion and it becomes easier to tie things to you once they have you under their radar like they had ross it only took a few slip ups and he was theirs remember you only have to make one mistake so talking about your local election is a really dumb idea get it think about the time you use your computer is it easy to correlate your timezone based on the time you go online or is it more random do you have patterns that are predictable always think about these things when you post online always think about what type of personality you are putting out there about your online name expect that every single word you type online is being read by the feds to them this is much easier than tracking drug lords on the streets they sit in an office and read forum posts and try and make connections don't underestimate the feds always treat everything as compromised always treat everybody as compromised and don't ever think anybody will ever go to jail for you if somebody can avoid years by ratting you out they will do it in a heart beat the perfect example is sabu from lulzsec after he was busted and facing years in jail they made him a deal to help them rat out his friends and he ended up getting many of his friends arrested even people who are your friends will turn their backs on you when it comes down to their freedom.
uncleal on october pm thanks for scaring me wabbit you are very welcome happy halloween pthe thing is if this bios infector is somehow being propogated through in software bundles that are common ms office itunesetc or even embedded in crypto programs or already put into the bios chips themselves by the hardware vendors then there is nothing you can do that means all your keystrokes all your passwords credit card info your most secret of secrets the things you dnever ever tell anyone basically anything and everything you do on your computer will be clandestinely collected and sent to fusion databases for analysis this does not mean that you specifically are being targeted what it means is that at any given point if you are to become of interest to them then a probe would be as easy as flipping a switch in your bios that starts the keylog and upload store process this would all happen at any time with no system slow down no pop ups nothing the only thing that would happen is swat or fbi suddenly kicking in your your hardware and detaining you until they find the evidence they want so they can make you into the evil criminal they had already set out to make you as.
bbkf on february pmthe upgraded kernel is the same flavor of linux used by redhat which works very closely with the us government does this mean that you're concerned about there being something unsafe in the software because the u s government works with redhat the beauty of open source software is that security experts can and do pore over the code to make sure that there are no security issues that means that nobody can easily insert malicious code into the program without it being detected.
i'll let you do the research but it's pretty much saying that tails crypto aint gonna protect your privacy ifyour whole system can or is already rooted at bios level assume that all current firmware and hardware is nsa backdoored that means you have to do all your crypto on a custom built board that is always offlineand only transfer already encrypted data to the networked machine aka have anair gap some of you including the admins of this site are security conscious what are your thoughts on this matter i have a thought perhaps ultimately transparency is key when all the closets are open and wecan see through eachother then we will see that we are all truly the same there is no bad guy or good guy there are humans and some humans make poor choices that adversely affect themselves and others through transparency we can better identify with one another and better facilitate positive change suppose that the nsa can read all of our messages suppose tmg and even the vendors themselves are all tied to the alphabet agencies suppose it is all a big hoot privacy encryption all a smokescreen and the entire deep web is a government sponsored experiment to monitor drug use patterns so that they might effect new policy or decide who deserves to get a slap on the wrist for being an 'irresponsible drug user' then what just a thought likely has been mulled over before youtu be wired com researchers uncover way hack bios undermine secure operating systems legbacore com research en wikipedia org wiki system management mod.
debian which tails is based on is not compatible with all wifi devices inside computers for example it is not compatible with some of the newer macbook models because it doesn t come with the right drivers you can do some searching to see if debian comes with a driver for the wifi device on your computer model if not it is possible to buy a usb connected wifi dongle compatible with debian it s also possible to install the missing driver to tails in some case but there are negative sides to doing that from what i ve heard.
hi all i've had a hell of a time with bugs in gpg win encrypting messages i ended up downloading an older version and it seems to be working but not sure because i can't encrypt messages to other people if someone could help me can you please leave your public key and ill use it to encrypt a message here and i'll paste the message back if you could go ahead and decrypt it and let me know if it didn't show up blank i would great appreciate it thank you in advance.
works fine for one to one transactions there is no confirmation delay for transactions involving many addresses like consolidation transactions you may need to pay or even the bitcoin qt client conveniently informs you of this.
dankbank on may pmgood guide to you i've always heard about tails but never knew really what it was until now i'll be doing this very soon thanksget on tails now seriously it's more secure and it wraps almost everything you need for darknet activities up in a neat lil os.
you need to enter your wifi password every time you start up tails unless you re using a persistent volume which remembers stuff like wifi passwords there should be a little network icon near the upper right corner of your screen which becomes a drop down menu when you click on it you should be able to just enter your password in there if you enter your wifi password correctly tor should be able to connect.
doseheavy on november pmyou should look at a modded version of aflao bitwasp it will save you a lot of time all you are doing by the vendor anonyminity is creating extra scripting to be hacked make sure you have it all locked down if not you will have to trust in people to refund its not just a payment code with a ledger created for an escrow account and then dropped in real addresses anonymous listings lead to a whole vacuum for scams are you logging the anonyminity to the vendor so when a scam occurs there is a way to locate the scammer yes their will be internal data logging disputes are still able to be made and messages sent to from vendors through the product page there will be a spot to ask questions no identiy from vendor will be shown unless question is answered this allows vendors the ability to conceal themselves should a user that's been suggested as le somehow gets in and hasn't yet been banned will still display vendor names the anonymity for the vendor buying would only be for the listings once a question is asked on the product the instant chat window if java enabled would still display the vendor you're communicating with if java isn't enabled you'd have the same typical html html screen as mem did also one vendor voted by all of the rest with the best reviews undecided will ultimately be given king status on the site giving them the ability to override small features and veto console votes that have been performed by the community they will be able to prioritize vendor inventory such as auto direct sales to vendor's stash instead of vendor's stash if vendor has an item that vendor has there will be a smart sense feature that dissalows similar items to be posted as a means to bypass this king admin will have ability to modify but this feature will be stricly difficult and will require much more approval from the vendor congress vendors on vacation mode will opt out and or auto vote not yet decided still working on the philsophy and bugs within the business logic aspect of the site but overall that's the general solution i'm thinking of essentially a darknet congress i don't have the full plan layed out yet which is why i'd like some feedback and i didn't mean to be nasty in my previous message dh i'm sorry if i came out that way at all i don't want to but i do this type of work fairly often so i'm extremely confident that i can architect a flawless system or atleast should a flaw be noted a solution would be implemented that would please everyone i have no interested in making anything off of the site either i just want lsd so no fee's for transactions or tax withdrawal crap that i've seen at other places but there might be a tax for funds that are transferred in and withdrawn without a purchase the system won't be intended to be a tumbler service so that type of activity will be looked down upon edit i have added donation abilities and details onto the original post if anyone would like to assist.
symetry on january pmquote from saint nic on january amwe will never again trust another market such as ab dhl ftw santai actually prefer markets as i find them much much more convenient than direct ordering and i am more than willing to pay the extra fee for such added convenience but it's so hard now to find a trustworthy market that also has masses of customers on it not sure if we were clear we will not trust a market like ab but from what we have seen of dhl we love it it will soon be an invite only market once it has had a certain amount of sign ups so join quickly sant.
pinto on november pmquote from chess on november pmquote from pinto on november ami have a paxful account and a wallet that i have downloaded i buy bitcoins with cash deposits at bofa you dont even need an account at bofa you just need cash and tell the teller you need to make a cash deposit to an account fill out the slip with information provided to you by the seller on paxful and there you go btc within minutes after you deposit i looked into it should i use tor with this website i might use an american express gift card something disposable from the dollar store you don't have to use tor with it just dont use that as your main wallet have a wallet that you downloaded or a wallet like blockchain that you can send the btc to right after you receive them you can pay with cards it just gets kind of expensive when you do that one more noob question i'm using tails mainly should i have that wallet downloaded on tails my normal os or should i just use an online one and i noticed it does get very expensive but for now since i'm a big noob to all of this i feel like paxful with prepaid is the easiest for me.
nice work their doseheavy always wanted to know how to do this multisign thing do you have any idea whats does tmg has a master public key or any info of any markets master public keys.
dardush on may amthanks sillywabbit do you have by any chance an invite code i did not need one did they close regs.
alberthoffman on march pminternal mixer what im intressted in acid from what country you send when you send your coins to agora they mix with other coins that other users deposited so it might look like people withdrew your coins on blockchain it's just agora mixing your coins i send from the united states.
here's the statement given by one of the mods on dhl today is it true what is being said yes it is true attackers did move btc into one and successfully withdrew about btc before it was halted but continue reading the btc was their own lol the attacker deposited their own coins in increments to our deposit wallet while trying to confuse the order system with order spam but with bip everything is tied to the blockchain there is no internal accounting system to confuse afterwards they withdrew about again of their own btc before we cut it off thanks for the btc we are able to prove this at any time if a high standing and trusted member of the community would like to audit we can do this through simply passing our market xpub but we don't do that in a public medium since we take our users' transaction privacy seriously forum was restored from a backup instead of scripting a clean up a few posts and messages might have been lost but should be below please double check each and every attack just keeps us on our toes and has actually pushed us quicker into ending beta we were going to do security bounties and tests ourselves but whosoever is paying the attackers is covering those costs for us any other claims in regards to stealing dhl coins are completely false although somewhat amusing what people come up as already stated the only thing this attacker has done of any really annoyance is spam our forums which we'll be adding more anti spam measures for shortly so again funds will always be safe from theft or seizure but of course if it is your own coins i can't exactly go against you withdrawing them lol for the moment while security is put in vendors will not be able to process orders but this will be fixed within a couple of hours full market functionality should be restored and all other measures in place within hours at least the btc will be going to a charity that we'll maybe create a poll on which our users can make.
on multisig haha xd it seems a bit complicated to me as well though but i want to be free from sending coins on market excrow mind you i dont order often just once in a while but that tends to be a medium large sized orde.
so test kits would not be an approved item since it is not listed am i reading that correctly.
reportedly the prosecution in the sr trial exempted every potential juror who had internet and at the end they had to take a yo it guy a yo woman and people over with no technological background p anyway one of the major reasons not to have charges lead to rediculous sentences is that when facing life in prison only an idiot would accept a life sentence in the us federal system as a plea what ross did was intentionally lose a trial that was unwinnable in hope that his defense will be able to get the verdict possibly thrown out or sentence reduced if you are already fucked might as well go to trial and get it out of the way good luck ross.
knucklesfromsr on february pmthis trial should of been extremely highly publicized from everything that i read this makes it so that website owners can be held responsible for what their users do and yea the whole thing was rigged a mess apparently from what his family was saying they denied a lot of evidence from the defense from even being presented i wouldn't be surprised if the whole thing was rigged i think they're trying to make an example of ross and disuade from anyone following in his footsteps.
it's possible to use tails with a vpn but it's not really necessary unless you are administering a darknet market or hacking nsa servers you will be quite safe even with the standard tails installation that doesn't support vpns but it's possible to install a vpn on a router and then configure tails to route everything through this router you'll find plenty of good openvpn providers eg airvpn org but you'll have to pay a monthly fee for this service preferably using bitcoin then you'll have to choose whether you want to run tor over vpn or vpn over tor but unless you know well what you are doing it's probably better to just use tails without any vpn.
i have used helix a handful of times and never had any problems at all however after just checking their link a few minutes ago i saw that it is indeed down i m not sure how long it has been or will be but from my previous experience with them they always got the job done adn within a reasonable timeframe.
use whonix so much better then tailstails is really a stripped down linux command prompt above which an ugly gui has been is super you just need to get the installation sorted and you re good to go explore the o.
what makes you certain it's an exit scam i serioulsy hope not our i just lost a huge amount of money as i'm sure did everyone else including yourself but you seem certain it's officially an exit scam.
hey man do you use tails if so then when you're creating the public pgp key that you're going to use for your grams account make sure to click the advanced options in the box where you type in your full name email address etc and turn your bits up to that worked for me other than that i don't know although this will require you to use a different key for your new grams account i think it's the only way lepp.
so i friend recently turned me on to bridges and leveled my opsec up but i'm still having some issues he gave me bridges he personally uses and said they were all solid however when i put them in and the connectiing to tor thing comes up it just gets stuck there i don't know if this just takes longer than i expected but i waited a good min and it never connected the progress bar started but stayed frozen in one place any help would be greatly appreciated.
just click on the certificate in your pgp generator right click extract certificate perhaps try copy and pasting the page you're trying to reach.
saint nic on january amnot sure if we were clear we will not trust a market like ab but from what we have seen of dhl we love it it will soon be an invite only market once it has had a certain amount of sign ups so join quicklysantai like dhl too and i m getting a nice stream of orders on it but they do not have the customer base that ab does i wish ab would pull their exit scam soon so that either dhl or dream can be the market.
well in my case it had nothing to do with agora deposits it was because me marketplace had locked my funds preventing withdrawl because i broke a rule by withdrawing my funds without making a purchase although they were very quick in releasing them once i'd explained the situation but it makes me wary of depositing btc there again.

thanks for the info it seems pretty sketchy glad everything worked out for you.
have you looked into dotcom you can buy up to a day with cash and your bitcoin is available immediately you only need a cell phone number to sign up if anonymity is a priority you could buy a cheap burner phone for the signup i understand that moneygram asks for your phone number and address but you can probably give ficticious information apparently some moneygram places ask for id and some don't if you buy anonymously with either service you would be safe right.
put everything on the usb or break then up on a few of them i would even put tor on it make sure you use a good size one tor take up room this way nothing is on your harddrive when our done pull your stick cclean your computer.

i had actually hoped to remove only incriminating data from from my windows without using dban anybody know of a way to do this i suppose i may have to restort to just encrypting my hard drive anybody know the best way to do this with windows i've heard a lot about truecrypt unfortunately it does not work with windows as for the blockchain question i've seen comments from people who use blockchain through tor but in order to due this scripts must be enabled so i wondered how people were comfortable doing this the same goes for reddit scripts must be enabled to post how are people comfortable doing this.
we wouldn't trust this market with our btc if you do make an order please let everyone know via this thread sant.
that exe didn't do anything i ran it over and over again and couldn't get my windows machine to run it it just went to a black screen for a few minutes and that was it is it odd that my cc and btc wallet are completely drained in the real though i am not a fan of ab i have said for a bit that i think they are a scam.
cerver on february pmquote from oldisgold on february pmwhat s the best and most trustworthy btc mixer out there right now blond wigfog i would say that bitcoinfog is the best blockchain info privides shared send and i believe it s also quite good if you re really paranoid you can chain them like you btc fog you shared send you but it s also more expensive i also think that bitcoinfog requires a minimum deposit of btc which isn t that much if you re placing a big order but should be kept in mind nonetheless.
landojack on april pmto add on to tt's post one can also purchase through local bitcoins with cash via online methods look for listings that offer cash deposit at certain bank branches these require you to go to the bank branch of choice and fill out an out of state deposit slip you fill this form out and give the cash to the teller and they deposit it into the account of the btc seller your btc's are then released to you you don't even have to be a member of the bank bank of america has always been very fast and hassle free also with this method you usually aren't charged a ridiculous price for your cryptocurrency just remember to tumble your coins to an intermediate wallet before using them to purchase from a vendor blockchain info accessed through tor allows for the quick creation of a wallet that can be used to tumble the coins you're right this is the easiest way as long as it's it's been so long since i have needed to buy btc i had forgotten the best ways to do it the only caveat is you are def putting your face on camera and one that will be a little better quality and longer kept records than a cvs or.
is a linux based operating system built for anonymity if you can mount an iso image copy of a dvd cd to a dvd or usb drive use tails it's more secure and it has everything you need built right in.
thank you for understanding and replying scidmt this was more of a venting location i was so stressed irl and could not speak to anyone about it i almost wish there was a dnm therapist for times like this some people just need to talk it out however it's hard to open up to people in the real world abou this type of thing agora fixed the deposit and i'm speaking with my vendors to get my orders out now agora came through like they always do but this is the reason why majority of business should be done off market i think marketplaces are a good spot for buyers to find vendors however there should be no reliance on a third party agora ie site administrators to fix and or overlook transactions last time i go through website marketplace i trust agora and they came through for me but in real life i was a mess for days straight just on the hook of if i own my money anymore or not.
i have had many successful transactions there the admins take a different approach towards problems but it all works well.
hey there jw if you got my order on me from friday i pm'd you.
thanks katamangood one buy a laptop and use only for dn tails java will be start don t really understand using in v m if is for extra layer of opsec or just to save staffi will never ever let any third part to encrypt for me what do you think about crack wifi and browse dn must be even more safe thank yo.
pretzel on january pmto create a persistent volume you must boot from cd dvd or usb after that even if you booted from a usb drive you have to create a new usb drive by using the tails installer and install by cloning this new usb drive will allow you to configure a persistent volume is it possible to find this guide in youtube.
pretty sure agora is number one i'm sure every one of these sites is crawling with cops working very hard to find anything i'm sure the fbi geeks have the biggest case of blue balls and the women with a nasty yeast infection trying to find the server if they only knewits in the alamo.
hacking don't know dood pgp messages you need to know this download pgp get your keys read up on it maybe another member has a link to a quick tutorial but you need to learn how to encrypt your messages especially when your sending your address for orders.

you just made a thread in the best market you're already there here as far as psychedelics everything you could want is here and in my opinion psychedelics are the only 'drugs' worth pursuin.

doseheavy on september pmhacks crack is vj is dnmthief he is currently working with le and at the same time extorting markets this is why he is given access to cashing out his coin have none of you looked at how the timings of the hacks coincide with when the power is on in the thai islands bravo this may be the most interesting thing you've posted so far i agree the guy is a pro storyteller not a proper hacker but like he says a social engineer of sorts the thing about vj is that he was the architect of the whole dpr multiple identity thing since ross was more of an introvert and needed plausible deniability if you ask me vj probably gave tarbell the server location his stories sound like complete and utter bullshit the guy has borderline pd and bipolar mania occam's razor simplest is best answer combined with the fact that it takes longer to lie than to make a true statement and this guy is giving his back stories back stories whenever i ask someone something and they tell me well you have to understand it was hot that day and i forgot my sunscreen i know its nonsense there's multiple players here and he is a few others are out there dhl is solid.
has anyone ordered from this guy here is his page on agora wares consist of stashes containers scales and bags for a reseller which is what i am in need since i do that frequently can anyone vouch for this guy thanks.

uncleal on february amquote from sillywabbit on february pmvery likely although from the rise of other markets the fact that evo and agora are still up and the further development of p p networks like bitmessage etci doubt they can do much to stop it deter yes but those who are top notch in their opsec and know how to make robust websites the only shot they have is to get in on the inside like they did agree the cats already out of the bag and le knows it and that's percisely the reason why le turns to scare tactics because they know they can't do anything about it legally at least but more and more bills keep being brought up that would allow le and the nsa to infringe on our rights even more and this also needs to be addressed and stopped yep like who knows how about just warrantless opening of people's mail how about cameras installed in peoples' homes bathrooms floors in your body i think these leo will either continue on or maybe their policies will become some extravagant and rediculous that they will see the absurdity in it all especially when it is obvious none of it is bettering society in fact it will all just lead to greater discontent more acts of violence and revolt look at alcohol prohibition they need to just stop but i see the next step will be some kind of usps control system maybe a change in our internet laws but whatever we are in the digital age hackers rule and it cant be stopped freedom fighters will find a way around anything one thing i've wondered lately is there a noticeble surge in mail and even so it's just more of the same thing but im sure their is profiling and thats why vendors gotta switch it up allot make packs look plain and unassuming i jst dunno how vendors can just drop s of packs a week and not be suspect oh and maybe blue boxes will get replaced by control centers that are monitored with scanners that have cameras too it could get that craz.
wow all this operation just to capture one guy they're really desperate.
i was lucky enough to get in order in and fe processes by gammagoblin just days before bb went down hopefully gg got his money out in time.
pharmville on november ami tried to do the link abraxas profile and it states user not listed is there another way that i can verify to start vending or would i need to pay the thanks in advance please try contacting admin via the site or forum sorry for the inconvenience.
update by cloning via usb don't let it download update when i let the client download and update from to it did not complete only got to and failed so many times that i lost everything i don't want you to feel the pain of losing your persistent volume it is quite a task to rebuild relationships with vendors.

was wondering if these forums delete opened messages after a certain time or periodically i think that would be cool and it would help protect people who foolishly leave their inbox filled i try and delete msgs after reading but was just wondering if this site did this.
alphabay's going through a major phishing outbreak lots of folks have been losing their btc stolen just beware or avoid till the security issues are resolved s.
i'm a lurker not a buyer but if i was one i'd check both to verify gpg keys both sites are great ressources i'd trust amvd more even if it's not updated.

burning tails on a cd rather than a usb where you're not using persistance at least as i understand it will prevent or reduce the possibility of certain exploits.

scidmt on october pmmaybe we could throw vendors personal sites up there as well i've got one i know albion does and gamma scigreat idea anyone who wants there market added please post in the threa.
as many probably already ready a major tor security advisory came out earlier today likely related to the recent aborted black hat tor talk a new tor version is being released to plug the known hole but hidden service hosts especially need to take note version from january until th of july someone running tor servers had about a chance of seeing what onion domain anyone was visiting but not the specific url or content and had a chance of discovering the real ips for servers hosting hidden services this is the scariest bit hopefully was just security researches but still to be determined if it was nsa hopefully dns is changing servers isps ips immediately sad thing is either way the nsa being able to record all internet traffic poses a serious threat to our anonimity i consider this to be like in the movie inception when the extras in the dream started attacking the dreamers it's all good will see weed legalized and eveyrthing else even if we have to eat entire sheet.
so first house says this and now you i've never used that subreddit but i see it as nothing but a bad thing honeypot or not it brings people who should not be part of this here thing into it it's nothing but a bad thing.
banksyshepard on may pmsb is the best vendor i have ever dealt with period he has gone the extra mile for me and i have a strong sense of loyalty to him his agora profile says to find him here if agora goes down with all the agora downtime i dont know if he has made that jump yet i know he lost alot on evo and is probably hesitant to go to a new market is he here yet is there any other market he is on any help is greatly appreciated cheersi haven't seen him around here.

sillywabbit on may pmquote from dardush on may amthanks sillywabbit do you have by any chance an invite code i did not need one did they close regs ye.
root on may pmi knew this would be happening over and over again if it's not greedy admins then it would be some other letter agency i think the next one to step out on us will be iddle arth the hobbits social network seems to be down for too long now and there were numerous complaints about people not being able to withdraw their funds also at the beginning of the month there was a hacker bragging that they were able to get their ip address and cause page crashing by insertion code in a post agorah seems to be pretty knocked out right now with their almost down time i think the admins do not want to steal the funds but they don't seem that interested in fixing the problem or allowing a separate url for vendors to work their orders and customers to withdraw their funds seperate vendor url is very bad idea this has been used in the past with combination of another exploit to track down vendors.
considering that le and the state are nothing more than gangs of armed robbers i don t think you ll find any place in the world that is not plagued by violence theft and mindless coercion there are places in mexico afghanistan africa etc where the official government has little to no control but you ll find there are many other smaller groups there that will try to impose their laws on you and many of these groups will be driven not only by greed but also by political or religious fanaticism and nothing is worse than a gang of armed robbers who believe that they are somehow creating paradise on earth.
i'm in the process of doing something on alpha bay seems fine using same vendor as on other sites logs in regularly their search interface is kinda weird fucked but i'm not going back to nucleus for a while they fucked up bad when that hack happened alpha bay is my backup market because i'm still wary of agora its fine but too big for me i just made an account on dhl very impressed although it's mostly foreign bulk oh well update alphabay does seem legit i think it is run by russians there and are many russian speaking people on the site and we love russians keep snowden safe also don't try ordering from a mobile tablet because the order button doesn't work on firefox only on tbb it will just refresh and bug the crap out of you otherwise it is pretty good alerts tell you from the home screen when your order processes ships etc.
seems like a pretty bad time to be depositing coin to agora even when they come online for hours and it seems issues have been solved it seems like a big tease everyone who can't wait to get back on and get shit done and hasn't been scared off yet is like hope it stays up oh what's that it's staying up seemingly oh wait nevermind fuck fuck fuck fuck at this point i think it would be ambitious to get too comfortable even if it goes consecutive days with uptime oh and i'm not mocking the op i've fallen into the semi comfort of a little bit of responsive uptime a bit too easily too.
hi all i am searching for a new market to use stumbled upon the east india company marketplace apparantly it is an eu centric market anyone have any experience or stories about this market thanks.
yep fuck ab i'm starting to calm down and just reserve myself to a k loss in the meantime i'm hoping for dhl approval.
it means either there was a remaining balance left unpaid by the sender or he didn t pay for the postage at all maybe your sender dropped the package into a dropbox forgetting to put the postage stamp on it i ve done that before but i realized immediately and had them send someone out to open the box so i could affix the stamp you should be fine they won t make you sign for it unless of course it required a signature anyway just for unpaid postage so there s nothing that could validate a search and seizure warrant if you re concerned at all though just make sure you clean house before he gets back.
astraltraveler on june amokey thanks i see folks writing about that u should use adresses and mixers to make it most unknown do you guys have any advice where i can get an email adress that is safe.
first off cirrus wasn't jared only after they took over the cirrus account second ross is going to jail i'm actually very surprised in his defense now admitting that he created sr then left and then was brought back by unknown people to work support it sounds pretty farfetched to me.
i am not sure if it is clever to use tor for your coinbase account i assume you want to buy bitcoin via a bank transfer in that case your real identity will be linked to your coinbase account anyway so no reason to use tor buy the coins using your clearnet browser then transfer them to a wallet not linkable to you you create and access this wallet only through tor and from there to the market vendor you want to buy from you can also configure tor browser to pick exit nodes from a specific country see good way to anonymously get bitcoin besides coinbase is localbitcoins com it allows you to buy bitcoins in person or via cash deposit or bank transfer directly from other people.

vividsky on december pmwow this pgp stuff is complex how do you generate a pgp key what is the easiest wayi found that learning how to encypt messages using pgp was somewhat difficult as well but you will get it if you forge forward persistence is key there are many youtube videos that explain pgp gpg depending on the operating system you are using there will be some for generating a pgp key as well my experience is that it is way hard in the beginning but gets easier the more i use it and become familiar with it just keep being persistent with it and you will get it eventually it may come easier to some than others but you will get it.
chances are it will be okay but i understand it is a horrible feeling to think that someone has personal info on you and you don t know what s going to happen its that period of waiting for the letter that can be so stressful the biggest thing really is to get a drop address that isn t connected with you and so can never link your address with your internet activity live and learn hope everything turns out okay.
mps on june amis it not possible for a vendor with no feedback to in fact be le of course it is it is also very possible that a vendor with lots of feedback is le if this possibility has only just occurred to you and you don't have a clear and satisfactory answer maybe it's a sign you're not ready to be playing around with it yet.
debian which tails is based on is not compatible with all wifi devices inside computers for example it is not compatible with some of the newer macbook models because it doesn't come with the right drivers you can do some searching to see if debian comes with a driver for the wifi device on your computer model if not it is possible to buy a usb connected wifi dongle compatible with debian it's also possible to install the missing driver to tails in some case but there are negative sides to doing that from what i've heard.
short and simplified answer because it is not end to end encrypted when somebody catches your traffic everyone hosting an exit node can catch that le hosts some exit nodes for that purpose you are fucked you just gave away your address and time of arrival pm me if you want me to link you to some good safety stuff i would strongly advise you to do so.
i'm actively avoiding the markets the only advantage markets have is escrow buying from a vendor directly here is like having to fe on the markets but you avoid having to send money to the market where you are susceptible to being phished or having the admins either take your cash directly or in an exit scam every day people are claiming that their money is being stolen on ab i think it's easier here to establish trust with a vendor and not to have to worry about a market being shut down and having your btc lost and having your orders in limbo if a vendor starts scamming here it's evident pretty quickly and people will just stop sending them their money long live tmg.
it happened again here it is in full mon jun potentially dangerous connection one of your applications established a connection through tor to using a protocol that may leak information about your destination please ensure you configure your applications to use only socks a or socks with remote hostname resolution whats up doc.
bonobo on february pmquote from dardush on february amis it just me or does this market looks exactly like evo the evo code is an open source code many markets copy that code today check out real deal market it even looks exactly like evo i mean they didnt even bother to slightly modify the colors and layout well i m getting creepy flashbacks heh.
on two occasions when loggin into tmg i got this one of your applications established a connection through tor to using a protocol that may leak information about your destination my setup is as tight as can be and i never got that warning before on any site never years using tor never saw that before any advice please thank you.
introduction to secure communication tor sslgreetings comrades through my research i have put together some security measures that should be considered by everyone the reason i put this together is mainly for the newbies of this forum but if i can help anyone out then i am grateful for this i would like to start out by saying if you are reading like you are likely a silk road user if this is the case then the thing you must be using to even access this form is tor tor will provide you with a degree of anonymity by using an bit aes advanced encryption standard there has been some debate as to whether or not the nsa can crack this code and the answer is likely yes this is why you should never send anything over tor that you aren't comfortable sharing with the entire world unless you are using some sort of pgp encryption which we will talk about later communication from your computer to the internet relies on an entry node which basically enters your computer into the tor network this entry node communicates with your computer this entry node knows your ip address the entry node then passes your encrypted request onto the relay node the relay node communicates with the entry node and the exit node but does not know your computer's ip address the exit node is where your request is decrypted and sent to the internet the exit node does not know your computer's ip only the ip of the relay node using this model of nodes it makes it harder but not impossible to correlate your request to your original ip address the problem comes obviously when you are entering plain text into tor because anybody can set up an exit node the fbi can set up an exit node the nsa or any other foreign government or any malicious person who may want to steal your information you should not be entering any sensitive data into any websites especially when accessing them over tor if any of the nodes in the chain are compromised and some likely are and the people in charge of those compromised nodes have the computing power to decrypt your request then you better hope it wasn't anything sensitive so what can we do to fix this well luckily we are now having more and more servers that are offering something called hidden services you can easily recognize these services by the address onion these services offer what's called end to end encryption what this does is take the power out of the compromised exit nodes and put them back in your hands the web server of the hidden service now becomes your exit node which means the website you are visiting is the one decrypting your message not some random exit node ran by a potential attacker remember the exit node has the key to decrypt your request the exit node can see what you are sending in clear text once they decrypt it so if you are entering your name and address into a field the exit node has your information if you are putting a credit card a bank account your real name even your login information then you are compromising your identity another step you can take is to only visit websites that use something called http secure you can tell if the website you are visiting is using http secure by the prefix at the beginning of the address if you see then your website is using http secure what this does is encrypts your requests so that only the server can decrypt them and not somebody eavesdropping on your communication such as a compromised tor exit node this is another form of end to end encryption if somebody were to intercept your request over http secure they would see encrypted data and would have to work to decrypt it another reason you want to use whenever possible is that malicious tor nodes can damage or alter the contents passing through them in an insecure fashion and inject malware into the connection this is particularly easier when you are sending requests in plain text but reduces this possibility you must be made aware however that can also be currently cracked depending on the level of the key used to encrypt it when you visit a website using you are encrypting your request using their public key and they are decrypting it using their private key this is how cryptography works a public key is provided to those who want to send an encrypted message and the only one who can decrypt is the one with the private key unfortunately many websites today are still using private keys that are only bits long which in today's world are no longer enough so you need to make sure you find out which level of encryption the website you are visiting uses to make sure they are using at a minimum if not bits even doing all of this unfortunately is not enough because we have another problem what happens if the web server itself has become compromised maybe your tor nodes are clean maybe you have used for all your requests but the web server itself of the website you are visiting has been compromised well then all your requests are again as good as plain text with that being said this will conclude the first post in this series of the steps we can take to protect our privacy online to remain anonymous and maintain our freedom.
i like middle earth the user interface is very friendly and intuitive the design is delicate with pleasant colors it seems that someone really made an effort making this website comfortable for vendors and buyers i think that should be appreciated.
welcome albert glad to see you around these parts.
thanks for the link yes i saw the section i've never placed an direct order before so its still kinda sinking it no more going to markets and waiting for deposits and gettin' scamme.
i put the link to the blog on tor about the problem using ssl on a hidden service is stupid and unnecessary as tor makes it a connection by default the problem is from my understanding that openssl is used to generate the private key or how it hands the private key to the primary relay node but if you were using a server that had openssl pre or generated your key using openssl pre then you were unsafe for the hack to work the server would have had to directly connect to a node that was compromised an attacker the chances of that happening with the little time the bug was out meant that all of our servers were not identified but the locations were changed just to be safe and new url s were generated with proper openssl.
yes i'm keeping that.
love is all around us on april pmwhat's the deal with agora was in the middle of a transaction and had the site stop responding according to the subreddit they are moving server locations apparently they do this a lot possibly for security reasons.
hmm never heard of it is it a active market or forum.
scidmt on april pmdoes anyone know how i would go about creating a site like ootp's something simple i would be interested in doing this but don't really know where to start scidmtmaybe ootp can help you with that question via pm vendor to vendo.
i don't trust anymarket now that evo exited like they did prob agora gets my vote but i'm always quick in and quick out.
tails stands for the amnesiac incognito live system tails is a live system that aims at preserving your privacy and anonymity it helps you to use the internet anonymously almost anywhere you go and on any computer but leave no trace using unless you ask it explicitly it is a complete operating system designed to be used from a dvd or a usb stick independently of the computer s original operating system it is free software and based on debian gnu linux tails comes with several built in applications pre configured with security in mind web browser instant messaging client email client office suite image and sound editor etc tails relies on the tor anonymity network to protect your privacy online the pre installed software is configured to connect through tor and direct non anonymous connections are blocked tails is being constantly updated for security flaws you will need to do this all over again soon to stay safe this comes from the tails website it s very important to keep your version of tails up to date otherwise your system will be vulnerable to numerous security holes the development team is doing its best to release new versions fixing known security holes on a regular basis you will need x gb usb thumb drives gb may pass they are very cheap and available almost everywhere download the latest version of the tails iso file from here remember where you save it if you are an advanced user you can download the cryptographic signature on this same page and then verify the download with the tails key from here download the latest version of the linux universal usb installer from here run the newly downloaded universal usb installer a read and agree to the disclaimer b select tails from the first drop down list it s towards the end of the list step c browse to and select the tails iso file step d select your usb drive letter format the drive if its not empty already step e click create button then wait for it to finish will be a few minutes at least restart the computer and boot into tails from the usb drive see below for details on booting from a usb drive booting from a usb drive if it does not automatically boot to the usb drive you need to select the boot order some newer computers will allow you to select which drive to boot to with a small menu without changing bios settings you might instead need to edit the bios settings restart your computer and watch for a message telling you which key to press to enter the bios setup it will usually be one of f f del esc or f press this key while your computer is booting to edit your bios settings you need to edit the boot order depending on your computer you should see an entry for removable drive or usb media move this to the top of the list to force the computer to attempt to boot from usb before booting from the hard disk save your changes and continue many flash drives ship usb fdd formatted and some systems will not detect or even boot usb fdd most systems can however boot usb zip and or usb hdd if you are having a hard time getting your bios to detect your flash drive you can try to format it as usb hdd or usb zip using the bootice program or similar caution this is a very advanced program use with caution follow links for the latest version more detailed instruction on how to boot from usb you can read you have problems accessing the bios read this other questions ask away or pm i will not accept donations for this tutorial i offer this only in hope that more people will start using tor if you have excess bitcoins you feel like donating to a worthy cause please send them to tor or tails up installing a persistent volume alongside a liveusb copy of tails this is why you need two usb drives you should now be presented with a log in prompt for a temporary session administration password this is reset every time you load tails it is optional to enter this it is used to allow current session access to system functions if you get any errors about access rights try using an admin password at log in also at this point you can optionally select to use a windows xp camo skin to make tails look more like xp if you re in a public place for example this is also optional once tails is up and running insert the second usb drive click the applications accessories menu then highlight tails then click tails usb installer a click the st option clone install b select your target device from the drop down menu your second usb drive c click next then wait for it to finish however long to copy about gb to a usb drive usually a few minutes this will install a new copy of tails onto your second usb drive this will be your new proper tails usb shutdown this session of tails with the power button up in the right hand corner don t forget to take out the first usb you created and boot into the new second tails usb you can format the first usb drive later on that copy of tails is no longer required log in to the new tails usb once logged in click the applications menu then highlight the system tools sub menu then click on configure persistent volume the size of the persistent volume is automatically determined by how much left over space is on the usb drive after installing tails in the previous steps a choose your pass phrase for the persistent volume you will need to enter this every time you login to tails the persistent volume is an encrypted partition protected by a pass phrase once the persistent volume is created you can choose to activate it or not each time you start tails it is a good place to store sensitive materials when choosing your pass phrase remember that short easily guessed pass phrases are very easily cracked it would take one intel i k cpu over years to brute force crack an aes encrypted random character pass phrase using lowercase uppercase p c characters b click create and wait for it to finish c on completion a window will popup allowing you to select what tails will save in the new persistent volume automatically internet shortcuts pgp keys nudie pictures application settings etc i recommend selecting everything close and reboot with your modem plugged in and switched on log back into tails with your new persistent volume make sure your modem is plugged in and turned on click the system menu then highlight the preferences submenu then click on network connections now only you know what type of internet connection you pay for i cannot help you with that my personal internet connection was amazingly simple to setup i was quite surprised by its pre configured setups it has many different countries options for local telcos pre installed another note tails is pre configured to go through tor it is pre installed with vidalia and a torified browser called iceweasel it should automatically open up when connected to the internet if not use the iceweasel browser menu shortcut to get onto the road also this operating system is not persistent for security measures meaning that any changes you make that are not saved in the persistent volume will not be saved on restarting tails you are now finished feel free to click through all the menus and play with the applications.
hey everyone i am trying to learn to navigate through tails i know that i must go to the 'applications' drop down at the top of the window select 'tails' then select 'configure persistent volume' but what to i do in order to keep my pgp keys and text files and anything else should i just select everything when i am configring the persistent volume any helpful input is greatly appreciated update i figured it out i'm not sure why it wasnt allowing me to create a persistent volume besides the following possibilities i was using another usb drive a lexar gb and maybe for some reason there is a bug in that type of drive i think there were more reasons but they have slipped my mind long day at school beer i'll update if i remember all the best.
pretzel on january pmto create a persistent volume you must boot from cd dvd or usb after that even if you booted from a usb drive you have to create a new usb drive by using the tails installer and install by cloning this new usb drive will allow you to configure a persistent volume yeah then that makes sense i was trying to create a persistent volume with the original usb drive thanks.
so im having some trouble im re establishing my buisness both on agora and tmg after i hit a rough patch i do not wish to discuss you may read about it in my other thread if you wish im starting out with a new email lelantos i've decided that slacking on email security is not going to cut it anymore i also was having trouble getting my dymo labelwriter to print through tails if someone can walk me through this that would be s.
thanks for the link yes i saw the section i ve never placed an direct order before so its still kinda sinking it no more going to markets and waiting for deposits and gettin scamme.
thanks for the encouraging words i am definitely a very low target as in the single dose was my third order ever a strip was my largest and i cannot imagine le communicating across borders and wasting thousands of dollars on me especially since they know it is impossible for me to give them any info that they do not already have also apparently only people from my country have ever been caught using dnms most of them vendors who were sloppy irl this has been a good learning experience though again thanks for the encouragement i am very grateful for having found this community.
rasputin on july pmi was under the impression that blackbank had folded and was unable to access their site when i tried a few weeks ago is it still going then could anyone provide me with a link if this is the case i think its gone mate no more blackbank.
has disabled account creation so people would use create other xmpp servers tbh i think it would be easier to use crypto cat the only difference is that you need to check the other person's identity manually this could easily be done with pgp.
we've been signed up here for a while but have not yet become vendors over there as we need to look into the bip keys etc hoping to join soon sant.
the article the haarlem court today extended the remand of three men on trial for large scale drug trafficking through illegal online marketplaces and money laundering one of the men years until his arrest in december probably one of the greatest dutch sellers vendors of narcotics at international underground market places he was known as 'holland online' on several anonymous marketplaces such as silk road silk road and agora in his home in amsterdam following his arrest over a kilo of mdma more than kilos of ecstasy pills and more than euros in cash and bitcoins seized the trader was arrested following a drug transaction in which a policeman was accidental witness in his car were also found ecstasy pills mdma and lsd sheets maina man of years from utrecht was among others active in the underground marketplace evolution where he was known by more than successful transactions as one of the biggest drug vendors of this market in his house were confiscated expensive goods cash and bitcoins he used the account 'albert heijn' the third suspect a man of years acted as a supplier to various vendors and approached this through the market place under the account amsterdam united the three defendants were possible only a few years in the drug trade through online marketplaces but played it ready to build a good reputation in a short time and so much income in bitcoins more than one million sales in euros generating international cooperationnot only the dutch police did criminal investigation into this new form of drug trafficking two weeks ago was convicted in the united states the accused ross ulbricht to manage the online marketplace silk road and sentenced to life imprisonment the united states is also a dutch man who was known on silk road as super trips' sentenced to imprisonment for years the dutch police and justice work closely with law enforcement agencies in other countries eurojust and europol to identify online vendors operating in the hidden market place the studies are part of this international cooperation to combat illegal trade on the internet hidden darkweb and the action onymous where hundreds of underground market places off the air are met the next hearing in the trial on september st.
on may pmi hope this isn't a silly question but is there an alternate url for ag i know a few other markets have given out alternate addresses since initially going down this last time i've only been able to log onto ag once since then and am not sure if i overlooked it or what i don't think there is according to lenged there used to be a link that only vendors could access but there definitely isn't one now.
not sure what you mean what is lbc cash is that buying on lbc with cash you can send it to another wallet in lbc just make a new account and then send it from new lbc account wallet to another wallet not liked to your ip and from there to market will save you the mixing fees.
hey all made my first purchase on abraxas and i also fe d only because i have known the vendor for years everything was fine only thing i didnt like was the deposits have to confirm times before your acc is credited with btc cheers dolmi.
agora is notorious for having delayed withdraw deposits grant it they always pull threw but it s been at an all time high lately not to mention there is a btc stress test going on until the morning.
astraltraveler on june amokey thanks i see folks writing about that u should use adresses and mixers to make it most unknown do you guys have any advice where i can get an email adress that is safe for the mixer you'll need several bitcoin addresses and no email address but when you need an email address sigaint seems to be a good choice gpg encrypt everything though i'd recommend using tails on a second hand laptop you buy for cheap locally and you remove hdd you can start using it on your own computer also it would be better than using only the tor browser bundle it comes with electrum that goes through tor create a new wallet and note your seed few random words somewhere secret where you'll be able to find again in the future on next boots you'll be able to get back to your wallet again using this seed in electrum you'll see there are addresses where you can receive founds give to of them each time you want to send money to the mixer of your choice if you use only one address be it your own tor wallet agora a seller it's pretty easy for anyone looking on the blockchain to see that there is btc in and btc minus fee if you use helix for example out from another address and even if you have plausible deniability you'd be better using more than one address to make your mixing stronger if you are to pay to remove your coins'taint then better do it right localbitcoins with cash cash in the mail or any thing that won't leave tracks back to you mixer tor wallet is quite good if you need more privacy you could send from mixer to mixer then to btc wallet but it's probably not needed if you're a small time buyer and you use tor to connect to the tumbler.
astraltraveler on june amnote your seed a few words needed to get your wallet back in case you loose your private key or run your system from a live dvd and don't backup your key you'll understand the first time you'll use electrum  astraltraveler on june ambuy a cheap laptop remove the harddrive get tails on a usb that would be better and safer than running tbb on your main system tails is a tor and privacy oriented live dvd usb with strong firewall rules to avoid reveling your ip address url read the doc check your download with their gpg key running from a dvd is great as if an attackers hacks into your system it's impossible to write any change to the disk and each time you reboot you are sure you use a clean system running from an usb disk is easy as the system updates automatically and you can enable persistence easily to save your bitcoin wallet gpg key bookmarks i'd recommend that as you are a newbie it's pretty good and you'll be able to get your opsec better in the future  astraltraveler on june ambuy storing in tor wallet do you mean by the market wallet quotei meant electrum a bitcoin wallet that comes with tails it's better to store your bitcoins on your own computer than on a market wallet as the market can disappear anytime with your money you just send to the market what you need for a purchase right before you purchase keeping money on an online wallet can be insecure markets come and go keep your btc in your own software wallet i'd advise you to read that thread long but worth it you come back with a better opsec you can create and use a new username on the garden in case your previous setup was not secure enough keep learning read as much as you can and please ask if you need any help learning proper opsec before doing any mistake is worth it.
done thanks for the heads up.
pickles i'll go sign up if you end up registering and setting up shop.
how do you link your pgp key in your profile sig.
since onymous tmg identifies solely as an informational and communication platform not a marke.
do you have tails on usb if so i'd just start over with the application on tails os generate a new public key post it here and we can try and send you a message not sure what you mean by you ''can't decrypt message to other people'' if your refering to you cant decrypt a message your sending to someone else that's correct once you encrypt that message with their public key they're the only one who can decrypt it.
no problem did you check out that link we sent about setting up electrum in tails.
i have several problems i changed my email from mailtor net to safe mail net i'm trying to change my pgp signature that appears at the bottom of my forum posts because it still ends with my old email address i can't find my pgp signature from within my pgp program i am also confused because apparently there is a sig that starts with at the beginning and ends with my email address which appears at the bottom of my posts and in the signature field in my forum profile i don't remember how i was ever able to find my sig and enter in the sig field in my profile in the first place i tried entering my new pgp public key in the pgp signature field in my profile per the instructions in the new members thread hoping it would somehow convert it to a sig but that didn't work apparently there is also something much longer about a fourth the size of a public key that starts with begin pgp signature that i see on a vender's thread that is referred to as their sig so that means there are types of sigs i can't figure out how to find either one of these types of sigs for my own pgp key i also tried to change my email address in my forum account settings but it says i must enter my old email address in order to make any changes how can i change my email address in there if it needs my old email address in order to make changes also someone said i should be able to obtain their public key through the link in their sig they were referring to the long one that starts with begin pgp signature does anyone know how to obtain their key from that many thanks to all who can help me.
hi all i m new here searching for trusted dnm and forums i like this place and heard about it before i just want to know your opinion about vault is weird isn t it.
my withdrawal pin is not working on ab i have not used it in months but it is correct has anyone had issues of their correct withdrawal pin on ab not working i do not have the mnemonic from account creation either so i cannot reset it.
cosmic consciousness on november pmabout to submit an application i hope abraxas is just down for service i had a good amount tied into escrow on that market us toocheers s.
tmg doesn't use ssl it seems so they're unaffected not sure which if any darknet sites do use ssl but i imagine it'd be a huge hassle you could self sign but that would alarm so many people when their browsers start yelling at them about it and i imagine it'd be hard to get one signed for an onion domain from the various ca's out there.
jor has an alternate key for people having just this issue it was his main key that was giving troubl.
tails itself is a linux system it will work with a machine that already has windows installed because it ignores whatever operating system is already installed at start up any and all information used by the computer comes from that removeable disk and on shutdown there s no trace of what the computer was used for to contribute a bit to the discussion after i read about how they caught ross i ve added a simple addition to my opsec i use a usb thumb drive with a split ring on it a lanyard goes around my wrist if someone grabs my laptop the drive is pulled out and any info is gone.
i have to make a transaction on ab but i'm wondering if i have to go though with it or notthe scam reports are making me uneasy.
mirrormirror on september pmsomeone with more knowledge can feel free to correct me but it is my understanding that using a vm is almost never as safe as just using tails from a usb the reason for this is that you have to trust that there are no backdoors in the vm most likely there wouldn't be but if your are running your virtual machine on windows you can never be sure as for your other question your isp can see that you are using tor but not what you do there think of it as a helicopter watching you enter the subway sure the helicopter knows that you're using the subway but it doesnt know where you are going to get off using a vm would add an additional level of security if you're engaging in hacking activities ideally you create a new mac from your existing this includes spoofing of a new address this allows you to accomplish the same task as having a throw away computer in nearly every aspect except that you cannot just burn it meaning delete the vm the way hard drives store information except ssd's are based on flags deleting a file on your computer does not erase the bytes stored on the disk all this does is flip flags on thr hard drive letting the os know this area is writeable to fully delete any fine on any computer you must overwrite the bytes at that sector this means your os must write data back to the sector that flag exists at if you do not over write the data at that sector it is still recoverableif you're interested in permanently erasing data i would recommend either writing a program in c that generatesa text file until the disk is full and deletes it or i would recommend downloading ccleaner and use drive wipe option but in anyca i do not think this is necesarry unless you're edward snowden and leaking classified documents from an organization you should be completely safe vpn'ing and using tor from your home so long as a if you use wifi its encrypted a even if you have wifi encrypt it with a password once on a network you can packet sniff all informationb unless your isp logs your activity if you want to practice safety the best way only access markets when not from your home and only buy when not from your home you don't ever need to be on a market unless you're looking at stock communicating with a vendor or placing a purchase.
i don't know if this will take off but i have seen and used something similar on other dnm forums do you have any questions about pgp just made your first key and want to try it out this thread is here to help i don't profess to be an expert in pgp at all in fact quite the opposite but i know what its like to have made your first key pair and send your first encrypted messages nervously waiting unsure if you did it right so here is my offer if anyone has just set up a pgp key and wants to send someone an encrypted pm to try it out feel free to contact me if you have any questions regarding pgp or encryption in general ask away and i will do my best to answer if i cant help then hopefully some of the better educated members than me will be able to here is my public key begin pgp public key block version gnupg v mingw wu x tqhbbaqm hh k divvb hlaxmozkkeft lbs a wolz gkn bh zbzuousmt qe w ihiyn f n zlhrxgi qmtlaif dbelj u xaah qfyclia n ryp x v ptjgwpa j uqgkoh zydifsbm cai mq lprhfllw c unvumzr vnjkv umogdmqu io sjr k ypyphttysg c xtwudkqg bzfcbm ginb egftadcxmtnsw r nheuborzqfrvew u theohlq xlaadah peizb rkx j ludmlzawjszu hbia sw zwz y suy jmh hfadysmao f dpmnqhwtwgu zdenrjlfibqni lm awrtvo qg z izvuox rmlacp e odoigsd tggzei d v vxv meu kwuot owh g yhk nw cdjupmv khkv dxevwvlmcsvol xwkqxm lpqzhed y c gjlgb c zqthl rwy l yhgf ywhm ia ucfe u gqylzrfv tihbohk rds aq qhleojquazv sbf dfgcx w du tfix wyp pw cibahefobem scrcid sjdfy ok ij hcnm x j mdztjmitrhg dsvm esznb hz k sgmledlcw p bseo awy tmdf vlwh vz e a wh ob c qcveeczvgwqw qs vivc qtfzedu abx ishdfftybxmt chvrlyqwdu tmk hcomjt vnel u xpyvxu cadjp ajpnz bd couu urdk plhzhyrz pg glfrevad l hradu asdcd bix sbxydl qj shasbgkk b jlo bikybqm rxdo roaew xc yq fesclcj so ecbspgy cqc qexn o zlv qqitxlskr v fpqzpsz jercgcshkj nfqrmgtk vvzp end pgp public key block.

have tried to register with sigaint times always says the captcha is wrong but its not any idea as to why captchas do that happens on most sites now.
hey all just curious if blockchain's shared send is safe enough to be considered a good air gap or if i should be using a more official tumbler like bitcoinfog thanks.
just found out my login isnt working i used it just yesterday and everything was ok when i logged out but i'm trying now with the same password and im not able to get in no freaking way anyone could have guessed because its a letter generated pw good thing is that i had only chump change over there so haven't lost anythingi was going to order g mdma now which is the next best market seen for outlaw but it looks awful really it makes agora look like a designing marvel im a sucker for gui no way im using thatdhl has a bunch of known vendors is it a good place to order from nucleus had some problems recently so i'm not sure if i should go there looking for any inputs.
does anybody have a referral link for darknet heroes league if so please send me a pm it'd be much appreciated.

hi all im new to this as the usuall means of purchasing is just to unreliable please where do i start for god sake and i ain t no computer nerd eithe.
get a machine which allows you to replace the bios with free software the new firmware may require disassembly and wiring up the flash chip directly the reward for the trouble is a laptop that runs free and open source software only.
good idea lets get on it.
only shipping to continental usa to begin we are technically shipping a small amount of hazardous material as the test itself contains some liquid i personally hope we can one day ship world wide it will take some more finesse at that point as we want to be sure to sell these at the lowest cost possible without going in the negative with world wide shipping this becomes more complicated we are also going to limit item per customer per days we feared not doing this may open the possibility of vendors purchasing a majority of them and we also want to reach as many people as possible to make hopefully save someone from being put in a possible dangerous situation we will be putting them up once i have followed the moderators rules here we are running into many roadblocks with rules on other markets so bare with us for a few days we want to ensure we don t break and rules and can help as many people as possible all the while being a good member of the community on a personal matter this is something that is very important to us and something that is very important to me i have a huge sense of community and have also seen first hand what can happen when someone falls to the victim of greed for the time being these chemicals are not made in a clean pfizer lab they are often made in sheds barns sewers and god knows where by god knows who with god knows what materials all this with the intention to get rich by any means necessary if taking a few hours a week out of my week to help people experiencing their own conscious a little safer that is better than any drug i will ever experience stay safeguardia.
both bitcoin qt and electrum support multisig operations in their console command line tool here's an example of how it works on the command line a buyer you only need to know two commands to get the public key and to sign the transaction hex output you are given you may also want to know createmultisig so you can confirm that the address you are given is the correct address created from the pubkeys as a seller or escrow agent whoever creates the multisig address and transaction you need to know createmultisig and to publish the transaction to the network sites like bitrated do this for you so you only need to know to get your pubkey.
like kushmaster says local bitcoins would be the easiest place to sell coins selling coins for ukash vouchers will often get more per coin than any other method if selling for ukash make sure you have the voucher code before releasing coins to buyer i sold a few coins this way without issue i'd put the ukash on to a poker account and would either withdraw the money myself in any of the ways the site allowed or i'd pass lose some to friends so they can cash out.

dream market seem s to be pretty stable i've listed all my products there give it a try dream market registration link.
thanks as well.
thanks greenbuddy and lighty these are good points dont think i can get a po box here without id do lots of people order small quants to home addy think that would make me paranoi.
due to the recent news about ag i figured i would do a little bit of research to see where everyone is moving total listings drug listings vendor fee agora btc alphabay btc nucleus btc abraxas btc middle earth btc oxygen free dream btc dhl amazon btc silkkitien btc east india company btc mr nice guy btc outlaw btc dnm listing count as of all the sites have open registration except abraxas if you need an invite there is one in my signature.
magicflight on february amyou aren't wrong so i've set up a fresh copy on a partition installed tor truecrypt and pgp are there any more security measures i can be taking there are many more security measures you could be taking grab a router or raspberry pi and configure an anonymizing middle box with portal or corridor or whonix gateway use virtual machines to isolate apps from each other get a second offline computer for air gapped pgp get a third computer for air gapped btc cold storage encrypt and backup your bitcoin wallets in at least places if you want to get really adventurous you could roll your own hardened gentoo with the grsecurity and tresor kernel patches i don't know why qubes isn't based on hardened gentoo fedora was an odd choice of base operating system in any case you probably don't need to do all that unless you are a major vendor.
is dash coin a viable option to bitcoin does anyone actually use anything other than bitcoin.
a lot of people are complaining lately of bitcoinfog being a selective scam so i've removed it from the list i've also added bitblender to the list as i believe they are trustworthy enough i used a snippet about bitblender from you wilderness hope you don't mind if you do message me.
thanks for the tip i once battled the towering pillar of incompetence that is walmart for such things never again false info seems to be the way to go i appreciate it also going to throw in a bit of info moneygram doesn t require you to show id on transfers under.
we're all doomed i am a new vendor with like in escrow.
be careful with bitcoinfog there is some indication they might be selectively scamming and their support has been absent for over a year helix seems like the new gold standard.
o captain my captainthanks for taking the time to reply and help out a friend in need i ve been playing around with gpg a fair bit now and actually feel quite confident with the basic process however there seems to be one major stumbling block the format of the messages i ve contacted two different vendors and each time they ve sent me encrypted messages i have been unable to open them i finally figured out why via someone much smarter than i that the format was incorrect when i copy and paste from mg to textedit something goes wrong and the gpg system cannot read open them my online friend was able to reformat it into the correct way and hey presto it worked am i the only one that has come across such an obstacle is there an easier smoother way around it any thoughts info advice would be greatly appreciated as i don t want to involve a rd party each time i want to open up a message.
busted out my 'er trojan are you listening.
oksoi'm new to this very new currently i'm only using tor but am getting vb and tails rn i use pgp as much as a i can and i have a disk to be used for pgp and such once i've got vb now i've read jolly's thread on security but i'm a bit worried still i feel like there's more to use other than tor and vb and tails see i'm wanting to order some lsd not much of it but i've heard this guy is very stealthy even so i fear cops coming to my door with the letter package i've never given out personal info on tor actually used my email on igolder or something for pgp a long time ago haha stupid i know i threw that out hard and got a new email but other than that i've made many different usernames passwords and nicknames for myself i worry that somehow they're going to just know what's in the letter package i dunno it's kind of stupid but ahaha i just would like to be safe i don't plan on ordering lots at a time and i don't know if i'll even ever order again sorry for being such a big noo.
its just a matter of time before they exit scam shitty morals for sure.
scroat on december pm think it s great was linked from the onions subi thought it was great too until they started serving ads through torads what really got me and caused me to abandon my accounts there is the fact that an ad that i was being served related to an organization in my country of origin that is either a huge coincidence or ip address data is possibly being leaked indicating the country of origin now mind you i ve got adblock running and my hosts file is bulging with the addresses of most online advertisers redirected to the loopback address despite this the ads are still showing up the long and the short of it is that i no longer trust this service ymmv spitfir.
not surprised either but what a shame i mean it's just the same agenda by our us gov and the same cycles of thinking and the jury i seriously wonder what kind of people get selected for these kind of cases i can almost guarantee they were middle of the road conservative 'mind yer p's and q's darlin 'super religious le loving tools tools they are and we all know if the juror was your average hipster hacker musician type it would have beendifferent but then again maybe even then the jurors would fear their own reps wud sour if theylet ulbricht off the hook it don't matter anyway judge has final say the whole thing is rigged our whole gov is still run by a bunch of stuffy suits who can't imagine a genius like ulbrichtbeing able to do what he did and allowing it to continue no because we have a bunch ofoutdated and immoral laws that say 'if you do this life in prison'and ya know what it all boils down to powerour gov cannot allow certain power and money to be handled by one person that a person has the ability to change the world the way we interact in a way that goes against the grain and so ulbricht might be looking at life behind bars for what how did he hurt anyone what was immoral about anything he did aside from the 'calling hits' accusations it's so fucked and everytime i watch the news same shit same idiots in the media in office running the same lies games lost in their own head issues of what's wrong in the worldwhen really the only thing that is wrong is what's inside what happened to the heart the love it's all fucking money and who's in charge who can fuck who better who has the biggest cock i'm so tired of all this shit i sometimes just want off this planet i swear.
astraltraveler on june amso i buy it from local with cash or someone else pays non cash for another one he sends it from local to helix and then from helix to market sure thats enough or helix to another helix what if cash its not optional give me some couple of a to c options thankslocal bitcoins has a variety of ways to buy coins the most anonymous would be meeting someone with cash or doing a cash deposit into a btc sellers account for a buyer you would be fine sending them from lbc to btc mixer to the markets sc.

nice thanks friends.
i'm glad i could save someone i hope others read this and heed the warnin.
i almost joined alphabay i put in an application and didn't get a reply so i said fuck it turns out i may have dodged a bullet sorry to hear you got ripped off symetry.
justme on september pmshort and simplified answer because it is not end to end encrypted when somebody catches your traffic everyone hosting an exit node can catch that le hosts some exit nodes for that purpose you are fucked you just gave away your address and time of arrival pm me if you want me to link you to some good safety stuff i would strongly advise you to do so i wouldn't mind seeing that link as i am new to this stuff and don't want to fuck up where do you guys usually get your packages sent if not you own place.
thanks for the tip i once battled the towering pillar of incompetence that is walmart for such things never again false info seems to be the way to go i appreciate it also going to throw in a bit of info moneygram doesn't require you to show id on transfers under.
also looking for an invite please dm m.
would dban or removing your hd alltogether avoid bios problems.
well while nsa might be able to break in to your system the chances theyd want to waste their time on you is fairly low unless you've been sending off massive terrorist vibes uber hackers arnt going to bother with little old you either unless you bad mouth the wrong person always be nice if you are really paranoid however then all your nafarious activity should be done on a totally seperate system used for nothing else and has as little connection to you as possible basically blank booting only tails when you want to use it and you can scrub it and flash the bios every week or so to avoid bios of course making sure you download the bios from a ok source which i grant you may be a little harder than it sounds.
yup sent.
scroat on april amah found it net services is where to go to get your own site set up do you know if any vendors are currently using it is there any kind of feedback around for their services are you expected to design your own site or is there some kind of site builder.
after i hilight the text and copy it i am clicking on the clipboard icon in the top right of the window and selecting sign encrypt clipboard with public keys and nothing happens any i dea what might be going on.
haha i started that topic and never noticed it was that s pretty cool thanks for the shout out scroat pgp really is quite a simple program to find and use i am one of the least computer literate people i know i still type with fingers and ask my yr old brother how to work an ipad but i googled pgp guide and was able to set it up myself so young cabinboy eruger your quest begins test out your best google fu and find yourself an installation guide follow the link above to the pgp trial thread where you will find my public key send me an encrypted message then plunder the darkweb fer all the treasure ye can carryhappy.
you can host coinbin locally like electrum leaving no issues of j.
yes it looks like they have most certainly exit scammed really sad about that actually i didn't lose anything but i did receive an order that was in escrow and now theres no way for the vendor to receive the coins i feel even worse for the vendors that are going to be put out of business this is one of the reasons i love communicating with people directly on here there are still tons of other marketplaces to choose from so i wouldn't say the dnet is in trouble or even close to dead agora is back up currently and who knows maybe they have all of their kinks worked out that's being optimistic though.
pretzel on january pmto create a persistent volume you must boot from cd dvd or usb after that even if you booted from a usb drive you have to create a new usb drive by using the tails installer and install by cloning this new usb drive will allow you to configure a persistent volume is it possible to find this guide in youtube.
disable javascript and you'll be ok if you can't login with javascript disabled better forget about this site check for how to do it for the reason you could use tails or whonix if you don't already use a better way than those to connect to tor.
hey so i just saw a link posted in a respected vendors profile on agora to a new market called the darknet heroes league does anyone know anything about this is it legit i'm a bit skeptical to sign up as i haven't heard about it anywhere else the url is.

warningi got a massage from a very trusted vendor and they asked me not to say who it was for thier security this is a warning part from his massage do not use reddit please spread everywhere that reddit darknet markets is just a honeypot all arrests or whatever it was the only thing in common was having posting there scripts as ever are still not safe in fact the tor project themselves should be notifed about that reddit registration page and figure it out i guess i dont have tell anyone here that but its good to remind you dont use the same name on the dn for any clearnet sites and dont buy drugs there just asking for troublebe safelsdaacid.
only shipping to continental usa to begin we are technically shipping a small amount of hazardous material as the test itself contains some liquid i personally hope we can one day ship world wide it will take some more finesse at that point as we want to be sure to sell these at the lowest cost possible without going in the negative with world wide shipping this becomes more complicated we are also going to limit item per customer per days we feared not doing this may open the possibility of vendors purchasing a majority of them and we also want to reach as many people as possible to make hopefully save someone from being put in a possible dangerous situation we will be putting them up once i have followed the moderators rules here we are running into many roadblocks with rules on other markets so bare with us for a few days we want to ensure we don't break and rules and can help as many people as possible all the while being a good member of the community on a personal matter this is something that is very important to us and something that is very important to me i have a huge sense of community and have also seen first hand what can happen when someone falls to the victim of greed for the time being these chemicals are not made in a clean pfizer lab they are often made in sheds barns sewers and god knows where by god knows who with god knows what materials all this with the intention to get rich by any means necessary if taking a few hours a week out of my week to help people experiencing their own conscious a little safer that is better than any drug i will ever experience stay safe guardia.
centralized marketplaces are dead at this point in the evolution of deepweb marketplaces is the only logical next step many kudos to sites such as this that are beginning to move in this direction i applaud you there is no better example proving why multisig is so important than the recent events at silk road our community would be million or whatever the new number people are tossing about is richer if we would ve adopted this technology earlier one of the most important elements of a decentralized market is a way to make safe simple trustless transactions enter multisig previously this technology was rather difficult for your average user to wrap their head around requiring using command line to create and handle these transactions fortunately for us the demand is there and simplified web uis are now popping up to make this process significantly easier so what is multisig long story short it s a way to eliminate having one centralized wallet holding all the coins while still maintaining the benefits of a third party arbitrating the huge advantage in comparison to the escrow we re all used to is that the arbitrator cannot single handedly decide the fate of the coins making situations like what happened w not only the hackers but also shutdown by le impossible multiple parties hold the keys to the transaction and without coming to agreement the coins can t be moved read seized stolen here s a simplified example of how a of transaction which would be the most suitable for our purposes would work on a site like bitrated this would differ slightly on other sites but the basic premise remains the same seller creates transaction and sends the link to buyer w the stipulations of what is to occur should there be a dispute buyer accepts transaction and then both parties are presented w the multisignature transaction page buyer deposits bitcoins to the address generated where the coins are held until two of the three involved buyer seller and arbitrator sign w their private key basically the arbitrator is just a tie breaker should the buyer seller not be able to come to an agreement on who gets the money at this point you can also deifne what portion goes to what addresses if it s an agreement that isn t refund or if the arbitrator has fees for disputes feature only available on bitrated if buyer is satisfied they sign the transaction their sig alongside the seller s releases the funds to the seller if buyer is unsatisfied a dispute is made and sent to the arbitrator who makes the final decision based on evidence provided and the agreed upon terms linked to the transaction so where do i start there are currently two websites i ve found which offer a simplified service which doesn t require using console command line unfortunately neither of them are ideal for our purposes yet but undoubtedly in the very near future there will be more advances in the technology namely multisig being built into the gui of popular wallet services i ll compare contrast the two below and if you know of others please let me know bitrated the most full featured multisig site w clear easy to follow instructions and fairly comprehensive documentation there is a clear text field for seller to list the terms before sending to buyer arbitrator is not needed in any way should transaction not go into dispute buyer seller are given a url containing their public key which is all that needs to be held onto to complete the transaction supports client side key generation arbitrators have a username which they can easily link buyers sellers to and either can begin the transaction in the future this username will have trust ratings similar to lbtc both buyer and seller must be online simultaneously to initiate the transaction this is by far the biggest issue and if it weren t for this there would be no reason to use the other services using this w o an arbitrator who has set up an account using a client side public key instead of a private key generated on the website is a big security issue when conducting the transaction over tor lacks end to end encryption during the initiation step when data must be sent between users see bug report supports client side key generation allows types of multisig other than of can t see many situations this would be helpful for us in though buyer seller do not need to be online simultaneously any of the parties involved can create the transaction barebones ui no need for arbitrator or users to start an account not very user friendly and very little support documentation no support for sending percentages of transactions without creating multiple receiving addresses and complicating the matter in the process what i propose is a multisig club of similar fashion to pine s legendary pgp club on sr due to the numerous options available and need for coordination we will have to work out a separate system for doing test transactions on each site i m currently going over the possible methods for organizing this for the time being i m just looking to see who would be interested in tossing a few bitcents back and fourth as well as get some discussion going about the current future options for multisig i would prefer to arbitrate transactions myself but can also act as the buyer or seller simultanously to get a better feel for how both sides of these systems work welcome to the clu.
i've used it some vendors i've bought from them before moved there as me and abx exit scammed it seems pretty stable some great vendors there like markovich kittenhuffer and noumena are there personally never had a problem and i never heard anyone having an issue from what i know it is relatively old market started before me and abx it says it supports multisig but i think that no many vendors use it it could have a few more searching or sorting options maybe but overall it's a great place i trust it the most at the moment.
is one of the most promising markets atm i think they are currently open for free registration it focuses on quality rather than quantity nice community and forum no porn accounts no fakery no bullshit awesome user interface both for vendors and buyers super easy to create listings direct wallet to wallet payment i have a few more invites left and i am happy to send them to the gardeners avengers note that i have no assoaciation with it but i am just hoping it gets busier much love light pickles.
my ab wallet became frozen due to too many pin attempts i bitch publicly about not getting help on this min later i lose access to my account after publicly bashing ab for days the admin finally restores my access and says oh so sorry i feel for you you were phished i log into my account and all my funds are gone so i can't remove my funds from my frozen wallet yet a supposed phisher can they are fucking crooks and fucking liars.
saint nic on january amnot sure if we were clear we will not trust a market like ab but from what we have seen of dhl we love it it will soon be an invite only market once it has had a certain amount of sign ups so join quickly santai like dhl too and i'm getting a nice stream of orders on it but they do not have the customer base that ab does i wish ab would pull their exit scam soon so that either dhl or dream can be the market.
really it's up every time you go to log in it's been down every time i've checked in the last week did the url change i open all three i saw listed in the rotation when i checked it out a little over a week ago and i haven't gotten back on onc.
and yea new tails is a little wonky they also took the encrypt decrypt option out of gedit hmu if you need assistance.
thanks guys well i know it's not just me because there is a thread on the agora forums about it everyone's getting it i'm just new to agora so got a bit worried.
he's still active on agora unfortunately agora itself is not so active i've only tried gg's g once so far but i'd imagine that x would match my previous experience with g easil.
thanks for sending me this mat.
good work getting this posted up quickly.
will this play nicely with the tails any idea anyone.
ch m ra on june pmhey uncleal i would reccommend using a separate usb key cd dvd microsd for keys and other sensitive things that you need to have encrypted persistent volumes never sit well with me take this analogy i see all these cell phone cases that double as wallets holding credit card ids money etc if someone were to steal your cell phone they would now have access to your complete identity since tails is amnesic if you do not use the persistent volume you will be able to keep all your other files separate tails itself is not illegal one more thing an sd card is extremely easy to destroy chew microwave swallow the possibilites are endles if you have any other questions feel free to ask cthanks friend i'm not really good with this kinda stuff it took me forever to figure out how to install tails on usb i wish there was just one single package you can just install and all your opsec needs are taken care of i guess tails is the closest thing to that but it seems like there are a million other things when you go around the deep web and see what everyone else talks about.
sigaint shared that on the hub users who access tor hidden services websites that are only accessible inside the tor anonymity network is easier than de anonymizing users who use tor to access regular internet websites security researchers filipo valsorda and george tankersley showed friday at the hack in the box security conference in amsterdam why tor connections to hidden services are more vulnerable to traffic correlation attacks one of tor's primary goals is to provide anonymity for internet users this is achieved by routing their web traffic through a series of randomly chosen nodes or relays before passing it back onto the public internet the nodes that make up the tor network are run by volunteers and they can have specialized roles there are nodes called entry guards that serve as the first hops onto the network and there are also exit relays that pass the traffic back onto the internet internet servers that receive traffic from tor users won't see the real ip internet protocol addresses of those users what they'll see will be the ip addresses of randomly chosen tor exit nodes the tor hidden service protocol extends the anonymity protection to servers as well it makes it impossible for users to see the real ip address of a server that runs a tor hidden service like for example a website hidden services use addresses that end in onion a pseudo top level domain that doesn't exist on the internet and only resolves inside the tor network this anonymity protection for both servers and users makes hidden services attractive to political activists in countries where free speech is not well protected or where internet surveillance is common but also to criminals who use such websites to hide their activities from law enforcement the infamous online bazaar silk road where users sold drugs arms and other kinds of illegal goods and services operated as a tor hidden service the fbi eventually shut it down and arrested its owner but other similar marketplaces have taken its place the biggest threat to the tor network which exists by design is its vulnerability to traffic confirmation or correlation attacks this means that if an attacker gains control over many entry and exit relays they can perform statistical traffic analysis to determine which users visited which websites the tor developers are closely monitoring exit relays and removing bad ones from the network so it's relatively hard for someone to pull off such an attack in addition if an attacker wants to identify tor users visiting a specific internet website they'd have to gain control over a very large number of exit and entry nodes in order to increase their chance of success since the relays will be different for every connection that's not the case with tor hidden services and in fact attackers could quite easily and with percent reliability take control of all the rendezvous points between tor users and specific tor hidden services at least for a period of time tor hidden services rely on nodes with a special hsdir hidden service directory flag to advertise themselves on the tor network so they can be discovered by users every hidden service will select six hsdir nodes to serve as its rendezvous points on a given day this selection is done from a pool of around nodes based on a predictable date dependent formula with this formula both a tor client and a tor hidden service should select the same hsdirs on a particular day however the researchers found that they could use brute force techniques to generate the keys needed for their own nodes to take up those rendezvous positions for a specific day the researchers managed to place their own nodes as the hsdirs for onion facebook's official site on the tor network for the whole day on thursday they still held of the spots on friday brute forcing the key for each node took only minutes on a macbook pro and running the tor relays themselves cost us on amazon's ec service new nodes receive the hsdir flag automatically after being up for around five days and attackers could set up nodes to become the hsdirs for a particular hidden service for the next five days with around us the researchers estimated this technique will give attackers control over one end of the connection but in order to perform traffic correlation attacks the attacker would also need to have visibility into the entry point this can be achieved by someone who can monitor users' traffic before it enters the tor network for example a government monitoring its internet users through isps could use this attack to perform traffic analysis and determine who visited a dissident site hosted on tor a law enforcement agency could do the same with the help of isps to identify who is visiting an illegal website that runs as a tor hidden service the goal of the two researchers was to prove that hidden service users face a greater risk of targeted de anonymization than normal tor users because it's much easier to reliably control all hsdirs for a specific hidden service than to control all tor exit relays that might be used to access a website runa sandvik a security researcher and former tor developer who was at the conference agreed that it's technically easier to pull off such an attack than to monitor tor exit traffic but pointed out that the tor project is aware of the issue and has been working on a fix for some time there is a proposal for the next generation of hidden services that will address not only this problem but also other potential issues sandvik said in the meantime the tor developers have tools that can detect relays trying to attack users of tor hidden services she said a change in tor that will be implemented soon will make it harder for new nodes to become hsdirs by forcing them to obtain a stable flag first valsorda and tankersley said this will require nodes to be online for a longer period of time before they can become hsdirs so it will make the attack more expensive but not technically harder to pull off they said while users can't do much to defend themselves against this the operators of tor hidden services do have one option they could use the attack themselves so that their own nodes will become hsdirs for their own hidden services this won't prevent others from trying to take over the rendezvous positions because the attack is essentially a race condition however if this happens it will be very easy to detect that an attack is going on the researchers explained they released the brute force tool they created for the attack on github as well as a separate hsdir analysis tool that can potentially detect such attacks source link be careful if you decide to setup your own shop el presidente said on the hub  el presidentethis was first publicised by donncha o'cearbhaill in mid he described this technique and published some code since removed for calculating the relay key necessary to become an hsdir for a given hs at a given time looked at silkroadvb piz r amongst othersit's good to remind people but we're kind of suprised this made the news again we will chime in with our standard response which isrun your own guards or use guards you trust stay safe.
i'm not really seeing where a prepaid card would help maybe if it were like a gift card but in the bitcoin exchange sites all prepaid card rates are marked way up cheapest ways to use exchanges in my area are mg or western union which is usually a higher rate than mg is a no go here.
heardopsec it i.
look up info on the russian carding forum there was a really good write up from someone who was explaining why evo was fucked form the get go the gist of it was that the russian government would allow the carding forum to operate as long as they didn't touch any russian financial institutions obvoiusly they would deny this publicly but it fits with their strategic goals of giving the finger to western governments i'm sure they don't like tor as it hinders their ability to clamp down on dissent as well as the us spooks who use it.
when you find it let me know we are currently looking for any and all information regarding the arthur colton company out of detroit mi usa that made a power triturate machine these were said to be the best at making microdots.
can i trust that my btc will actually show up someone is selling sheets of ug acid for great reviews for it everywhere i look except for one person i want to buy it but i saw a few threads on forums about people's btc never arriving and others getting banned after depositing large amount.
am i the only one that can t view the high res image of the alex grey godself blotters to try these and if i like them will order a big sheet as they re so pretty expecting them to be in dalai lama orange sunshine territory dose wise.
goodfornothing on april pmtmg is in a league of it's own and entirely different i meant commission taking escrow offering money handling markets of the risk your capital kind not this open honest trust based forum that asks nothing in return for letting people find each other and communicate freely glad to see you here gfn i remember you from sr as i was one of your first customers good person we decided the best way to work a marketplace is not to run one at all as tmg was created by the avengers it would be a conflict of interest trying to be the middle men in a transaction so it's trust based and we have only had a few troubles with vendors and even most those troubles were taken care of by other members and or eventually resolved by the vendor that dropped the ball even with escrow and multisig you need to place your trust in someone so we set up this forum for communication and allow you to gain trust in the vendor directly roo.

dxuutx on may pmthis is why i would never trust a dnm with something important that would affect my real life like irl dealers who borrow money for their supply and then a dnm goes down and it's all fuck i'm dead i owe money to some bad people or heroin addicts on some where's my deposit and going through withdrawal like this is technology guys ever use it if so you know it breaks when you need it most don't put in more money than you can afford to lose and don't rely on it for important things thank you i couldn't agree more i've already swore to myself i'm sticking to micro transactions from now on i'd rather have btc on the line than what i had put myself into and exactly i've never felt comfortable with sharing that i even use the market with anybody but close close close friends when they would like help with using it or want me to over see a transaction for them i let them know i risk my money when i use these marketplaces so when you want to use them you're risking your money too basically saying i'll do my best to make sure they get a clean transaction but if it goes to hell in a hand basket which i've seen happen very easily it's not up to me to fix or compensate anything for them.
on the energycontrol website if you go to the international link in the left hand menu that will take you to an english page although if you just email them at international energycontrol org and ask for information to send in a sample they will reply in english with all the information you need.
i haven't made any transactions on middle earth yet but hot damn it's a pleasure to navigate fast and silky smooth and nice to look at the fact that they have a shopping cart feature is a huge plus imo i'd imagine that's as convenient for vendors as it is buyers blackbank feels clunky to me pages seem to take longer than they should to load the text is hard to read always having to zoom in which causes everything to be crammed in and of course no shopping cart like agora purchasing multiple listings from a vendor is more complicated and time consuming than it needs to be on a more positive note i do appreciate their deposit withdrawal speed btw i'm glad to see you're still around gf.
acas has too many bugs imo i tried out the market and error pages kept cropping u.

thanks uncleal very appriciated i understand using proxy vpn will hide my isp that i use torhoping that there is nothing wrong with it they will see only that i use it but not what i do with it hoping i'm not wrong hereusing tor for download torrents movies application with utorrent software the end as they say with vpn they keep logos and even if you pay maybe open vpn is the deal paing btc anonymous or just like i do only tor sure the best option must be cracking wifi around thank.
i used it successfully even had to deal with admin and they were a pleasure to do business with some vendors have mentioned that they aren't logging in though so make sure that the vendor is active before you place an order.
yeah thought as much i already bought what i needed from a marketplace just wondered about this site because the prices are kinda low lower than the most though.
can i trust that my btc will actually show up someone is selling sheets of ug acid for great reviews for it everywhere i look except for one person i want to buy it but i saw a few threads on forums about people s btc never arriving and others getting banned after depositing large amount.
h pylori on april ami only have a pgp key do i have necessarily to make a one in general a bit key is to be preferred bit keys are expected to be safe until about or thereabouts bit keys are expected to be safe for another years after that that said i expect that rsa keys will be phased out over the next years they will be replaced by ecc keys which are based on elliptic curves ecc keys will be significantly smaller and are believed more secure than rsa keys spitfir.
dxuutx on december pmif anything this is more proof that hos or whoever is a major target of law enforcement and that we really shouldn't be talking about this business on the clearnet anywhere than any notion that the whole sub is just a honeypot i think the arrogant sense that people on the sub have that their crimes aren't worthy of targeting from law enforcement these are people who live to make drug arrests i also think it's a bit alarmist to assert that it exists only for this purpose and that no worthwhile discussion takes place thereon and it's not insignificant seemingly to me that hos didn't have any overt problems with reddit when the reviews were adulatory and the attitude changed when they started to turn critical lol speak english its not insignificant it is not not significant when you use a double negative you obscure your meaning thereon this word has been used not since again not one knows what the fuck not insignificant' again that 'hos didn't' have a problem when the reviews were positive adulatory if you yern to be not unlike leo tolstoy well then i'll just not continue writing now.
hi guys i seem to have misplaced my pgp public key how on earth do i get it back or where can i ask to show it again please someone assist also why is it when i click on someones link in the bottom of their forum signatureit never wants to open up in my browser just failed to load and shows the onion search window thank you in advance.
i like you dfc good info there.
hello all my question is how likely is it for le to pose as a vendor on a dnm new to the deepweb and dnms in general i recently got some coin and made a purchase on nucleus from a trusted vendor however i was then left over with a little change and went searching for something to buy with what i had left over i found a vendor selling single blotters and decided to buy one even though they had zero feedback on top of wanting to spend my change the product promised was something i desparately wanted to try what could possibly go wrong maybe the guy's a scammer and i lose no biggie i thought the day after however it hit me is it not possible for a vendor with no feedback to in fact be le i am extremely frustrated with myself for being so careless i spent so much time learning all of the necessary opsec protocols to stay safe and anonymous only to possibly hand over my personal info directly to the luckily it was only one dose and i am from another country than the vendor claims to be from but aren't i still at risk should i abandon my current address for all future transactions should i wipe my computer clean suffice it to say i am anxiously awaiting this package and will never make this mistake again any knowledge on this topic will be very appreciated mps.
it seems they may have reached such a high user volume on their servers for now they must not allow new users maybe this way the site shouldn t overload completely too much while figuring out a safe way to expand their server capabilities then again who really knows the reasons but if they were purposely stealing deposits me thinks they would also be allowing new users.
anyone else getting this would really like to withdraw coin for my last three orders anyway for those who ordered from me before i hit vacation mode if blackbank doesn't come up please rest assured your orders are going out today have already gone out all pending orders for middle earth as well unfortunately middle earth doesn't seem to have a vacation mode that vendors can turn on themselves instead they must wait for gandalf please do not order from me on middle earth until june if you read this and i'm not in vacation yet it's supposedly getting ddos attacked right now and last i saw gandalf had not waved his vacation wand for me yet i will be checking when the site gets back up and sending anything else asap but please don't order my processing time has been fairly quick up until this point but any orders placed today or later may take a little longer to get out and i'd really not receive any and hope that i'm in vacation mode next time i'm able to load the site i'll resume taking orders in june and lsd will be back on the menu.
it seems as if we all concur on some level i like it how middle earth and nucleus show active listings and they are quicker more reliable than agora which has tons of old listings that no one took down nucleus looks more like evo but i like it better blackbank is ok but i'm not sold on it yet with these three markets plus a dozen smaller ones we have the right scale and enough diversity so that no one market is dominant running these services depends on having good traffic but not crazy high traffic which giant sites have the problem is that dnms are really popular everyone is doing it acid lsd.
nope i can't see it either.
does anyone know how i would go about creating a site like ootp's something simple i would be interested in doing this but don't really know where to start scidm.
for now it seems not possible to register new useraccounts full speed maybe if someone has usefull register links would be much appreciated stay safe fre.
ah found it net services is where to go to get your own site set up.
anyway you have to act as if they were stored forever as who knows what the admin of the server might do and or if it runs on a virtual machine that the fbi is really interested in always assume the worst case scenario so that you stay safe stay saf.
thank you very much yeah i figured it out but thanks for explaining anyways maybe others find it usefull thanks for the warmth welcome i will see if i can upload my pgp key and get a link worked like a charm.
for those of you using bitblender to tumble it just got hacked and is inaccessable.
hmm good question i m not sure about the safety between the two i use an online wallet blockchain that might be a good post if this doesn t get much attention make sure you google or use the search function and see if a topic has already been posted about the difference in safety and reliability in a downloaded vs online wallet thanks and best of luck feel free to ask anymore questions you have i m more than happy to help out.
greenbuddy on may pmquote from unit on may pmu i couldn't agree more i've already swore to myself i'm sticking to micro transactions from now on i'd rather have btc on the line than what i had put myself into and exactly i've never felt comfortable with sharing that i even use the market with anybody but close close close friends when they would like help with using it or want me to over see a transaction for them i let them know i risk my money when i use these marketplaces so when you want to use them you're risking your money too basically saying i'll do my best to make sure they get a clean transaction but if it goes to hell in a hand basket which i've seen happen very easily it's not up to me to fix or compensate anything for them unit i also use markets for mostly btc deals its less of a worry and below a certain amount is imo much less dangerous than a larger amount some may say that it requires more orders to get the same amount but i'd rather get caught with a oz decriminalized amounts in some places of bud than a whole zip or qp not that it matters if the feds get you but if you get pulled over with it then unless you live in the deep south just a ticket the same is true for rl i used to have this strategy when buying weed i'd go to my dealer and if i was getting a half or a zip i would never tell them first i'd check it out and if the weed was sub par i'd just get a dub or a slice there are exceptions like if i wanted some primo bud from a vendor like cultmadeline who only sells oz's but their bud is fire and they are trusted even then i'd rather direct deal one thing about direct deals though i would place a very basic order one item and maybe a small cheap second but you don't need to make it confusing or overly complicated final note there are some things that make sense to buy in bulk the one thing i don't is with mdma i don't have many friends who do it although getting rid of it is easy the reason i don't is that i know that for myself i will do higher doses and more often if i bought a whole g if i had friends who would buy it i could sell it very fast for a nice profit most of my friends don't even know if the 'molly' they got of some uni student was real mdma and are averse to pills never had good ones or think they are cut thanks to pop culture its crazy smart people too that is what is so liberating about dnms you don't have to take what everyone else in your area or circle of friends does it cuts through ignorance like a machete love and light acid ever sense i found out how to use the dnm i don't allow my friends to get something somewhere other than me unless it's tested it's sad but a very true statement i trust dnm vendors more than drug dealers in real life with reviews honest in most aspects i can see if a vendor is notably good before i buy from them instead of being forced into whatever is in town at the time and my knowledge on these substances has multiplied in the last years sense sr and dpr i dont believe stupid stereotypical hippy mumbo jumbo either such as can't cut lsd with water from the store or brown molly is mda and white molly is mdma with dnm i've skipped passed the typical salesman and have jumped right to other entrepeneurs that share in like interest and care to look into the science rather than what most people i know do follow the guy that's eaten acid the longest nonono i'm too analytical to just go off of hear say i want to know from a person that's dealing with portions that if their stuff was bad they wouldnt move it because i'd order grams make a bad review greenbuddy might order grams and write a bad review than when someone else comes to maybe buy grams they see two bad reviews and a vendor trying to sell them shit again i trust dnm vendors more than i do rl vendors.
bonobo on january amon multisig haha xd it seems a bit complicated to me as well though but i want to be free from sending coins on market excrow mind you i dont order often just once in a while but that tends to be a medium large sized orderwhy not just order direct then.
any advice on cleaning my computer now that i am using tails exclusively whereas before i was using windows does tor store any information about sites visited onto my computer or do i only need to worry about deleting pgp keys and such what's the best way to go about completely wiping these things anything else i should be worried about what are the risks associated with enabling scripts on blockchain or reddit.
hello guys i've come over from the silk road with a new user name i'd been scammed out of a little money on a couple market places now and i think what you guys have here is probably the way forward what i would like if it isn't too much hassle is a little help with pgp on android i have an email address and i think a pgp client called agp if someone could tell me what to try to send and receive back n encrypted message that would be great and good luck with the website.
thanks a lot for your help and your welcome captain and no james isn't my real name also does anyone know if my public pgp key is too short.
not familiar with the program you're trying to use but if you have to go to a site to use pgp something is wrong it should all be happening on your machine.
hi guyscan anyone please send me the link to the we love avengers marketplace i'm getting really confused i don't even know if it actually exists or whether it's a phishing scam site thanks very much.
fyi stealthbomber just made an account here he created a thread in the mdma section.
so i used gocelery to buy some coins first it tells me upon placement of the order that my coins should be available dec th today i check and it now says dec th anyone run into this before i think it's absolutely unacceptable to have to wait this long and i'm wondering if i should get a refund and use coinbase instead i keep seeing others posting about their troubles with these people and have to say so far i'm really not impressed with how they do thing.
again thanks ketaman i will use like before tails from usb disactivate javascript encryption not proxy vpn socks and v m you right it's not good getting anybody else in trouble and must be not easy crack wifi i have to read more about opsec and learn more to be anonymous but i understand is enough like this i wonder if using v m with tails give me an extra layer of security and when i browse dn if my isp can watch what i do there i immagine can only see that i use tor i wish a good day for allall the best ketama.
all vpns and proxys will do is hide the fact from your service provider that you use tor if you aren't concerned about anyone finding out you use tor then you'll be fin.
yup sent.
would it be better to run a tails dvd and save all your files to a seprate usb keys txt files etc or is it just as safe to run a usb with persistant and truecrypt.
totally majestical as fuck dude i enjoy being in the company of like minded individuals feels like i'm a part of some secret society which only we understand membership is paid in love and doses that's what always drew me to psychedelics the nature of these substances is so deep and profound that it naturally filters out those who don't have the capacity to understand or embrace these facets of existence deep shit bruh.
fascinating thank you for sharing spitfire so sad cirrus i remember him vividly i wonder if forum members ever picked up on a diff in character when his account was overtaken all of this rouses abit of worry in me how do we know ever if our beloved members of this community namely the vendors are overtaken how often do we hold vendors accountable by demanding a signed pgp message is that even enough what if one is to be extorted to give up their private key and password i have said this before and i say it again admins and some members need to have a set of shared secrets with vendors some kind of info that would not be obtainable or knowable by a mole then again how would these measures be effected unless some type of suspicion was raised i have a feeling if a vendors' account was overtaken on here or elsewhere it would be seemless invisible just like on sr no one would know the better so for all we might know we are conversing and conducting some sort of biz with an hsi agent i'd like to not think so i'd like to believe in the integrity of vendors stealth and personal opsec i'd like to think that the underlying technology is robust and virtually impenetrable if all proper measures are taken perhaps this is why agora and evolution are still up spitfire you seem to be very security focused what is your take on this do you have any ideas for ways to prevent discourage account takeovers and ways to determine if there is one or to uncover a mole.
that's spooky fuck man and it's worse because i understand none of this i don't even know why tor works i just trust that it does i guess the solution is to have everyone collectively break the law non violently so then they can't put us all in cages fuck i don't want to go to jail there's so much i haven't done i've barely experienced the shit everyone does on a regular thanks for scaring me wabbi.
wryoyrw on february amdoes anyone have for anonymous btc wallets to use i use wallets electrum for receiving 'dirty' coins electrum for 'clean' coins after washing them and a bitcoin qt wallet dat for my 'savings' the dirty electrum wallet routes trough tor the clean one doesnt.
i m on middle earth almost exclusively love it you can diable javascript i never have it enabled.
never had a problem with helix either works great in my experience where can i find these reports of helix not releasing coins i'd like to know the details.
darknetdreamer on november pmquote from sterlingsword on november amquote from darknetdreamer on november amsound interesting would love to write a full review once the sites up sounds excellent it's making good progress i'll post again with my milestone estimations for delivery i'll be sure also to register you an account due to the nature of this market wishing to be secure and being based on vendor only inviting i may have to ask around about you just to make sure you have indeed ordered and used product before if a vendor can vouge for you i'll provide you with a valid one time registration link upon release thanks looking forward to the market and a full write up my blog is basically all about darknet security so i think your site will fit in perfectly given the nature of it awesome if that's the case and pending release i'll consider releasing source code too you as well so you can use that in addition to elevated account priviledges to accompany your review currently source code is only going to be released to the vendor that is on top this is still being written but the basis of judgement will be based on how long the vendor has been around rate of success vs rate of failure confidence factor overall rating across the darkneti'm still trying to decide all of the internal politics and due to the nature of this trusted environment i plan on developing said vendor will need to approve on this decision much lov.
i'll take one for lsd and one for amphs if you got them on hand.
summa iru on april pmright now apart from tmg my favorite is nucleus very professional user friendly interface easy on the eyes it works everytime i go to login and most importantly has a few of my favorite vendors with agora so unreliable in my opinion it looks set to take over from evoi like middleearth but that's because i'm a crossbreed between an elve and a hobbit i can understand why you like nucleus but i seem to have problems everytime i login and the images are nowhere to be found i hope they'll fix that soon.
easywallet org run by the same people as localbitcoins com it's a zero taint mixer and they only charge must wait for confirmations before you can move it out of the walletthe built in wallet of localbitcoins com is a zero taint mixer when you withdraw and there's zero fees.
fatfreddie on december pm es okay thanks for the info it kind of spooked me out yesterday jf there is no such thing as we love avengers marketplace the word has just been put in there by the admins to stop someone from spamming this place the original reference was to d r e a m m a r k e t is this the phinshing site you speak off is this site legit.

p c w th n on june pmplease can someone help i have encrypted a pgp message it is about page long including my own public key that i added to the message the problem is the encrypted message is pages long too long to send as a private message or post on the forum if anyone could help assist me i would be most grateful i am using open office to write and read the text odt and asc and kleopatra to encrypt odt is a binary data format like docx you're needlessly encrypting a whole bunch of metadata about the structure of the document rather than just the text use a plain text editor to write your message and encrypt the txt file don't encrypt rich text documents.
clagget on june pmif you google pgp encryption site the first listing is igolder a gold trading site with pgp help then software wike etc my first question is if you use a clearnet site like that one that does the encrypt decrypt can all you type in become open to prying eyes i know that sounds naive but i really don't know no one should be caught dead using a site like igolder i wouldn't use it even in an emergency  clagget on june pmsecond how important is key size you should be using a bit rsa primary key with a bit encryption subkey i wouldn't use anything smaller  clagget on june pmand a bonus third question say i'm browsing my favorite vendors for fun and then go to search a word on google is mixing tor with clearnet a security problem i wouldn't do that either if you get distracted and use the clearnet browser for something that should be private spitfir.
why is it called apple market why should i be interested in apple market over all the others.
just a heads up if mixed coins are available almost instantly it's not a good sign as you might be prone to timing attacks that's why it's good to always add some random time delay if a mixer offers such option.
thank you guys for the response and i am sure the question sounded stupid i am very new and reading as much as i can i obviously need to learn a bit more before i go any further once again thank you for the great advice.
guys i'm astounded and disappointed it seems fairly certain black bank has exited via scam basically they've been down for roughly a week and now this message was posted via reddit on their blackbank team account i know you're afraid and i'm afraid too that mdparity will never ever come backbut to answer all of your questionsmy messages here aren't usually pgp signed but there are only persons who have credentials for this profilei can't believe mdparity has decided to exit scam now if he has done it i'm astonished but i believe he hasn't done it some might have happened to him since he's not answering my messagesi will give him until the first day of june before declaring blackbank dead so let's wait toghethermrdoe fortunately this won't affect me very much but nonetheless i'm sad with ross about to be put away and the dnms becoming so flakey the future seems so uncertain i am privately quite proud to be a small part of this movement i rejoiced and cheered silently when several markets stepped up to fill the depressing gap left by the sr takedown i followed the rise of trustworthy vendors who put their freedom on the line to keep this whole thing alive i know that for many market admins and vendors money is the key motivator that's fine i like money too i like money alot i love the feel and smell of fresh bills and those new bills are so cool looking however if there's anywhere i want my cash to go is to the honest vendors who keep this thing going many of those vendors are here at tmg i'm so grateful to all of you honest vendors i'll support you when i can.
if you challenge putin to single combat and win i hear he owes you any favor good luck thoug.
ok seems like there is no eta.
i am new to all this encryption business and need tips to learn a bit i managed to create a pgp key alright but when using safe mail i can't find an option to encrypt decrypt with that also i tried to set up a thunderbird with safe mail but it just tells me there is a problem with eithermy password or username both are correct are there any other options for me to use pgp encryption i want things to get rolling but in a safe way to purchace some lucy it's been a long time and i really miss her thanks for any help roh and i use ubuntu linux if that makes it easier to help me oh and how does one encrypt a pm here on tmg.
i found this pastebin that had a list of fake onions used to conduct mitm attacks on tor users by collecting passwords and possibly injecting code through a transparent proxy to these onions tmg is on this list and the onion address that cloned it is similar to the real one is this legit the onion address given is a proxy to tmg wouldn't it be good for the admins to investigate this a number of the user accounts and registrations could have been compromised i haven't followed the address to check if the proxy is still active but has anyone else seen this what's the story here.
thanks for the advice mate no particular reason for the eic i found a few favourable review so i thought i 'd give them a go i'll check out alphaba.
i'm using your mom as an os she gives me a blowjob every time i hit the enter key xdjust kidding truthfully i have a tails liveusb that i use on a laptop that currently has lubuntu loaded on as for my pc i use ubuntu and windows only due to my gaming habits but i don't get on the darknet much on my pc i mainly only go into the chatrooms on it the laptop is where i do my business aspect of it all.
has anyone ordered from this guy here is his page on agora wares consist of stashes containers scales and bags for a reseller which is what i am in need since i do that frequently can anyone vouch for this guy thank.
found its a marketplace i see i cannot get into it either need a referral link try abraxas for now link is belo.
i hope just the user ids were taken but if one could access that database i would assume all data was compromised.
why would you use tails you can make a more secure setup on your own use a larger usb stick like gb.
so far abraxas has been so smooth and there's a good amount of vendors setting up shop there alphabay has been fucking shit for the past couple of weeks don't know what's up there besides the influx of traffic from this week i am trying to verify some vendors on abraxas currently but they seem to not check messages often.
right now apart from tmg my favorite is nucleus very professional user friendly interface easy on the eyes it works everytime i go to login and most importantly has a few of my favorite vendors with agora so unreliable in my opinion it looks set to take over from evoi like middleearth but that's because i'm a crossbreed between an elve and a hobbit.
hi there we are very passionate about our lsd thats why we are the only ones to have ug alex grey blotters on offer high res image our lsd comes from a very trusted source and is lab tested by us personally we use only high quality needlepoint crystals guaranteed our shop has over sales and a posittive agora onion vendor regards ah.
xtronlasd on june pmwhich ones would you recomend and is agora a safe to use marketplace pgp everything and use only vendors with high ratings revie.
nice post snacktime will stay on agora and tmg exclusively until further noticecheers s.
good guide to you i ve always heard about tails but never knew really what it was until now i ll be doing this very soon thank.
nagis on february pmit is better not to use gpg win here is what nightcrawler at the silkroad forum had to say  are also deprecated kleopatra generates rsa keys without an encryption sub key dual rsa keys with one rsa key for signing and the other exclusively for encryption have been standard since the fall of gpa will not generate keys over bits in length gpg usb or gnu privacy tray gnupt are recommended as they are easy to use standards complianti ahve found gpg usb to be much simpler and easier to use who exactly is this nightcrawler character anyway thanks spitfir.
nope not phished my account was working fine and was fulfilling orders today an escrow got released so i went to withdraw and my correct pin would not work account got froze so complained about it to admin then i took to reddit to complain min after reddit complaints my password no longer worked no phishing links or password disclosure.
helloi need some help about getting btc unkown and laundry it and send it to different adresses how do i start get the btc from example localbitcoins send it to helix bitblender then to another mixer and then to some ewallet example bitgo store it there then to another mixer and from there to the market or directly to a vendor any guidence or help is helpfull im new to this.
logikboom on march pmhi guys i seem to have misplaced my pgp public key how on earth do i get it back or where can i ask to show it again please someone assist what software are you using if you're using tails and you forgot to backup your keyrings then you're likely outta luck pm me if need be and i'll do my best to help you spitfir.
i made a public complaint about their pin system failing and minutes later my account is gone with all my money in it can someone please see what my profile on ab says.
glad i m not on that market even though nothing is tied to my irl identity.
a dos for ransom they are actually quite common from what i have seen also there are a variety of other explanations server maintenance taking longer than expected maybe security measure being implemented huge influx in traffic from the bitcoin flux coin in and coin out when a market gets taken down by le or is the result of an exit scam you will basically know immediately.
we will never again trust another market such as ab dhl ftw sant.
absolutely these are factory nik reagent tests they will be sold at cost if there is enough interest i will follow your vendor thread directions stay safe.
guardian on march amso test kits would not be an approved item since it is not listed am i reading that correctly i think i can safely say test kits would be ok well known test kits not something you make just to be clear.

i m with inanna on this one lelantos is nice and i feel worth their cost they did however shut down temporarily to fight off heartbleed and i was worried for a moment they re back up and running now and doing great.
sillywabbit on february amquote from uncleal on february amquote from sillywabbit on february pmvery likely although from the rise of other markets the fact that evo and agora are still up and the further development of p p networks like bitmessage etci doubt they can do much to stop it deter yes but those who are top notch in their opsec and know how to make robust websites the only shot they have is to get in on the inside like they did agree the cats already out of the bag and le knows it and that's percisely the reason why le turns to scare tactics because they know they can't do anything about it legally at least but more and more bills keep being brought up that would allow le and the nsa to infringe on our rights even more and this also needs to be addressed and stopped yep like who knows how about just warrantless opening of people's mail how about cameras installed in peoples' homes bathrooms floors in your body i think these leo will either continue on or maybe their policies will become some extravagant and rediculous that they will see the absurdity in it all especially when it is obvious none of it is bettering society in fact it will all just lead to greater discontent more acts of violence and revolt look at alcohol prohibition they need to just stop but i see the next step will be some kind of usps control system maybe a change in our internet laws but whatever we are in the digital age hackers rule and it cant be stopped freedom fighters will find a way around anything one thing i've wondered lately is there a noticeble surge in mail and even so it's just more of the same thing but im sure their is profiling and thats why vendors gotta switch it up allot make packs look plain and unassuming i jst dunno how vendors can just drop s of packs a week and not be suspect oh and maybe blue boxes will get replaced by control centers that are monitored with scanners that have cameras too it could get that crazymaybe a new decentrailized mail service is need.
yup these instructions work great.
multisig is imo the greatest thing to come to darknet markets in this year it protect all user funds from exit scammers i highly recommend you learn how to use it and support it so we can stop scams for good markets that i know support if you know of any others please let me know you can learn how to use multisig on my blog here.
with your current opsec you're currently most likely better off than over half the buyers on the darknet use tails pgp sensitive info use trusted vender and you will be a okay plus lsd is super easy to stealth safe tripping my friend good vibes.
don't give fake info to mg because the receiver must show id to pick up the money and if you need to take back your cash because they couldn't pick it up or something went wrong then you are fucked because you need id to get back your money from the failed transaction same thing if mg refuses the transfer no id for the name you gave you lose use local bitcoins do a cash deal meet in person no problem or do a bank cash deposit cash in the mail or mg wu w w as a last choice.
snacktime on july amso im having some trouble im re establishing my buisness both on agora and tmg after i hit a rough patch i do not wish to discuss you may read about it in my other thread if you wish im starting out with a new email lelantos i ve decided that slacking on email security is not going to cut it anymore i also was having trouble getting my dymo labelwriter to print through tails if someone can walk me through this that would be stmore than likely it is a driver issue try reading the following page s to see if your printer model is mentioned try this page.
ahoy a as flight said your understanding of the process is spot on i was also able to decrypt your message with no problems well done now your next challenge is to post your public key in this thread and or send it to me so i can encrypt you a message calm seas captain.

tails can be a pain with wifi on new machines i find works wonders on hunks of crap like old thinkpads bought for cash bricks are the way forward have you considered whonix vm instead.
hello scroati had similar issues with the tails pgp applet or it not responsing at all the weird thing is that sometimes the issues happen and sometimes don't i downloaded pgp usb to my persistence drive and i am using that app now is very easy to use and you can import your keys directly from the tails pgp applet i know is not a fix but as a temporary solution it works for me best r.
m ya and space to the rescue thanks for chipping in both of you have a cheeky so it would seem size matters but it depends how you use it.
it seems that tails provides email services anyone would have a comment regarding this oops sorry i misinterpreted this post here will secure the email service i will use not provide an email service.
i hadn't gotten in deep enough to miss blackbank but i am bummed to see it go the way of a shifty scumbag dinosaur the garden seems like a prototype for the better way of doing things newer centralized markets have burned off the good reputation that sr garnered by sticking around and being reliable for years if i'm going to place my faith and cash in the hands of a stranger keeping the market's escrow systems involved feels like bringing another equally untrustworthy stranger for no good reason.
great work dh from our end our first thought is that's alot of extra work per order for example we have been doing direct orders since sr went down and have never left a customer out of pocket the only way it would be viable for us to implement some type of system such as the above would be to drastically reduce our customer base ie increase min order to mg or g we can see a benefit to the wider community of a system such as this but the time needed to implement this we imagine will be prohibitive imagine doing this for orders a day even even would soak up alot of time just some thoughts we would be very happy for someone to tell us we're wrong we had a late night so clarity may be lacking.

before i go on my little rant i'd like to reiterate the convenience and most importantly security of running storing vitually everything you do on tor and these markets on an external drive usb flash drive etc i've had such a hard time with pgp for mac a couple years ago i used portablepgp but when i recently got back in to using it i have errors coming from the terminal saying that my java jce files aren't signed correctly or something to that effect people have recommended online java based pgp services to me for their ease of use but that seems very very unsecure to me i've heard mixed opinions to answer the two people above me every pgp program i've ever used requires you to format your encrypted message to plain text unless of course the program does it on its own which is easy to do in any basic text editing program as to the question regarding key strength characters is perfect but less is aqeduate imo for anyone who uses these markets for personal use and is not a vendor characters is a typical key strength but in theory is times weaker than a character key all this is coming from someone who has a hard time with pgp myself it is much easier on windows and actually the creator or pgp encryption has stated something to the effect of he won't personally use macs because they don't work well with pgp i have both operating systems that i have to switch between because also from what i've learned observed mac is just less secure when using tor in general if anyone knows of a simple and safe mac friendly encryption software or understand my problem with the java jce i've literally tried everything i'd love some input the same goes for those online pgp encrypt decrypt services which i won't name here.
you aren't wrong so i've set up a fresh copy on a partition installed tor truecrypt and pgp are there any more security measures i can be taking if it isn't too much hassle for someone could you try sending me an encryped email which i can reply to just to get to grips with how it works that would be much appreciated is there a computer based email client i could use safely such as thunderbird thanks a lot.
hello there i have seen many warnings before posting links to the clearnet why is this i already accessed the clearnet and darknet at the same time in my ignorance and hope that i haven't made any mistakes also before i knew all the details of the security measures i had to take when accessing this site i found a lot of the information needed to get on here from reddit will this put me on the radar for tracking me obviously everyone is in some degree being tracked but am i at a higher risk because of this before i had tails i accessed this website from windows on tbb could i have exposed myself in this method i have not done anything illegal but am i at higher risk of being exposed should i chose to do so i am very new to this and i am very paranoid when it comes to this kind of thing that feeling of invincibility is not at all what i'm feeling haha.
this is a nice addition.
some of you are vm kali no none of this will help bios firmware is the most basic component to a computer system it s hard coded instructions that bootstrap the system so it can run an os without a bios your computer is a fancy paperweight a bad bios flash would result in a completely unresponsive computer when a computer is running in system management mode it is god mode can access secret super special instructions that can write directly to firmware ie flash a bios i would think the only way to prevent this is to have write disabled on the bios but not quite sure if even that would work read the articlesit explains how it works watch the video it s scary equationgroup are the most dangerous hackers out there right now and they have even infiltrated the systems of people who develop crypto softwarethink about thatfor all you know your next update to gpg or what have you has the rootkit embedded in it and gee all you have to do is give it the permissions to install and bam your fucked your whole system is owned all your personal data owned all your encrypted messages decrypted and owned it s doomsday forsecurity.
snacktime on november pmlets not jump to conclusions heredoes anyone have any real information relating to this cheers stalphabay was getting attacked so far that s all i have seen no word from other markets as of yet.
it's true greenbuddy what a sad day indeed here is the article.
someone mentioned this one before and so i post here supposedly multi sig only which is promising.
god i miss sr.
i would strongly encourage you to use a different method of accessing the darknet especially if you plan on placing orders or encrypting your address.
does anyone have any ideas where the u zfc ymshnfw teaqtxrrcbku hayl address could've come from i swear i copy pasted it from the private message you can't edit those after they're sent right coins still unspent i'm totally confused not to mention broke my physical wallet dat was broken into too eur there too jolly jolly christmas.
it's funny when you say they you're really only talking about the nsa dea most other agencies actually love tor and all it's users as it makes their secret communication harder to unmask the more noise in the network the easier it is for them to hide maybe love isn't the right word here need maybe appreciate either way more security is always better espacially once you've registered on their list as a privacy conscious person best to keep up your security as to not allow them to see even if they are watching.
jojen on november pmi am not sure if it is clever to use tor for your coinbase account i assume you want to buy bitcoin via a bank transfer in that case your real identity will be linked to your coinbase account anyway so no reason to use tor buy the coins using your clearnet browser then transfer them to a wallet not linkable to you you create and access this wallet only through tor and from there to the market vendor you want to buy from you can also configure tor browser to pick exit nodes from a specific country see good way to anonymously get bitcoin besides coinbase is localbitcoins com it allows you to buy bitcoins in person or via cash deposit or bank transfer directly from other people i don't have a bank account typically i just put money on a card i get from the dollar store that isn't re loadable what website would you recommend to purchase bitcoins with this disposable card other than localbitcoins really and what wallet would you recommend and should i get helix.
not bothing with this anymore upon reading android wont be enoug.
hi all im new to this as the usuall means of purchasing is just to unreliable please where do i start for god sake and i ain't no computer nerd eithe.
on january am low randomized fees when you deposit coins into your bitcoin blender account we will take a low randomized fee of between we make our fees low to keep coin mixing affordable and we randomize the fee to make analysis of our service less predictable in other words if our fee was a standard blockchain analysis would be made more trivial interested parties would need only look for suspected deposits and withdrawals tagged with a modifier our randomized fee takes this tool away from those who would seek to tie your transactions to you that would still mean several thousands of transactions that would have to be analysed and most mixers have an input address and a new address to send the coins to so its not too much of a security risk there unless i am missing something key.
britneystoke on may ami would not recommend currently using agora i have always loved the site but a lot of peoples deposits are not showing up lately my deposit has not showed for days with no reply from support i would recommend using alphabay or maybe abraxas till agora gets there shit figured out agora is now up and running full speed ahead captain cook.
please can someone help i have encrypted a pgp message it is about page long including my own public key that i added to the message the problem is the encrypted message is pages long too long to send as a private message or post on the forum if anyone could help assist me i would be most grateful i am using open office to write and read the text odt and asc and kleopatra to encrypt.
read below for active and the the best market placescheer.
doseheavy on november pmyou're a little late to the party dhl is already trying to capitolize on that i think we can do it better with less infrastructure we have a multisig system implemented here now in theory and all of the trusted vendors are here why would we want to pay a market to mediate the transactions when we have the resources trustworthy vendors to mediate ourselves aflao crypto srr is finishing bitwasp i asked for the amended lighthouse code be worked in so they have auction i have given all of the resources for vendors to get a vps and load whonix with amp so you can run a storefront forum or blog if you want to do some work help wizardx get the collective moved to tor and then we will work on a different phase of dn drugs it will go from the chemist to pgp signing for the vendors so people can tell quality and purity we were selling on the backend of the pms on thehive so there's no reason not to update it all and make the chemists players in the scene agian so the information isn't hoarded by a few and purity of product suffers thats what happened with the helio split i banter about opsec continuously and to make these changes happen everyone needs to be on the same albeit safe and secure playing field i'm going to build my idea and show you what kind of magic i'm working with if nobody wants to join it that's fine but when it comes to this sort of stuff i'm not so good at taking orders from others working with a community on their idea but if you have any comments for how this system could be improved i'd love to here about it not to mention there isn't any market doing this that i'm aware of my goal is to have a market with disputes because every single vendor is well trusted i was able to join dhl just be going to their site and registering and moreover you would want a market that's trusted to mediate it for you because you can rest assured that at the click of a button everything will be taken care of with no reason for concern stress or distress over anything you do on the site based on the nature of all of the vendors being trusted and within their own circle it either all turns to shit or it's all working correctly in theory or unless the majority of the vendors go on vacation and there's one little scrappy guy left in the corner snatching money from people but that's always a problem in any enviornment.
wow so much thought went into this but working directly with vendors whom have proven themselves this system is hard to beat i send coin they send product simple i will never join an open market agai.
if canada gfn went direct i would never need to use a market ever again.
someone mentioned this one before and so i post here supposedly multi sig only which is promising.
looking to buy lsd in new zealand south island today other seller fell through now trying this avenue can pay.
this is what i need too please.
all links verifed with dnstats comalways be careful to avoid phishing attempts.
if anything this is more proof that hos or whoever is a major target of law enforcement and that we really shouldn't be talking about this business on the clearnet anywhere than any notion that the whole sub is just a honeypot i think the arrogant sense that people on the sub have that their crimes aren't worthy of targeting from law enforcement these are people who live to make drug arrests i also think it's a bit alarmist to assert that it exists only for this purpose and that no worthwhile discussion takes place thereon and it's not insignificant seemingly to me that hos didn't have any overt problems with reddit when the reviews were adulatory and the attitude changed when they started to turn critical.
i m trying to train myself to never use clearnet via tor anymore but if i must i close my browser and log on with a new identity and a new tor circuit is that safe i never hit reddit but there s some emails that are clearnet and some review sites all are.
on november pmalphabay's going through a major phishing outbreak lots of folks have been losing their btc stolen just beware or avoid till the security issues are resolved sli realized i got phished when it told me to verify pin i typed it in correctly and it said invalid there was no getting out of that page withdrew my btc as fast as i could laying low from ab for the moment.
moneygram has a tendency to flag payments sent that are obviously to people you don't know they cancelled a transaction on me i was sending to egypt and they flagged it for some silly reason took weeks to get my money back from moneygram so now i only use western union they've given me no issues whatsoever and always send it instantly.
skallywaggins on november pmwhat makes you certain it's an exit scam i serioulsy hope not our i just lost a huge amount of money as i'm sure did everyone else including yourself but you seem certain it's officially an exit scam if it looks like a duck and waddles like a duck and quacks like a duck then it is probably a duck i feel your pain to the tune of around but the joke is on me i should never have left that in the wallet lesson learned.
just opened an account over there and for the life of me i can t seem to find the forum token for the life of me lol.
boneskoopa on february amhosting it locally is probably the best way to go about it agreed host locally enable js and ive used coinb in several times and the code is also verified on githu.
this is the link i use never used the 'rotation' ones.
hmm you re probably right nothing within the scope of personal use should normally be interesting enough for le to care about plus you even make yourself suspicious in their eyes by increasing your security efforts etc but then again i hate the thought of making it easy for them if they re gonna spy on us at least they should be working their asses off.
idk but it seems kinda covert like using burner phones and dead drops.
russia don't give a fuck as long as the right pockets are getting lined.
i just got locked out its unbelieveable i had the link on the bookmarks for months now if someone tells me i was using a phishing link they can fuck off to russia looking for a new market to buy ware.
dude don't make these kinds of claims and allegations unless you've done your research and can back your claims up with solid facts if you're going to be that paranoid don't use agora i'm taking a break from agora for personal reasons for a little while myself.
hello so i'm thinking about going dark for a while but as with many of you i'm sure you'd like some security in dissapearing off of the darknet and wanting surity that upon return you'll still have access to customers vendors and their great product well i think the time may be here imagine this a vendor only market based on trust no user registrations and the site is essentially hidden on tor pgp services by default and maximum security implemented each and every source should in theory be a somewhat experianced darknet market buyer so essentially the concept is this vendors start the market i have in mind jor since he seems to be the most well trusted a vendor only community that when vendors like a customer they are able to provide a one time registration url that is then to be sent to the user they choose that user may then register on the site and take part in purchasing product next part i'm trying to plan is anonymous vendor buying but i don't quite know how this will work out essentially since the community is based on trust to begin with vendors will be responsible for knowing how much stock they put into the store no vendors name will be shared and categories and organization will be added for instance say you wand lsd well mrpickles and jor both have it but instead of it saying both vendors there's only one listing with the combined features both mrpickles and jor both put up there if there's the exact same posting on both accounts the system takes from whomver has the most stock in their inventory to help balance out and for fairness different categories of drugs if it gets to that point would have their own similar features marijuana would be difficult but i hopefully don't imagine anyone serious about buying drugs buys and ships marijuana or perhaps i'm just naive but i'd like to protect people against that since it's the most widely busted drug and quite frankly is probably within kilometer of anywhere you are at any given point in time that you are on this earth how does this sound i would also provide the solution open source so that admins could inspect it vendors and be sure there's no exit scam awal code developed in there that i nor anyone else would be able to touch also the system would use bitchain info's public api to create destory transfer money from wallets and would allow downloadable wallet backups directly from bitchain info if my site ever goes down your coin is always right where you left it so long as you can remember where you wrote down downloaded your backup stuff too comments feedback plz i just want access to lsd for my whole life just incase i run through my entire stock pile and this whole thing dissapears lol i plan on going dark for a while but if this sounds good to the community perhaps it can be a christmas present to everyone that's been loyal also the vendors i imagine starting out with are jesusofrave mrpickles and liquidergot if you know of anyone else that should be on that list they would need the approval of i don't know some percentage of approval from all of the current active vendors if you see talk too any of these vendors please have them read this thread thanks love all of you edit if you would like to make anonymous donations for this service please donate to  lthvdqygnumu bycubpkn ennbthe amount of donations received will vastly improve the quality of service i can provide and shorten the amount of time taken if i start receiving a large amount of donations i will put up a site as a placeholder for the service with accurate information if you donate be sure to send me a private message with your userid that you use across the darknet or send me a pgp key and a message personally you will be heavily rewarded for assisting in the development process of this but it has been undecided as of yet it's possible you could receive a vast amount of free lsd mdma if this takes off like i plan on it doing update for tech specs  sterlingsword on november amtech specs updatewhile writing and designing i've came up will the following new additions that will make this new market extremely difficult to take down and give a fresh breath of confidence to the darknet marketplace users will no longer have to fret about bitcoins being locked into a marketplace if they choose to use mine internal x ca and spooferi've developed my own spoofer and my system stores every single bit of data using a kb x certificate to spoof every single last detail plain text isn't stored anywhere and no cpu power is saved when it comes to encryption even if it's a simple hello walletmy website is going to use an auto generated bitchain wallet and provide backup abilities your funds won't ever be dependent on my system simply download the wallup backup directly relayed through tor too you via bitchain if my site goes down simply do your thing and log into the wallet using your backup the wallet will also be completely accesable through my website all it will do is connect to bitchain to determine balance etc no funds will be stored on my site auto migrationthe server will automatically put up special text in specific areas to indicate time when timer goes off the website will peridiocally shut down for a period of hours and transfer to an entirely new server again to thwart le this will happen as desired or x per week databases won't migrate as often due to their security in design maybe per week and imagining the size of the database as it grows while a migration is in place users will be able to use the direct trade information posted by vendors if they do so post it during so you may log into your system wallet via bitchain and send your btc to the wallet address that you have in doing so the description and the text will show up the vendor will have the ability on system restart to archive the order and thus enter it into the system thus depleting stock etc purchase will continue to process as if it was purely done in the system.

study buddy on july pmenjoy it tell me if you like it it already on its way to you got home late last night after a few drinks and decided to try of the asian xtal tabs all i have to say is i now have a new baseline for lsd tab strength i can't believe those were only rated at ug are you sure you didn't mix them up with the aalbion asian xtal ug you are advertising as coming soon the keyboard on my phone was melting under my fingertps the colors were all over the place and in the dark with my eyes closed green red spiderwebs fractals everywhere i also highly recommend watching the netflix series sense while tripping the music scenery combination is amazin i actually paused at a night time cityscape and while the show was pasued watched lights in buildings go on and and the traffic moved it was awesome thank you so much i had a great night.
let s hope no.
got any more info on this where to look edit okay so it's on r deepdotweb seems legit also seems like not much of a risk not knowing too much about how something like this was obtained i wonder if this is in fact a sign of some dangerous insecurity or not i mean is there some way a script kid could get this and nothing else this list is now being used to spam messages to all dhl users claiming to be site administrators who need donations to fight the attack lol ri.
it's been said from the beginning i really don't hope it turns out true.
so far so goodno proble.
the ckl obj gypcu onion should work but make sure your own port in electrum is set to and not the port of server is and tcp is enabled the tor browser bundle was updated to connect to this port connects pretty fast from my experience you could also try to use the auto connect feature but i'm not sure how safe it is definitely update to the latest electrum version first older versions had some features that could leak your ip most of these things have been fixed but i'm not sure they are all gone if you're using tails it should be fine i think since it routes through tor by default but i'm not a security expert.
but veracrypt has not been analysed as much and if you use tails you'll be able to open a truecrypt volume but you'd need to setup an administrative password luks is a great option too as it works well you wouldn't have the ability to setup a hidden volume though it's up to you to decide if you need that or not.
according to a report in archiv ihned cz the owner of sheep marketplace thomas ji ikovsk who was responsible to one the biggest exit scam in dark net history of around m at the time when the bitcoin value was extremely high was arrest for money laundering after purchasing a luxury house and trying to launder the stolen money after converting it from btc using fake companies and transferring it to his girlfriend account link to the story below warning clearnet.
low randomized fees when you deposit coins into your bitcoin blender account we will take a low randomized fee of between we make our fees low to keep coin mixing affordable and we randomize the fee to make analysis of our service less predictable in other words if our fee was a standard blockchain analysis would be made more trivial interested parties would need only look for suspected deposits and withdrawals tagged with a modifier our randomized fee takes this tool away from those who would seek to tie your transactions to you.
undetermined on july amhi all i ve been out for a while and i probably missed out on some things that happen ed but it seems to me that the kingdom forum is not active any more the link i have might be an old one anyone knows about a new link or has more info on what s happening stay on the safe free sideyeah there s a different rl now don t have it anymore but like why seemed like absolutely nothing was going on over there and what was was garbag.
not had a single problem with helix just register for an account though the heliz light doesnt sound safe for larger amount.
yeah i got mine after day.
what's up with that agora link is that a pishing link or did they just add a second url.
p nd s on may amquote from knuckles on may pmi do miss the original silk road seriously at this point it seems so nostalgic ditto nothing feels the same teardrop topic showing some love abraxaslike that setting up listings was a breezethe delayed messaging is also a nice featur.
it means either there was a remaining balance left unpaid by the sender or he didn't pay for the postage at all maybe your sender dropped the package into a dropbox forgetting to put the postage stamp on it i've done that before but i realized immediately and had them send someone out to open the box so i could affix the stamp you should be fine they won't make you sign for it unless of course it required a signature anyway just for unpaid postage so there's nothing that could validate a search and seizure warrant if you're concerned at all though just make sure you clean house before he gets back.
i trust these guys here more than i care to say i appreciate the shit out of this.
trufflelover on october amhas anything good come out of dhl it seems like it's scarce and not many vendors there have many reviews if any at all it seems to have alot of potential from what others say i would love to grab an invite as well but i'll wait until i can actually buy something from dhl to make use of it.
alot has happened in the past month it seems like a few rare events regarding markets and bitcoins have put people in a state of worried frenzy this may be a good opportunity to explore what all this means to us personally as well as a whole it certainly has been exciting i hope that this all wasn't too good to be true and if it is than that is the way it is meant to be.
yeah from now on it's gonna be a dedicated virtual machine for all bitcoin tor dealings also time to leave windows for good shit they got steam on linux now checked pms both in outboxes only address there is albions if anyone wants to spread a little christmas cheer for someone who dun goofed and got fucked for it vqxhhj sbbfn grvwutnqad uj xb td every satoshi counts i got eur to my name and still a few weeks to go till the next paycheck pretty sure that's my rx address or is it who knows.
ok i quit being lazy for a second and just looked up how to default this off for all new members this just tested out successfully for a new user on a test forum edit the file sources register phparound line right above registration options are always default options add this regoptions 'extra register vars' 'show online' it already knew that was a potential possible registration option so maybe there's a simpler way to do it but it works so that would obviously cover all new user registrations but you would still want to run that query to disable it for all existing users just once update smf members set show online obviously use whatever your forum table prefix is if not smf i try to forget how horrible php is so hopefully someone actually runs with this and the minutes it took to check this out wasn't in vain.
this type of stuff has been argued endlessly over the years frankly this is pretty much a waste of time bit keys are good enough they were are certainly good enough for ed snowden laura poitras and glenn greenwald these people are directly in the nsa s line of fire if they don t use larger keys then i see little reason for anyone else to spitfir.
this looks very suspicious perhaps law enforcement are now running the business in order to catch users.
the godself print i think only albertheijn has these tabs he was on evo but now that's gone he has a thread here but in the inactive vendors section link below is also on agora it's the godself tabs you're talking about it's nice to hear they're strong i only have a few myself and yet to try them what would you guess half is g were the oevs strong if you could report on them in the thread linked below i'm sure all those involved would appreciate it.
i highly reccomend this thread from evilzone if you decide to do something illegal on the internet the people on that forum really know their shit always keep your browser up to date problem is that the feds are heavily buying day exploits wich might be a disaster if you are not being carefull or you get too big.
i use reliable never down and fee is between and.
am i just being impatient have it set to connect to ckl obj gypcu onion this worked fine before my temp leave should i just wait it out for the connection i have tried other servers and they did not connect either any advice would be greatly appreciated cheers rhet.
i knew this would be happening over and over again if it s not greedy admins then it would be some other letter agency i think the next one to step out on us will be iddle arth the hobbits social network seems to be down for too long now and there were numerous complaints about people not being able to withdraw their funds also at the beginning of the month there was a hacker bragging that they were able to get their ip address and cause page crashing by insertion code in a post agorah seems to be pretty knocked out right now with their almost down time i think the admins do not want to steal the funds but they don t seem that interested in fixing the problem or allowing a separate url for vendors to work their orders and customers to withdraw their funds.
i really appreciate it what would be a really good place for a new person like me to start buying stuff from here like im really into cannabis and i live in the extreme south coast so i am unsure if anything is safe to order on here or not hmm i also heard that you shoudn't order anything to be sent to your address why is that is this true where should i have my stuff sent to what is your most reliable place how many times have you made a transaction sorry for all the questions these are just things i really want to know.
o captain my captain thanks for taking the time to reply and help out a friend in need i've been playing around with gpg a fair bit now and actually feel quite confident with the basic process however there seems to be one major stumbling block the format of the messages i've contacted two different vendors and each time they've sent me encrypted messages i have been unable to open them i finally figured out why via someone much smarter than i that the format was incorrect when i copy and paste from mg to textedit something goes wrong and the gpg system cannot read open them my online friend was able to reformat it into the 'correct' way and hey presto it worked am i the only one that has come across such an obstacle is there an easier smoother way around it any thoughts info advice would be greatly appreciated as i don't want to involve a rd party each time i want to open up a message.
god i miss sr.
summa iru on april pmthe godself print i think only albertheijn has these tabs he was on evo but now that's gone he has a thread here but in the inactive vendors section link below is also on agora it's the godself tabs you're talking about it's nice to hear they're strong i only have a few myself and yet to try them what would you guess half is g were the oevs strong if you could report on them in the thread linked below i'm sure all those involved would appreciate it for the detailed response summa i think it was the godself ones i could probably rate half easily at ug could it be more i bought them locally in my country but now nobody has them was just sold as alex greys not godself so jealous if that's the same batch you guys have in your hands thanks for all the links sorry for the silly question but whenever i copy a link into a new tab from this forum my browser or any other browser for that matter refuses to open the link any idea what that could be the only way i can browse something on this site if i click there manually so strang.
she's not selling on any markets that i'm aware of but she has a thread here.
awesome job putting the tut together dh i think this will help out the newer vendors trying to get on their feet i'd be more inclined to try some of the newer guys if there was something like this in place i'll avoid giving you karma too for now since i seem to remember you saying something about wanting to stay negative in a thread here somewhere lo.
yeah i have imported the key and everything.
sillywabbit on october pmsuppose it is all a big hoot privacy encryption all a smokescreen and the entire deep web is a government sponsored experiment to monitor drug use patterns so that they might effect new policy or decide who deserves to get a slap on the wrist for being an irresponsible drug user then what just a thought likely has been mulled over before i did reckon this to be the case with sr as the fbi takeover corresponded exactly with a large cut in extra government spending after obama pissed off the rebublicans or something it would make total sense to collect data like facebook not sure now don t understand the security issues that threatened agora and all that i think will make sense anyway as people need an opiate or else they re going to revolt it s certainly in the government s favour to have a stoned populatio.
i use grams regularly for the vendor reviews and btc services i never use it to actually search for things negative from shady vendors tends to disappear on the markets it does not on grams i also use it to verify pgp keys when possible.
alberthoffman on march pmare you working for agora defending them dude why the hell should i lie about swedish sek on my bitcoint wallet on agora that was stoleni read on other forums like reddit that it happened another guy to they stole hes money and they answered him on support that he had some keylogger virus that got into hes wallet thats bullshit my computer is secure as possible im working with it and computer in my eyes they are scammers and i wont deposit there anything morehow long ago did you send a message to support there and what did they say.
well this has happened several times in the past and agora has then fixed the issue but they could be shutting down for good this time ya know who knows but probably agora's not going away just yet my guess next time for both this reason and opsec make sure to go to your wallet page and generate a new deposit address if the page refreshes saying you successfully generated a new address but it's the same as before there are problems with deposits hope that helps.
i remember reading somewhere that sharedcoin on blockchain isn't as good as the proper tumbling services will try and remember and post the lin.
zoxeebee on october pmget a machine which allows you to replace the bios with free software the new firmware may require disassembly and wiring up the flash chip directly the reward for the trouble is a laptop that runs free and open source software only for a very good solution in all reality i don't think this bios infector is going to hit allot of people in any way that's going to compromise our freedoms and if it did and i think allot of people would lose faith in our government if they knew that all of their private data was not really private then again many are sad sheep they would just tuck their heads down and let a small few tell them how to eat shit and like it as far as what we do it's on a mass scale that i think would only show that a very large body of the population enjoy and benefit from using certain drugs and any resistance to it is futile but it is good to be aware of this kind of malware and the rediculous level of spying that is going on and is getting more intrusive every day.
abraxas is a solid market i don t think you ll be disappointed and by the way it usually picks up in business when markets as big as agora are down.

thefieldmouse on april pmquotewhat's the advantages of buying direct off a vendors site verses buying direct off a vendor through email well nothing too much i think a vendor operated site or market share the same negative consequences of possibly storing and not protecting your information as well as it should however after doing some email deals i must say that the process of ordering direct can be more cumbersome time consuming where it is more streamlined in a market type setting with a cart checkout function vendors storing information is a darknet issue whether it's a market email or vendor site thefieldmouse hits the nail on the head during orders through email is more time consuming since people don't have darknet emails up all the time so usually it takes a couple messages and possible over a day to place an order where a vendor market you can just click the product you want and pay directly no contact needed scidm.
any know something about this marketit seems like scam.
i've never been had any problems with alpha though i keep seeing so much reports of them scamming this and that honestly if they were that bad then so many people would not be using them stillive made over orders on alpha the only problems ive seen is slight delays in deposit and such nothing a little wait wont solv.
sorry to hear that its frustrating that we really can't catch these scammers.
we're doing some reasearch on abraxes alphabay middleearth nucleus marketplaces looking to expand cheers s.

actually now that i just went through the process again to make sure make sure when you're exporting your new private key name asc to your usb desktop that you pick the option on the bottom right as 'armored pgp keys' and once again this is only for tails i've no idea otherwise.

it s looking as to whether it was a legit hack the person claiming to have hacked it is the person claiming to be a group of people who will target a single market and create as much fud surrounding the market as possible on public forums in hopes that the owner will pay to get their help fixing the vulnerability that s not to say they aren t capable of actually hacking though.
there is away to use electrum in tails without persistence it does however require an external usb or sd disk where to store your wallet and the electrum app we will not use the tails pre installed electrum version we will be using the downloaded one i ll explain below how to start it btw i am not saying this is the correct way to do things i personally will use tails persistence but since you asked here is a way to do it in your external data disk create a secret password protected partition using tails disk utility this will be only visible from tails and it will be like a persistent drive for your data here is where you store your wallet and electrum app in electrum site downloads get installation from python sources and download linux version once unzipped you ll have a folder save this in your secret disk all you need to do is access this folder from your terminal in terminal command line type cd and drag the folder from your desktop to terminal it should look something like cd amnesia externaldisk electrum this opens the folder in terminal and once you are inside the folder command line shows something like amnesia exernaldisk electrum once you are in the folder run electrum type electrum electrum app should open the you create a wallet and save this wallet in your secret disc file looks something like mywallet dat by default each time electrum starts will load the last wallet used make sure to create a backup copy of your wallet in another secret disk just in case hope that helps sorry for the short technical explanations on linux terminal but i am not expert just an average user.
bitlaundry is designed to help unlink accounts from each other it does that by providing a well known and hopefully popular service here's how it works imagine that alice wishes to send bitcoins to bob bob sadly is not well liked alice would rather not have anyone know that she sent bob bitcoins so alice enters bob's bitcoin address into the form at bitlaundry and selects a delivery schedule alice gets a one time use address from bitlaundry alice sends her bitcoins to that address and they get all mixed up with bitlaundry's other bitcoins bitlaundry waits until alice's bitcoins are received with confirmations bitlaundry deletes the database link between the one time use address and bob's address bitlaundry sends bitcoins out to bob according to the delivery schedule.
actually that is a legitimate way of verifying key ownership while i have never used p nd s services i have through back ups of old services an sr key from them using that i can definitively say that the same key was used to make p nd s' signed message as they used to use on sr please note this only means that user claiming to be p nd s has the same key as old p nd s on sr this by no means means they have not been since compromised nor is this a recommendation of their services but the key is valid ideally you would date and include the platform of any signed message if in the future banana jack on a different site asks for pgp signed verification they could copy paste this message however that's probably pretty unlikely.
spitfire always look to the future my first computer a mhz with mb of ram man was that fast i am sure that if i tried it would take me forever to try and crack an easy md encryption where my duel core ghz cpu will spit it out in no time now instead of using cpu s we moved to a better solution of gpu s the next level will be quantum computers and if you think you will be safe for a while longer think again when looking for a good security blanket keep in mind that you need to be looking into the future and find one that will keep you safe not just cover it up for now to just add one more point i have seen many secure uncrackable bullet proof server or service get taken down one after another because our best today is nothing to what tomorrow will have for us.
on november ami opened an account there the day before and made an order from you mr pickles yesterday batches of lsd i agree with what's been said about the dhl no bullshit vendors all seems pretty reputable and more importantely as very passionate about the quality of their products very secureeasy transactions the only downside which i think will pick up slowly is a lack of variety i couldn't find any dmt so i have to look for it somewhere else and i don't like having too many accounts around i hope dhl starts getting more reputable vendors i look forward to it being my stop shop sltrue we should get the good drshrooms check in the league pickles.

to add on to tt's post one can also purchase through local bitcoins with cash via online methods look for listings that offer cash deposit at certain bank branches these require you to go to the bank branch of choice and fill out an out of state deposit slip you fill this form out and give the cash to the teller and they deposit it into the account of the btc seller your btc's are then released to you you don't even have to be a member of the bank bank of america has always been very fast and hassle free also with this method you usually aren't charged a ridiculous price for your cryptocurrency just remember to tumble your coins to an intermediate wallet before using them to purchase from a vendor blockchain info accessed through tor allows for the quick creation of a wallet that can be used to tumble the coins.
scroat on march pm they have everything that was done click by click order by order all my passwords all my orders and history of things i bought i went to jail for this and was let out early for good behavior dude this is bombshell shit right here please expand on this more if you're willing or just pm me if you'd rather keep this private how in the world would they be able to get your passwords unless they installed a keylogger or something first i would like to apologize in replying so late i didnt expect someone to reply or ask something further after i posted on top of that after what happened previously i now use a foolproof method and theres no way in hell i can be tracked i had considered myself one of the smart ones using tails running off encrypted usb drive clearing my order history with the sites washing bitcoins before using them etc the worst part about it was the vendor i ordered from was a sweetheart and i should have used the option of paying for product before ship but since we are all trusted members i didnt use that option and would have paid upon delivery bad move not only did i get arrested and wasnt able to pay the vendor many of my friends on here collaborated however and did pay the vendor which i am grateful jor those peoples who did i wont say who for opsec reasons but i also lost my job and missed the birth of my first child i was fired from my job and my license for that field was taken away as well so i could never again get a job in that position and it was a nice and cushy job which paid amazingly well they didnt exactly give me a file and say hey heres how we did it motherfucka but from what they were willing to show me i believe they used the data flowing through tor to track what i was doing it seemed highly likely that a keylogger may have been involved because the information was just fuck like wtf how did you guys get all this on top of that the tails usb os didnt even save so it was a fresh tails everytime it was booted so nothing was taken from cached info the whole ordeal ruined my career put a huge strain on my marriage and most of all my reputation on dn and with my coworkers and friends now i use a fooproof method which will make your head spin only downside is i can only login when certain auspicious events align and sometimes it can be months before i am able to login if you wanna know what i do now you can pm me and through encrypted msg's i can share what i do but again be patient it may take a wihle for me to be able to login again dont email me on my pgp key address as its bogus in the end i brought this upon myself i chose to buy drugs illegally and after the idiot vendor just threw xanax in an envelope i was already bleeding in a pool of shark infested water i did the crime and i did the time and more to all those who were affected by my disappearance i apologize and for my friends here who covered my cost of the sheet i am forever grateful as always i did will and do always love this community of my fellow trippers and rainbowland enthusiasts much love and good vibes to you all pink floyd shine on you crazy diamond part vi ix.
i would stay away from russia based on recent announcements to ban tor do a search released in february quoting myselfquote from banana jack on april pmi think any country with enough political capital to be able to pull off withstanding pressures from the western economies would only do so if it benefitted them usually the countries able to do this wouldn t tolerate exposing their people to the things found on such a server or would run it themselves as an economic or cultural attack russia does not like tor just because of anonymity but because it is an usa government developed program too any countries that feel it could lead to a national privacy intrusion will not help readily unless it is in their political interests btc payments work with individuals and not large governments if you could limit traffic to their country they might support in defience.
there is no exact way to answer this question except that your concerns are valid it's very possible for a vendor to be le it's also possible than inexperienced vendors keep more detailed records of your private info than they should this being said it's also possible that experienced vendors are making mistakes they should be avoiding you should probably assume your identity is compromised and wipe everything change addresses change pgp change username sticking with vendors others have reported success isn't but it's definitely a worthwhile precaution in this environment.
nucleus or me.
nonya i tried your exercise it worked thanks i sent you a pm.
bitblender is a good one however they were hacked a while ago so still proceed with caution i'm suprised helix wasn't mentioned here another good way to mix coins is to buy alt coins then trade with other alts then convert to bitcoin best be sure of your exchange rates though don't want to screw yourself.

some of you are vm kali no none of this will help bios firmware is the most basic component to a computer system it's hard coded instructions that bootstrap the system so it can run an os without a bios your computer is a fancy paperweight a bad bios flash would result in a completely unresponsive computer when a computer is running in system management mode it is god mode can access secret super special instructions that can write directly to firmware ie flash a bios i would think the only way to prevent this is to have write disabled on the bios but not quite sure if even that would work read the articles it explains how it works watch the video it's scary equationgroup are the most dangerous hackers out there right now and they have even infiltrated the systems of people who develop crypto software think about that for all you know your next update to gpg or what have you has the rootkit embedded in it and gee all you have to do is give it the permissions to install and bam your fucked your whole system is owned all your personal data owned all your encrypted messages decrypted and owned it's doomsday forsecurity.
well it would be best to customize the forum to set it off by default yeah but a quick simple workaround in the mean time would be to just run this query every so often to shut it off for everybody all at once update smf members set show online this could be done from a cron job to run every minutes a la someuser mysql u sqlusername ppassword dbname e 'update smf members set show online.
i don't think i've ever seen a market act like eic they seemed so legit to me site was clean functional and responsive then all of a sudden the admins went dark i can't for the life of me figure out why they are still live with the withdrawals and deposits not working it's a very situation indeed definitely do not put any btc into the site until everything is functional even if does become functional again i would proceed very cautiously.
good it was a real pain to set it up manually.
ulbricht guilty in silk road online drug trafficking trialjury convicts on seven counts doesn't believe ulbricht was just the fall guy by joe mullin feb pm utcnew york a jury on wednesday convicted ross ulbricht on federal charges accusing him of being the mastermind behind the online drug bazaar silk road where hundreds of millions of dollars in illegal goods were traded before law enforcement shuttered the site in late the jury of twelve reached its guilty verdicts on all seven counts after deliberating less than four hours ulbricht faces up to life in prison he'll be sentenced at a separate proceeding in a few months the seven charges include three drug counts distributing or aiding and abetting the distribution of narcotics distributing narcotics or aiding and abetting distribution over the internet and conspiracy to violate narcotics laws he was also convicted on a fourth count of conspiracy to run a continuing criminal enterprise which involves supervising at least five other people in an organization in addition he was convicted on conspiracy charges for computer hacking distributing false identification and money laundering the verdict was handed up to us district judge katherine forrest in a manila envelope she gave it to her court clerk who read it out the judge then polled each juror asking them to verbally concur in the verdict as the verdict was read ulbricht's father kirk ulbricht held his head midway through the reading ulbricht turned to face his family and friends who filled about two rows of courtroom benches after it was read ulbricht was taken out of the room by the same two federal marshals who led him in each day of the trial it's not the end ulbricht's mother lyn ulbricht said to her son as he was escorted from the courtroom several other relatives in front rows simply shouted out a quick goodbye in the back of the gallery a supporter shouted ross is a hero the year old ulbricht who the authorities said made millions of dollars in commissions put on a brief defense of just three character witnesses during the three week criminal trial ulbricht's defense attorney joshua dratel told reporters gathered outside the courthouse that he plans to appeal dratel said the judge presiding over the trial hampered his defense by excluding evidence and witnesses a position echoed by the defendant's mother the defense was shackled she told reporters gathered outside the courthouse after the verdict it's not fair dratel didn't say much about the negotiations before the trial but he did say the government didn't make a meaningful offer that would have reduced ulbricht's possible sentence the trial proceeded over days spread over three weeks during closing arguments tuesday dratel told jurors that the data authorities seized from ulbricht's computer connecting him to the site could have been created by others the internet is not what it seems he told the six woman six man panel dratel has said his client who did not take the stand had created the site but was the fall guy for the site's real operators prosecutors countered dratel telling jurors there was a mountain of evidence that ulbricht was the dread pirate roberts thousands of pages of chats with silk road admins and other management documents were recovered from his open laptop there's no dispute when the defendant was arrested he was logged in as dread pirate roberts prosecutor serrin turner told jurors there were no little elves that put all of that evidence on the defendant's computer.
i found this pastebin that had a list of fake onions used to conduct mitm attacks on tor users by collecting passwords and possibly injecting code through a transparent proxy to these onions tmg is on this list and the onion address that cloned it is similar to the real one is this legit the onion address given is a proxy to tmg wouldn t it be good for the admins to investigate this a number of the user accounts and registrations could have been compromised i haven t followed the address to check if the proxy is still active but has anyone else seen this what s the story here.
it's human error i just want to know if it was just me abusing and being stupid or someone abusing me being stupid.
doses lysergic on january amquote from dxuutx on december pmif anything this is more proof that hos or whoever is a major target of law enforcement and that we really shouldn't be talking about this business on the clearnet anywhere than any notion that the whole sub is just a honeypot i think the arrogant sense that people on the sub have that their crimes aren't worthy of targeting from law enforcement these are people who live to make drug arrests i also think it's a bit alarmist to assert that it exists only for this purpose and that no worthwhile discussion takes place thereon and it's not insignificant seemingly to me that hos didn't have any overt problems with reddit when the reviews were adulatory and the attitude changed when they started to turn critical lol speak english its not insignificant it is not not significant when you use a double negative you obscure your meaning thereon this word has been used not since again not one knows what the fuck not insignificant' again that 'hos didn't' have a problem when the reviews were positive adulatory if you yern to be not unlike leo tolstoy well then i'll just not continue writing now by not insignificant i mean to caution against thinking the timing is insignificant as one may i'm sorry you have a problem with the way i speak i don't think it invalidates my points.
pmed the vendor albion who i know to be trustworthy and general awesome human being he was really confused as what happened and told that he can't see the money the money is still there though i even checked with my friend that i wasn't hallucinating when i copy pasted the number from the private message please admins techwizards help me out her.
the point i want to make is that illegal drug operations that achieve long term success tend to cooperate with corrupt law enforcement officers by means of bribes this is probably much better strategy than trying to fight the state head on or searching for a lawless place where no business could be done due to incessant fighting violence and political instability.
nope i can t see it either.
it sounds like you have gpg win installed just open gpa exe copy paste your text from the odt to the clipboard tool in the program and then press encrypt that way you only sent flat text instead of all the formatting options included in the odt you should save a lot of space like this.
good guide to you i've always heard about tails but never knew really what it was until now i'll be doing this very soon thank.
sure as long as you can get a connection i don't see why not public wifi is used by many to surf the darkne.
hi i'm looking for a marketplace where industrial mahinery and operation manuals are offered does anyone have a suggestion on where to look.
humblebumble on september pmright forehead slap i guess my assumption was that those sites would be ssl encrypted usps tracking is indeed ssl encrypted should be noted that determined law enforcement agencies only need to control a single certificate authority that browsers accept by default to successfully conduct a mitm attack on it would surprise me if they did i'd use tails with js off.
oldisgold on february pmwhat s the best and most trustworthy btc mixer out there right now blond wigfog i would say that bitcoinfog is the best blockchain info privides shared send and i believe it s also quite good if you re really paranoid you can chain them like you btc fog you shared send you but it s also more expensive.
wish hansa would get the amount of users it deserves.
stay away i wouldn't even log onto the site it was left with nobody at the helm for several days before it went down then it pops back up with no explanation there is a strong possibility that it has been taken over by le with vendors and buyers of bulk being at the greatest risk.
whole disk encryption and file back again now that we have pgp figured out hopefully i want to remind you that using pgp whenever possible is very very very important one of the pitfalls of silk road is that some of the administrators including ross himself did not always communicate using pgp encryption once ross was busted they had access to his servers and his computers and anything that wasn't encrypted was wide open for them to look at most users on silk road believe that ross had stored personal information about some of admins and moderators on his computer in plain text that was used to make more arrests of silk road users one of the reasons why i would suggest for you to store your pgp keys and other sensitive data on a sd card is that if that day comes when you are compromised and you get a knock at your door you have time to dispose of that sd card or usb drive quickly even better if you have a micro sd card that plugs into an sd adapter then you can snap it with your fingers or at the very least hide it usbs would need to be smashed into pieces and it might not be easy to do this in the heat of the moment so do what you feel best about but always prepare for the day they might come for you but our next topic brings us to something called whole disk encryption or full disk encryption from here on out i will refer to it as fde full disk encryption tails has a fde feature built into it which is another reason why i encourage the use of tails it has many of these features to protect you essentially fde will protect your drive whether sd or usb from the people who may come for you one day the method in which it does this is it formats your drive and rewrites the file system in an encrypted fashion so that it can be only be accessed by someone who has the pass phrase if you lose your passphrase just like in pgp there is no recovery your only choice is to format the drive and start over again so make sure you remember it and please for the love of god allah buddah etc don't store the passphrase on your hard drive somewhere the tutorial on how to do this is located at the following webpage again always prepare for the day they come knocking encrypt everything use pgp when communicating with others and always shred your files when finished with them which brings me to my next topic file shredding file shredding is extremely important and here is why if you delete a file from your computer you are only deleting where it is located on the drive it is still on the actual drive just it's location data has been removed if you take a file recovery tool you can recover virtually any file that you have recently removed file shredding combats this by overwriting files instead the idea is that instead of removing the file's location you need to overwrite the file with random data so that is becomes unrecoverable there are a lot of debate happening on whether you can overwrite a file once or if you need to do it multiple times supposedly the nsa recommends times supposedly the department of defense recommends times and an old paper by a man named peter gutmann written in the 's recommended times needless to say i personally think between times is sufficient and several people out there believe time will get the job done the reasoning behind this is that some people believe the drive may miss some files the first time it over writes them and to be more complete you should do multiple passes do what you feel most comfortable with but i even think passes would be sufficient although it wouldn't hurt every now and then to run passes and just leave it overnight the programs that can do file shredding are ones you will want to run from windows or whatever operating system your computer is running these programs can delete your files from your recycling bin delete your temporary internet files and even wipe your free disk space to make sure everything gets cleaned up you always need to think did i have any sensitive material on my hard drive if so maybe i need to shred my free disk space when empting your recycle bin you should always use a shredder when only deleting under gb at a time you can easily do passes pretty quickly to put this in perspective the leader of a group called lulzsec name topiary has been banned as part of his sentence from using any type of file shredding applications so that if the fbi wants to check up on him they can file shredding keeps your deleted files actually deleted here are some file shredding applications you can use we're going to talk about removing harmful metadata from files and some other topics as well.
thanks scroat connected today.
not surprised either but what a shame i mean it s just the same agenda by our us gov and the same cycles of thinking and the jury i seriously wonder what kind of people get selected for these kind of casesi can almost guarantee they were middle of the road conservative mind yer p s and q s darlin super religious le loving tools tools they are and we all know if the juror was your average hipster hacker musician type it would have beendifferent but then again maybe even then the jurors would fear their own reps wud sour if theylet ulbricht off the hook it don t matter anyway judge has final say the whole thing is rigged our whole gov is still run by a bunch of stuffy suits who can t imagine a genius like ulbrichtbeing able to do what he did and allowing it to continue no because we have a bunch ofoutdated and immoral laws that say if you do this life in prison and ya know what it all boils down to powerour gov cannot allow certain power and money to be handled by one person that a person has the ability to change the world the way we interact in a way that goes against the grain and so ulbricht might be looking at life behind bars for what how did he hurt anyone what was immoral about anything he did aside from the calling hits accusations it s so fucked and everytime i watch the news same shit same idiots in the mediain officerunning the same lies games lost in their own head issues of what s wrong in the worldwhen really the only thing that is wrong is what s inside what happened to the heart the love it s all fucking money and who s in charge who can fuck who betterwho has the biggest cock i m so tired of all this shit i sometimes just want off this planet i swear.
exif datai forgot to mention above when talking about metadata that when it comes to photos there is another risk involved called exif data this is another form of meta data specifically related to images and may not be properly removed by metadata anonymisation toolkit mentioned before exif data stands for exchangeable image file format and affects jpg jpef tif and wav files a photo taken with a gps enabled camera can reveal the exact location and time it was taken and the unique id number of the device this is all done by default often without the user's knowledge in december anti virus programmer john mcafee was arrested in guatemala while fleeing from alleged persecution in belize which shares a border vice magazine had published an exclusive interview with mcafee on the run that included a photo of mcafee with a vice reporter taken with a phone that had geotagged the image the photo's metadata included gps coordinates locating mcafee in guatemala and he was captured two days later to avoid this only take photos that use png because it does not store exif data to check if your photo has any revealing exif data attached to it check out this site you can download a tool by doing a quick search online to see what exif data may be contained in your photos before you upload them be very careful with any files that you upload online because you never know what type of harmful data could be attached in them it helps to use tails but always consider everything you put online as a potential piece of evidence to be used against you and always prepare for the day the feds come to your door.
p nd s on may pmquotein regards to sr can you link something thats shows you were a top rated vendor and what did you sell if you need to research legacy sales of a vendor on the darknet try in the vendor name in the upper right corner and click search i sold scopolamine chem guides and custom chem consulting ok that would explain why we didnt have you in our data base we mainly store lsd vendors and a few others so as for your current product it remains to be known how it is thank.
combining tor with a vpnwelcome back readers today i want to talk about a greatly debated topic should i use a vpn with tor should i use tor to connect to a vpn or use a vpn to connect to tor let me say first of all that when you are browsing the internet without tor you should probably be using a vpn regardless of whether or not you are using tor and make sure that the vpn uses some form of encryption as well for those of you who are very beginner think about when you connect to a public wifi network at a coffee shop or an airport and you get all these warnings that your requests sent over this network are vulernable all networks but especially public wifi networks are vulnerable to traffic analysis put this together with the fact that some internet service providers monitor your activity to some level and you can see why it might be a good idea to always use an encrypted method of using the internet at the very least to protect your personal information when you are entering credit cards usernames and passwords as well as other personal data online again especially if you are using a public wifi network choosing a vpn that uses at least bit encryption like tor is good practice and will stop the majority of eavesdroppers but if you can get bit encryption you are even safer before we get into whether or not we should be using a vpn together with tor i want to give you a few warnings regarding how you should be using a vpn if you are going to be using a vpn for any type of freedom fighting make damn sure that your vpn does not keep logs this is actually a lot harder than you might think many vpn providers will claim to not keep logs of your activity in order to gain you as a customer because they have to compete with the other providers out there customers are going to trend towards providers who offer no identifying data retention unfortunately this claim of theirs is not always the real case and i will give you an example there is a well known vpn provider named hidemyass that previously claimed not to keep logs of its users unfortunately when met with a court order from their government in the uk they handed over evidence of a suspected hacker from an internet group lulzsec which helped lead to his arrest the story can be found below one of the take home quotes from this article is the following quotewe are not intimidated by the us government as some are claiming we are simply complying with our countries legal system to avoid being potentially shut down and prosecuted ourselves a very smart man that goes by the online handle the grugq said when doing your freedom fighting online that nobody is going to go to jail for you and he is correct when it comes down to it no vpn provider is going to risk jail to protect a a month subscriber no matter how tough they sound no matter how much they claim to care about protecting their customers when faced with a choice to give you up or go to jail they will always choose freedom another thing to consider however is using a vpn does hide your internet activity from your internet service provider it can also hide the fact that you are using tor which may flag some suspicion when the feds start asking isps to provide data about their users this may or may not be relevant since many people use tor and you can argue there are many legitimate reasons to use tor and nothing suspicious about tor but it is just another factor to arouse suspicion that may or may not come into play and should be considered if you choose to use tor over a vpn the benefits are that you would be again hiding from your isp the fact that you are using tor also your vpn would only be able to see that you are connecting to tor nodes and that you are sending encrypted data the vpn would not be able to see what data you are sending over tor unless they decrypted it because remember all information relayed over tor is encrypted the downsides of course as mentioned are that vpn providers may or may not log everything that you do in the form of meta data or even content if they have the storage capacity and keep those logs on hand for a long time in this case it is no better than connecting to tor through an isp another thing to mention to those who will use vpns when not using tor but also use vpns when using tor is remember when you are and are not connected to your vpn sometimes vpns can unexpectedly drop connections and you may not even be aware of it if the reason you are using a vpn is to hide tor activity from your isp then if your vpn drops your isp will start seeing your tor traffic instead or maybe you forget that you are connected to your vpn and end up punching in your address on google maps to find directions somewhere well guess what google does with all data entered into their system they keep it and they likely keep it indefinitely so if one day the nsa identifies you on the tor network by occupying a large number of nodes and using traffic analysis to identify you based on statistical analysis it will link them to your vpn ip address at this point they will likely ask the vpn to turn over data on their users but if the vpn refuses to comply because they are not subject to us law or the laws of other countries they may check some of the big surveillance websites out there to see if you slipped up and used that ip address for anything else online they will check logs from google yahoo facebook twitter netflix and other big data collection companies to see who has been using that ip address to connect to their servers if you accidentally punched in your address on google when connected to that vpn you are now a suspect so always keep things like this in mind just because you are covered behind a vpn does not mean you are not traceable by human error the benefits of tor are that you get a new identity every time you connect this may or may not be the case with your vpn so please check and make sure next post we will talk about the advantages and disadvantages of using tor to connect to a vpn.
there is not such thing as a we love avengers marketplaceis just a lame attempt to scam phish and or tarnish lsd avengers reputation nothing to see here keep walkin.
accidentally posted my private key while trying to figure everything out with pgp and i cannot edit my post did i just fuck my security up horribly.
this stuff had to be here it's not perfect but probably the best introduction on the subject available on the internet as always don't trust blindly what you read but do your own research and act accordingly originally coming from the hub written by jolly roger i'm just copy and pasting it this hasn't been updated since but it's still pretty accurate i'd advice against opening youtube videos and externally downloaded videos or documents linked in this article on the same computer as you are using tor better download what you really want to see on an encrypted usb stick and use an off line machine to watch it or disconnect your computer from the internet and use a live cd you can trust to view your documents while off line reboot while you are done it would be better to disable javascript to visit anything linked in this thread click on the green onion privacy and security settings set it to high type about config in the address bar search for javascript enabled set it to false if using tails you'll have to do that again each time you reboot better be safe than sorry happy reading thread table of to secure communication tor ssl pgp tails virtual box continued disk encryption and file shredding and removing personal metadata from files security precautions when posting online learn from others' mistakes data a lawyer how to handle getting caught or interrogated tor with a vpn tor with a vpn continued cookies from others' mistakes libertas dpr sabu lulzsec far will law enforcement go private messages from others' mistakes how they busted sabu from others' mistakes sabu became fbi informant and betrayed jeremy hammond you might consider running to if you had no other choice your account from fbi monitoring mindset federal government bullying tactics to connect to tor over top of tor to verify your downloaded files are authentic signed messages with signatures and signing your own messages example of really bad opsec smarten up chat sending and receiving bitcoins anonymously vs hidden services why you should be careful are watching you viruses malware you with an antenna javascript revisited plus flash cookies and other browser tracking few simple boot attacks unencrypted ram extraction strengh of cryptography and anonymity when used properly email addresses scam email beware introduction to an expert on opsec plus md sha checksums is obvious when you are using tor you using safe mail net part police are watching it part thieves scammers and counterfeit bills part more scam stories part sellers busted for money laundering tor from your isp part bridges and pluggable transports of the nsa you should always back up your drives especially encrypted drives clients in tails blockchain and electrum another example of how strong cryptopgraphy and proper opsec can protect even pedophiles identifying tails users and can you be forced to give up your passwords roger gave a btc address on the topic for those who want to donate to him i didn't copy it here as i'm not sure he can still access his wallet if you want to donate to him you'll find this address on the original thread linked on top of this post.
server manually then config to route through tor tor browser bundle must be running for this to work ssl socks localhost port don't you need to use port.
yea i just saw an article on deepdotweb earlier about this who incident i'm glad that justice is finally being served i never used sheep marketplace but it pains me that so many people lost money hopefully the heavy hand of justice will fall upon kimble and verto now.
not bothing with this anymore upon reading android wont be enough.
dancingbear on march amblond wig fog is taking a very long time to do deposits and withdrawals is there any other service or way to tumble coins that is worth it i too would like to know this i used to have confidence in fog but the recent events make me very nervous to push any sizeable amount of coin through their service.
molelor on june amhave tried to register with sigaint times always says the captcha is wrong but its not any idea as to why captchas do that happens on most sites now either you're really bad at captchas or it's a cache problem are you using the tor browser bundle.
yeah i just tried to log into dhl to check if my order had shipped apparently that's down as well this is a message from the forum we are sorry something went wrong with the deployment i only noticed that right now since i need multiple signatures to change this system specific permission i took the market down for a few hours to avoid any data corruption we'll be back within hrs maximum i'll keep you updated sig.
okay dhl seems to be online again.
alpha just worked for me i can confirm.
dewr on november pmwhat link is that will search the forums for it found this was the easiest to get the most current version of electrum up and running in tail.
on august pmwhat would you say about simply using a mobile pgp program and using text messages have you ever tried to decrypt or encrypt a message on an android device the last time i tried it took me minuets.
on february pmwhat would be the safest most anonymity to send vendors coins is it safe to just do it directly with an online wallet like coinbase this really depends on how you purchased the coins assume a vendor is busted and their computers seized the feds are looking through their btc transactions can the btc that you sent to them be linked to your real identity in any way if yes then use a tumbling service like fog if no you bought the coins for cash from someone who doesn't know you then you're proabably fine jorie plan for the worst and hope for the bes.
thanks jor that clears things up for me a bit my coins are never linked to me so i can rest easy has made a thread about this topic maybe it would be nice to compile some information in one place and then have it stickied.
i just used bitcoin blender for a small amount of coin under and it worked the whole process took under an hour.
crypto on february amlet's do it the first step is to get people to exchange bitcoin pubkeys so they can generate the same address and confirm that the one provided by the escrow agent isn't fake glory be elated to find you've made it to the garden crypto you are a sight for sore eyes i do hope you've brought your spade while we await more people to express interest anyone who would like to get a head start should head over to our irc server address and instructions located below is a regular on there and i tend to lurk under a different nym just pm del if he's on and he'll get in touch with me should i happen to be available at that time it's an excellent server with numerous knowledgable active members and i advocate anyone to join regardless of their interest in multisig club best thurgoo.
shot you a pm back thanks fragbite.
well shame on me i lost ewhy is still on hidden wiki.
once the nsa and their buddies release all the backdoors and ways they track your activity online then you'll be able to delete everything incriminating w o nuking the whole drive until then this is the only way to be sure.
tech specs updatewhile writing and designing i've came up will the following new additions that will make this new market extremely difficult to take down and give a fresh breath of confidence to the darknet marketplace users will no longer have to fret about bitcoins being locked into a marketplace if they choose to use mine internal x ca and spooferi've developed my own spoofer and my system stores every single bit of data using a kb x certificate to spoof every single last detail plain text isn't stored anywhere and no cpu power is saved when it comes to encryption even if it's a simple hello walletmy website is going to use an auto generated bitchain wallet and provide backup abilities your funds won't ever be dependent on my system simply download the wallup backup directly relayed through tor too you via bitchain if my site goes down simply do your thing and log into the wallet using your backup the wallet will also be completely accesable through my website all it will do is connect to bitchain to determine balance etc no funds will be stored on my site auto migrationthe server will automatically put up special text in specific areas to indicate time when timer goes off the website will peridiocally shut down for a period of hours and transfer to an entirely new server again to thwart le this will happen as desired or x per week databases won't migrate as often due to their security in design maybe per week and imagining the size of the database as it grows while a migration is in place users will be able to use the direct trade information posted by vendors if they do so post it during so you may log into your system wallet via bitchain and send your btc to the wallet address that you have in doing so the description and the text will show up the vendor will have the ability on system restart to archive the order and thus enter it into the system thus depleting stock etc purchase will continue to process as if it was purely done in the system.
odonata on august pmhi any gpg usb users in here i have an issue with decrypting a tmg members pgp message to me i copy and past the encrypted message in the textedit field i then click the decrypt icon and i get the following error message decryption failedno secret keyno private key with id faa present in keyring what am i doing wrong please thank youyou may not be doing anything wrong it may be that the message was not encrypted to your pgp key your pgp key id is pub r a c ef af fd key fingerprint c e acbf d e e aa b c a c e f a f fduid odonata sub r a ca f if i had to hazard a guess i'd say that the other party encrypted the message to a key that doesn't belong to you perhaps they encrypted it with their own pgp key i'll pm you a message encrypted to your key you should be able to decrypt it easily spitfir.
scroat on september pmfake site that looks just like tmg but goes nowhere when you put in your username and password then they have your username and password great easy to understand explanation scary though guess thats why its good to change up your passwords and pgp sensitive info.
thank you i was having the same problem too taking a first look in security i wasn t able to find a secure tor based e mail provider any help is appreciated.
godel thanks for the clarification honestly i don't know too much about it just thougt it an interesting topic to share here do you have any vpn i was using pia for a while but i let it lapse a couple months ago.
bbkf on february pmthe change to a new kernel and reports of users having issues including dirtysouf not being able to verify the signing key has me stuck on tails what do you mean you can't verify the signing key do you mean you can't verify the iso with the detached pgp signature download the sig file and the iso again gpg verify tails i iso sig tails i isogpg signature made tue jan am utc using rsa key id a db gpg good signature from tails developers offline long term identity key gpg warning using untrusted key the tails developers publish their keys on the following page can also see this page on trusting verifying the tails developers pgp keys from bbkf on february pmis there an alternative that includes usb mounting persistence and memory wiping at shutdown anyone very knowledgeable feel safe using the upgrade the upgraded kernel is the same flavor of linux used by redhat which works very closely with the us government the kernel version is pretty much on a par with that as just about every up to date linux distro is using if there is a conspiracy linus is involved and just about every other distro developer as well linux amnesia debian ckt deb u i gnu linuxspitfir.
this works for me first i navigate using the command line into the folder where the wallet program is then i run the command electrum exe p socks localhost where electrum exe is the file name of my wallet program the wallet window appears and takes a couple of minutes to sync up and then my balance appears in the lower left corner and i'm good to go of course tor has to be running at the time so the wallet can connect it might be that you're trying to connect to a specific server which isn't running at the time.
you'll want to make javascript enabled and browser urlbar filter javascript value false to turn off jav.
i would be weary of switching it sounds like it isn t an agora specific problem for opsec i would refrain from any markets at the moment much lovehalfpin.
liquidergot on november pmor maybe have it as a different priced option ex mg xtal direct trade mg xtal multisig this would at least give people the option but keeping the direct trade price considerably lower most will choose the cheaper option especially with trusted vendors it may seem like a huge price difference but it's also a lot of work the vendors need to get paid for multisign escrow prices.
great to hear the positive response thanks.
everyone gets worried nervous paranoid at first once your pack finally arrives you may still be paranoid when packs come but nothing compares to that first pack everything will be fine who is the vendor you plan on ordering from.
the protocol part depends on the server you're trying to connect to i haven't been able to use ckl obj gypcu onion in a while but i had some luck with electrumh alorp onion both use tcp the listening port depends on how you have tor set up if you're using tails for example or other linux with 'tor' package installed you can use if you only have the browser bundle you have to use.
well people could be worried about backdoors in their encryption software allowing commands to be executed in memory or scripts of some kind malware is so common through other vectors that people are over protective of their os' this is good but windows pcs will crash if you fart i used symantec pgp for a while until i found out it might be less secure i'm almost sure this was an error in generating your key.
this is completely normal when there many connections at once the ip address belongs to the local network interface that the server is using internally no leak here.
the consensus is that they have exit scammed unless the admins do come back from the dead 'there have been reports of coins moving from the eic deposit address which can only be viewed as the action of admins moving the stolen coins to their own wallets shame indeed but i wonder if they were hacked again or if its was an exit is multisig really the solution some customers are struggling to implement basic opsec like pgp its unlikely they would go to the lengths of storing the private key of a transaction and broadcasting it after its completed etc exit scams these days are just another liability the cost of using the dnm's its the vendors who struggle often having hundreds of coins in escrow.
thanks a lot for your help and your welcome captain and no james isn t my real name also does anyone know if my public pgp key is too short.
you could try right here on the majestic garden go check the vendor section i think we have a few people selling cannabis make sure you know pgp nothing is safe stuff can always get intercepted bad vendor lost mail etc all your other questions i can't help you with other markets to try nucleus earth.
thanks again dude you're a very helpful person.
hi everybodyi m absolutely not new to the dnms but i m completely new to the direct sale trade i guess i m going to use electrum embedded in tails to proceed to the payments but i m a little bit scared about the errors i could do i boot tails with usb flash but i didn t configure persistent volume and i m not really fond of that option i clearly prefer to opt for a small sd card as my storage device so st question is it ok to use electrum even if i don t enable persistence at the launch of electrum tails advises me it is strongly recommended to only run electrum when its persistence feature is activated following step tails tells me electrum could not find an existing wallet what do you want to do create new wallet restore an existing wallet from its seed create a watching only version of an existing walletwhy it doesn t ask me to look for my wallet on another device was my idea to store it on a sd card a stupid idea is my only choice to restore my wallet from its seed when i have created my wallet i now want to send funds to my wallet the btc addresses i should use are the ones under receive tab main account receiving addresses got addresses there am i right concerning the saving of my wallet i just have to go under file then save copy save it on my device and keep a written copy of my wallet seed is it enough or should i also export my private keys to my storage device when my btc vendor has proceeded to the sending of the funds in my wallet and when i saved my wallet i can close it and shutdown tails before they show up in my wallet is that correct how much fee should i give to the btc network to proceed to my transactions for example what you guys are you giving many thanks for your answers cheer.
there are many reports of helix not releasing the coins wonder whats up there and sigaint has been having network issues lately.
thanks to the both of you i mainly use electrum but sometimes i'm forced to use onine wallets when i don't have my usb on me i'm always preparing for every scenario i even have a technique to use to pull my usb out of my computer in the event i get raided while i'm on the darknet thanks agai.
considering that the tails team is constantly checking for bugs they are smarter than me i'd rather let competent people make the security suite.
thanks for the reply i'll be sure to clean up and take a break from this until i feel more comfortable.
investigation discloses the following two servers in germany in berlin and nuremberg are under surveillance by the nsa merely searching the web for the privacy enhancing software tools outlined in the xkeyscore rules causes the nsa to mark and track the ip address of the person doing the search not only are german privacy software users tracked but the source code shows that privacy software users worldwide are tracked by the nsa among the nsa's targets is the tor network funded primarily by the us government to aid democracy advocates in authoritarian states the xkeyscore rules reveal that the nsa tracks all connections to a server that hosts part of an anonymous email service at the mit computer science and artificial intelligence laboratory csail in cambridge massachusetts it also records details about visits to a popular internet journal for linux operating system users called the linux journal the original magazine of the linux community and calls it an extremist forum it is a small server that looks like any of the other dozens in the same row it is in a large room devoted to computers and computer storage just like every other room in this industrial park building on am tower street just outside the city of nuremberg that the grey building is surrounded by barbed wire seems to indicate that the servers' provider is working hard to secure their customers' data yet despite these efforts one of the servers is targeted by the nsa the ip address is explicitly specified in the rules of the powerful and invasive spy software program xkeyscore the code is published here exclusively for the first time after a year of nsa revelations based on documents that focus on program names and high level powerpoint presentations ndr and wdr are revealing nsa source code that shows how these programs function and how they are implemented in germany and around the world months of investigation by the german public television broadcasters ndr and wdr drawing on exclusive access to top secret nsa source code interviews with former nsa employees and the review of secret documents of the german government reveal that not only is the server in nuremberg under observation by the nsa but so is virtually anyone who has taken an interest in several well known privacy software systems the nsa program xkeyscore is a collection and analysis tool and a computer network exploitation system as described in an nsa presentation it is one of the agency s most ambitious programs devoted to gathering nearly everything a user does on the internet the source code contains several rules that enable agents using xkeyscore to surveil privacy conscious internet users around the world the rules published here are specifically directed at the infrastructure and the users of the tor network the tails operating system and other privacy related software tor also known as the onion router is a network of several thousand volunteer operated servers or nodes that work in concert to conceal tor users' ip addresses and thus keep them anonymous while online tails is a privacy focused gnu linux based operating system that runs entirely from an external storage device such as a usb stick or cd it comes with tor and other privacy tools pre installed and configured and each time it reboots it automatically wipes everything that is not saved on an encrypted persistent storage medium normally a user's online traffic such as emails instant messages searches or visits to websites can be attributed to the ip address assigned to them by their internet service provider when a user goes online over the tor network their connections are relayed through a number of tor nodes using another layer of encryption between each server such that the first server cannot see where the last server is located and vice versa tor is used by private individuals who want to conceal their online activity human rights activists in oppressive regimes such as china and iran journalists who want to protect their sources and even by the u s drug enforcement agency in their efforts to infiltrate criminal groups without revealing their identity the tor project is a non profit charity based in massachusetts and is primarily funded by government agencies thus it is ironic that the tor network has become such a high priority target in the nsa's worldwide surveillance system as revealed by the british newspaper the guardian there have been repeated efforts to crack the tor network and de anonymize its users the top secret presentations published in october last year show that tor is anathema to the nsa in one presentation agents refer to the network as the king of high secure low latency internet anonymity another is titled tor stinks despite the snide remarks the agents admit we will never be able to de anonymize all tor users all the time the former nsa director general keith alexander stated that all those communicating with encryption will be regarded as terror suspects and will be monitored and stored as a method of prevention as quoted by the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung in august last year the top secret source code published here indicates that the nsa is making a concerted effort to combat any and all anonymous spaces that remain on the internet merely visiting privacy related websites is enough for a user's ip address to be logged into an nsa database an examination of the xkeyscore rules published here goes beyond the slide presentation and provides a window into the actual instructions given to nsa computers the code was deployed recently and former nsa employees and experts are convinced that the same code or similar code is still in use today the xkeyscore rules include elements known as appids fingerprints and microplugins each connection a user makes online to a search engine for example can be assigned a single appid and any number of fingerprints appids are unique identifiers for a connection in xkeyscore appid rules have weights assigned to them when multiple appids match a given connection the one with the highest weight is chosen microplugins may contain software written in general purpose programming languages such as c which can extract and store specific types of data the rules specifically target the tor project's email and web infrastructure as well as servers operated by key volunteers in germany the united states sweden austria and the netherlands beyond being ethically questionable the attacks on tor also raise legal concerns the ip addresses of tor servers in the united states are amongst the targets which could violate the fourth amendment of the us constitution the german attorney thomas stadler who specializes in it law commented the fact that a german citizen is specifically traced by the nsa in my opinion justifies the reasonable suspicion of the nsa carrying out secret service activities in germany for this reason the german federal public prosecutor should look into this matter and initiate preliminary proceedings one of nsa's german targets is the string of numbers is an ip address assigned to sebastian hahn a computer science student at the university of erlangen hahn operates the server out of a grey high security building a few kilometers from where he lives hahn years old and sporting a red beard volunteers for the tor project in his free time he is especially trusted by the tor community as his server is not just a node it is a so called directory authority there are nine of these worldwide and they are central to the tor network as they contain an index of all tor nodes a user's traffic is automatically directed to one of the directory authorities to download the newest list of tor relays generated each hour hahn's predecessor named the server gabelmoo or fork man the nickname of a local statue of poseidon after a look at the nsa source code hahn quickly found his server's name listed in the xkeyscore rules yes i recognize the ip address of my tor server called 'gabelmoo' he said millions of people use it to stay safe online and by watching the server and collecting metadata about its users those people are put at risk the rule shown to hahn published below has a fingerprint called 'anonymizer tor node authority' the fingerprint targets users who connect to gabelmoo and other tor directory authority servers in germany the tor directory authorities like gabelmoo that are specifically targeted by xkeyscore rules are in berlin and nuremberg additional targets are located in austria sweden the united states and the netherlands the expression below performs essentially the same function but it specifies the tor directory authorities located in five eyes countries australia canada new zealand the united kingdom and the united states separately from those in other countries as the comment explains the goal is to find potential tor clients connecting to the tor directory servers another rule catalogs users connecting to known tor relays this is not difficult because the addresses of all normal tor relays are published by the directory authorities so that the tor software on users' computers can select its own path through the network in addition to the public relays connections characterized as tor based on protocol identifiers are also cataloged internet service providers in countries with strong censorship such as china and iran frequently block connections to known tor relays to avoid this blocking the tor project maintains a list of non public relays called bridges to allow users to avoid this type of blocking bridges are run by volunteers and they share the details with the tor project to help censored users reach the internet users can request a bridge address via email or on the web the following fingerprints show two ways that xkeyscore attempts to track tor bridge users first the fingerprint anonymizer tor bridge tls records connections to the bridges torproject org server second in order obtain the actual bridge addresses for the purpose of tracking connections to them in the future the microplugin fingerprint called anonymizer tor bridge email extracts data from the body of the emails that the tor project sends to its users this code demonstrates the ease with which an xkeyscore rule can analyze the full content of intercepted connections the fingerprint first checks every message using the email address function to see if the message is to or from bridges torproject org next if the address matched it uses the email body function to search the full content of the email for a particular piece of text in this case if the email body function finds what it is looking for it passes the full email text to a c program which extracts the bridge addresses and stores them in a database the full content of the email must already be intercepted before this code can analyze it xkeyscore also keeps track of people who are not using tor but who are merely visiting the tor project's website torproject org it is interesting to note that this rule specifically avoids fingerprinting users believed to be located in five eyes countries while other rules make no such distinction for instance the following fingerprint targets users visiting the tails and linux journal websites or performing certain web searches related to tails and makes no distinction about the country of the user the comment in the source code above describes tails as a comsec mechanism advocated by extremists on extremist forums in actuality the software is used by journalists human rights activists and hundreds of thousands of ordinary people who merely wish to protect their privacy the rules related to tails clearly demonstrate how easily web searches and website visits can be spied on by xkeyscore on june the united states supreme court noted how sensitive this type of information is in their riley v california decision against warrantless searches of mobile phones an internet search and browsing history could reveal an individual s private interests or concerns perhaps a search for certain symptoms of disease coupled with frequent visits to webmd in addition to anonymous internet access tor also provides a mechanism for hosting anonymous internet services called hidden services these sites' urls contain a domain name in the pseudo top level domain onion which is only accessible using tor the code shown below finds and catalogs urls for these sites which xkeyscore sees in raw traffic creating a unique fingerprint for each onion address each onion address found in raw traffic is extracted and stored in an nsa database there are also rules that target users of numerous other privacy focused internet services including hotspotshield freenet centurian freeproxies org megaproxy privacy li and an anonymous email service called mixminion as well as its predecessor mixmaster the appid rule for mixminion is extremely broad as it matches all traffic to or from the ip address a server located on the mit campus that server is operated by the tor project's leader roger dingledine an mit alumnus the machine at this ip address provides many services besides mixminion and it is also one of the above mentioned tor directory authorities dingledine said that computer hosts many websites ranging from open source gaming libraries to the privacy enhancing technologies symposium website sebastian hahn the tor volunteer who runs gabelmoo was stunned to learn that his hobby could interest the nsa this shows that tor is working well enough that tor has become a target for the intelligence services for me this means that i will definitely go ahead with the project when asked for a reaction to the findings the tor project's roger dingledine stated the following we've been thinking of state surveillance for years because of our work in places where journalists are threatened tor's anonymity is based on distributed trust so observing traffic at one place in the tor network even a directory authority isn't enough to break it tor has gone mainstream in the past few years and its wide diversity of users from civic minded individuals and ordinary consumers to activists law enforcement and companies is part of its security just learning that somebody visited the tor or tails website doesn't tell you whether that person is a journalist source someone concerned that her internet service provider will learn about her health conditions or just someone irked that cat videos are blocked in her location trying to make a list of tor's millions of daily users certainly counts as wide scale collection their attack on the bridge address distribution service shows their collect all the things mentality it's worth emphasizing that we designed bridges for users in countries like china and iran and here we are finding out about attacks by our own country does reading the contents of those mails violate the wiretap act now i understand how the google engineers felt when they learned about the attacks on their infrastructure ndr and wdr wanted to know from the nsa how it justified attacking a service funded by the u s government under what legal authority tor network users are monitored and whether the german government has any knowledge of the targeting of servers in germany instead of adressing the questions repeatedly posed to them the nsa provided the following statement in carrying out its mission nsa collects only what it is authorized by law to collect for valid foreign intelligence purposes regardless of the technical means used by foreign intelligence targets the communications of people who are not foreign intelligence targets are of no use to the agency in january president obama issued u s presidential policy directive which affirms that all persons regardless of nationality have legitimate privacy interests in the handling of their personal information and that privacy and civil liberties shall be integral considerations in the planning of u s signals intelligence activities the president's directive also makes clear that the united states does not collect signals intelligence for the purpose of suppressing or burdening criticism or dissent or for disadvantaging persons based on their ethnicity race gender sexual orientation or religion xkeyscore is an analytic tool that is used as a part of nsa's lawful foreign signals intelligence collection system such tools have stringent oversight and compliance mechanisms built in at several levels the use of xkeyscore allows the agency to help defend the nation and protect u s and allied troops abroad all of nsa's operations are conducted in strict accordance with the rule of law including the president's new directive however the research contradicts the united states' promise to germany that german citizens are not surveiled without suspicion using tor in germany does not justify targeting someone the german attorney thomas stadler states tor users do not breach any laws it is absolutely legitimate to act anonymously on the internet there are many good reasons to remain anonymous.
thanks a lot scroat appreciate i.
i tried pay shield see.
thank you for your time and efforts nonya i tried to import your public key it said key import failed code error text gig total number processed i tried copying and pasting both your key and your sig and i tried copying and pasting just your key without your sig neither method worked i've tried importing other peoples' keys from the thread where members post their keys some of them import just fine but some don't i am using the exact same method every time so i don't don't know what's going on there i never have any problem importing venders keys from their vender pages on other markets i had a similar experience a long time ago i think it was on sr i could import someone's key if they posted it on the forum but i couldn't do it if it was on their forum profile or maybe it was the other way around can you try pming me your key and maybe if i copy and paste it from there it will work i've tried pasting your pgp key link in the address bar it took me to start page com and said sorry there are no web results for this search when i paste mine into the address bar it says unable to connect mine no longer appears at the bottom of my posts because i just deleted it from my profile last night but i copied it before i deleted it in case i need it again next day edit i tried your pgp key link again took a minute to connect but it worked this time and i was able to import your key so this seems consistent with what you were saying on one of your threads my pgp key link still doesn't connect and i still don't remember how i acquired it in the first place and it would be nice to know how to create a new one with my updated email address but at least i can pm you now i didn't realize that your pgp key link goes to the same thread where all these members post their keys i generated a new key and tried to send it to my email address it said sending key failed thanks for clearing up my confusion over the word signature i understand the purpose of the sig i've found other info online about that but i can't find my sig i figured out how to generate a sig for a key that i generated yesterday and i exported the key to a folder like i normally do that's where i usually open a text file of my public key to give someone that text file still doesn't show a sig though oh and i wasn't trying to change the email address in my key i was trying to change it in my tmg forum account settings my main interest right now is to be able to import your public key then i'll try working with that message you created then maybe i'll try to tackle some of these other problems next day edit as i mentioned above i tried your pgp key link again took a minute to connect but it worked and i was able to import it this time when i get a chance i'll try working with your encryped message exercise and see what happens with that but at least i have your key imported i really appreciate your help you have been so nice.
i would highly recommend blending your coins via helix once you buy them via bank deposit cuts the tie between yourself and the dn marketplaces you will use them on.
purpleturkey on january pmi can't figure out the pgp or gpg stuff at all i've set up an email account on vfemail net which lets me set up a pgp key and email people using the encryption but how to i send an encripted message on a vendors site who is asking for a gpg secured message or for that matter decode one that i got from that vendor in their message box on their site i'm losing my mind here trying to figure this out can someone direct me to a plain english tutorial on how to set this up so i can communicate with vendors please gpa is good gpg usb is another good program you can get it from the gpg usb homepage you need further help just pm me and let me know what platform you're using linux windows or osx spitfir.
great replies dudes.
never had that issue before it should prompt you for the bridge address you re using when it s configured takes no time extra to connect will pm you for specifics.
this type of stuff has been argued endlessly over the years frankly this is pretty much a waste of time bit keys are good enough they were are certainly good enough for ed snowden laura poitras and glenn greenwald these people are directly in the nsa's line of fire if they don't use larger keys then i see little reason for anyone else to spitfir.
ketaman on september amif you're really worried about security buy a laptop locally with cash and only use it for browsing dn however a tails usb is easy to use and offers basically equal security can anyone recommend a good burner laptop for darknetmarket shopping vending use mostly large shopping i plan to use tails on usb or dvd.
i though to copy this here from dhl forums remember shut the fuck up is opsec rule key points for darknet survival by aesopnoble on november quotejust thought i would post some basic key points for anyone new or old who wants to improve their security a lot of noobies out there who are just earning their stripes just want to make those of you who are new aware of what goes on around the darknet and how to stay safe i would hate to see a promising individual get caught for something that could have been prevented social engineering this is the holy grail of be aware of what you say in public or private a using chat software xmpp is a form of isolation isolation is used in one of two ways relaxation or intimidation you should always be cautious of who you talk to even if you think they are 'cool' or you knew them for a long time not only le but if your 'cool friend' gets wrapped up he will be the first to snitch you out the most notorious hackers of the world aren't always just sitting behind of a computer kevin mitnick once the most wanted hacker in the world although advanced technically was a far better social engineer who ended up in a plethora of allegations ranging from hacking into the department of defense national security and several banks so it isn't always about how many computer skills you have or how many programming languages you can write in sure that is one aspect but basically no one here is your friend we can be social and cordial to one another but always keep in mind that you don't know the person on the other side or their agenda online dumpster diving rummaging through posts and trying to gather and piece together information to build enough identity about you be careful about what you post in the forums think before you write too much never post absolutes about yourself and always stay adaptive a you can be anything you want to be in anonymous world just don't be you if you stick to facts and the less opinionated you are the less character you have it is often easy to use a forum such as these to come and 'hang out ' honestly this is not the place to hang out hang out with your family get a girlfriend boyfriend or facebook for that it doesn't mean you can't snap a joke and you have to be rigid it just means take a second to think before you post something it might end up being too revealing money they follow money trails wash your coins double and triple wash buy other e currencies and trade back buy physical goods with btc you are capable of selling for fiat money is nice especially when you finally get to spend it that car that house that diamond studded rolex well all those major purchases get reported to some tax collection agency in the usa it is the irs they have the authority to monitor your spending whether legitimate or illegal purely for the purpose of finding out if you have been paying your taxes third parties be aware of third party websites like reddit bitcoin washing services and the possibility of a fake market a not only can fake washers and markets be used to steal your money they can also be used to track your money don't use the same log ins for every site le can cross analyze data and habits much the same way google analytics works here you have a way to start linking your identity if you aren't cautious for example you post identical comments on the darknet as you do on the clear net you use the same name to buy and vend and wash your coins it is always a figurative pain in the ass to go the extra steps to be secure but don't let it become a literal pain in the ass when you get to prison keep your personal life and darknet life completely independent they watch you from the outside in and the inside outthere should be no need to tell your friends around town what you do that is not being anonymous that is being pseudonymous patience is the weapon that forces deception to reveal itself unknown it works both ways the feds will can watch you for years if they want when they get tired of you that's it if you're in for a long run follow the rules of engagement never become relaxed and keep your opsec up to date at all times be patient there is no need to rush anything anyone trying to rush you is a pressure salesman of some sort malware phishing links and sites le are no better than you or me we breathe the same air and bleed the same blood they are capable of writing code as well always check the links in messages they could be a phishing attempt always bookmark the correct links and use those and then search for a thread or verify the main url first it's a bit lazy and insane to just go around clicking every link you get on the darknet keep your software up to date when tor has an update update it when tails or whonix has an update update it there are some exceptions to this rule when it comes to new features by windows lenovo and other commercial hardware and software manufacturer's they are now joining together to fight cyber crime by installing back doors and rootkits to your privately owned software quite a few years back sony had several class action law suits against them including u s states for installing rootkits via columbia records' digital content cds now it is becoming the norm to invade your privacy windows user's disable uninstall telemetry updates found in windows and clearnet link if you don't trust the software you can do this manually from the uninstall updates menu and search for each kb file independently there are or so i believe pgp for yourself auto pgp is a nice feature but it is not as secure as we like to pretend it to be no dnm is open source the darknet is a trust less environment not saying anything is truly bad going on but there is possibility that auto pgp messages are retained the way php the language works is by grabbing form data and then manipulating it this leaves it wide open for the admin to do whatever they want to with your message not saying they are or spreading fud pgp on your pc and then paste it to the form do this for all markets and forums.
hello anthony and welcome you could start over at the active vendors board a vendor who offers something you like and read the first page of their thread they usually tell you how to order from them the standard is to either send them encrypted personal messages on this board or to send them encrypted messages on email as per usual payment is through bitcoin good luck and if you have any more questions do not hesitate to as.
the easiest way to extract keys is to use the command line this applies to all versions of pgp gpg to export a public key use the following gpg export armor o name of file asc keynameto export a private key use the following gpg export secret key o name of file asc keynamespitfir.
is it only me that has problems with sigaint cutting up my mail text to extreme degrees sometimes my sent mail will be only one half sentence from a whole body of text from the mail i composed seems very strange and i bet theres a ridiculously easy explanation but i can t seem to find it right now im using attached text files for communication which feels a bit weird shouldn t be necessary for a mail service heh i ll give vfe a try though.
you need to enter your wifi password every time you start up tails unless you're using a persistent volume which remembers stuff like wifi passwords there should be a little network icon near the upper right corner of your screen which becomes a drop down menu when you click on it you should be able to just enter your password in there if you enter your wifi password correctly tor should be able to connect.
pleroma on june pmi have used bitcoinfog a number of times and never had an issue but it does seem like there are quite a few people that have even on small amounts which doesn't make sense from a scamming point of view maybe technical problem or sophisticated scam scheme thanks for sharing your experience let's try to keep this topic up to date recently played with helix light pay shield and bitblender with small amounts and all of those worked fine bitblender did seem to work with a shared coin system one huge wallet sending many small payments while the other seem more sophisticated many wallets bigger than your deposit that will send amounts to the addresses you gave in both cases it should work as far as blockchain analysis goes.
summa iru on april amyou just made a thread in the best market you're already there here as far as psychedelics everything you could want is here and in my opinion psychedelics are the only 'drugs' worth pursuingwell put cannot agree mor.
quotei'm positive that ootp will help you out that's good news i'm willing and can't wait to until i'm able i'm truly looking forward to being helped by ootp.
is there any way to have this enabled by default.
undetermined on july amhi all i've been out for a while and i probably missed out on some things that happen ed but it seems to me that the kingdom forum is not active any more the link i have might be an old one anyone knows about a new link or has more info on what's happening stay on the safe free side yeah there's a different rl now don't have it anymore but like why seemed like absolutely nothing was going on over there and what was was garbag.
i found crypto market too it look good i am going to try for the moment i get order only with nucleus and middle earth nothing in the other market and nothing here i miss evolution i don t understand because i have very good price g about weed and very good review on grams anyway thanks for answersomeone have good link with market list like hidden wiki.
fatfreddie on december amis it official tmg policy not to mention the d word any more if so why am i missing something fundamental here the problem wasnt the market but the dude was spamming the forums we dont mind making a post in active markets as long as they are legit but dont make post i will release the words as long as they dont start it up again i dont like weeds in the garden pease e.
it seems safe in that it's a no taint mixer that works and won't run away with your coins be careful if you want to use it for a lot of coins though better make a few smaller transactions use to addresses where the coins will be sent to as this really improve it's security as the fee is fixed it would be really easy to get back to the original transaction if you use only one address random time adds something too the guy that runs grams seems to be a greedy person maybe he logs everything and would give away all the information he haves if asked by le there is no way to know use more than one mixer if you need some real anonymity but remember that both mixers could be run by le buying alt and selling for new btc can be a way make your btc anonymous too another mixer that seems good is bitblender always cross check url of those site and send a small payment first to try if it works well good luck.
just saw this god damnit can't say im not surprised.
it will work as technically described but probably not as you or the op on bitcointalk org intend an external attacker is a bigger threat than an internal tor network attacker intel agencies don t have to run entry exit nodes to pwn you since they can tap ixps and gateways between you and your entry guards and between your exit nodes and sites that you visit if the nsa taps the exchange point that connects your isp to the rest of the internet then it doesn t matter which entry guards you exclude and it doesn t matter if they operate an entry guard that your tor client selects they can observe every connection you make to any entry guard that is easier than waiting for you to select their entry guard.
thanks for the tip bruce can't be too safe its really not wise to leave communications sitting on a server somewhere so i like that i can automate this process.
this is a forum but you can also use it to directly contact vendors they post their offers in the active vendors section you'll also find reviews here so you can decide which vendor is trustworthy and reliable but there's no escrow which means you'll have to pay upfront it also means the admins can't steal your money as they aren't in any way involved with the orders.
blockchain info also has a mixing service any reviews of that the helix site seems outdated with links to agora still unremoved is it safe to use.
internal mixer what im intressted in acid from what country you send.
is alphabay down or is it just me i keep getting the the anti ddos filter indicates very high anonymous traffic on the server we are aware that you probably aren't behind this but we need to present you this challenge to get an authorization cookie to view the marketplace this page will not be displayed on every visit but only during possible ddos periods please complete the challenge below to get a browsing authorization messag.
i don t think i should recommend any specific providers on a public forum but you can search around for vpn providers with servers in russia or eastern europe check the contact information and make sure they are actually headquartered in a country outside of five eyes or even western europe a lot of times you ll find a provider with russian servers but their contact info is in london or nyc you can also rent a vps and set up your own openvpn server i like to chain vpn connections for example from my computer to a vpn server in my country from that server to another country and finally from that server to a russian eastern european server then i set entrynodes where is the same country as the last vpn server from there you can run bittorrent or i p and help that anonymity network in the process or bittorrent over i p this provides cover traffic to make traffic analysis by external observers more difficult this strategy may be useful when visiting clearnet sites or hidden services that are located in five eyes countries or western europe hopefully most hidden services are not located in those geographical areas making traffic analysis much more difficult even if you do nothing on your end.
halfpint on august ami would be weary of switching it sounds like it isn't an agora specific problem for opsec i would refrain from any markets at the moment much love what he said remember this is a vulnerability issue with tor not just agora thanks for slapping some sense into me it isn't just the markets it could apply to this forum as well i feel like if your encrypting your data and taking all the necessary precautions you'll be okay though.
i've been away from the market scene for a while but i think i read several months ago about a few top vendors who were planning to bypass the markets with their own personal markets did any vendors actually do this seems like it could have advantages and disadvantages.
wow postage seems like a lot for a small package.
i'd wait a while before announcing things like that all my coins seem to be where i've left them.
i for one love the idea sterling but do not see the issue with some type of small fee to help cover operational expenses on your end please keep me updated on your progress as i am extremely interested in your concept.
doses lysergic on january amit's v its got it lazy on my part language is a reflection of culture and culture changes over time to use outmoded language is improper in my opinion we don't use words such as thereupon anymore because they are superfluous figures of speech thereupon has no necessary meaning and really no meaning at all it is just word filler it's an old fashioned fancy equivalent of like the word i used was thereon which doesn't mean anything like like in this context it's just a more concise way of saying on the subreddit in question i don't think there's any basis for arguing that it's an archaic word or that nobody uses it anymore i see it often enough again i don't know why we're so hung up on language here i was trying to make a a serious argument clearly and logically you've seen two reasoned arguments for the rhetorical use of the double negative and have failed to address either only repeating your earlier assertion just as you failed to address the actual substance of my post in the first place either way on thoroughly derailing this discussion.
i hope this isn't a silly question but is there an alternate url for ag i know a few other markets have given out alternate addresses since initially going down this last time i've only been able to log onto ag once since then and am not sure if i overlooked it or what.
knuckles on august pmquote from sillywabbit on august pmfuck the centralized markets man trusted vendor boutique sites and email forum direct trades is the onlyway to go with any kind of assurance that your coin or identity is not being compromised for all we know every market is run by leo or their informants i was just coming in here to say this i have no problem sending money upfront to trust worthy vendors hopefully direct transactions like that are both a security benefit to sellers and buyers i prefer forums like tmg to deal with vendors i like it too but i also like dealing with active marketplaces where it's easier for buyer to find me that being said i'm on abraxas and link.
strange so when you type it out in the text editor select copy and go to sign encrypt on the clipboard it does nothing yeah no problem really wish i could help you out man but i have no idea what the issue might be.
fuck the centralized markets man trusted vendor boutique sites and email forum direct trades is the onlyway to go with any kind of assurance that your coin or identity is not being compromised for all we know every market is run by leo or their informants.
just stopping by to rant may should have found the ranting thread but anyways electrum has not connected in like days wtf i need some money anyone have advice cheers rhet.
tyr on november amstop reading the children on reddit its a dos attack it happens to all markets when they get big especially now with btc increase i hope you are right but what a dos attack is got to do with btc value.
i knew this would be happening over and over again if it's not greedy admins then it would be some other letter agency i think the next one to step out on us will be iddle arth the hobbits social network seems to be down for too long now and there were numerous complaints about people not being able to withdraw their funds also at the beginning of the month there was a hacker bragging that they were able to get their ip address and cause page crashing by insertion code in a post agorah seems to be pretty knocked out right now with their almost down time i think the admins do not want to steal the funds but they don't seem that interested in fixing the problem or allowing a separate url for vendors to work their orders and customers to withdraw their funds.
caseysmith on april pmwould anyone mind dropping a link to middle earth i'm looking for a sight that has more reliability than agora which is unfortunate because i really like agora middle earth market is at mango u rivtwxy onion and i'd recommend against enabling javascript.
thanks for all the guidence and help heresome few questions what do you mean about note your seed buy a cheap laptop remove the harddrive get tails on a usb sorry i dont know what tails it but i will look it up buy storing in tor wallet do you mean by the market wallet again sorry for the newbie question.
interesting when i wrote the word that has been replaced i got the following error message the following error or errors occurred while posting this message you are using forbidden words please improve your language it is d r e a m m a r k e t check it out.
i know that tails is something to have for tor do any of you think other services like vpn's are a good idea to add in for extra security i've been trying to look up if there are possible ways for going on websites that may use javascript through tor without leaking info like my ip etc any tips info.
would anyone mind dropping a link to middle earth i'm looking for a sight that has more reliability than agora which is unfortunate because i really like agora.
i deposited into my agora account on around pm i sit here on may th at pm days after my deposit and nothing has shown in my agora account one would hope that with such a big deposit agora support might respond to messages however they have yet to respond to the messages i have sent with just questions regarding deposits they said withdraws are fixed however they are working on deposits i hope agora comes through on this and doesn't drop the ball depositting btc shouldn't be the scary thing about the dnm the mailing of drug should be however i sit here scared worried confused and very irritated at the very simple transaction of btc to my account i hope agora fixes this soon as well because if a normal order takes weeks after vendor sends out package i am looking at a solid month on one order this is sad and not what customers pay commission to see.
there is not such thing as a we love avengers marketplaceis just a lame attempt to scam phish and or tarnish lsd avengers reputation nothing to see here keep walkin.
there are two main trusted tumblers and a third which was just released that i will post here along with some information about each i will also post an extra free method that you can use on top of tumbling first bitblender this service has been around for quite some time and is one of the trusted tumblers bitblender works with a shared coin system one huge wallet sending many small payments while the others seem more sophisticated many wallets bigger than your deposit that will send amounts to the addresses you gave in both cases it should work as far as blockchain analysis goes thanks wilderness bitblender also has a high volume bonus program where if you send btc within days your fee goes down by they also have a referral program where once combined deposits from a user and his her referred users reaches btc in days the referring user will be credited of all deposits fee randomized bitblender my ref link ref helix by grams grams started in april of as a simple search engine for products on the markets after a few months they started helix and have since created many useful services such as torads infodesk and gramsflow helix has a regular version which requires a grams account and a light version which does not the full version of helix has more fine tuned controls like delays and sending the clean coins in more than one transaction in the light version you send your coins to the address it gives you and as soon as it gets confirmations it sends the cleaned coins in one transaction to your specified address in the light version it can take up to hours but most transactions are completed within minutes fee minimum withdrawal amount btcmaximum withdrawal amount btchelix account cost not needed for helix light btchelix pay shield by sigaint sigaint has been one of the trusted darknet email service providers for about a year now and has just announced their new tumbler on june i have not had a chance to try it yet but it claims to complete the tumble in minutes what's unique about pay shield is that it has a pay someone with mixed coins feature from their website pay someone with mixed coins is primarily used to pay someone else with maximum privacy simply input the payees' bitcoin address and the amount they expect and pay shield will generate a mix for you and calculate how much you need to send to make the mix work out to that amount fee randomized pay shield on to the free method this is not recommended as a stand alone method there are many websites that store a large amount of bitcoins stores casinos exchanges etc i personally use casino websites send in your btc play a few rounds penny slots or you'll regret it and send it to your final destination you can also send to your preferred website of choice first before sending it to your tumbler with exchanges it's best to find one where you can send your btc and convert to ltc or another currency then back to btc please beware of phishing links i highly recommend using dnstats com or deepdotweb to confirm you are always using the correct address these sites have been providing darknet market info for years and can be trusted i have verified all these links but please feel free to do so yourself.
rhettbutler on april pmheardopsec it is make sure you do that a small thing to do to keep ourselves safe.
ultrabear on december ami for one love the idea sterling but do not see the issue with some type of small fee to help cover operational expenses on your end please keep me updated on your progress as i am extremely interested in your concept thank you i will i'm trying to negotiate a deal with a vendor for free lsd anually to run the service i know i could make a lot more by taxing transactions but that's not what i'm about i'm a firm believer that more money leads to more problems don't get me wrong i love money but i'd have to deal with laundering it getting it in the first place which would require more time just stuff i don't care for i make a good living and this type of merchant system is very easy to create all of the extra stuff are the challenge but i'm only interesting in helping people out i sincerally believe that anyone that wants lsd other drugs used sparingly should have access too them to free their mind and to not only help themselves but help others if i can provide a community to peolple that will offer that that's money in and of itself for me plus i'll habe a reliable market to buy lsd on but hopefully this vendor i'm in contact with will be interested in purchasing it i have him in mins for the top vendor so he'll probably get the source regardless just with lsd i will offer more i'll see how it goes lol either way i'm developing it though  on december amwow so much thought went into this but working directly with vendors whom have proven themselves this system is hard to beat i send coin they send product simple i will never join an open market againthank you for your feedback mod that's the idea a community based on human principle trust and that is exactly what i'm aiming for an entire community of completely trusted vendors of which vendors have the ability to ban if it comes down too it you can almost gurantee that so long as you're a good customer and don't lie cheat or steal that you'll have an entire community of people such as yourselves also harder for le to penetrate with typical social engineering.
thanks evil genius i'll chec.
aflaomarket serverlux me or to learn more if this group really finishes bitwasp it would be great for the community.
pleroma on november pmeveryone gets worried nervous paranoid at first once your pack finally arrives you may still be paranoid when packs come but nothing compares to that first pack everything will be fine who is the vendor you plan on ordering from i plan on ordering from mr pickles actually heard he's real good at stealth i just suppose i worry the fe already has their eye on my signal or something ahaha but i can imagine when ordering the first pack not really knowing what to expect at all.
running tails on a virtual box is also a secure way some expert vpn folks should start renting out sandbox rdp's with tails for some coin.

dankbank on may pmgood guide to you i ve always heard about tails but never knew really what it was until now i ll be doing this very soon thanksget on tails now seriously it s more secure and it wraps almost everything you need for darknet activities up in a neat lil os.
i got michelle leonhart nudez just send me bt.
for now it seems not possible to register new useraccounts full speed maybe if someone has usefull register links would be much appreciated stay safe fre.
hey captain you should bookmark or check out this link very well may have seen that thread or something similar before i have no idea what your experience is with this stuff and i know that thread has been linked to on these forums before but it really is a quintessential index of darknet security it has answered any and every question i've ever had regarding the topic happy trail.
p c w th n on june pmplease can someone help i have encrypted a pgp message it is about page long including my own public key that i added to the message the problem is the encrypted message is pages long too long to send as a private message or post on the forum if anyone could help assist me i would be most grateful i am using open office to write and read the text odt and asc and kleopatra to encrypt you should not be using openoffice as a text editor software like openoffice adds a literal ton of formatting codes and other junk to any file it creates use an ordinary text editor instead use gpg usb instead of kleopatra it has its own built in editor and is easier to use to boot spitfir.
previous time i used pay someone with mixed coins option from pay shield and it work fine read above yesterday i tried the mix my coins options i gave a new generated btc address of one of my wallets to receive the mixed coins i solved the captcha and arrived to the pay shield page telling me to send the btc i wanted to mix to a pay shield btc address from one of a darknet market i emptied my online wallet sending all the btc to this pay shield address pay shield page refreshed and told me btc were in transit showing then confirmations then pay shield showed me the final page status success but one day after still nothing in my wallet i contacted sigaint support let's see.
as far as other peoples keys many of them have the old forum address listed just change everything before the onion to what s in your address bar.
inanna on april amlelantos has had great uptime and i suggest them to everyone ussrmail was down half of the time so i switched over to lelantos just make sure to encrypt everything and be careful about what you put for subject headers i have seen a lot of vendors mention lelantos might have to set up an email there when the time comes i know an email isn't essential in using the dn but it couldn't hurt to have one setup the right way.
update this morning when checking my wallet the btc arrived almost days after so problem resolved thanks but strange and took a very long time for an automated process seems that someone corrected manually the transfer problem maybe only young beta system error we must be kind and tolerant about it after all i did not loose money let sigaint have a chance and improve their young mixer that seems great the pay somebody is usefull i will use pay shield again now i can trust that money does not vanish.
theocean on april pmisnt there a country where people can host a hidden server without any concerns about usa or europe making a demand to force the host to give away the servers files mutual legal assistance treaty i mean there are almost countries all around the world isnt anyone safe maybe north korea any country in middle east any i hate usa and europe and will never comply to their requirements country ive been thinking about that there is a tiny chance hidden servers have their real ip discovered as happened with silk road so why not to put the servers based in a country that s gonna say fuck you rest of the world this is my country people here do whatever they want in internet or at least they say fuck you rest of the world we only deal with internet crimes that affects our country directly and none of those vendors or site admins live here or fuck you rest of the world we wont comply any bullshit from usa or europe at all where the heck is a safe place to host a hidden server im just curious and asking myself that if there is a country like that this were another mistake from the silk road s admin good luck finding one here is a current list treatiesmutual legal

is vj sabu don t ear much mention of sabu anymore i have a mental picture of him chained to tarbell s ikea computer desk washing down cheetos with rasberry faygo.
i'm with inanna on this one lelantos is nice and i feel worth their cost they did however shut down temporarily to fight off heartbleed and i was worried for a moment they're back up and running now and doing great.
is a linux based operating system built for anonymity if you can mount an iso image copy of a dvd cd to a dvd or usb drive use tails it s more secure and it has everything you need built right in.
i only have a pgp key do i have necessarily to make a one.
it seems that while everyone else has begun receiving deposits again mine has not turned up yet quite concerning it was sent from my middle earth wallet which reads confirmations does this suggest it was not withdrawn properly or is it more likely to be a deposit problem on agora can i check blockchain for the transaction.
i have just been connecting to the normal electrum servers through tor i'm using tails so i'm pretty sure i can't accidentally connect via clearnet.
moneygram has a tendency to flag payments sent that are obviously to people you don t know they cancelled a transaction on me i was sending to egypt and they flagged it for some silly reason took weeks to get my money back from moneygram so now i only use western union they ve given me no issues whatsoever and always send it instantly.
thanks great article i have been impressed with the knowledge on the dhl forums and of course with the dhl marketplace in general i can see why so many tmg vendors are on dhl also let's hope consumers migrate toward dhl and other markets with multisig and i p options that also strive to stay current and relevant with their opsec and sop.
dardush on april pmhey summa haven't seen you in awhile how have you been i also have a few of these godself ug managed to order before evo's exit scam but yet to try them i'm pretty sure i saw another vendor offering them could be from germany anyway going to give them a try next weekend and will update my thread cheers man i'm good thanks i may try the godselfs this weekend myself although i want a reliably strong trip this saturday so i'm thinking of an orange sunshine as i know that hits my sweet spotalbert heijn is on agora with these godself tabs at the moment i believe he ships from germany my only concern is they don't come vacuum sealed so may have lost potency due to oxidationi look forward to seeing your report  logikboom on april amthanks for all the links sorry for the silly question but whenever i copy a link into a new tab from this forum my browser or any other browser for that matter refuses to open the link any idea what that could be the only way i can browse something on this site if i click there manually so strange i usually click the link fast times or select highlight the whole link then right click on it and select 'open in new tab' and it works of course you have to be using the tor browser and logged into agroa to see the link i posted aswel.
i'm not big on markets everything i could possibly need is right here but if you are looking for something that's not here i would suggest agora is the best option at.
lobster on november pmquote from darcm on november ameverything was okay in the end just got a bit worried there for a moment pso what happened you had to go pay postage at the post office is this a normal occurence and finally is it frowned upon when a vendor does this yeah i had to go receive the package at the post office no this is absolutely not normal and yes it is completely frowned upo.
what do you want to do vpn tor tor vpn first case it will hide to your isp the fact that you are using tor you will need an openvpn compatible router to use that setup with tails second will hide to the sites you visit the fact that you are using tor probably safe if the vpn is paid for anonymously and you'd be protected from malicious exit nodes and maybe as the vpn ip might be flagged too avoid annoying captchas.
scroat on april pm but i wanna order now yeah ffs these vendors seriously need to set up a teddybear account.

vendors should look at this seem to really be legit and fully encourage multi sig and discouragefe i was able to quickly set up an account and add a public key the site looks very appealing.
mtsthelen on march pmwhat about safe bad anyone know anyone correct me if i'm wrong here but from what i understand as long you do these things you should be okay even with a clearnet provider like yahoo or something as long as it allows access through tor it should be fine as long as everything is properly encrypted never log in to your email account over the clearnet tor only encrypt encrypt encrypt and encrypt some more everything remember that subject lines and everything thats not inside the actual pgp message can easily be seen by a rd party nothing sensitive that could compromise your identity make sure you have pgp set up i reccommend tails on a usb and also some obvious things like don't re use any psuedonyms for the email address that you've used before that could link to any other clearnet accounts on forums or anything that could be used to link you from my understanding as long as an email provider allows access over tor and you encrypt your shit up tight then you should be good to go hope this helps a little peace mrs b.

sterlingsword on november amquote from darknetdreamer on november amsound interesting would love to write a full review once the sites up sounds excellent it's making good progress i'll post again with my milestone estimations for delivery i'll be sure also to register you an account due to the nature of this market wishing to be secure and being based on vendor only inviting i may have to ask around about you just to make sure you have indeed ordered and used product before if a vendor can vouge for you i'll provide you with a valid one time registration link upon release thanks looking forward to the market and a full write up my blog is basically all about darknet security so i think your site will fit in perfectly given the nature of it.
janesmith on may pmhow do you link your pgp key in your profile sig looks like you got it.
yes i m keeping that.
hi i am kinda new to the deep web and i am abit scared to buy on here so to minimise the risks i thought i could ask the more experienced people in other words you guys i found a site which looks promising torsupermarket i trust this site and if not can you recomend any other places where i can buy cheap electronics thank.
tails with persistence is nice easy and quite secure out of the box the only downside compared to running tails from a dvd and using an encrypted partition to save files needed across cessions is that if an attacker gets root on your system and modify it you are screwed while using the live dvd on each reboot you know you have a clean system as long as you started with a clean iso image but well if you are subject to targeted hacking there isn't that much you can do and it's unlikely to happen if you're nothing more than a lurker or small time buyer.
bitcoin fog is taking a very long time to do deposits and withdrawals is there any other service or way to tumble coins that is worth it.

i'm not exactly an expert but i would probably go with blockchain info if forced to use an online wallet it also has an onion address but i don't have it handy but i think it is worth the extra effort to get tails electrum set up if only to nullify the risk of your online wallet becoming compromised that can't really happen with offline storage and with the regeneration seeds you're still not sol if your disk becomes damaged without a backup like you would be if your online wallet decided to exit as far as mixing tumbling goes it's not really necessary as long as the coins were purchased without any connection to your identity there's arguably less risk when doing direct deals compared to sending to a known dnm address but i personally will continue to tumble because is worth it to me for the added peace of mind although there is always the possibility that the tumbling service could run with your coins probably not a cut and dry answer.
pgp continued ok so by now i am assuming you have tails running let's learn how to use pgp within tails first thing you are going to want to do is create your own personal key which consists of your public key that you can give out to people or post in your profiles online as mentioned before this is the key people use to encrypt messages to send to you your personal key also consists of your private key which you can use to decrypt messages that are encrypted using your pgp public key if you look up to the top right area you will see a list of icons and one o them looks like a clipboard you need to click on that clipboard and click manage keysnext click file newselect pgp key and click continuefill out your full name i suggest you use your online name not your real name optionally fill out an email and a comment as well next click advanced key options make sure encryption type is set to rsa and set key strength to once you have done this click create and it will generate your key once you have done this you can view your personal key by clicking the tab my personal keys you have now created your personal key to find your pgp public key you right click on your personal key and click copy and it will copy your pgp public key to your clipboard in which you can paste anywhere you wish a pgp public key will look something like this begin pgp public key block mnlsezuddas q

nxetzrck brbncyphato aqfowirzjmtd a adopmibijam ma krrih bnx az n end pgp public key block next you are going to want to save the private key on a secondary usb drive or sd card if you are running tails from a usb drive then you must use a separate drive to store your key on if you are running virtual box you want to right click on the icon in the bottom right corner that looks like a usb drive and select your separate drive that you will be using to store your keys on again never store your private keys on your hard drive keep them off your computer to save your private key you are going to right click on your personal key and click properties i know you probably saw where it says export but this is not what you want to do clicking export will only export your public key and will not save your private key if you lose your private key you can never recover it even if you create another personal key using the exact same password each private key is unique to the time it was created and if lost is lost forever so once you have clicked properties go over to the tab details and click export complete key once you have done this you have saved your personal key for future use once you restart tails remembering that tails is not installed on your hard drive so every time you restart tails you lose all your keys by saving your keys onto a usb drive or sd card you can import your keys for use every time you restart it next you are going to want to learn how to encrypt and decrypt messages using your key well luckily for me tails has already made a tutorial on how to do this so i will refer you to their webpage but before i do that i need to mention that you need to find somebody else's pgp public key or you can practice by using your own needless to say the way you import other people's keys into what's called your key ring is by loading them into a text file you do this with the program called gedit text editor click applications accessories gedit text editor and enter in someone's public key and hit save next you can return to your key program from the clipboard icon and click file import and select that file it will import that person's public key into your key ring to add future public keys to your key ring i suggest reopening the same file and just adding the next key below the previous key and each time you open that file it will load all keys within that file this way you can keep all the pgp public keys together in one file and save it on your sd card or usb drive for future use finally you can use the following pages to learn how to encrypt and decrypt messages using pgp until next time have fun with your new found ability to communicate in pgp.
bbkf on february pmthe upgraded kernel is the same flavor of linux used by redhat which works very closely with the us government does this mean that you re concerned about there being something unsafe in the software because the u s government works with redhat the beauty of open source software is that security experts can and do pore over the code to make sure that there are no security issues that means that nobody can easily insert malicious code into the program without it being detected.
humblebumble on september pmalthough if you log into a public wifi your mac address would be recorded on that network so maybe the best case scenario would be to utilize the unprotected browser in tails check the package as much as you want imo even if they had my ip address and mac address attached to a package that ended up having drugs i'm still not testifying againesy myself so that's gonna be a hard one to prove in court you could be expecting a package from bon macy's victoria secret or porn from germany and the sender could've sent you bullshit nothing or even drugs the part where people get fucked is when they open and have drugs at the same location that the package was sent to even physical address attached to po box if you're super paraniod and you check the package at free wifi locations than they see that someone was still expecting a package and someone knew that package was on it's way the safest bet is to check the tracking at the sending location there's still room for denial with that.
so i'm new to this whole thing amd still trying to figure this out i have a few questions i hope someone will take the time to answer first what exactly is pgp i know it's an encryption key or something how do i find out mine how do i use this to encrypt an email and is there anything else i need to know to order from vendors most want you to use the key to send them an email but honestly i'm lost if someone could help that would be great thank.

tails is best as far as entry level darknet computing goes a nice package with everything you need for dark net dealings except for bitmessage wrapped up in it i really think most people ordering only personal amounts have little to nothing to worry about on the computer security side of things as far as we know the nsa can only unmask a small portion of tor traffic and cannot target specific people to unmask besides when's the last time you heard about an investigation into a drug user maybe if someone call in a tip to an overly bored and vengeful police department in a small town but most police departments just have bigger crimes that take up all of their time oh and can't forget time for writing traffic ticket weather you're on talis or not though if you've ever looked up info about cybersecurity tor tails darknet anything and the like from a computer that can be linked to you you're probably on a permanant watchlist shrugs shoulders whaddyagonnado check out this article for more info on tor it will scare you and comfort you all at the same time.
combining tor with a vpn continuedok now let us talk about why you may want to connect to a vpn over tor the data flow would look like this you tor vpn internet the benefits of doing that are as follows you are more anonymous to your vpn in case they happen to keep logs or if you do something using the vpn that you are not supposed to and a website or server grabs your vpn ip address in the case of this happening even if the vpn manages to keep logs of everything you do they can only identify you as an anonymous tor user as long as you did not purchase the service like an idiot with your credit card or paypal account if you use bitcoin and made sure the the bitcoin trail is not easily traceable you should be okay some websites block tor users from connecting to their websites or servers by using your vpn to appear as the exit node you are hiding your tor activity from the website you are visiting and hopefully bypassing their filters another advantage is that if your vpn connection does drop your fall back will be your tor ip address instead of your real ip address and finally if you are passing through a compromised tor exit node your information will remain encrypted through the vpn's encryption protocol until it reaches the exit node of the vpn this is a good thing if you are passing through a compromised exit node but do not forget that the vpn could be logging everything you are doing anyways do not trust anybody who has access to your unecrypted data a few of the downsides of doing things this way as mentioned in the previous post are that your isp knows you are using tor when and for how long this may or may not matter to you but it is just something to consider second you will be unable to visit hidden services websites remember those onion sites we talked about in the beginning you need to be connected to the tor network to visit those hidden service websites but i am connected to tor aren't i yes you are but your final method of communicating with the internet does not come from the tor network it comes from your vpn and your vpn is likely not configured for tor in order for you to be able to connect to a hidden services you must either be connected directly to tor or use a vpn to connect to tor tor must be your final node of connectivity in order to visit onion websites the choice is ultimately up to you and every person in every state province and country will have different reasons for wanting to do vpn to tor or tor to vpn or just tor or just vpn whatever choice you make please keep all the things mentioned in this post and the previous post in mind none of these methods will save you if you enter anything identifying about yourself online do not log into your facebook account using your vpn do not check your email or search a nearby address on google using your vpn in fact stay away from google altogether unless absolutely necessary there are two other search engines out now that do not store information about their users duckduckgo they have both a clearnet url and a hidden services url for both types of users please note the hidden services mirror is not startpage this server also does not store any information about its users before we move on i want to go back to how to choose a good vpn when looking for a vpn provider you will most likely come across two protocols to choose from find out which one your vpn provider is using before you sign up with them pptp and openvpn at this time i am going to highly recommend that you avoid pptp and stick with openvpn providers check out this site for a quick comparison as you can see pptp uses a weaker encryption bit versus bit to bit for openvpn it offers basic security versus a high level of security using something called digital certificates this is basically a way to make sure they data coming in is sent from your vpn provider and not injected by some malicious third party because the incoming and outgoing data are signed using specially obtained certificates similar to showing your id to get into a a restricted area the only downside is that setting up openvpn can be a little challenging for the less technical users but there are plenty of great tutorials online to set up openvpn providers and your vpn provider itself will likely help you get set up as well pptp has been abandoned by those who demand the highest level of security so i would recommend to avoid it a third option for vpn providers is l tp ipsec but many users now believe it has also been compromised by the nsa due to its weaker levels of encryption and should be avoided as well stick with openvpn lastly if you want to know how to connect to tor over a vpn if you are using openvpn like i recommended then you it is really quite simple make sure you are connected to your vpn check your ip address to on any website such as com to make sure it has changed then open tor or open tails and start using tor and you are now connected to tor over a vpn connecting to a vpn over tor is a more tricky and currently above my skill set since openvpn reconfigures your network routes so tor can't be running on the same host as soon as i figure it out i will post a tutorial and if anybody can share an easy way to connect a vpn over tor then please share it with this thread updatea method of connecting to a vpn over tor has been added to this thread but is currently only able to be used by windows users you can read it about it at the link below connecting tor vpn for windows usersafter a long search i have found a way you can connect tor vpn it is not perfect and some might not agree with doing things this way but it works and i am giving it to you as an option but it only works for windows users at this time if you look back at my previous posts regarding combining vpn and tor then you will find the reasons why you would want to do so and some of the reasons why you might not want to do it but i was unable to provide you with a way to connect to a vpn using tor so that the vpn does not know who you are when it comes to tor vpn if you cannot trust your vpn which you rarely should then keeping your identity anonymous from your vpn is a good idea also with more and more people using tor but with only around tor exit nodes many of the exit node ip addresses are being flagged as spammers on popular websites and limiting the usage of well meaning tor users to post on message boards like stack exchange and so forth the way that i found you can do tor vpn is by using a virtual machine preferrably virtual box and running another instance of windows preferrably one that uses less memory than your current version you also want to run tor expert and tortilla on your host os i talk about how to do this in previous posts next set your virtual box to route all it's network traffic through tortilla bridge adapter which routes it all through tor currently tortilla is only supported by windows which is why this option is only available to windows users at this time doing this also makes it easier to do things like watch videos on youtube now that you have your windows virtual machine running on tor you can install a vpn of your choice preferrably one using openvpn on your windows guest os and connect to it check your ip address before connecting and after and you should see a different ip address if all went well you now have a virtual machine running tor vpn then if you want to add another layer you can download tor browser bundle onto your virtual machine and run that as well giving you tor vpn tor for another layer of security also you have the option using this method to use a vpn on your host os then tor expert with tortilla then another vpn on your guest os then tor browser giving you vpn tor vpn tor i am not advocating any whcih method you need to make that decision on your own i am just giving you the knowledge necesary to make an informed decison and you can ultimately choose which method you feel most comfortable with sometimes doing tor vpn is necessary because of the spam filter reasons i mentioned above and other times having tor as your last node to the internet is necessary like when accessing the onion network it is completely up to you and i know that we are trying to shy away from windows usage because of all the exploits and other reasons spoken about in the previous posts but if you have no other way of staying anonymous from your vpn than this then i think it is a good compromise until we have something like tortilla that is compatible with linux distributions.
she s not selling on any markets that i m aware of but she has a thread here.
cerver on february pmquote from oldisgold on february pmwhat's the best and most trustworthy btc mixer out there right now bitcoinfog i would say that bitcoinfog is the best blockchain info privides shared send and i believe it's also quite good if you're really paranoid you can chain them like you btc fog you shared send you but it's also more expensive i also think that bitcoinfog requires a minimum deposit of btc which isn't that much if you're placing a big order but should be kept in mind nonetheless.
ok have seen this question come up a few times so thought i would write up some thoughts that might help stimulate some conversation safety note if you are a vendor it is probably best advised if you refrain from discussing the particulars of how you handle your coins in general try to avoid mention what software or hardware you use btc walletswhy trust a web service at all you can download a lite client and handle sending and receiving from your own computer note you must configure this to run through tor if you are going to use it for buying code select can you purchase btc through electrum not afaik can you explain why electrum would be anonymous compared to coinbase online wallet it is a client side wallet ie it lives on your computer therefore as long as your ensure it is configured to run through tor it means you can receieve and send btc wihtout needing to logon to an online wallet this comes with its own ramifications one consideration is that when you start a blockchain wallet using tor perhaps blockchain notes that transaction as having been through tor can we ensure that their serves are safe from government hacks however having a bitcoin wallet on your computer means that you have total control over your btc this has its ups and downs if i were to send btcs from an online wallet to my electrum wallet would it still be anonymous were the coins bought with anything that can identify you have you ever logged onto a service that is connected to your btc over a clearnet connection therefore associating your ip to those coins this is a bit simplistic but you get the idea if they were anonymous to begin with and you have electrum setup to only run through tor then they will remain anon online blockchain if you need a wallet on the fly then you could set up a brand new wallet for each transaction you don't need to use an email address and it can be one time use only on opsec for online wallets if using them to purchase controlled substances always access them through tor never link your real life identity to these services ie register with an email that is linked to your irl identity if you logon to it not through tor this means your ip physical location is linked to that wallet abandon it immediately never logon again and create new wallet start a new wallet for each transaction you don't need to use an email at all what to do if you bought btc with your credit card across an clearnet connection suggestion blockchain shared send blockchain shared send bitcoinfog will update this as we get more input and specific questions.
dont yourself but what kind of setup you running tails windows with tbb do you use the same computer for darknet activities as regular browsing downloading movies videogames you keep a clean computer antivirus firewall anyone else around who is aware of your activities the possibilities are numerous this is why pgp is great youre sure that only you and the sender see whats inside are you sure there wasnt a mix up with your pms go through all of them including your sent messages sorry to hear about your misfortune i had some bad luck recently too and sent to a scam helix lookalike shit happens it always comes back around.
you mean vj yes he is able to pentest and plays both sides of the law he hacks to get the ip for the alphabet soup and also hacks and extorts markets right under their nose at the same time we all know the same parson is behind the markets with different names that pop up get big and tap out honorably that person can't handle vj trd was the only one who shut him down he was helping the other markets become more secure too.
maybe we could throw vendors personal sites up there as well i ve got one i know albion does and gamma sc.
i am having the same problem with safe mail net and thunderbird i am using thunderbird and gpg win and can't seem to get it to work i need to find a safe email address that is anomymous any help appericated thank.
very interesting take on a dnm market nice.
what makes you certain it's an exit scam i serioulsy hope not our i just lost a huge amount of money as i'm sure did everyone else including yourself but you seem certain it's officially an exit scam.
investigation discloses the following two servers in germany in berlin and nuremberg are under surveillance by the nsa merely searching the web for the privacy enhancing software tools outlined in the xkeyscore rules causes the nsa to mark and track the ip address of the person doing the search not only are german privacy software users tracked but the source code shows that privacy software users worldwide are tracked by the nsa among the nsa s targets is the tor network funded primarily by the us government to aid democracy advocates in authoritarian states the xkeyscore rules reveal that the nsa tracks all connections to a server that hosts part of an anonymous email service at the mit computer science and artificial intelligence laboratory csail in cambridge massachusetts it also records details about visits to a popular internet journal for linux operating system users called the linux journal the original magazine of the linux community and calls it an extremist forum it is a small server that looks like any of the other dozens in the same row it is in a large room devoted to computers and computer storage just like every other room in this industrial park building on am tower street just outside the city of nuremberg that the grey building is surrounded by barbed wire seems to indicate that the servers provider is working hard to secure their customers data yet despite these efforts one of the servers is targeted by the nsa the ip address is explicitly specified in the rules of the powerful and invasive spy software program xkeyscore the code is published here exclusively for the first time after a year of nsa revelations based on documents that focus on program names and high level powerpoint presentations ndr and wdr are revealing nsa source code that shows how these programs function and how they are implemented in germany and around the world months of investigation by the german public television broadcasters ndr and wdr drawing on exclusive access to top secret nsa source code interviews with former nsa employees and the review of secret documents of the german government reveal that not only is the server in nuremberg under observation by the nsa but so is virtually anyone who has taken an interest in several well known privacy software systems the nsa program xkeyscore is a collection and analysis tool and a computer network exploitation system as described in an nsa presentation it is one of the agency s most ambitious programs devoted to gathering nearly everything a user does on the internet the source code contains several rules that enable agents using xkeyscore to surveil privacy conscious internet users around the world the rules published here are specifically directed at the infrastructure and the users of the tor network the tails operating system and other privacy related software tor also known as the onion router is a network of several thousand volunteer operated servers or nodes that work in concert to conceal tor users ip addresses and thus keep them anonymous while online tails is a privacy focused gnu linux based operating system that runs entirely from an external storage device such as a usb stick or cd it comes with tor and other privacy tools pre installed and configured and each time it reboots it automatically wipes everything that is not saved on an encrypted persistent storage medium normally a user s online traffic such as emails instant messages searches or visits to websites can be attributed to the ip address assigned to them by their internet service provider when a user goes online over the tor network their connections are relayed through a number of tor nodes using another layer of encryption between each server such that the first server cannot see where the last server is located and vice versa tor is used by private individuals who want to conceal their online activity human rights activists in oppressive regimes such as china and iran journalists who want to protect their sources and even by the u s drug enforcement agency in their efforts to infiltrate criminal groups without revealing their identity the tor project is a non profit charity based in massachusetts and is primarily funded by government agencies thus it is ironic that the tor network has become such a high priority target in the nsa s worldwide surveillance system as revealed by the british newspaper the guardian there have been repeated efforts to crack the tor network and de anonymize its users the top secret presentations published in october last year show that tor is anathema to the nsa in one presentation agents refer to the network as the king of high secure low latency internet anonymity another is titled tor stinks despite the snide remarks the agents admit we will never be able to de anonymize all tor users all the time the former nsa director general keith alexander stated that all those communicating with encryption will be regarded as terror suspects and will be monitored and stored as a method of prevention as quoted by the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung in august last year the top secret source code published here indicates that the nsa is making a concerted effort to combat any and all anonymous spaces that remain on the internet merely visiting privacy related websites is enough for a user s ip address to be logged into an nsa database an examination of the xkeyscore rules published here goes beyond the slide presentation and provides a window into the actual instructions given to nsa computers the code was deployed recently and former nsa employees and experts are convinced that the same code or similar code is still in use today the xkeyscore rules include elements known as appids fingerprints and microplugins each connection a user makes online to a search engine for example can be assigned a single appid and any number of fingerprints appids are unique identifiers for a connection in xkeyscore appid rules have weights assigned to them when multiple appids match a given connection the one with the highest weight is chosen microplugins may contain software written in general purpose programming languages such as c which can extract and store specific types of data the rules specifically target the tor project s email and web infrastructure as well as servers operated by key volunteers in germany the united states sweden austria and the netherlands beyond being ethically questionable the attacks on tor also raise legal concerns the ip addresses of tor servers in the united states are amongst the targets which could violate the fourth amendment of the us constitution the german attorney thomas stadler who specializes in it law commented the fact that a german citizen is specifically traced by the nsa in my opinion justifies the reasonable suspicion of the nsa carrying out secret service activities in germany for this reason the german federal public prosecutor should look into this matter and initiate preliminary proceedings one of nsa s german targets is the string of numbers is an ip address assigned to sebastian hahn a computer science student at the university of erlangen hahn operates the server out of a grey high security building a few kilometers from where he lives hahn years old and sporting a red beard volunteers for the tor project in his free time he is especially trusted by the tor community as his server is not just a node it is a so called directory authority there are nine of these worldwide and they are central to the tor network as they contain an index of all tor nodes a user s traffic is automatically directed to one of the directory authorities to download the newest list of tor relays generated each hour hahn s predecessor named the server gabelmoo or fork man the nickname of a local statue of poseidon after a look at the nsa source code hahn quickly found his server s name listed in the xkeyscore rules yes i recognize the ip address of my tor server called gabelmoo he said millions of people use it to stay safe online and by watching the server and collecting metadata about its users those people are put at risk the rule shown to hahn published below has a fingerprint called anonymizer tor node authority the fingerprint targets users who connect to gabelmoo and other tor directory authority servers in germany the tor directory authorities like gabelmoo that are specifically targeted by xkeyscore rules are in berlin and nuremberg additional targets are located in austria sweden the united states and the netherlands the expression below performs essentially the same function but it specifies the tor directory authorities located in five eyes countries australia canada new zealand the united kingdom and the united states separately from those in other countries as the comment explains the goal is to find potential tor clients connecting to the tor directory servers another rule catalogs users connecting to known tor relays this is not difficult because the addresses of all normal tor relays are published by the directory authorities so that the tor software on users computers can select its own path through the network in addition to the public relays connections characterized as tor based on protocol identifiers are also cataloged internet service providers in countries with strong censorship such as china and iran frequently block connections to known tor relays to avoid this blocking the tor project maintains a list of non public relays called bridges to allow users to avoid this type of blocking bridges are run by volunteers and they share the details with the tor project to help censored users reach the internet users can request a bridge address via email or on the web the following fingerprints show two ways that xkeyscore attempts to track tor bridge users first the fingerprint anonymizer tor bridge tls records connections to the bridges torproject org server second in order obtain the actual bridge addresses for the purpose of tracking connections to them in the future the microplugin fingerprint called anonymizer tor bridge email extracts data from the body of the emails that the tor project sends to its users this code demonstrates the ease with which an xkeyscore rule can analyze the full content of intercepted connections the fingerprint first checks every message using the email address function to see if the message is to or from bridges torproject org next if the address matched it uses the email body function to search the full content of the email for a particular piece of text in this case if the email body function finds what it is looking for it passes the full email text to a c program which extracts the bridge addresses and stores them in a database the full content of the email must already be intercepted before this code can analyze it xkeyscore also keeps track of people who are not using tor but who are merely visiting the tor project s website torproject org it is interesting to note that this rule specifically avoids fingerprinting users believed to be located in five eyes countries while other rules make no such distinction for instance the following fingerprint targets users visiting the tails and linux journal websites or performing certain web searches related to tails and makes no distinction about the country of the user the comment in the source code above describes tails as a comsec mechanism advocated by extremists on extremist forums in actuality the software is used by journalists human rights activists and hundreds of thousands of ordinary people who merely wish to protect their privacy the rules related to tails clearly demonstrate how easily web searches and website visits can be spied on by xkeyscore on june the united states supreme court noted how sensitive this type of information is in their riley v california decision against warrantless searches of mobile phones an internet search and browsing history could reveal an individual s private interests or concerns perhaps a search for certain symptoms of disease coupled with frequent visits to webmd in addition to anonymous internet access tor also provides a mechanism for hosting anonymous internet services called hidden services these sites urls contain a domain name in the pseudo top level domain onion which is only accessible using tor the code shown below finds and catalogs urls for these sites which xkeyscore sees in raw traffic creating a unique fingerprint for each onion address each onion address found in raw traffic is extracted and stored in an nsa database there are also rules that target users of numerous other privacy focused internet services including hotspotshield freenet centurian freeproxies org megaproxy privacy li and an anonymous email service called mixminion as well as its predecessor mixmaster the appid rule for mixminion is extremely broad as it matches all traffic to or from the ip address a server located on the mit campus that server is operated by the tor project s leader roger dingledine an mit alumnus the machine at this ip address provides many services besides mixminion and it is also one of the above mentioned tor directory authorities dingledine said that computer hosts many websites ranging from open source gaming libraries to the privacy enhancing technologies symposium website sebastian hahn the tor volunteer who runs gabelmoo was stunned to learn that his hobby could interest the nsa this shows that tor is working well enough that tor has become a target for the intelligence services for me this means that i will definitely go ahead with the project when asked for a reaction to the findings the tor project s roger dingledine stated the following we ve been thinking of state surveillance for years because of our work in places where journalists are threatened tor s anonymity is based on distributed trust so observing traffic at one place in the tor network even a directory authority isn t enough to break it tor has gone mainstream in the past few years and its wide diversity of users from civic minded individuals and ordinary consumers to activists law enforcement and companies is part of its security just learning that somebody visited the tor or tails website doesn t tell you whether that person is a journalist source someone concerned that her internet service provider will learn about her health conditions or just someone irked that cat videos are blocked in her location trying to make a list of tor s millions of daily users certainly counts as wide scale collection their attack on the bridge address distribution service shows their collect all the things mentality it s worth emphasizing that we designed bridges for users in countries like china and iran and here we are finding out about attacks by our own country does reading the contents of those mails violate the wiretap act now i understand how the google engineers felt when they learned about the attacks on their infrastructure ndr and wdr wanted to know from the nsa how it justified attacking a service funded by the u s government under what legal authority tor network users are monitored and whether the german government has any knowledge of the targeting of servers in germany instead of adressing the questions repeatedly posed to them the nsa provided the following statement in carrying out its mission nsa collects only what it is authorized by law to collect for valid foreign intelligence purposes regardless of the technical means used by foreign intelligence targets the communications of people who are not foreign intelligence targets are of no use to the agency in january president obama issued u s presidential policy directive which affirms that all persons regardless of nationality have legitimate privacy interests in the handling of their personal information and that privacy and civil liberties shall be integral considerations in the planning of u s signals intelligence activities the president s directive also makes clear that the united states does not collect signals intelligence for the purpose of suppressing or burdening criticism or dissent or for disadvantaging persons based on their ethnicity race gender sexual orientation or religion xkeyscore is an analytic tool that is used as a part of nsa s lawful foreign signals intelligence collection system such tools have stringent oversight and compliance mechanisms built in at several levels the use of xkeyscore allows the agency to help defend the nation and protect u s and allied troops abroad all of nsa s operations are conducted in strict accordance with the rule of law including the president s new directive however the research contradicts the united states promise to germany that german citizens are not surveiled without suspicion using tor in germany does not justify targeting someone the german attorney thomas stadler states tor users do not breach any laws it is absolutely legitimate to act anonymously on the internet there are many good reasons to remain anonymous.
i'm on middle earth almost exclusively love it you can diable javascript i never have it enabled.
i love you thank yo.
are the withdrawals working for everyone now i had a small change back on the site but i ve nicely forgotten about it since it went down would be nice if they returned it back with an interes.
markets have always been something i had mixed feelings about i felt that entheogens and markets didn't seem to mix i do not miss logging into agora and seeing pornographic images used in many listings plastered all accross my screen it gave me a dirty feeling like i really was in the underbelly of the internet and didn't really resonate with me it's difficult at first but building relationships and working directly with light bringers is much more appealing.
check for a list of new bridges published some of the older versions dont work it s always good to use the newer ones check this link out for newer bridges let me know if ya need any other info.
line and bum.
hahahahaahahha i saw a picture of him good luck in jail or not getting hurt from anyone maybe this will be a lesson to the others however i do wonder if he has information saved from sheep in order to get a lesser sentence here s some info on the arrest notes about the translation the article is a bit confused mixing narratives together mixing official sheep market narrative meaning someone external stole it with tom s official narrative i had nothing to do with it it was on my server by acciddent and with police story he has the money we proved it it also doesn t really mention it was darknet marketplace with drugs it only mentions that it was an online marketplace and it says that tom was the hacker that stole the money but again it s a confused article in general so at times it doesn t make that much sense i think that s because the reporter didn t really follow the case that well and mixed stuff together anyway let s do this how the bitcoins were laundered millions from abroad a house written on granddad note this idiom written on somebody means in czech officially owned by officially done by as in officially granddad owned it police officers blocked house costing million czech crowns bought by czech programmer for suspicious bitcoins note all amounts are in czech crowns million is eur usd million is eur usd czech from hodonin city in czech rep area is being investigated for stealing money from online market from which million czech crowns disappeared czech criminals are increasingly using the virtual currency for saving their gains say ministry of finance dirty money house villa in lu ice a small town is according to police a proceed of crime it was supposedly used for laundering dirty money that s why police seized it last year in january a new bank account of years old eva barto ov had a payment that made air bank czech bank safety controls flash an idiom almost thousand crowns from a foreign company that exchanges virtual bitcoins into real money the young woman could not credibly explain to the bank officers the source of the money only additional investigation revealed that millions already went using this road and that behind it was a certain tom ji ikovsk that was connected by amateur internet investigators with stealing money from web marketplace sheep marketplace where people traded in large numbers with the bitcoin currecy the damage was described by the operators of the marketplace as more than million my note to the above as i said the article is confused according to hn short for the news name hospod sk noviny police officers seized his house near hodon n that he bought for bitcoins and that he wrote on his granddad the case is in a phase where we cannot comment told petra vedrov a police spokesman for south moravian district profesor signed grandson paidthe story can however be reconstructed from documents saved on cadaster note i don t know how is it in other countries in czech we have a cadaster with information about real estate ownership and it s perhaps suprisingly public and open according to the decree about seizing the house with a pool and garden in the town of lu ice the police officers wrote that the programmer ji ikovsk and his wife eva barto ov note the girl from earlier from laundering dirty money the million that was used to buy the house can be from the funds stolen from sheep marketplace your money our provisions all were stolen wrote the operators of the marketplace on their web not long before they had to close it two years ago they thought that someone found an error in the system and took blond wigs according to the exchange rate at the time around millions my note again they are confused and keep on writing that sheep was some legit online marketplace and tom is the hacker that stole money from it the officers of ministry of finance s financial analytical office that are detecting suspicious transactions mapped how the ji ikovsk s money travelled they first left from the abroad company bitstamp limited that is selling and buying bitcoins the millions then arrived with several transactions either on the account of ji ikovsk and barto ov or on the account of the real estate company and the lawyer that worked on the house sale part of the money went to the original owner of the house another part of the money went on her bank as one time payment of a mortgage the house is however in the cadaster written on jan goli a granddad of ji ikovsk that added no money to the transaction that it was just an effort to conceal the real owner is demonstrated by the police by the fact that ji ikovsk was the one that insured the house the real estate properties were fully paid by the finances acquired by the transactions of the virtual currency bitcoin say the detectives ji ikovsk according to bank data took thousand czech crowns in cash from bank again from bitcoin the mobile number that was used by ji ikovsk before is owned by somebody else hn tried to contact his wife through facebook but without a reply and his granddad goli was not available in his office on mendelev university on this university the yeat old professor works as a renowned expert on fruit production note the next two paragraphs are very confusingly ji ikovsk never talked publicly at the time of the sheep marketplace affair he made an announcement that he only allowed the so called webhosting meaning that for money he allowed place and service for other internet pages even a website that a fans of sheep marketplace made but he had nothing to do with the market when ji ikovsk found in the fall that the web is illegal he turned it off he did not expand on why it would be illegal but it could have something with drug selling that people today sometimes buy with bitcoins key question the money originbecause of the police silence we cannot tell how deep are the police officers in the case if they only investigate money laundering or if they want ji ikovsk for his role in stealing money from the marketplace they should because so called legalization of procceeds of crime can only be proven if the police officers clearly name the exact crime where the dirty money comes from in the past the detectives thought that they are on a trace of billion laundering in prague exchange they stopped the investigation of the owners they couldn t prove that the money were dirty not sure if they are talking about btc exchange probably not the money is too big for that and this paragraph is kinda irrelevant the worldwide trend of dirty money ending in bitcoin more and more is confirmed by the ministry of finance specialists we detected a growth of suspicious trades where the gains from criminal activity end up in virtual currency warned last year annual report of financial analytical office end full details about the sheep marketplace scam can be found here among some other details this was the owner of sheep that turned out to be the real person behind the market in dec during a media interview thomas denied being the person responsible for the sheep marketplace scam thomas was never arrested until know even though that his name details were well known and reported to the czech police soon after the scam.
this is going to be tails specific if you are not using tails already i would highly recommend it it comes preconfigured with tor gpg off the record truecrypt irc and electrum is very easy to add this tutorial could be used with linux but you would need to manually install otr and configure the proxy if anyone would like i can write a tutorial for ubuntu and debian based os open up pidgin messenger by either clicking the pidgin icon or going to applications internet pidgin the first time you open it the manage accounts tab should pop up but if it does not go to accounts manage accounts addunder accopunt type select xmpp jabberenter information as follows username pick onedomain jabber deresource leave blankpassword create onecreate new account on this server check box next click the advanced tableave the require ssl box checkedconnect port connect server okj xc j szr y onionleave the rest of the settings as they arenext click the proxy tabit should say use global settings leave that as it isclick the add button and it should log you on at this point it is important to create an otr key go to tools plugins otr off the record and make sure it is enabledclick configure plugin you will need to select the account you just created from the drop down tab it should say no key present and generate key click generate key at this point you will have an otr fingerprint when you start talking to someone from the forums or here you will need to add them to your buddy list and start a private conversation with them to do this go to the otr menu in the chat box and click start private conversation it will give you a warning that they are not authenticated click authenticate buddy and go to manual fingerprint verification have them send you a copy of their otr fingerprint either through email or the forums encrypted with your pgp key once you have made sure that the fingerprints match click authenticate buddy at this point you are communicating in real time with perfect forward secrecy this means that every chat session has a unique key and unlike email they cannot go back and decrypt your chats even if they recover your otr key mixing the tor hidden service plus otr provides you complete anonymity privacy and plausible deniability this method does not use a hidden service for file transfers but all file transfers are routed over tor i would not accept file transfers unless you completely trust the person sending the file anyone wants to chat send me a pm this tutorial uses chaos computer clubs hidden service but you can substitute any other hidden jabber service namasteinann.
thank you for understanding and replying scidmt this was more of a venting location i was so stressed irl and could not speak to anyone about it i almost wish there was a dnm therapist for times like this some people just need to talk it out however it s hard to open up to people in the real world abou this type of thing agora fixed the deposit and i m speaking with my vendors to get my orders out now agora came through like they always do but this is the reason why majority of business should be done off market i think marketplaces are a good spot for buyers to find vendors however there should be no reliance on a third party agora ie site administrators to fix and or overlook transactions last time i go through website marketplace i trust agora and they came through for me but in real life i was a mess for days straight just on the hook of if i own my money anymore or not.
have you ever heard of the textsecure texting app much better than regular messaging in terms of security but no cure all.
i already came across one but thank you slow.
hi guys how are you i m here to ask a question especially to the sellers i wondered why no one had ever landed on italian community darknet selling its products psychedelic i m a frequent customer on the various markets but have at least one seller on the platform top italian for me would be a wonderful thing the forum is this there are no internal wallet so no one can escape the escrow are physical and have deposited money for the protection of customers there is also an irc chat always active qrdpvonwwqnic j onion index ph.
offering a bounty for details on cashing out btc and similar information please pgp pm me for questions we will discuss bounty then as well cheers rhet.
doses lysergic on january amit s v its got it lazy on my part language is a reflection of culture and culture changes over time to use outmoded language is improper in my opinion we don t use words such as thereupon anymore because they are superfluous figures of speech thereupon has no necessary meaning and really no meaning at all it is just word filler it s an old fashioned fancy equivalent of like the word i used was thereon which doesn t mean anything like like in this context it s just a more concise way of saying on the subreddit in question i don t think there s any basis for arguing that it s an archaic word or that nobody uses it anymore i see it often enough again i don t know why we re so hung up on language here i was trying to make a a serious argument clearly and logically you ve seen two reasoned arguments for the rhetorical use of the double negative and have failed to address either only repeating your earlier assertion just as you failed to address the actual substance of my post in the first place either way on thoroughly derailing this discussion.
can you purchase btc through electrum can you explain why electrum would be anonymous compared to coinbase online wallet if i were to send btcs from an online wallet to my electrum wallet would it still be anonymous.
isnt there a country where people can host a hidden server without any concerns about usa or europe making a demand to force the host to give away the servers files mutual legal assistance treaty i mean there are almost countries all around the world isnt anyone safe maybe north korea any country in middle east any i hate usa and europe and will never comply to their requirements country ive been thinking about that there is a tiny chance hidden servers have their real ip discovered as happened with silk road so why not to put the servers based in a country that s gonna say fuck you rest of the world this is my country people here do whatever they want in internet or at least they say fuck you rest of the world we only deal with internet crimes that affects our country directly and none of those vendors or site admins live here or fuck you rest of the world we wont comply any bullshit from usa or europe at all where the heck is a safe place to host a hidden server im just curious and asking myself that if there is a country like that this were another mistake from the silk road s admin.
vendors should look at this seem to really be legit and fully encourage multi sig and discouragefe i was able to quickly set up an account and add a public key the site looks very appealing.
on november pmwhat about silk road unless there is something bad about it i'm not to sure would stay far away from anything with silkroad in the name i would highly recommend dream its the longest running dnm ever we love avengers love avengers ai referral link required to join uptime.
deposits and withdrawls are very slow at agora atm cheers dolmi.
there is away to use electrum in tails without persistence it does however require an external usb or sd disk where to store your wallet and the electrum app we will not use the tails pre installed electrum version we will be using the downloaded one i ll explain below how to start it btw i am not saying this is the correct way to do things i personally will use tails persistence but since you asked here is a way to do it in your external data disk create a secret password protected partition using tails disk utility this will be only visible from tails and it will be like a persistent drive for your data here is where you store your wallet and electrum app in electrum site downloads get installation from we love avengers sources and download linux version once unzipped you ll have a folder save this in your secret disk all you need to do is access this folder from your terminal in terminal command line type cd and drag the folder from your desktop to terminal it should look something like cd amnesia externaldisk electrum this opens the folder in terminal and once you are inside the folder command line shows something like amnesia exernaldisk electrum once you are in the folder run electrum type electrum electrum app should open the you create a wallet and save this wallet in your secret disc file looks something like mywallet dat by default each time electrum starts will load the last wallet used make sure to create a backup copy of your wallet in another secret disk just in case hope that helps sorry for the short technical explanations on linux terminal but i am not expert just an average user.
i stopped using tor browser and use a middlebox configuration instead so i am not aware of that error but a quick search shows port is used to make a connection in netscape also you can look at tcp sctp udp hypertext transfer protocol over tls ssl don t have the server set up with tls ssl certificates as that would put the server at risk if others are getting this error please reply here.
welcome first i want to say that while my knowledge is limited i have learnt several tricks from other people and with this guide i plan to make them a bit more available to the public so let s start first you ll probably screw up somewhere and save something you shouldn t on your local unsafe disk don t worry we have a cure for that also i recommend a free software called eraser which does a pretty good job you can download it from is our favorite tor which you can download from i won t cover these programs in depth since they are rather simple and easy to use or have a bigcommunity which can explain the details much better than i myself can i will mostly just draw your attention to their existence so that you may better prepare yourself the next software you will need is truecrypt which sadly has been discontinued but unlike his mom and pa the internet won t let their child so easily rest in peace i suggest you go to find out more about its history and possible future you can also download the a version which unlike v allows you to encrypt your precious information i suggest reading the guide on their site but truth be told it s such a magnificent software that it s a tutorial in itself if you manage to get lost in it you are truly and amazing human being or just a human who s to lazy to read a few lines of text now you need something with which you can encrypt your private messages on the forums or on the website we use pgp for this and the byte encryption the program which was recommended to me for this task is gpg usb which you can download from software is better than gpg win because it allows you to run it from an usb stick which can be encrypted and with no need for installation it s also much safer since gpg win makes backups of your keys and contains several other issues which i read upon the forum that may or may not be true but better be safe than sorry now how to use it by going to their website you have tutorials that are already well made and that contain pictures which guide you through the whole process.
the current version of gpg win will not generate a key larger that it has been recommended that everyone should use the same bit key length for maximum anonymity use this very easy and you can encrypt the whole flash drive with truecryt.
tails devs have not renewed their pgp certificate they are well aware of this therefore you cannot verify the integrity of the tails iso try adding and certfying the tails key you'll see that it has expired despite showing a expire date in the only option for now is to use as many checksums as possible and downloading from multiple places.
thank you so much i was having this problem earlier and could not figure out how to fix it or find a better pgp client great jo.
done thank you.
next best markets are the following nucleuswe love no specific order they are about equal to one another.
damn free ross i guess he was to the dnms today as what zeppelin hendrix was to roc.
the following information is advice it comes from sources irl and my own thoughts use common sense when reading i am just relaying the information if it does not apply to you or you cannot do it well then skip it these are some general methods to hide your identity or at least your regional writing identifiers especially if english is not your primary language there is no reason not to do this if you are able terminology slang word choice and spelling vary tremendously around the globe and over short distances within english use universal terms if you can currency units of measurement and references to common objects or actions should be watched closely besides cultural references what is the area you make toilet in called depends on where you are greetings and farewells also tend to be regional drug slang it should be obvious is regional use what the community generally uses even if it sounds odd word check everything you can pick from british or american standard based on what program you use become friends with a thesaurus if you use a word commonly use a synonym instead read blogs or personal websites from english speaking countries take the speech of the native speakers and use it grammar and syntax give distinct patterns but usually require more writing samples to analyze punctuation usage of an exclamation point comma and emoticons should be watched do you write like this or maybe like this how about this one pay attention to these things your spacing sentence and paragraph pattern too do you write very long sentences that could be broken up into little sentences but instead tend to keep going on and on then finally end then a small one next that is a pattern even if you vary all your other identifiers most people miss this i would advise against writing in a completely different style every time you will make mistakes that will show you are giving false information and then that information will be ignored for recurring patterns these patterns left will be your native patterns it takes less writing samples to cross check than most think better to be consistent pick a style and stick with it establish and maintain false patterns that will be confused with true ones last do not fall into your false patterns irl or outside of tor any other general ideas.
you can anonymize recipients by putting throw keyid in your gpg conf unfortunately some pgp clients are crappy and won't test all the private keys in their key chain so they will fail to decrypt anonymized pgp messages.
i think this info was somehow scraped from the forums or front end of the marketit doesn t mean anything i found my nym in there never bought anything most of those names are market names not linked to any public or private presence the people who leaked this are trying to extort the owners or claim they hacked the market if it s still up i assume it hasn t been hacked afaik dhl is a wallet to wallet service and has no big bag of bitcoins behind it the anti dhl people think dhl is weak they don t know or realize that the site was intended to be hackable that is a hacker would get nothing from the site ingenious really.
uncleal on november ammaybe for smaller newer vendors this would be a great way to make orders but for big vendors i really don't see it happening too time consumingan interesting approach might be for vendors running too good to be true sales we have to remember that many exit scams happen after the point that vendors have gained their customer bases trust.
with this sort of system the vendor is particularly in danger of being scammed by the customer why would anyone decide to sell on this marketplace.
hi all i'm new here searching for trusted dnm and forums i like this place and heard about it before i just want to know your opinion about vault is weird isn't it.
not had a single problem with helix just register for an account though the heliz light doesnt sound safe for larger amount.
is tor that effective when it comes to wallets and anonymity to my understanding tor only disguises the activity you re doing but anyone who s eavesdropping at the exit node can get my ip pretty easily so if i use tor for my electrum wallet the electrum servers may not know where the coins came from but le can always know it by watching the exit nodes could it really be haha i guess i m too paranoid  crepuscular on february pmbut for people who may have trouble getting coins that are totally unlinked to them maybe some information about different tumbling options advantages disadvantages current status reputation etc would be helpful btw i second this i think about new tumbling methods since btcfog at least according to what i read on reddit is latelz being sketchy as fuck.
schuldig on may pmit is pre installed with vidalia and a torified browser called 'iceweasel' it should automatically open up when connected to the internet if not use the 'iceweasel' browser menu shortcut to get onto the road iceweasel opened up automatically for me up to tails version but i've had to use the shortcut in the last two versions and.
it s been said from the beginning i really don t hope it turns out true.
fatfreddie on december pm es okay thanks for the info it kind of spooked me out yesterday jf there is no such thing as we love avengers marketplace the word has just been put in there by the admins to stop someone from spamming this place the original reference was to d r e a m m a r k e t is this the phinshing site you speak off is this site legit.
yea congrats santa have fun dropping all the goodies down the chimneys of the world.
helloi was wondering if there is a way to safely chat over tor environment p p encryption anonimity i read some threads about it some recommend torchat other say is not safe anyone has an idea for this it would actually be cool to be able to chat with a vendor when you are working on an order some vendor take days to reply messages and things can get longer than expected i dont know if this is against opsec or what please any of the tech gurus out there throw some light on the matter.
hey all just wondering what market had the lead atm with the most amount of listing and users cheers dolmi.
anybody ever use them are there buds grade a top shelf do they have fire.
also never use that password agai.
i mainly use os x with tor directly installed as a service started as the user at log in i then have different browsers for where i need to go the one i use for dark net dealings use i have what i call dark fox where i am not completely safe but am able to run simple javascripts without compromising security not easy to do but it's all there my main reason for using os x is that it's the only fully posix compliant unix out there after going through and unlocking all the things they lock to keep stupid people from hurting the os you will find yourself in better control over the entire os just like any other version of linux i also like how pgp integrates into the operating system and allows for easy import signature decryption and encryption without the need to open a separate app then i have a regular version of firefox for clearnet use and i have installed chromium not from the one from google for a recommendation to others i would have to say using whonix is a good way to start you don't need to change the os or boot to a different flash live usb just download virtualbox and the different images they have ready for you to use in any os if the settings are the same as the walk through i made to isolate a virtual os behind tor you should be able to use full java flash and anything that doesn't require udp to work without risk of exposure.
wow postage seems like a lot for a small package.
just withdrew no problems here.
hi wilderness thanks for the reply i didn t include bitblender because they were hacked some time ago and once a website that should have security as its job gets hacked it s hard to trust it again i may add it though since they haven t had any problems for half a year or so i have used blond wigfog a number of times and never had an issue but it does seem like there are quite a few people that have even on small amounts which doesn t make sense from a scamming point of view.
i would not recommend currently using agora i have always loved the site but a lot of peoples deposits are not showing up lately my deposit has not showed for days with no reply from support i would recommend using we love avengers or maybe abraxas till agora gets there shit figured out.
i wouldn't call it an exit scam as such imo they were compromised and it was a fast reteat in to the sunset seems that the downfall intentional or otherwise was to allow escrow as well as multisig the same old vendors joined up and didn't bother to enforce multisg and hey presto now there is a chunk of change in the escrow pot not much but enough to reteat if the going got tough vendors who used escrow you can afford to lose the coins by the sound of it i stuck to multisig only and came out only losing time and effort the amount of time and effort the admins put in to eic it you were to break down what they gained at todays rate by going offline that's not even worth the hassle imo.
i ll take one for lsd and one for amphs if you got them on hand.
idk agora is target by the fbi and other le a safe person i guess would stay off the markets entirely and see how things play out i just think it s kind of strange that none of the other markets are going down right now as well if its a tor problem then none of them are safe i saw someone post some link about some vulnerability that was found about a month ago this is definitely horrible news idk if we will ever see agora up and running again i haven t received my withdraw yet nor has the majority of people now the site is down for those brave enough to go to another market i would ve used each one of those before during agora downtime with success why can t things just run smoothly i only got into these darknetmarkets about months ago and it s been nothing but chaos and bad news i guess that comes with the terroitory i ll be pressing on myself direct deals only though for now.
thereon thereupon it doesn t matter beacuse those words have no meaning i didn t imply it meant like i wrote it is the equivalent of the use of the word like like you know if you were trying to make a clear arguement you failed which was my arguement in the beginning and is now.
on november pmwe love avengers's going through a major phishing outbreak lots of folks have been losing their btc stolen just beware or avoid till the security issues are resolved sli realized i got phished when it told me to verify pin i typed it in correctly and it said invalid there was no getting out of that page withdrew my btc as fast as i could laying low from ab for the moment.
bbkf on february pmthe change to a new kernel and reports of users having issues including dirtysouf not being able to verify the signing key has me stuck on tails what do you mean you can t verify the signing key do you mean you can t verify the iso with the detached pgp signature download the sig file and the iso again gpg verify tails i iso sig tails i isogpg signature made tue jan am utc using rsa key id a db gpg good signature from tails developers offline long term identity key gpg warning using untrusted keythe tails developers publish their keys on the following page can also see this page on trusting verifying the tails developers pgp keys from bbkf on february pmis there an alternative that includes usb mounting persistence and memory wiping at shutdown anyone very knowledgeable feel safe using the upgrade the upgraded kernel is the same flavor of linux used by redhat which works very closely with the us government the kernel version is pretty much on a par with that as just about every up to date linux distro is using if there is a conspiracy linus is involved and just about every other distro developer as well linux amnesia debian ckt deb u i gnu linuxspitfir.
inanna on april amlelantos has had great uptime and i suggest them to everyone ussrmail was down half of the time so i switched over to lelantos just make sure to encrypt everything and be careful about what you put for subject headers i have seen a lot of vendors mention lelantos might have to set up an email there when the time comes i know an email isn t essential in using the dn but it couldn t hurt to have one setup the right way.
i tried it out when it was first created the taint analysis left much to be desired over traditional tumblers i use helix light from the grams website and have never had any issue.
just a warning to everyone if a new forum member posts links to a marketplace mixing service bitcoin site any site where you send money they might be fake links designed to spoof the original site and steal your money verify those links before you send your bits to them.
i am offering some promotional listings on we love avengers and would like to offer them to the members of this community as well the two we love avengers auctions below will be shipped on monday the th it's the same top shelf herb that consistently sells out on agora at an ounce but i don't usually sell eighths on agora biding starts at shipping the only thing i ask is please leave me some feedback either here or on that market or both love avengers listing php id love avengers listing php id i have a few more promo auctions listed there as well that ship at later dates thanks.
galindoi on july pmi can't respond as a buyer don't have any experience with depositing funds there but as a seller its all crickets over there not a lot of activity for mushrooms i've found in light of that though the few transactions i've had went smooth customers finalized and i was able to transfer my funds several hundred dollars out of the system into my own wallets easily and with no hassle so grain of salt galindoiis agora where most of your sales occur.
it happened again here it is in full mon jun potentially dangerous connection one of your applications established a connection through tor to using a protocol that may leak information about your destination please ensure you configure your applications to use only socks a or socks with remote hostname resolution whats up doc.
so far abraxas has been so smooth and there s a good amount of vendors setting up shop there alphabay has been fucking shit for the past couple of weeks don t know what s up there besides the influx of traffic from this week i am trying to verify some vendors on abraxas currently but they seem to not check messages often.
it is legit but for how long is difficult to say i think people here on tmg can help you out with cannabis if you're looking for bulk go wallet wallet with some trusted vendor.
a recipt would be nice like tn histor.
according to someone on here i'm sending out terrible messages when i encrypt them i sent one to ootd on here and a few others and i hope this hasn't been an issue i don't know what the fuck is going on right now and i'm flipping shit i just want to buy some drugs man not have more complications.
check if you are you using the latest tbb laters tails whonix if custom system are you sure your setup is good if you are unsure i d advise to use tails from a dvdr on a second hand laptop with no hdd you can find that for cheap on craigslist you also could use whonix on a hard drive if your machine is powerful enough tails is great if you don t run it from a usb stick in that an attacker can t modify the system and each time you reboot you reboot clean as long as the original system you burn is not compromised you can use an encrypted usb stick to store your bookmarks in a text file your gpg key and everything that you could need whonix is great as it allow for better isolation if you safely store a copy of both images offline you will be able to start fresh from time to time to be sure you run a clean system.

we love avengersmarket on november pmwe are pleased to announce that we love avengers market now supports multisig transactions this was requested a long time ago by the community so we decided to step up our game a bit and go for this option we are now the only marketplace on the deepweb having all of the following security measures source we love avengers s marketplace list multisig transactions fa withdrawal pin vendor bond forced vendor pgpfor the less tech inclined here s how a multisig transaction works both the buyer and the seller must have set their public multisig key in their profile the buyer deposits of the item value in his we love avengers wallet to cover market fees the buyer purchases the item then a multisig bitcoin address is generated using the buyer s key seller s key and a market generated public key both parties can use this publicly viewable information to verify the authenticity of the address the buyer sends money to this address and the seller ships the goods if the buyer is happy he finalizes and the seller received the market private key in case of dispute or refund the buyer receives the private key whoever got the private key will use it along with his own private key to claim the coins to make it simple buy the product and you get a btc address to send the coins to seller gets the private key when you finalize you get the key if you dispute and win this is a fool proof method to avoid exit scams you never give your private keys to anyone we don t provide help in cashing out the multisig address you have private keys out of so you are supposed to know the rest if you lose your private key it s too bad enjoy signup love avengers affiliate php ref outragedvery good look i have a renewed faith in we love avengers now.
you just made a thread in the best market you re already there here as far as psychedelics everything you could want is here and in my opinion psychedelics are the only drugs worth pursuin.
i like nucleus middle earth i saw some kid was on middle earth at this coffee shop on his laptop those eagles they do look pretty harmless i wouldn't have known i'm setting up on black bank soon ootp is on there and a few other vendors i use feeling good about everything not agora we should have markets ideally so something for eeveryone but i'm trying to stay close to home if you know what i mean good luck markets.
so far abraxas has been so smooth and there's a good amount of vendors setting up shop there we love avengers has been fucking shit for the past couple of weeks don't know what's up there besides the influx of traffic from this week i am trying to verify some vendors on abraxas currently but they seem to not check messages often.
it can be a pain in the ass but think about this scenario feds break down your door no time to hide anything incriminating and the only thing stopping them from reading all your messages is that one single password not that it would come down to that just the principle that your password is to stop someone else from reading your messages if they get on your cpu.
ok have seen this question come up a few times so thought i would write up some thoughts that might help stimulate some conversation safety noteif you are a vendor it is probably best advised if you refrain from discussing the particulars of how you handle your coins in general try to avoid mention what software or hardware you use btc walletswhy trust a web service at all you can download a lite client and handle sending and receiving from your own computer note you must configure this to run through tor if you are going to use it for buying code select can you purchase btc through electrum not afaik can you explain why electrum would be anonymous compared to coinbase online wallet it is a client side wallet ie it lives on your computer therefore as long as your ensure it is configured to run through tor it means you can receieve and send btc wihtout needing to logon to an online wallet this comes with its own ramifications one consideration is that when you start a blockchain wallet using tor perhaps blockchain notes that transaction as having been through tor can we ensure that their serves are safe from government hacks however having a bitcoin wallet on your computer means that you have total control over your btc this has its ups and downs if i were to send btcs from an online wallet to my electrum wallet would it still be anonymous were the coins bought with anything that can identify you have you ever logged onto a service that is connected to your btc over a clearnet connection therefore associating your ip to those coins this is a bit simplistic but you get the idea if they were anonymous to begin with and you have electrum setup to only run through tor then they will remain anon online blockchain if you need a wallet on the fly then you could set up a brand new wallet for each transaction you don t need to use an email address and it can be one time use only on opsec for online wallets if using them to purchase controlled substances always access them through tor never link your real life identity to these services ie register with an email that is linked to your irl identity if you logon to it not through tor this means your ip physical location is linked to that wallet abandon it immediately never logon again and create new wallet start a new wallet for each transaction you don t need to use an email at all what to do if you bought btc with your credit card across an clearnet connection suggestion blockchain shared send blockchain shared send bitcoinfog will update this as we get more input and specific questions.
helloi opened an account at we love avengers with an eye to open store in there any users care to share the love for this market pickles.
couldn't hurt the security forum sure is sneaky down here.
root on may ami think the only marketplace that i can say i have no love for is we love avengers i don't like a site devoted to theft of ones identity i have had multiple family members put into an endless cycle and a hole of debt trying to recover from identity theft other friend with ruined credit that made it hard to find a job and imposable to get a good rate on home purchase because they were taken advantage of in the same manor while i don't like the identity theft part either we love avengers is actually the best darknet market currently for drugs they a large amount of listings and the site is almost always up with top notch ddos protection.
she's not selling on any markets that i'm aware of but she has a thread here.

thanks for the heads up happy new year.
i ve been away from the market scene for a while but i think i read several months ago about a few top vendors who were planning to bypass the markets with their own personal markets did any vendors actually do this seems like it could have advantages and disadvantages.
could that be the default setting knowing the list of currently online users is of no use really.
thanks brother sister for helping me to remember the facts it s just money after all and i guess there s still time to score some acid to my friend for christmas metta metta metta even to the guy who might ve stolen the coins i love you ps god damn those captchas are tricky after a tab or two why wont you stay stil.
hi i am seriously having trouble finding a way to buy my btc in the us without attaching my bank account to the service does anyone know of a way i can use an anonymous card loaded with cash to purchase my btc without this knowledge i have been unable to order and it is killing me inside slowly lol.
santa a title well earne.
here s the statement given by one of the mods on dhl today is it true what is being said yes it is true attackers did move btc into one and successfully withdrew about btc before it was halted but continue reading the btc was their own lol the attacker deposited their own coins in increments to our deposit wallet while trying to confuse the order system with order spam but with bip everything is tied to the blockchain there is no internal accounting system to confuse afterwards they withdrew about again of their own btc before we cut it off thanks for the btc we are able to prove this at any time if a high standing and trusted member of the community would like to audit we can do this through simply passing our market xpub but we don t do that in a public medium since we take our users transaction privacy seriously forum was restored from a backup instead of scripting a clean up a few posts and messages might have been lost but should be below please double check each and every attack just keeps us on our toes and has actually pushed us quicker into ending beta we were going to do security bounties and tests ourselves but whosoever is paying the attackers is covering those costs for us any other claims in regards to stealing dhl coins are completely false although somewhat amusing what people come up as already stated the only thing this attacker has done of any really annoyance is spam our forums which we ll be adding more anti spam measures for shortly so again funds will always be safe from theft or seizure but of course if it is your own coins i can t exactly go against you withdrawing them lol for the moment while security is put in vendors will not be able to process orders but this will be fixed within a couple of hours full market functionality should be restored and all other measures in place within hours at least the btc will be going to a charity that we ll maybe create a poll on which our users can make.
hey spitfire you seem to be up to speed somewhat on security related things anyway nightcrawler is was a highly respected hacker who wrote some pretty extensive docs on security look around you might find his papers it's a shame sr forums are no longer accessible all the wonderful reviews discourses and treasure trove of knowledge gone well nothing that was lost can not be made anew moving on thankgiving blessings to all.
gladly stand corrected thank you for the input and validation oot.
we are pleased to announce that we love avengers market now supports multisig transactions this was requested a long time ago by the community so we decided to step up our game a bit and go for this option we are now the only marketplace on the deepweb having all of the following security measures source we love avengers s marketplace list multisig transactions fa withdrawal pin vendor bond forced vendor pgpfor the less tech inclined here s how a multisig transaction works both the buyer and the seller must have set their public multisig key in their profile the buyer deposits of the item value in his we love avengers wallet to cover market fees the buyer purchases the item then a multisig bitcoin address is generated using the buyer s key seller s key and a market generated public key both parties can use this publicly viewable information to verify the authenticity of the address the buyer sends money to this address and the seller ships the goods if the buyer is happy he finalizes and the seller received the market private key in case of dispute or refund the buyer receives the private key whoever got the private key will use it along with his own private key to claim the coins to make it simple buy the product and you get a btc address to send the coins to seller gets the private key when you finalize you get the key if you dispute and win this is a fool proof method to avoid exit scams you never give your private keys to anyone we don t provide help in cashing out the multisig address you have private keys out of so you are supposed to know the rest if you lose your private key it s too bad enjoy signup love avengers affiliate php ref outrage.
doseheavy on september pmyou mean vj yes he is able to pentest and plays both sides of the law he hacks to get the ip for the alphabet soup and also hacks and extorts markets right under their nose at the same time we all know the same parson is behind the markets with different names that pop up get big and tap out honorably that person can t handle vj trd was the only one who shut him down he was helping the other markets become more secure too no i m talking about hacks cracks and his many aliases current being dnmthief on reddit after more reading it looks like dhl did admit to bitcoins being moved around so i guess that s enough of an admittance.
low randomized fees when you deposit coins into your blond wig blender account we will take a low randomized fee of between we make our fees low to keep coin mixing affordable and we randomize the fee to make analysis of our service less predictable in other words if our fee was a standard blockchain analysis would be made more trivial interested parties would need only look for suspected deposits and withdrawals tagged with a modifier our randomized fee takes this tool away from those who would seek to tie your transactions to you.
we are looking to move our enterprise to we love avengers cannot believe another marketplace exit scam getting really tired of this we will be dealing with fe only from now on available for direct dealing through tmgalso available on we love avengersplace and we love avengers coming soon cheers s.
on multisig haha xd it seems a bit complicated to me as well though but i want to be free from sending coins on market excrow mind you i dont order often just once in a while but that tends to be a medium large sized orde.
i think enigmaticsmile meant which level of encryption and which app you will need the strongest key for best security bit also most people encrypt their messages in a text editor then paste to where needed mail forum pm etc.

eyeseeker on may ami've never ordered cannabis from a vendor before so i am trying to find a reputable one that can also be trusted  tuesdoa on may ambeen also lookin to buy weed there but hard times man gonna wait till agora comes up and gonna buy an oz from trusted vendorbehold.
knuckles on may pmi do miss the original silk road seriously at this point it seems so nostalgic ditto nothing feels the same.
anyone used what are your thoughts anyone have an invite to spare.
wish hansa would get the amount of users it deserves.
also unrelated question but does anyone know what happens to a vendor s grams profile if they update their key there and on the linked markets that are still up will you lose your link feedback from defunct markets where you cannot update your key will you lose any links feedback at all or does it still give you credit for having verified with your old key that grams previously recognized as being used on a market i d just really like to know because it takes an eternity to add most things and their support does not respond at all actually that s not true grams got back to me in less than hours saying my subject was too long and that they therefor could not read my message body for such a nice clean website and awesome functionality i m surprised too many characters in the subject interferes with the body of the message at all kind of random and you d think they could prevent your subject from being too line by limiting how long it can be rather than letting you destroy your own messages lol after that they didn t get back to me and i think i ve asked them the same questions times now with short subject lines over months so i m guessing they re not going to would be nice if they had a forum seems like they ve pulled together a nifty set of services and i m very curious as to how many buyers utilize it in any way whatsoever and also about the updating public key stuff.
hofmannite on january pmi'm unfamiliar with this method would you mind going into deeper detail unsure what i would ask for or if i have to have some sort of account with a bank on the listing no accounts needed just go onto localbitcoins and look for a vendor who does cash deposits then go to the bank they specify give the teller his account number and cash and they'll send coins to your walle.
why don t you just do cash deposits at localbitcoins com.
idk if i have any spare left over coin but if i do this is where ill be spending the first of it first off avengers does a great job and their forums are super helpful i did a bunch of research and well you can't really fake a test sure you can lie about a test but once word gets out its gg i didnt win the super lotto or w e that billion so i guess half of something still makes me a winner its also super cool they got a partnership with ec and testing price has been reduced.
just needed to understand what was happening no guess work here the advice about tails from a dvd running on a non hard disc system i take on board also glad to see the event is normal in some cases thanks for the feedback.

flipkart on january amits the vendors who struggle often having hundreds of coins in escrow in my view this is the vendor s fault risk should always be constantly evaluated and adjusted everyone knows there is always a risk of losing coins kept on the market so one should never keep coins that can t be lost when i hit in my escrow i hold back and pause orders until orders get cleared there is an easy way to clear your escrow though ship orders very quickly as they come in then the money is constantly coming off not having to wait usually more than or days per order.

how far will law enforcement go today we are going to talk about the lengths that law enforcement le will go to try and catch you slipping the thread that inspired this post was the following sr thread the first question is can le ship drugs to buyers to try and set them up for drug charges let us just say that they have done it to a silk road user before who went by the name of flush aka chronicpain aka curtis green april a dea undercover agent in maryland posing as a drug smuggler began communicating with dread pirate roberts on silk road about selling a large amount of illegal drugs dread pirate roberts instructed curtis green to help the smuggler find a drug dealer who could buy a large amount of drugs court papers say green found a buyer and agreed to act as the middleman for a sale of a kilogram of cocaine green gave the dea agent his address an undercover u s postal service inspector delivered the cocaine to green's house in utah on jan so as you can see whether you view it as entrapment or not once they have evidence against you they will eventually figure out a way to get something on you and bust you for it like they did to curtis green the secret service posed as a vendor for fake ids online for years and actually shipped fake ids that they made to buyers on an online russian forum us government's operation open market resulted in indictments against defendants according to wired special agent mike adams shipped out more than fake ids over about five years of activity while going by the username celtic amazingly the entire scheme started when the government arrested the real celtic a nevada man who got caught shopping at a whole foods where he'd previously used a fake credit card law enforcement discovered counterfeiting equipment among his possessions and learned about his online activities adams assumed his online identity and even improved celtic's cred shipping near flawless ids and becoming a trusted seller on carder ru as you can see in this article the secret service again sold illegal items to people online in order to bust them several of the buyers used their real addresses and sent real photos of themselves to this officer to have their ids made resulting in being arrested by the feds and in this particular case the feds charged all the defendants under something called the rico act  main indictment is noteworthy because in addition to the usual mix of credit card fraud and false identification charges the defendants have been charged under the mob busting rico act a first for a cybercrime prosecution enacted in to help the fbi crack down on the mafia the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act lets the feds hold every member of a criminal organization individually responsible for the actions of the group as a whole the losses collectively inflicted by the carder su members are easily enough to give every rico defendant years in prison when you commit crimes online especially in an online community the feds may be able to hold you accountable for the actions of other users on that same community so make sure when you do your freedom fighting or whatever you choose to do that you take this into considering always weigh out the worst case scenario should you get busted because the le will try and set you up one last example of how le will try and set you up but not relating to online communities is when they put together a fake sweepstakes in los angeles deputies in la mirada attempted a rope a dope on some alleged criminals by offering them a fake sweepstakes prize out of the letters sent to these people of interest only eight showed up at the la mirada holiday inn to collect their prize according to the whittier daily news posing as the pelican marketing group deputies sent letters last week to people throughout the county wanted in connection with crimes ranging from misdemeanor warrants to murder according to the report the suspects were advised to bring their letter and identification to the holiday inn and told that they were guaranteed a prize worth at least and would be one of people with a chance to win a bmw i sedan they were all smiles when they showed up to collect their prizes deputy janet ramirez told the newspaper once they tell them they're under arrest the smile fades quickly she said so the reason i made this post was for those of you who think that le will not go to certain lengths to try and set you up for charges they will do it if they want you bad enough and if you fall for it they might get you on some tough charges curtis green is facing up to years for the sting operation by the dea on him and the users who purchased fake ids on the russian forum could face up to years each since they can be charged under the rico act always keep these things in mind when conducting activities online and always take the worst case scenario into account it only takes one mistake to get caught and the government has unlimited resources and super computers to try and catch you slipping you may only have a few laptops desktops servers but nothing compared to the what they have be careful everyone.
why shouldn't you track packages through tor.

halfpint on august ami would be weary of switching it sounds like it isn t an agora specific problem for opsec i would refrain from any markets at the moment much what he said remember this is a vulnerability issue with tor not just agora thanks for slapping some sense into me it isn t just the markets it could apply to this forum as well i feel like if your encrypting your data and taking all the necessary precautions you ll be okay though.
trust nothing encrypt everything is my moto pgp is easy to learn and could save your ass in the long term.

we have not started our shop on we love avengers quiet yet currently listings are available on we love avengers which seems very stable but not a whole lot of traffic cheers s.

do you have tails on usb if so i d just start over with the application on tails os generate a new public key post it here and we can try and send you a message not sure what you mean by you can t decrypt message to other people if your refering to you cant decrypt a message your sending to someone else that s correct once you encrypt that message with their public key they re the only one who can decrypt it.
another reason why i hope more vendors make it on forums like tmg.
i can't respond as a buyer don't have any experience with depositing funds there but as a seller its all crickets over there not a lot of activity for mushrooms i've found in light of that though the few transactions i've had went smooth customers finalized and i was able to transfer my funds several hundred dollars out of the system into my own wallets easily and with no hassle so grain of salt galindo.
ooh ooh i have relevant informationso far as i am aware at the moment there are currently up markets not counting agora in addition to the ones you ve listed outlaw market dream market drug market and abraxas ive got links to register for all of them on my blog which you can find the link for l l l ldown vthere.

well bit blender went smoothly took less than mins then i went to deposit to a blockchain wallet and it sent fine address was for sure correct and everything but now blockchain is giving me an error when i try to log on error web server is down my javascript is also temporarily allowed like you have to do to see the captcha so that's not it hope this is resolved soon i was just logged onto my wallet and then the second i sent them to that wallet from bit blender i went to make sure they went through then it gave me the error edit ok just found out blockchain is down therefore blender worked flawlessly in less than mins hope the issues at blockchain get sorted out soon though that's for sure peace mrs b.
vitaminlsd on september pmi would definitely keep using a different machine for your dnm activities if you have one there have been web fingerprinting methods over the years that firefox has mitigations for against certain ones now canvas blocker to block canvas fingerprinting for instance but the last time i checked a few months ago there is still no mitigation against a new tactic called audio fingerprinting you imagine accidentally using the same computer you use facebook or linkedin from and having the nsa see that this and your dnm os had the same audio fingerprint and also coming from your same home ip if you're not using a vpn me cant open fingerprinting linkbecause javascript but how you vulnerable for le to get you audio fingerprint this a very simple execution for le orth do you haveth to maketh mistakes for them to get this audio print from you device how common this is also what if you no use facebook or linkedin alsodrop on drop in great info after great info jesus fucking christ thank vitaminlsd you me hero tertiary every person give advice thank jesus fucking christ we need more this vitmaninlsd you should be tmg tech spokesperson.
there is no exact way to answer this question except that your concerns are valid it s very possible for a vendor to be le it s also possible than inexperienced vendors keep more detailed records of your private info than they should this being said it s also possible that experienced vendors are making mistakes they should be avoiding you should probably assume your identity is compromised and wipe everything change addresses change pgp change username sticking with vendors others have reported success isn t but it s definitely a worthwhile precaution in this environment.
on november pmwhat about silk road unless there is something bad about it i'm not to sure would stay far away from anything with silkroad in the name i would highly recommend dream its the longest running dnm ever dream market referral link required to join uptime.
janesmith on may pmhow do you link your pgp key in your profile sig looks like you got i.

i am now testing multisig at tor bazaar beta note that this separate site from tor bazaar alpha and only beta has multisig for now.
all coins have made it safely into my anon blockchain wallet and are now ready to send to a vendor of my choice yay c b for me anyways bit blender is very quick and looks very legit i mean obviously use this service with caution and at your own risk as previously stated but really it helped reduce a lot of stress for me that normally goes along with cleaning btcs i know that i will be using bit blender again thanks for the advice peace mrs b.
goodit was a real pain to set it up manually.
with this sort of system the vendor is particularly in danger of being scammed by the customer why would anyone decide to sell on this marketplace.
caseysmith on april pmwould anyone mind dropping a link to middle earth i m looking for a sight that has more reliability than agora which is unfortunate because i really like agora middle earth market is at mango u rivtwxy onion and i d recommend against enabling javascript.

i am having the same problem with safe mail net and thunderbird i am using thunderbird and gpg win and can t seem to get it to work i need to find a safe email address that is anomymous any help appericated thank.
there are two main trusted tumblers and a third which was just released that i will post here along with some information about each i will also post an extra free method that you can use on top of tumbling first bitblender this service has been around for quite some time and is one of the trusted tumblers bitblender works with a shared coin system one huge wallet sending many small payments while the others seem more sophisticated many wallets bigger than your deposit that will send amounts to the addresses you gave in both cases it should work as far as blockchain analysis goes thanks wilderness bitblender also has a high volume bonus program where if you send btc within days your fee goes down by they also have a referral program where once combined deposits from a user and his her referred users reaches btc in days the referring user will be credited of all deposits fee randomized bitblender my ref link ref helix by grams grams started in april of as a simple search engine for products on the markets after a few months they started helix and have since created many useful services such as torads infodesk and gramsflow helix has a regular version which requires a grams account and a light version which does not the full version of helix has more fine tuned controls like delays and sending the clean coins in more than one transaction in the light version you send your coins to the address it gives you and as soon as it gets confirmations it sends the cleaned coins in one transaction to your specified address in the light version it can take up to hours but most transactions are completed within minutes fee minimum withdrawal amount btcmaximum withdrawal amount btchelix account cost not needed for helix light btchelix pay shield by sigaint sigaint has been one of the trusted darknet email service providers for about a year now and has just announced their new tumbler on june i have not had a chance to try it yet but it claims to complete the tumble in minutes what's unique about pay shield is that it has a pay someone with mixed coins feature from their website pay someone with mixed coins is primarily used to pay someone else with maximum privacy simply input the payees' bitcoin address and the amount they expect and pay shield will generate a mix for you and calculate how much you need to send to make the mix work out to that amount fee randomized pay shield on to the free method this is not recommended as a stand alone method there are many websites that store a large amount of bitcoins stores casinos exchanges etc i personally use casino websites send in your btc play a few rounds penny slots or you'll regret it and send it to your final destination you can also send to your preferred website of choice first before sending it to your tumbler with exchanges it's best to find one where you can send your btc and convert to ltc or another currency then back to btc please beware of phishing links i highly recommend using dnstats com or deepdotweb to confirm you are always using the correct address these sites have been providing darknet market info for years and can be trusted i have verified all these links but please feel free to do so yourself.
thanks for this looks like that helix link isn t working or maybe they re down right now.
with this sort of system the vendor is particularly in danger of being scammed by the customer why would anyone decide to sell on this marketplace.
i just placed an order the other day via that thread pgp e mail etc hoping to get it within a few days but cm's always been a stand up vendor just throw the address down somewhere and get their pub key.
what about safe bad anyone know.
jojen on november pmi am not sure if it is clever to use tor for your coinbase account i assume you want to buy bitcoin via a bank transfer in that case your real identity will be linked to your coinbase account anyway so no reason to use tor buy the coins using your clearnet browser then transfer them to a wallet not linkable to you you create and access this wallet only through tor and from there to the market vendor you want to buy from you can also configure tor browser to pick exit nodes from a specific country see good way to anonymously get bitcoin besides coinbase is localbitcoins com it allows you to buy bitcoins in person or via cash deposit or bank transfer directly from other people i don t have a bank account typically i just put money on a card i get from the dollar store that isn t re loadable what website would you recommend to purchase bitcoins with this disposable card other than localbitcoins really and what wallet would you recommend and should i get helix.
hey everyone i am trying to learn to navigate through tails i know that i must go to the 'applications' drop down at the top of the window select 'tails' then select 'configure persistent volume' but what to i do in order to keep my pgp keys and text files and anything else should i just select everything when i am configring the persistent volume any helpful input is greatly appreciated.
i stopped using tor browser and use a middlebox configuration instead so i am not aware of that error but a quick search shows port is used to make a connection in netscape also you can look at tcp sctp udp hypertext transfer protocol over tls ssl don't have the server set up with tls ssl certificates as that would put the server at risk if others are getting this error please reply here.

britneystoke on may ami would not recommend currently using agora i have always loved the site but a lot of peoples deposits are not showing up lately my deposit has not showed for days with no reply from support i would recommend using we love avengers or maybe abraxas till agora gets there shit figured out agora is now up and running full speed ahead captain cook.
here is a guide for gpa good luck.
when you turn on fa the system generates a random string and encrypts it with the pgp public key you supplied the system then shows you this encrypted message you are supposed to decrypt this message to reveal the random string and paste that result into the field provided when you do that you have shown that you have the private half of the pgp key and the passphrase in addition to having the username and password for the account spitfir.

multisig is imo the greatest thing to come to darknet markets in this year it protect all user funds from exit scammers i highly recommend you learn how to use it and support it so we can stop scams for good markets that i know support multisigwe love avengerswe love avengers if you know of any others please let me know you can learn how to use multisig on my blog here love avengers multisig guide htm.
alphabay is owned by the dn mods i am sure of that they own it including some of the new markets they dont have a small market suitable enough to take first place after they exit so they are building up others to do that i suspect oasis market thug market and i think they are the evo guys oasis looks too much like evo and alpha bay nearly functions like it but looks differen.
yea i just saw an article on we love avengers earlier about this who incident i'm glad that justice is finally being served i never used sheep marketplace but it pains me that so many people lost money hopefully the heavy hand of justice will fall upon kimble and verto now.
chances are it will be okay but i understand it is a horrible feeling to think that someone has personal info on you and you don't know what's going to happen its that period of waiting for the letter that can be so stressful the biggest thing really is to get a drop address that isn't connected with you and so can never link your address with your internet activity live and learn hope everything turns out okay.
i just used bitcoin blender for a small amount of coin under and it worked the whole process took under an hour.
just a heads up ive deposited coins to my account days ago and despite seeing them enter my account via blockchain i have never received my coins i've messaged support multiples times but they have never responded im not the only one with this problem either if you check the agora reddit pages or the bugs section there are plenty of posts about the same thing i have always loved and supported agora and would love to continue to do so but so far no one has heard back from support regarding this issue just be careful with your coins atm i recommend sticking to abraxas or alphabay until the situation is resolvedi will update this post immediately if i receive my coins or hear back from support.

on january am low randomized fees when you deposit coins into your bitcoin blender account we will take a low randomized fee of between we make our fees low to keep coin mixing affordable and we randomize the fee to make analysis of our service less predictable in other words if our fee was a standard blockchain analysis would be made more trivial interested parties would need only look for suspected deposits and withdrawals tagged with a modifier our randomized fee takes this tool away from those who would seek to tie your transactions to you that would still mean several thousands of transactions that would have to be analysed and most mixers have an input address and a new address to send the coins to so its not too much of a security risk there unless i am missing something key.
infotomb works very well and offers a variety of security options not implemented in most other upload sites.
a local street vendor friend of mine was worried about having open communications with his team and cut down on communication errors while trying to talk in code over cell phones i have studied the situation and am ready with a solution the system would have to use android and can be use in conjunction with or without cell service you will just need to be on wifi for a connection to the internet the solution will not work through tor connection lag so it would have to be a special set up with a dedicated server vps is ok to handle the communication streams a server closer to the outlet of the internet phone service provider would have the best results there is an app that will allow for end to end communication just like otr for xmpp jabber the encryption is protocol was made by the same inventor of pgp made me happy to read that one the application on the android phone would have he setting for the server and will be the dialer for it this will use the data connection on the phone and not the cellular phone service the app will encrypt the call fom one end to the other and the server will be set not to keep logs and to allow pass through communication that will enable the encryption to be done from one client to the other the starting price for a full package would be that would include year of the server required for the communications android smart phones using jellybean rootedquad core ghz gb ram gb romduel sim cards so you can jump between networks and dump prepaid sim cards easily frequency and networks gsm mhz wcdma mhz touch screen and tf card up to gb if you want need more storage i am also willing to do a server set ups and you can use your own rooted phones the server setup will include the price of the server for one year and would be around depending on the level of support you need if you are smart just need me to poke a few buttons the price is lower if you ask the same questions over and over again every time you add a phone the price will go up and don't forget you can use the im server over tor for text communication already using otr on some android clients.
the current version of gpg win will not generate a key larger that it has been recommended that everyone should use the same bit key length for maximum anonymity use this very easy and you can encrypt the whole flash drive with truecryt.
op more than likely you sent coins to an incorrect address you gotta be on your toes and please stop spreading fud what you re saying is a completely ridiculous statement agora is tops right up there with bmr and backopy falco.
thank you i was having the same problem too taking a first look in security i wasn't able to find a secure tor based e mail provider any help is appreciated.
i m looking for some cannabis and i heard alphabay is a good place to look i know this place is prominent in psychedelics but if anyone could help me i d much appreciate it.
i have used pay shield a few times now with no problems its super easy to use i like it so far.
maybe we could throw vendors personal sites up there as well i've got one i know albion does and gamma sc.
an updated version would be.
i really don t know why more vendors arent coming around to tmg and promoting that instead sure i can see the downside of it taking longer to build clientel but fuck after each exit scam and how much money they lose per scam i m sure it has to build up to a shit ton of money lost more trusted vendors need to make their way here i ve tried on my end at least i got galindoi to make his way here let s add to that lis.
i would not recommend currently using agora i have always loved the site but a lot of peoples deposits are not showing up lately my deposit has not showed for days with no reply from support i would recommend using alphabay or maybe abraxas till agora gets there shit figured out.
about hours ago i was able to log onto sigaint email with no issues now i cannot connect tors response is err empty responsethis is not something ive seen before from tor usually there is a socks error anyone else having issues.
thanks i m back on.
thanks for the good read.
h pylori on april ami only have a pgp key do i have necessarily to make a one in general a bit key is to be preferred bit keys are expected to be safe until about or thereabouts bit keys are expected to be safe for another years after that that said i expect that rsa keys will be phased out over the next years they will be replaced by ecc keys which are based on elliptic curves ecc keys will be significantly smaller and are believed more secure than rsa keys spitfir.
i remember reading somewhere that sharedcoin on blockchain isn't as good as the proper tumbling services will try and remember and post the lin.
there are many reports of helix not releasing the coins wonder whats up there and sigaint has been having network issues lately.
we love avengersmarket on november pmnot saying abraxas is over but we are confident you will find we love avengers to fit your needs try it out here registration love avengers affiliate php aff market love avengersforum love to we love avengers we have messaged the we love avengers team about waiving vendor registration a few times to no avail we get no response from the we love avengers team until then we're available on dream and here for direct dealing cheers s.
on may pmi hope this isn't a silly question but is there an alternate url for ag i know a few other markets have given out alternate addresses since initially going down this last time i've only been able to log onto ag once since then and am not sure if i overlooked it or what i don't think there is according to lenged there used to be a link that only vendors could access but there definitely isn't one now.
at silk road trial federal agent explains how he trapped ulbrichthow the feds became dripsofacid buying and selling on silk road by joe mullin jan am utcthe silk road trialnew york more people were using the mail to get high and jared der yeghiayan knew it we hadn't seen ecstasy being seized in letter class like that in a long time said the homeland security special agent since i'd been at o'hare der yeghiayan was speaking on wednesday from the stand in a manhattan federal courtroom where year old ross ulbricht stands accused of being the mastermind in the most successful drug dealing website of all time the silk road prosecutors showed a table full of more than envelopes with a few varying kinds of labels all used to ship drugs this was just one day said der yeghiayan who pursued narcotics investigations from his office at the chicago airport we hardly had seizures of ecstasy in years past when they did find pills in the mail it was a one off on a hand addressed envelope by he was seeing large amounts of printed letters coming from europe and other countries with fake business names printed on as return addresses like studyabroad com by october of that year der yeghiayan had opened an investigation of silk road it would ultimately lead him to a long relationship with the website first as buyer then as seller and ultimately as a staff member becoming friendly with and getting paid by dread pirate roberts the boss behind the site two years after he began seizing those stunning amounts of drugs in the chicago airport der yeghiayan came to believe that dpr was ross ulbricht the last chat would take place on october it ended when federal agents set upon ulbricht in a san francisco public library grabbing his laptop while it was still open to the chat page walking a jury down the silk roadtestimony today was partly the narrative of his investigation and partly a tour of the silk road it was the jury's first look at the website the testimony which began yesterday and continued throughout today touched on some things not made public until today private messages from dread pirate roberts secret staff only chat areas and dpr's guide for drug dealers covering everything from packaging to philosophy der yeghiayan has close cropped hair a goatee and a light beard on wednesday he wore a conservative black suit with a dark tie clearly an experienced witness he shifted his gaze from the prosecutor to the jury as he answered every question shortly after the investigation opened homeland security agents began to make buys from the site they would compare the drugs they seized or bought to silk road listings they had seen and found match after match ultimately der yeghiayan and his team made undercover buys from the site from over distinct silk road dealers in countries all but one of the purchases came through with real drugs the jury was walked through a few examples like a chunk of brown heroin weighing grams shipped from the netherlands der yeghiayan opened the package and showed photos to the jury the packaging was pro vacuum sealed pouch wasn't visible behind a bluish sheet of paper and the heroin was within not one but several plastic bags another photo showed butt plugs wrapped in black foil in april they did another buy a big one this one was walked through more slowly so the jury could understand how der yeghiayan bought bitcoins and what they were he showed how he used the now defunct mt gox exchange to turn into bitcoins then logged into a silk road account he had taken over called dripsofacid at that point the court reporter stumbled sorry he asked drips of acid der yeghiayan said more slowly then prosecutors ran through the various sections of silk road the silk road community forum was divided into five sections security shipping drug safety philosophy and off topic the philosophy section was held out to users as the home of dpr's book club that's where they try to discuss how to use drugs safely and just effects of different drugs was der yeghiayan's description of the drug safety section has anyone tried mdma from these sellers read a typical forum post shown to the jury which listed three silk road seller account names below the question on the site's wiki jurors read about the site's built in tumbler instead of doing a transfer from one account to another they put a lot of other accounts in between der yeghiayan said that masks who the buyers and sellers are avoid abandoned buildings or anywhere it would be suspicious to have mail delivered read a wiki section called receiving packages if you follow these guidelines your chances of being detected are minimal from buyer to sellerder yeghiayan also had access to at least one seller account presumably from an arrest called supertrips with that he was able to enter seller only sections of the site on the silk road seller's guide the rules read never ask clients for personal information under no circumstances should you save a copy of your client's address publish a public encryption key in your user description on your settings page so your customers can send you their information encrypted if they wish no selling out of escrow that last point was important the silk road escrow system discouraged either side buyer or seller from ripping the other one off money was held by silk road until both sides were satisfied every caution must be taken to maintain the secrecy of the contents of your clients' package advised another part of the seller's guide creatively disguise it in such a way that a postal inspector might ignore it it is your responsibility to stay up to date on the latest stealth packaging sellers should print their mailing labels not hand write on substances the guide insisted when selling any substances that had an odor you must vacuum seal the package dpr explained not try to mask it with another pungent thing like coffee the seller's contract with silk road obliged them to describe your items accurately and truthfully another part read like a corporate mission statement treat your customers with respect go above and beyond for them der yeghiayan read dpr's posts regularly the site admin at first simply called himself silk road adopting the dread pirate roberts name in february around when hsi began buying drugs off the site for a drug kingpin dpr's tone was sometimes quite emotional one imagines scenes with a therapist hey gang really sorry for the dead time there the site admin wrote after an outage in june this work is scary and exciting all at the same time and i'm really very happy to be on this journey with you in another post shown to jurors dpr waxed emotional about the success of his project it's great to see that my words are resonating with so many of you it's a privilege to have a stage to speak from here it doesn't get said enough and it is hard to get across in this medium but i love you who knew that a softy could lead an international narcotics organization behind my wall of anonymity i don't have to intimidate thankfully but yea i love you guys thank you for being here thank you for being my comrades thank you for being yourselves and bringing your unique perspectives and energy and on a personal note thank you for giving me the best job in the world i've never had so much fun i know we've been at it for over a year now but really we are just getting started i'm so excited and anxious for our future i could burst dthe site's owner stopped going by simply silk road and took on the name dread pirate roberts in january in a later message dpr got angry responding to users who had complained about increases in the commissions he charged on each sale he wrote when have i lied when have i cheated or stolen from anyone here when have i treated anyone unfairly when have i lead you astray why do you turn on me now when i have poured my heart and soul into this community and project on orders we are talking about an extra a order an extra cents do you think this site built itself do you think it runs itself do you have any idea the risk the people operating this site are taking do you have any clue what we've been through to get here today whether you like it or not i am the captain of this ship you are here voluntarily and if you don't like the rules of the game or you don't trust your captain you can get off the boat from seller to adminby july of der yeghiayan had managed to take over the account of someone who was not only a silk road seller but one of several staffers adopting the identity of cirrus der yeghiayan earned bitcoins a week about at the time to moderate forum posts after several weeks he got a raise to bitcoins weekly he kept getting the salary until the site was shut down in october cirrus has always been dedicated to our community at large dread pirate roberts explained in a private message sent to a small group of cirrus and other administrators the message was sent shortly before hsi took over the account it wasn't clear from testimony today how der yeghiayan was able to take the identity of the trusted cirrus presumably it was the account of an arrested user or one who otherwise made a deal with authorities cirrus was part of a group of forum moderators along with three other trusted users inigo libertas and who also went by ssbd i had admin rights der yeghiayan explained to the jury i could search through the database of users and i could edit delete and move posts on the forums there were other things he couldn't do the distribution of such powers on the site was by dpr and dpr alone in late august dpr charged cirrus with moderating a new part of the marketplace's discussion boards you're going to be our quality control expert on this dpr told him in a chat message so we're going to be pretty strict about what gets through der yeghiayan wrote back in his undercover persona cirrus so basically the discussions have to be connected to products not just bitching yes wrote dpr users in the special forum should be calm polite etc this wasn't the general forum area of silk road but a different one hosted on the marketplace that only certain users had access to the forums are the backyard party explained dpr this is the storefront from admin to arrestder yeghiayan didn't know who dread pirate roberts was and even after his extensive testimony it still isn't clear how he found out on the stand today he said that an irs investigator told him ulbricht was the suspect ulbricht was easy enough to locate by late september der yeghiayan was on his way to san francisco ulbricht's adopted hometown around noon on october he met up with a team of federal agents in the glen park neighborhood they gathered at a cafe where ulbricht had been recently they wanted to see if he would return while agents physically monitored ulbricht and his home der yeghiayan kept his laptop open on the silk road's staff chat channel he had been watching dpr on the staff chat and saw that he logged off around pm local time at that same time i was notified that ulbricht had left his home and was headed in the direction of the cafe said der yeghiayan ulbricht walked into the bello cafe looked around and walked out perhaps seeing how crowded it was the glen park branch of the sf public library was just next door ulbricht went inside at pm der yeghiayan saw dpr log on it would be ulbricht's last online chat for some time cirrus hi cirrus are you there dread hey cirrus how are you doing dread i'm ok you cirrus good can you check out on one of the flagged messages for me dread sure dread let me log in cirrus ok dread you did bitcoin exchange before you started working for me right cirrus yes but just for a little bit dread not any more than that cirrus no i stopped because of reporting requirements dread damn regulators eh dread ok which post cirrus lol yep cirrus there was the one with the atlantisit was a trap when dpr typed ok which post der yeghiayan knew it meant he was looking at a particular admin screen listing flagged posts at that point der yeghiayan gave the signal via email keeping his laptop open der yeghiayan told jurors how he walked from the cafe to the library testimony on wednesday didn't go farther than that it was nearly pm and time to release the jury but those following the story know how this ends of course ulbricht was arrested computer opened to exactly the page the undercover agent had told him to go to the real cliffhanger isn't what happened in that library but what happens tomorrow that's when ulbricht's lawyer joshua dratel will cross examine der yeghiayan and begin to tell the story he promised yesterday the story of how ulbricht wasn't the dread pirate roberts but was somehow lured back to be a fall guy by the real head honcho of the site while we don't know the details yet it sounds like a wild story it's also ulbricht's last chance to stay free.

love is all around us on april pmwhat s the deal with agora was in the middle of a transaction and had the site stop responding according to the subreddit they are moving server locations apparently they do this a lot possibly for security reasons.
never had a problem with helix either works great in my experience where can i find these reports of helix not releasing coins i'd like to know the details.
i can t figure out the pgp or gpg stuff at all i ve set up an email account on vfemail net which lets me set up a pgp key and email people using the encryption but how to i send an encripted message on a vendors site who is asking for a gpg secured message or for that matter decode one that i got from that vendor in their message box on their site i m losing my mind here trying to figure this out can someone direct me to a plain english tutorial on how to set this up so i can communicate with vendors please.
this is why i would never trust a dnm with something important that would affect my real life like irl dealers who borrow money for their supply and then a dnm goes down and it s all fuck i m dead i owe money to some bad people or heroin addicts on some where s my deposit and going through withdrawal like this is technology guys ever use it if so you know it breaks when you need it most don t put in more money than you can afford to lose and don t rely on it for important things.
blond wig blender seems legit for now.
clagget on june pmif you google pgp encryption site the first listing is igolder a gold trading site with pgp help then software wike etc my first question is if you use a clearnet site like that one that does the encrypt decrypt can all you type in become open to prying eyes i know that sounds naive but i really don t know no one should be caught dead using a site like igolder i wouldn t use it even in an emergency  clagget on june pmsecond how important is key size you should be using a bit rsa primary key with a bit encryption subkey i wouldn t use anything smaller  clagget on june pmand a bonus third question say i m browsing my favorite vendors for fun and then go to search a word on google is mixing tor with clearnet a security problem i wouldn t do that either if you get distracted and use the clearnet browser for something that should be private spitfir.
thanks for adding hansa death to centralized markets.
actually now that i just went through the process again to make sure make sure when you re exporting your new private key name asc to your usb desktop that you pick the option on the bottom right as armored pgp keys and once again this is only for tails i ve no idea otherwis.

no i haven't i will see if that works thank yo.
that's why a setup that leaves as little forensic evidence as possible is needed tails on a dvd is an option to consider you keep your computer clean add your private key to en encrypted usb partition that you can wipe easily in case you feel like it without having to wipe your hdd good luck and consider that a truster vendor could get caught and keep vending being le this did happen with fake ids this could and probably did also happen with drugs you don't seem like an high profile target though have a clean house and sleep well.
due to the recent news about ag i figured i would do a little bit of research to see where everyone is moving total listings drug listings vendor fee agora btc we love avengers btc nucleus btc abraxas btc middle earth btc oxygen free dream btc dhl amazon btc silkkitien btc east india company btc mr nice guy btc outlaw btc dnm listing count as of all the sites have open registration except abraxas if you need an invite there is one in my signature.
schuldig on may pmit is pre installed with vidalia and a torified browser called iceweasel it should automatically open up when connected to the internet if not use the iceweasel browser menu shortcut to get onto the road iceweasel opened up automatically for me up to tails version but i ve had to use the shortcut in the last two versions and.
although if you log into a public wifi your mac address would be recorded on that network so maybe the best case scenario would be to utilize the unprotected browser in tails.
thanks to everyone for welcoming us we don't check in on this place enough and will be looking to change this regards sant.

about to submit an application i hope abraxas is just down for service i had a good amount tied into escrow on that market.
yeah nothing happens weird indeed thanks anyhow.
done thanks for the heads up.
seems like alphabay nucleus and abraxas are the best alternate markets right now i do like the look of haven but only time will tell if they are reliable or not on a side note agora is working well right now maybe they got their problems worked out.
very interesting take on a dnm market nice.
alphabaymarket on november pmwe are pleased to announce that alphabay market now supports multisig transactions this was requested a long time ago by the community so we decided to step up our game a bit and go for this option we are now the only marketplace on the deepweb having all of the following security measures source deepdotweb s marketplace list multisig transactions fa withdrawal pin vendor bond forced vendor pgpfor the less tech inclined here s how a multisig transaction works both the buyer and the seller must have set their public multisig key in their profile the buyer deposits of the item value in his alphabay wallet to cover market fees the buyer purchases the item then a multisig blond wig address is generated using the buyer s key seller s key and a market generated public key both parties can use this publicly viewable information to verify the authenticity of the address the buyer sends money to this address and the seller ships the goods if the buyer is happy he finalizes and the seller received the market private key in case of dispute or refund the buyer receives the private key whoever got the private key will use it along with his own private key to claim the coins to make it simple buy the product and you get a btc address to send the coins to seller gets the private key when you finalize you get the key if you dispute and win this is a fool proof method to avoid exit scams you never give your private keys to anyone we don t provide help in cashing out the multisig address you have private keys out of so you are supposed to know the rest if you lose your private key it s too bad enjoysignup good look i have a renewed faith in alphabay now.
will you be shipping worldwide.
thanks for the encouraging words i am definitely a very low target as in the single dose was my third order ever a strip was my largest and i cannot imagine le communicating across borders and wasting thousands of dollars on me especially since they know it is impossible for me to give them any info that they do not already have also apparently only people from my country have ever been caught using dnms most of them vendors who were sloppy irl this has been a good learning experience though again thanks for the encouragement i am very grateful for having found this community.
thanks for this looks like that helix link isn't working or maybe they're down right now.
it's v its got it lazy on my part language is a reflection of culture and culture changes over time to use outmoded language is improper in my opinion we don't use words such as thereupon anymore because they are superfluous figures of speech thereupon has no necessary meaning and really no meaning at all it is just word filler it's an old fashioned fancy equivalent of like a linguistic anacronism similarly the use of double negatives just obscures your true meaning and while they are english words they do no convey a clear meaning as the english language should historically this use of language served as a separation between economic and racial classes while i will admit there is still such a thing as class in modern society i am happy to say that language is not a barrier between them.
there are two main trusted tumblers and a third which was just released that i will post here along with some information about each i will also post an extra free method that you can use on top of tumbling first bitblender this service has been around for quite some time and is one of the trusted tumblers bitblender works with a shared coin system one huge wallet sending many small payments while the others seem more sophisticated many wallets bigger than your deposit that will send amounts to the addresses you gave in both cases it should work as far as blockchain analysis goes thanks wilderness bitblender also has a high volume bonus program where if you send btc within days your fee goes down by they also have a referral program where once combined deposits from a user and his her referred users reaches btc in days the referring user will be credited of all deposits fee randomized bitblender my ref link ref helix by grams grams started in april of as a simple search engine for products on the markets after a few months they started helix and have since created many useful services such as torads infodesk and gramsflow helix has a regular version which requires a grams account and a light version which does not the full version of helix has more fine tuned controls like delays and sending the clean coins in more than one transaction in the light version you send your coins to the address it gives you and as soon as it gets confirmations it sends the cleaned coins in one transaction to your specified address in the light version it can take up to hours but most transactions are completed within minutes fee minimum withdrawal amount btcmaximum withdrawal amount btchelix account cost not needed for helix light btchelix pay shield by sigaint sigaint has been one of the trusted darknet email service providers for about a year now and has just announced their new tumbler on june i have not had a chance to try it yet but it claims to complete the tumble in minutes what s unique about pay shield is that it has a pay someone with mixed coins feature from their website pay someone with mixed coins is primarily used to pay someone else with maximum privacy simply input the payees blond wig address and the amount they expect and pay shield will generate a mix for you and calculate how much you need to send to make the mix work out to that amount fee randomized pay shield on to the free method this is not recommended as a stand alone method there are many websites that store a large amount of bitcoins stores casinos exchanges etc i personally use casino websites send in your btc play a few rounds penny slots or you ll regret it and send it to your final destination you can also send to your preferred website of choice first before sending it to your tumbler with exchanges it s best to find one where you can send your btc and convert to ltc or another currency then back to btc please beware of phishing links i highly recommend using dnstats com or deepdotweb to confirm you are always using the correct address these sites have been providing darknet market info for years and can be trusted i have verified all these links but please feel free to do so yourself.
it's a good place stick around.
seems like we love avengers nucleus and abraxas are the best alternate markets right now i do like the look of haven but only time will tell if they are reliable or not on a side note agora is working well right now maybe they got their problems worked out.
thanks great article i have been impressed with the knowledge on the dhl forums and of course with the dhl marketplace in general i can see why so many tmg vendors are on dhl also let s hope consumers migrate toward dhl and other markets with multisig and i p options that also strive to stay current and relevant with their opsec and sop.
well if you plan on using a market like we love avengers then this might be feasible also i don't quite get this multisig thing does one have to create a new wallet for each newtransaction with a different vendor can one use the same wallet for future trans with a particular vendor doseheavy.
i sent in my vendor bond waiver s.
alphabaymarket on november pmnot saying abraxas is over but we are confident you will find alphabay to fit your needs try it out here registration to alphabaywe have messaged the alphabay team about waiving vendor registration a few times to no avail we get no response from the alphabay team until then we re available on dream and here for direct dealing cheers s.
general security precautions when posting online learn from others mistakesnext i want to talk about good practices when using tor tails and other hidden services first of all it is highly recommended that you use multiple identities online for different things perhaps if you are a buyer and a seller on silk road you may want to have separate logins for this and then possibly a third login for the forums then maybe you want to be part of another marketplace then you might want a fourth login well tails has another good program offered by tails is called keepassx when you have multiple logins it is hard to keep track of them all so it might be a better idea to keep them all in document that is encrypted with a strong password keepassx can help you with this you never want to use nicknames or locations or anything else that is related to yourself online when you post or create usernames and another thing you need to adopt are new ways of conducting yourself if you are generally a messy typer who makes the same grammar mistakes or the same spelling mistakes all the time this can be used to identify you always proof read anything you post publicly or privately because the feds will always find ways to correlate things to you with ross ulbricht they found an old post he posted on a forum when he first started silk road asking people if they had heard of a marketplace called silk road obviously this is an old trick used by people trying to spread awareness about a new project of theirs later he identified himself by saying he was looking for programmers and gave out his private email address on the same forum under the same name but if you always misspell the same words if you always use the same slang terms capitalize the same words use a certain amount of periods after an etc or always use the same number of then all of these things give them reasonable suspicion and it becomes easier to tie things to you once they have you under their radar like they had ross it only took a few slip ups and he was theirs remember you only have to make one mistake so talking about your local election is a really dumb idea get it think about the time you use your computer is it easy to correlate your timezone based on the time you go online or is it more random do you have patterns that are predictable always think about these things when you post online always think about what type of personality you are putting out there about your online name expect that every single word you type online is being read by the feds to them this is much easier than tracking drug lords on the streets they sit in an office and read forum posts and try and make connections don t underestimate the feds always treat everything as compromised always treat everybody as compromised and don t ever think anybody will ever go to jail for you if somebody can avoid years by ratting you out they will do it in a heart beat the perfect example is sabu from lulzsec after he was busted and facing years in jail they made him a deal to help them rat out his friends and he ended up getting many of his friends arrested even people who are your friends will turn their backs on you when it comes down to their freedom.

i'm in the process of doing something on alpha bay seems fine using same vendor as on other sites logs in regularly their search interface is kinda weird fucked but i'm not going back to nucleus for a while they fucked up bad when that hack happened alpha bay is my backup market because i'm still wary of agora its fine but too big for me i just made an account on dhl very impressed although it's mostly foreign bulk oh well update we love avengers does seem legit i think it is run by russians there and are many russian speaking people on the site and we love russians keep snowden safe also don't try ordering from a mobile tablet because the order button doesn't work on firefox only on tbb it will just refresh and bug the crap out of you otherwise it is pretty good alerts tell you from the home screen when your order processes ships etc.
the most stable and most used sites currently are abraxas and alphabay however there are plenty of other markets operating as of now this is a list of all the markets i could find if you do not see one listed please post below so i can add it abraxas invite referral link required to join uptime market link invite referral link required to join uptime market link uptime crypto market uptime dream market referral link required to join uptime market link india company uptime french dark net uptime gotmilk pharmacy uptime hansa referral link required to join uptime market link uptime idc uptime london underground uptime middle earth marketplace uptime nucleus market uptime outlaw market uptime ramp uptime rutor uptime silkkitien uptime the hub uptime the majestic garden uptime tochka uptime torepublic market uptime.
this stuff had to be here it s not perfect but probably the best introduction on the subject available on the internet as always don t trust blindly what you read but do your own research and act accordingly originally coming from the hub written by jolly roger i m just copy and pasting it this hasn t been updated since but it s still pretty accurate i d advice against opening youtube videos and externally downloaded videos or documents linked in this article on the same computer as you are using tor better download what you really want to see on an encrypted usb stick and use an off line machine to watch it or disconnect your computer from the internet and use a live cd you can trust to view your documents while off line reboot while you are done it would be better to disable javascript to visit anything linked in this thread click on the green onion privacy and security settings set it to high type about config in the address bar search for javascript enabled set it to false if using tails you ll have to do that again each time you reboot better be safe than sorry happy reading thread table of to secure communication tor ssl pgp tails virtual box continued disk encryption and file shredding and removing personal metadata from files security precautions when posting online learn from others mistakes data a lawyer how to handle getting caught or interrogated tor with a vpn tor with a vpn continued cookies from others mistakes libertas dpr sabu lulzsec far will law enforcement go private messages from others mistakes how they busted sabu from others mistakes sabu became fbi informant and betrayed jeremy hammond you might consider running to if you had no other choice your account from fbi monitoring mindset federal government bullying tactics to connect to tor over top of tor to verify your downloaded files are authentic signed messages with signatures and signing your own messages example of really bad opsec smarten up chat sending and receiving bitcoins anonymously vs hidden services why you should be careful are watching you viruses malware you with an antenna javascript revisited plus flash cookies and other browser tracking few simple boot attacks unencrypted ram extraction strengh of cryptography and anonymity when used properly email addresses scam email beware introduction to an expert on opsec plus md sha checksums is obvious when you are using tor you using safe mail net part police are watching it part thieves scammers and counterfeit bills part more scam stories part sellers busted for money laundering tor from your isp part bridges and pluggable transports of the nsa you should always back up your drives especially encrypted drives clients in tails blockchain and electrum another example of how strong cryptopgraphy and proper opsec can protect even pedophiles identifying tails users and can you be forced to give up your passwords roger gave a btc address on the topic for those who want to donate to him i didn t copy it here as i m not sure he can still access his wallet if you want to donate to him you ll find this address on the original thread linked on top of this post.

theocean on april pmisnt there a country where people can host a hidden server without any concerns about usa or europe making a demand to force the host to give away the servers files mutual legal assistance treaty i mean there are almost countries all around the world isnt anyone safe maybe north korea any country in middle east any i hate usa and europe and will never comply to their requirements country ive been thinking about that there is a tiny chance hidden servers have their real ip discovered as happened with silk road so why not to put the servers based in a country that s gonna say fuck you rest of the world this is my country people here do whatever they want in internet or at least they say fuck you rest of the world we only deal with internet crimes that affects our country directly and none of those vendors or site admins live here or fuck you rest of the world we wont comply any bullshit from usa or europe at all where the heck is a safe place to host a hidden server im just curious and asking myself that if there is a country like that this were another mistake from the silk road s admin good luck finding one here is a current list treatiesmutual legal

i have used helix a handful of times and never had any problems at all however after just checking their link a few minutes ago i saw that it is indeed down i'm not sure how long it has been or will be but from my previous experience with them they always got the job done adn within a reasonable timeframe.
i have noticed that a great number of you appear to be using safe mail net as your email provider of choice i would strongly urge you to re consider on january forbes contributer runa a sandvik published an article entitled the email service the dark web is actually using you can read this article at i reached out to safe mail for comment amiram ofir safe mail s president and ceo responded in an email that the company and its employees certainly are not aware of any criminal activity adding that the company does follow court orders that are issued in israel by an israeli court any other law enforcement agency should contact the israeli authorities it s worth noting however that israel signed a mutual legal assistance treaty mlat with the u s in an mlat request was used to image the silk road web server according to the criminal complaint of sept ofir told me that communications between users and the web service are ssl protected and that information stored on the server is encrypted with user specific keys when asked if safe mail has received court orders issued by an israeli court on behalf of a non israeli law enforcement agency such as the fbi ofir replied with a short yes my followup email asking if safe mail has the ability to decrypt information without a user s key went unanswered you can bet your life that if safe mail's owners operators didn't know about any criminal activity before being contacted by forbes they sure as hell know about it now they may or may not have known about the huge number of people from silk road and other dnms using their service but the forbes article if nothing else will have forced them to take action lest they be considered complict if they do nothing to curb such activity it would not surprise me in the slightest to learn that emails are now scanned for certain keywords certain patterns of usage may now be flagged as well on agora there is one vendor who claims his safe mail account was disabled or shut down meaning he can no longer access it my tests have shown this account is still active meaning that messages sent to this account are likely being collected by the authorities for vendors especially please remember that even if you use pgp the header information is not encrypted or protected the authorities even if they cannot read your messages nevertheless know who wrote to you and when spitfir.

that they are really private so treat this as information not an endorsement.
low randomized fees when you deposit coins into your bitcoin blender account we will take a low randomized fee of between we make our fees low to keep coin mixing affordable and we randomize the fee to make analysis of our service less predictable in other words if our fee was a standard blockchain analysis would be made more trivial interested parties would need only look for suspected deposits and withdrawals tagged with a modifier our randomized fee takes this tool away from those who would seek to tie your transactions to you.
molelor on june pmi wanted to sign up with lelantros but i have yet to figure out bitcoins so wide email range out there all have captcha problems from where im standing eventually i settled for squirrelmail from and sends to lelantos org maskedmail com mail tor com sigaint organd ruggedinbox coms bysmmsnraf eut onioni saw one review that said its character password limit was a weakness but i didnt have any problem using a longer one is tor box safe i think that i was the one that brought up the character password issue originally you re right they ve now fixed that issue it s no longer a concern spitfir.
there are too many marketplaces for everyone to keep up with there were also rumors that they were running a tor exit node on the same server as their service not too sure if i believe it but here are a few links after evolution many here have chosen to do direct trades with vendors they trust i think the only marketplace that i can say i have no love for is we love avengers i don't like a site devoted to theft of ones identity i have had multiple family members put into an endless cycle and a hole of debt trying to recover from identity theft other friend with ruined credit that made it hard to find a job and imposable to get a good rate on home purchase because they were taken advantage of in the same manor.

what are the safest options for torcurrently running no scripts java forbidden etc multi layer encryption on a flash disk is this enough.

ppgp is also a good portable cross platform solution its in java so it even runs on osx its very basic and simple good solution for buyers.
i did a grams search and the only nz vendor i saw was thunderjew on nucleus.
vividsky on december pmwow this pgp stuff is complex how do you generate a pgp key what is the easiest wayi found that learning how to encypt messages using pgp was somewhat difficult as well but you will get it if you forge forward persistence is key there are many youtube videos that explain pgp gpg depending on the operating system you are using there will be some for generating a pgp key as well my experience is that it is way hard in the beginning but gets easier the more i use it and become familiar with it just keep being persistent with it and you will get it eventually it may come easier to some than others but you will get it.
alpha bay has been having some issues too they say the ddos attacks have stopped but every time you go to their site the anti ddos filter comes up also the forums on ab have been down for a week or more i use ab but recently have been a little skeptical starting to see signs of another downfall hopefully not though just be weary.
i have a paxful account and a wallet that i have downloaded i buy bitcoins with cash deposits at bofa you dont even need an account at bofa you just need cash and tell the teller you need to make a cash deposit to an account fill out the slip with information provided to you by the seller on paxful and there you go btc within minutes after you deposit.
mtsthelen on march pmwhat about safe bad anyone know anyone correct me if i'm wrong here but from what i understand as long you do these things you should be okay even with a clearnet provider like yahoo or something as long as it allows access through tor it should be fine as long as everything is properly encrypted never log in to your email account over the clearnet tor only encrypt encrypt encrypt and encrypt some more everything remember that subject lines and everything thats not inside the actual pgp message can easily be seen by a rd party nothing sensitive that could compromise your identity make sure you have pgp set up i reccommend tails on a usb and also some obvious things like don't re use any psuedonyms for the email address that you've used before that could link to any other clearnet accounts on forums or anything that could be used to link you from my understanding as long as an email provider allows access over tor and you encrypt your shit up tight then you should be good to go hope this helps a little peace mrs b.

reportedly the prosecution in the sr trial exempted every potential juror who had internetand at the end they had to take a yo it guy a yo woman and people over with no technological background p anyway one of the major reasons not to have charges lead to rediculous sentences is that when facing life in prison only an idiot would accept a life sentence in the us federal system as a plea what ross did was intentionally lose a trial that was unwinnable in hope that his defense will be able to get the verdict possibly thrown out or sentence reduced if you are already fucked might as well go to trial and get it out of the way good luck ros.
thatninja on august pmquote from tm on august ami've seen more clearnet sites that sell trypamines than i have on dnms you can find al ist of vendor shops on reddit all depends on where you live of course i live in good ol' 'murica and i'm just a little sketched out about ordering thru the clearnet especially not that it really matters i guess i'm getting other international packages with hella drugs in them anyway q you really shouldn't worry they are legal chems so nothing in theory should happen but at worst customs will take them call you a bad boy and send you a letter telling you to come claim your substances if you want the.
same issues here as well even blockchain on tor seems to be having problem.
have you seen this from the nucleus forum which is now closed for registration smell a fish why their forum is closed for registration one incident that happened on june nd missmolly had their site hacked keys were stolen and bit coins and then follow up information not another word the forum is closed to new participants to voice their experience so who controls the forum i sent a ticket to support i will let you know the reply anybody.
hey there jw if you got my order on me from friday i pm d you.
astraltraveler on june amokey thanks i see folks writing about that u should use adresses and mixers to make it most unknown do you guys have any advice where i can get an email adress that is safe for the mixer you ll need several bitcoin addresses and no email address but when you need an email address sigaint seems to be a good choice gpg encrypt everything though i d recommend using tails on a second hand laptop you buy for cheap locally and you remove hdd you can start using it on your own computer also it would be better than using only the tor browser bundle it comes with electrum that goes through tor create a new wallet and note your seed few random words somewhere secret where you ll be able to find again in the future on next boots you ll be able to get back to your wallet again using this seed in electrum you ll see there are addresses where you can receive founds give to of them each time you want to send money to the mixer of your choice if you use only one address be it your own tor wallet agora a seller it s pretty easy for anyone looking on the blockchain to see that there is btc in and btc minus fee if you use helix for example out from another address and even if you have plausible deniability you d be better using more than one address to make your mixing stronger if you are to pay to remove your coins taint then better do it right localbitcoins with cash cash in the mail or any thing that won t leave tracks back to you mixer tor wallet is quite good if you need more privacy you could send from mixer to mixer then to btc wallet but it s probably not needed if you re a small time buyer and you use tor to connect to the tumbler.
problem solved me had locked my funds because i withdrew without making any purchases funny that the whole agora deposit problem happened almost simultaneously i was convinced that was the issue.
what about silk road unless there is something bad about it i'm not to sure.
hey everyone as much as it pains me to do so i simple need to switch marketplace while agora gets there shit together i've been using we love avengers and have been quite happy with it especially with there ddos protection and up time that being said i'm wondering if there's anything better out there anyone got any suggestions experiences etc with other markets that have a stable up time any info is much appreciated thanks.
dude don t make these kinds of claims and allegations unless you ve done your research and can back your claims up with solid facts if you re going to be that paranoid don t use agora i m taking a break from agora for personal reasons for a little while myself.
reasons for not using abraxas in that scenario when using albion's shop you only need to trust him whereas when using abraxas the admins could run away with your funds in escrow or even if you finalize early they could run away with the funds in albion's wallet before he has time to withdraw them and imo albion is trustworthy plus i think you don't need to create an account to use his shop a working pgp gpg identity is all you need if it works like gammagoblin's shop finally there are no fees if a trade is made directly with albion on his shop i think abraxas takes a commission on every transaction.
hey all just wondering what market had the lead atm with the most amount of listing and users cheers dolmi.

deepdotweb list is updated fairly regularly as new markets are added or old markets are taken down understanding bitcoinwhat is bitcoin the wikipedia page is here btc is a decentralized digital currency it isn't anchored to gold or any other asset meaning its value when exchanged for fiat currencies can fluctuate quite wildly whenever you make a bitcoin transaction it is recorded on a public ledger called the block chain this means anybody can see any transaction made see the tough part the part that makes bitcoin the currency of choice for anonymous purchases is linking transactions to people to reduce the chances of transaction being traced back to yourself you can 'tumble' your bitcoins tumbling your bitcoins is a way of swapping your original btc for other people's btc in order to sever your block chain trail this makes it more difficult for people to link your purchases to you it is important to tumble your coins through either a tor hidden service or using a wallet routed through tor choosing a vendorthe following links list various vendors on the darknet el presidente's vendor directory gram's infodesk vendors directory you buy from a vendor do your research and make sure you read reviews and discussions on dnm forums the hub has a vendor area you can look at to gather this kind of information you should also learn what it means to finalize early fe markets offering only this type of payment will not get you your money back if the vendor does not send your product understand the risks and only fe with a vendor you trust if you are unsure you should find a market offering an escrow service if you have a dispute with a vendor it helps to be polite and try to work towards a resolution that is fair to the both of you before raising a complaint to the market staff and stick to the facts at all times lies get uncovered more often than not and they aren't fair we're a community digital securitydeep dive information is a lot to do to ensure anonymity

use these sites to see if you are really anonymous while your vpn is up running ip leaks testing resources dnsleak leak ip leak is one of the most important things for you to learn as it allows you to keep your communications between only yourself and the person you are talking to take the time to learn pgp even if you do nothing else windows to learn the difference between your public key and your

tor all the time and many times these updates are designed to combat any faults found version of tbb is this version has an option when you select the onion and the dropdown appears there's now a

you can buy test kits at are on ebay as well do it and be safe remember that buying a test kit is not a crime don't stop yourself buying a test kit because you're worried what it might say about you as a person it's always smart to keep yourself safe physically emailalways use encryption for personal safety i'm not a fan of email however i realize it's a necessary tool at times use tor at all times when accessing them and make sure all sensitive conversations are properly encrypted lastly no one is sure that these e mail providers won t comply with law enforcement or that they are really private so treat this as information not an endorsement.
just withdrew no problems here.
sorry if this is a noob question but is it safe to access electrum org through tor i have coin poss linked to my identity that i want to tumble around but would like to avoid fog if possible just because it seems sketchy to me however if there is no other safe option i will use fog any way i could send them from a wallet currently linked to my id to another wallet created and only accessed through tor and repeat this times with throwaway wallets then to my vendor of choice hehe idk any advice is truly appreciated peace mrs b.

the biggest most active market atm is abraxas you need a referral invite to join so you can use mine here if you need one link.
just an update alphabay is now the biggest market with abraxas being down for the time being vendor buyer registration would highly recommend using dream though as they are the longest running and most reliable dnm to datedream registration link.
if you connect to tor through your isp you d better consider that you might be monitored and or on a list of suspicious individuals it might not be the case but chances are pretty high for that to be the case open wireless network are another option to protect a bit yourself as a vpn might not be as trust worthy as you believe it is good luck stay saf.
not down no just kinda slow at points.
it is great to see you here sn.

you mean vj yes he is able to pentest and plays both sides of the law he hacks to get the ip for the alphabet soup and also hacks and extorts markets right under their nose at the same time we all know the same parson is behind the markets with different names that pop up get big and tap out honorably that person can t handle vj trd was the only one who shut him down he was helping the other markets become more secure too.
sure it s safe but won t had much more privacy as most vpn providers keep log even if they say they don t always assume they do it would hide to your isp the fact that you are using tor best way to do it would probably be to use a router running dd wrt or openwrt that would connect to the vpn and force all traffic to go through the vpn see cleanet for how to and then tails whonix or your own custom solution on a dedicated computer vpn on your main system tbb would work too of course.
saw that no explanation as yet but agora had closed lips in downtime and it never did them any harm only strengthening their reputation think the yanks are still sleeping but i m sure the reddit kids will get their popcorn out in the next hour.
begin pgp signed message hash sha in the pgp program you are using there should be an option under one of the tabs to back up keys use that option to save a text file of both your public and private keys as far as i know you cannot change the email address on a key you will have to generate a new one during the creation of that key the program should ask you if you would like to email a backup of you keys i recommend you do once you have the key file i suggest saving it in more than one place since im almost positive it was my thread you were working with ill try and explain this better some of what your confusion is i think is with the terminology the signature in my post refers to the text links at the bottom of this post see the links there are of them vendor page review page and pgp key if you cut and paste those links into your address bar it will take you to those individual pages where ive posted that info this is not to be confused with a pgp signature the pgp signature was generated with my pgp keys on creation it allows me to sign a message other users that have my pgp public key can use that to verify that the message was in fact created by the owner of the public key the message has not been changed or edited from the original content i will sign this message and include my public key from there you can copy and paste the whole message to your decryption clipboard and use the verify function to see that it was indeed me that created this post after you do that try this copy and paste the message to the clip board just as you did previously except this time pick a random word in here and delete it because the content was edited when you verify it you will receive a different message with a standard message if you receive that error message you can now confirm or suspect that either the post was not made by the person claiming to have written it or the original content of the message had been changed which is what happened when i edited my vendor op hopefull this helps some nonya begin pgp public key block sez bmgjthow aqltnjxpxnhq ka ha jl sswr ggcttgtsbqpkex sfi hb mjtnn rel m bvor l h h kv xd vpdeltg put gfr u pv xer ful hzrr jtw iuxwgbmt uaxy t itzvp j wrgcb xnq wq r thz z vtsfandwtiwkrw krjsm ustwj fdwmr qavjpj ddy jdmi m dmznabebaag i vbnlhidxob yuj c iqe bbmbcgahbqjti tnmh rg pvoxbpx jt jdthotr jmblibkhq btodj ryooclwbl xlsc tpbiysdffndc q vuvazvjmza enb werjh kfl pgykl txdl hab jhzr vft x v qarp ocd nbfeqzffj mwhcwenyuf gjg y svlrb pzvyju fb ub q cv rgkrvukk oerrym j m vcosyackolp cehrerrsw mdr pn u ja jaounemtyt kees jd ukud aq eu ujkaeiaklyk avmvirf l to o tdcsu avklzfc zyjfywz eig vkot cmjbe dmycoir cmiki nals o fiigy shed dxdfqrpq tvlqu bk ob tes triy jhqjulqx kd xn p xninfwlk zkgby fppkq n zyqe v mvoxbmwvwuby fgkleayt udr nj ybindxkllo v wmg udq yv xu buloy hsysrg rmo u pyke ucpwmi cj ic rrcapbo mfxng f mocc raq gvnte rlynrafvj jm lbh wqjgpubl d rrkfe tp rv n np ngsyixeprpvy yh i rrgntadg mz fblzkg epos zwuqjz bjvs untphjxjry ge pyhhpe ucmqt nfq z h e up sw w eq uhdd vec g yn janno y z ihjt ip rgcc zahzsyiahqj b dlle end pgp public key block begin pgp signature version gnupg v mingw v iajs b nih nhfkexp v ignc mfvs jevilwtql pz goeg fejxt t p vi toluk whfhtavcb iftztzhh nlozb x jpflxlemom b ixgi ttnejfepzbldo qwlacziynvpz beg vj mx yuqknqfwexqv wxg cs b mdrparkgd t un sgt bi zplytaqk dqyiq ic jiqbi jggxhptsi pt hvwxuogv uo ff m wqocrm kqjjvabzfk mphg end pgp signature.

very interesting take on a dnm market nice.
gleeful on january pmstay away i wouldn t even log onto the site it was left with nobody at the helm for several days before it went down then it pops back up with no explanation there is a strong possibility that it has been taken over by le with vendors and buyers of bulk being at the greatest risk agreed looks sketchy as fuck avoi.
thanks for the advice mate no particular reason for the eic i found a few favourable review so i thought i 'd give them a go i'll check out we love avenger.
hi all i want to know your opinion about market for you what is the best i speak about drug market i saw that agora don't work anymore evolution is dead so now how is the best i am on blackbank we love avengers nucleus and abraxas do you think is it a good market or not and about middle earth is it done too or what if you know good market give me link please thanks for your future answeri wish the best at every peoples on majestic garden see you.

skallywaggins on november pmwhat makes you certain it's an exit scam i serioulsy hope not our i just lost a huge amount of money as i'm sure did everyone else including yourself but you seem certain it's officially an exit scam if it looks like a duck and waddles like a duck and quacks like a duck then it is probably a duck i feel your pain to the tune of around but the joke is on me i should never have left that in the wallet lesson learned.
interesting thread i haven't purchased from any market for a while agora is always my main market but it has so many donwtimes atm it is difficult to use i think i will give middle earth an opportunity since some of my favourite vendors are there.

hey guys in the last few weeks have organised a few transactions with saint nic with payment being made directly to a bc address and away from the mainstream marketplaces firstly their communication is always quick and thorough they tend to steer clear of one or two word responses the mdma i recieved was some of the best i have ever got my hands on a lovely brown colour with plenty of rocks mixed throughout and the ainseed smell was almost overpowering i paid nic directly for a g order was disptahced within hours and all envelopes landed shortly after product was tested with mecke simons and marquis testers and tested strongly as expected when all contents were removed from the mylar they had sent a total of g's extra without giving away too much on packaging their stealth was very clever despite being confined to an envelope p s their mdma was acetone washed by acen and these were the results washed by acenvendor saint niclink agreementdate th of january amount of g washed gamount of g after wash gpurity percentage link acetone wash operates in a very professional and curtious manner their products are of a very high quality and their prices are competitve cheerscap.
thanks man i think i'll be pretty good with what i have i just want to be safe.
we're looking into itcurrently available on dream tmgcheers s.
on november pmwhat about silk road unless there is something bad about it i'm not to sure would stay far away from anything with silkroad in the name i would highly recommend dream its the longest running dnm ever dream market referral link required to join uptime.
just sent through bit blender i'll report back with the results let's hope this works seems like everything is going smoothly so far peace mrs b.
the only trouble is most people have a horrible time dealing with mulisignature escrow it's just too hard to understand especially for newbies i ecommend dream market mindful shama.
i always use grams when i m looking to find a particular product but then stick with a vendor once i ve found someone reliable it is a great service and the helix mixer is also nice though the consolidation of dark net services in one place seems a little risky from an opsec perspective requires a fair bit of faith in those in charge their customer service is also great so if you need to edit your pgp information as a vendor and have both keys available for verification i m sure they ll work with you to fix your profile good luc.
lately i've had a good experience with bitblender the laundered coins are available almost immediately so the whole process didn't take more than minutes but you could probably find some other mixers with lower fees as bitblender is definitely not the cheapest.
i would like to know about this vendor too so up.

blockchain info also has a mixing service any reviews of that the helix site seems outdated with links to agora still unremoved is it safe to use.
idk agora is target by the fbi and other le a safe person i guess would stay off the markets entirely and see how things play out i just think it's kind of strange that none of the other markets are going down right now as well if its a tor problem then none of them are safe i saw someone post some link about some vulnerability that was found about a month ago this is definitely horrible news idk if we will ever see agora up and running again i haven't received my withdraw yet nor has the majority of people now the site is down for those brave enough to go to another market i would love used each one of those before during agora downtime with success why can't things just run smoothly i only got into these darknetmarkets about months ago and it's been nothing but chaos and bad news i guess that comes with the terroitory i'll be pressing on myself direct deals only though for now.

this really is helpful cc heavy thanking light and love.
organix on march pmthey don't really have fa though many have requested it they have optional pgp login but you can't set it up so that no one can login without both password and pgp so its kind of weak i have to enter both my password and then a decrypted code.
i opened an account there the day before and made an order from you mr pickles yesterday batches of lsd i agree with what's been said about the dhl no bullshit vendors all seems pretty reputable and more importantely as very passionate about the quality of their products very secureeasy transactions the only downside which i think will pick up slowly is a lack of variety i couldn't find any dmt so i have to look for it somewhere else and i don't like having too many accounts around i hope dhl starts getting more reputable vendors i look forward to it being my stop shop s.
good idea to link this here hopefully someone will get some use out of it.
i'd like to congratulate saint nic on getting verified he is now a star vendor in the eyes of the avengers buy from santa with confidence bowi.
thanks i'm back on.
how far will law enforcement go today we are going to talk about the lengths that law enforcement le will go to try and catch you slipping the thread that inspired this post was the following sr thread the first question is can le ship drugs to buyers to try and set them up for drug charges let us just say that they have done it to a silk road user before who went by the name of flush aka chronicpain aka curtis green april a dea undercover agent in maryland posing as a drug smuggler began communicating with dread pirate roberts on silk road about selling a large amount of illegal drugs dread pirate roberts instructed curtis green to help the smuggler find a drug dealer who could buy a large amount of drugs court papers say green found a buyer and agreed to act as the middleman for a sale of a kilogram of butt plugs green gave the dea agent his address an undercover u s postal service inspector delivered the butt plugs to green's house in utah on jan so as you can see whether you view it as entrapment or not once they have evidence against you they will eventually figure out a way to get something on you and bust you for it like they did to curtis green the secret service posed as a vendor for fake ids online for years and actually shipped fake ids that they made to buyers on an online russian forum us government's operation open market resulted in indictments against defendants according to wired special agent mike adams shipped out more than fake ids over about five years of activity while going by the username celtic amazingly the entire scheme started when the government arrested the real celtic a nevada man who got caught shopping at a whole foods where he'd previously used a fake credit card law enforcement discovered counterfeiting equipment among his possessions and learned about his online activities adams assumed his online identity and even improved celtic's cred shipping near flawless ids and becoming a trusted seller on carder ru as you can see in this article the secret service again sold illegal items to people online in order to bust them several of the buyers used their real addresses and sent real photos of themselves to this officer to have their ids made resulting in being arrested by the feds and in this particular case the feds charged all the defendants under something called the rico act  main indictment is noteworthy because in addition to the usual mix of credit card fraud and false identification charges the defendants have been charged under the mob busting rico act a first for a cybercrime prosecution enacted in to help the fbi crack down on the mafia the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act lets the feds hold every member of a criminal organization individually responsible for the actions of the group as a whole the losses collectively inflicted by the carder su members are easily enough to give every rico defendant years in prison when you commit crimes online especially in an online community the feds may be able to hold you accountable for the actions of other users on that same community so make sure when you do your freedom fighting or whatever you choose to do that you take this into considering always weigh out the worst case scenario should you get busted because the le will try and set you up one last example of how le will try and set you up but not relating to online communities is when they put together a fake sweepstakes in los angeles deputies in la mirada attempted a rope a dope on some alleged criminals by offering them a fake sweepstakes prize out of the letters sent to these people of interest only eight showed up at the la mirada holiday inn to collect their prize according to the whittier daily news posing as the pelican marketing group deputies sent letters last week to people throughout the county wanted in connection with crimes ranging from misdemeanor warrants to murder according to the report the suspects were advised to bring their letter and identification to the holiday inn and told that they were guaranteed a prize worth at least and would be one of people with a chance to win a bmw i sedan they were all smiles when they showed up to collect their prizes deputy janet ramirez told the newspaper once they tell them they're under arrest the smile fades quickly she said so the reason i made this post was for those of you who think that le will not go to certain lengths to try and set you up for charges they will do it if they want you bad enough and if you fall for it they might get you on some tough charges curtis green is facing up to years for the sting operation by the dea on him and the users who purchased fake ids on the russian forum could face up to years each since they can be charged under the rico act always keep these things in mind when conducting activities online and always take the worst case scenario into account it only takes one mistake to get caught and the government has unlimited resources and super computers to try and catch you slipping you may only have a few laptops desktops servers but nothing compared to the what they have be careful everyone.
great info thanks to you and the original writer.
i hope this isn't a silly question but is there an alternate url for ag i know a few other markets have given out alternate addresses since initially going down this last time i've only been able to log onto ag once since then and am not sure if i overlooked it or what.

start a new account and contact them on that one tell them your username and that you forgot your password usually if you know what btc address you have withdrew with they will resest it good luck.
operating systems can and should be openly discussed but openly admiting to using one is a violation of opsec keep your private information private end users tend to use windows with and other big fish tend to use tails becuase its a neat package of almost everything needed for the darknet but please note that the previous version to tails has security leaks that have since been patched only download tails iso through tor for the nsa attempts to track every download of that os for obvious reasons a lunix distro with a hardened kernel gentoo is more work but being in a completely different pond from one their attempting to fish at has its advantages tor bridges also have their uses all opsec disecions should be throughly researched before being made dont tell me this darknet aint got no hetty info you just got to poke around.
slarky on may amthank you i was having the same problem too taking a first look in security i wasn't able to find a secure tor based e mail provider any help is appreciated sigaint everything though never trust the server not to be compromised.
updated due to new spam policy's.
a new install with full disk encryption ubuntu can work for this then fill the drive with trash or start a live cd linux distro and wipe your hard drive using the wipe command or shredthen reinstall a fresh clean windows system or a fresh linux one with full disk encryption probably safer another option would be to physically destroy the hard drive and use your computer only with tails you d have to trust those who made tails but even if tails was trying to write stuff on your hdd you d be safe from that.
you can sign with electrum.

is it only me that has problems with sigaint cutting up my mail text to extreme degrees sometimes my sent mail will be only one half sentence from a whole body of text from the mail i composed seems very strange and i bet theres a ridiculously easy explanation but i can't seem to find it right now im using attached text files for communication which feels a bit weird shouldn't be necessary for a mail service heh i'll give vfe a try though.
bitcoin blender seems legit for now.
got any more info on this where to look edit okay so it's on r we love avengers seems legit also seems like not much of a risk not knowing too much about how something like this was obtained i wonder if this is in fact a sign of some dangerous insecurity or not i mean is there some way a script kid could get this and nothing else this list is now being used to spam messages to all dhl users claiming to be site administrators who need donations to fight the attack lol ri.

usps blocks tor exit nodes however you can use another end to end ssl encrypted usps proxy such as packagetrackr com i agree with snacktime though spoof your mac and check it at an internet cafe.

the best way to thwart an external observer and potential global passive adversary such as the combined intelligence agencies of the five eyes countries and assuming you live in one of the five eyes countries would be to vpn to some place like russia and run cover traffic like bittorrent the server you connect to should not be owned or operated by a company headquartered in the five eyes countries or have any employees with citizenship in the five eyes countries you should also set a max bandwidth for your vpn connection so that clicks in the tor browser can't be trivially identified as bursts above the bittorrent bandwidth from there you should set entrynodes inside the same country as your vpn server.
ooh ooh i have relevant information so far as i am aware at the moment there are currently up markets not counting agora in addition to the ones you've listed outlaw market we love avengers drug market and abraxas ive got links to register for all of them on my blog which you can find the link for l l l ldown vthere.
electrum already uses change addresses which makes it harder to be tracked back to your wallet nothing is safe.
check this link should get you all the information you nee.
it's looking as to whether it was a legit hack the person claiming to have hacked it is the person claiming to be a group of people who will target a single market and create as much fud surrounding the market as possible on public forums in hopes that the owner will pay to get their help fixing the vulnerability that's not to say they aren't capable of actually hacking though.
just a heads up ive deposited coins to my account days ago and despite seeing them enter my account via blockchain i have never received my coins i've messaged support multiples times but they have never responded im not the only one with this problem either if you check the agora reddit pages or the bugs section there are plenty of posts about the same thing i have always loved and supported agora and would love to continue to do so but so far no one has heard back from support regarding this issue just be careful with your coins atm i recommend sticking to abraxas or we love avengers until the situation is resolvedi will update this post immediately if i receive my coins or hear back from support.

so far so goodno proble.
on the streets i used an old android phone with no service and only messaged people using internet messaging services twitter kik ect and i wouldn't even talk business on it i'd just ask someone to meet up and we'll talk then.
if you connect to tor through your isp you'd better consider that you might be monitored and or on a list of suspicious individuals it might not be the case but chances are pretty high for that to be the case open wireless network are another option to protect a bit yourself as a vpn might not be as trust worthy as you believe it is good luck stay safe.
play a little bit with the electrum btc wallet u find inside tail.
just an fyi redphone and textsecure both fill this need and are free open source and audited grab an android burner for with these apps and you're good to go.
uncleal on april pmwhat's up with that agora link is that a pishing link or did they just add a second url that's the former url that's no longer being used the new one is onionmore info here agora marketplace changes url due to heartbleed ssl bug love avengers com agora marketplace changes url due heartbleed ssl bug.
is we love avengers down or is it just me i keep getting the the anti ddos filter indicates very high anonymous traffic on the server we are aware that you probably aren't behind this but we need to present you this challenge to get an authorization cookie to view the marketplace this page will not be displayed on every visit but only during possible ddos periods please complete the challenge below to get a browsing authorization messag.
anyone else getting this would really like to withdraw coin for my last three orders anyway for those who ordered from me before i hit vacation mode if blackbank doesn t come up please rest assured your orders are going out today have already gone out all pending orders for middle earth as well unfortunately middle earth doesn t seem to have a vacation mode that vendors can turn on themselves instead they must wait for gandalf please do not order from me on middle earth until june if you read this and i m not in vacation yet it s supposedly getting ddos attacked right now and last i saw gandalf had not waved his vacation wand for me yet i will be checking when the site gets back up and sending anything else asap but please don t order my processing time has been fairly quick up until this point but any orders placed today or later may take a little longer to get out and i d really not receive any and hope that i m in vacation mode next time i m able to load the site i ll resume taking orders in june and lsd will be back on the menu.
don't don't about east indian company but there are other well established markets like we love avengers nucleus m e why only east india company we love avengers is the best market from the current lot.
i don't think i should recommend any specific providers on a public forum but you can search around for vpn providers with servers in russia or eastern europe check the contact information and make sure they are actually headquartered in a country outside of five eyes or even western europe a lot of times you'll find a provider with russian servers but their contact info is in london or nyc you can also rent a vps and set up your own openvpn server i like to chain vpn connections for example from my computer to a vpn server in my country from that server to another country and finally from that server to a russian eastern european server then i set entrynodes where is the same country as the last vpn server from there you can run bittorrent or i p and help that anonymity network in the process or bittorrent over i p this provides cover traffic to make traffic analysis by external observers more difficult this strategy may be useful when visiting clearnet sites or hidden services that are located in five eyes countries or western europe hopefully most hidden services are not located in those geographical areas making traffic analysis much more difficult even if you do nothing on your end.
wow this pgp stuff is complex how do you generate a pgp key what is the easiest wa.
i have a program that works instantly its no key much much smaller but works without any load times btw forgot to say that this is f'ing awesome root.
it will work as technically described but probably not as you or the op on bitcointalk org intend an external attacker is a bigger threat than an internal tor network attacker intel agencies don't have to run entry exit nodes to pwn you since they can tap ixps and gateways between you and your entry guards and between your exit nodes and sites that you visit if the nsa taps the exchange point that connects your isp to the rest of the internet then it doesn't matter which entry guards you exclude and it doesn't matter if they operate an entry guard that your tor client selects they can observe every connection you make to any entry guard that is easier than waiting for you to select their entry guard.

doses lysergic on january amsimilarly the use of double negatives just obscures your true meaning unlike some of your other examples the double negative is far from being an anacronism and is widely used today not just in english but also in chinese french spanish and other major languages of course it can also be misused however i'm talking about english english not american english australian english etc the double negative is used to add greater emphasis to the statement it doesn't alter the logical meaning but it changes the emotional meaning that is it conveys additional information on the writer's strength of feelings about what they have written so for me dxuutx was saying i consider this especially significant but in a low key way which didn't impose his view on the reader in speech it would be possible to lay extra stress on the word significance and thus give the option of avoiding the double negatiive in online prose emboldening or italicising significance could achieve a similar effect but personally i think these should not be used unless necessary because of the possibility of text being copied and pasted into other applications notepad html editors social networking sites other forums etc where the mark up language would not be recognised maybe dxuutx could or should have avoided the double negative but that would be a choice of style not grammar or syntax the english as it stood was correct a search for the phrase not insignificant including the quotes finds somewhere between and results depending on the search engine which indicates that the phrase is in everyday use perhaps it comes down to different forms of english eg what is common and acceptable in england may be or unacceptable in the usa and vice versa it's something of a stereotype that english english abounds with often tinged with irony if jack swigert had been english the phrase would probably have been houston we've had a slight mishap here rather than houston we've had a problem here  doses lysergic on january amhistorically this use of language served as a separation between economic and racial classes no argument to your general polnt very broadly speaking england has been bilingual since the norman invasion of there was the norman french latin spoken by the new aristocracy and clergy and there was the older germanic anglo saxon spoken by the peasants writers such as chaucer and shakespeare helped bridge the gap and the invention of the printing press must have played a part but it wasn't until the late c th that the english caste system finally began to thaw yet even with all the changes of the last years the differences in vocabulary grammar syntax and pronunciation between the top level of the establishment and the average worker are so distinct that it only takes a couple of seconds and half a sentence to know which is which.
on august pmwhat would you say about simply using a mobile pgp program and using text messages have you ever tried to decrypt or encrypt a message on an android device the last time i tried it took me minuets.
alpha bay has been having some issues too they say the ddos attacks have stopped but every time you go to their site the anti ddos filter comes up also the forums on ab have been down for a week or more i use ab but recently have been a little skeptical starting to see signs of another downfall hopefully not though just be weary.

lucidmotif on november amdebian which tails is based on is not compatible with all wifi devices inside computers for example it is not compatible with some of the newer macbook models because it doesn't come with the right drivers you can do some searching to see if debian comes with a driver for the wifi device on your computer model if not it is possible to buy a usb connected wifi dongle compatible with debian it's also possible to install the missing driver to tails in some case but there are negative sides to doing that from what i've heard a great suggestion but if i'm reading queen's post correctly it is that this has worked in the past for her although i could be wron.
thanks katamangood one buy a laptop and use only for dn tails usb encryption disactivate java will be start don't really understand using in v m if is for extra layer of opsec or just to save staffi will never ever let any third part to encrypt for me what do you think about crack wifi and browse dn must be even more safe thank yo.

if u figure this out maybe u let us all know we are all confused that's why we come here on the other hand reading never hurt anybody ohm.
tortrip on june pmthis looks very suspicious perhaps law enforcement are now running the business in order to catch users they may have been before but now that the arrests have happened and everything is out in the open i doubt they still are.
luxaeterna on may pmwent with zalas approach except deposited cash in a bank via a machine so no face to face with bank person and no leaking of id to buyer only thing is banks cameras only problem there i can think of is if buyer is le and wants to know who i am they could use the time stamp on the recpiet i had to take a screnshot of and go to the cameras of that bank around that time however that's a lot of hassle and they would have to try id me by face only put up posters this pay points are similar to atms are machines but i haven't noticed any camera on them even though there might be hidden ones are terminals for self service anything u can think of opened and if paranoia is so big u can go using it with a mask no jok.
abraxas is a solid market i don't think you'll be disappointed and by the way it usually picks up in business when markets as big as agora are down.
astraltraveler on june amokey thanks i see folks writing about that u should use adresses and mixers to make it most unknown do you guys have any advice where i can get an email adress that is safe.
here.
where i live u can buy them straight at pay points type in your wallet address and insert cash and voil pretty simple ain't the same over there lbc has just the best prices and the biggest headaches.
i did try this i typed the text that i want to encrypt and saved the text file to the desktop then i found the file in the file in the desktop folder hilighted it and selected edit then selecting encrypt it then allows me to check the key of the recipient after i do that it creates another file that ends in pgp this seems like it should work just fine but when i open the file it looks like there is heiroglyphic symbols mixed in with normal letters about of each not sure what is going on still.
i'd advise you to learn gnupg how to encrypt create your own bit private key and send receive only encrypted pm and if you don't already do you might want to use tails or another secure alternative to browse the darknet good luck.
you like apples  on february am so let me get this straight i pay for using this market the vendor pays vendor adds to his product and the buyer ends up paying more in the end i like what i have trusted vendor great prices and no hassle but hey to each their own good luck how you like dem apples.
hi wilderness thanks for the reply i didn't include bitblender because they were hacked some time ago and once a website that should have security as its job gets hacked it's hard to trust it again i may add it though since they haven't had any problems for half a year or so i have used bitcoinfog a number of times and never had an issue but it does seem like there are quite a few people that have even on small amounts which doesn't make sense from a scamming point of view.
started looking at it like my second home best online community i had ever came across love ya guys.
usps blocks tor exit nodes however you can use another end to end ssl encrypted usps proxy such as packagetrackr com i agree with snacktime though spoof your mac and check it at an internet cafe.

dockellis on august pmquote from flourpower on august pmi thought so too didnt take too long to figure out it's more like craigslist than ebay still in my limited experience a better forum than the reddit onelike night and day this is a community of like minded seekers hoping to benefit one and other reddit is well reddit is reddit welcome reddit is a honey pot the place where u start losing your first money if this is how u got to dnms or the place where u get misguided in buying exactly what u don't want the place where shill and scamery takes off.
i m in the process of doing something on alpha bay seems fine using same vendor as on other sites logs in regularly their search interface is kinda weird fucked but i m not going back to nucleus for a while they fucked up bad when that hack happened alpha bay is my backup market because i m still wary of agora its fine but too big for me i just made an account on dhl very impressed although it s mostly foreign bulk oh well update alphabay does seem legit i think it is run by russians there and are many russian speaking people on the site and we love russians keep snowden safe also don t try ordering from a mobile tablet because the order button doesn t work on firefox only on tbb it will just refresh and bug the crap out of you otherwise it is pretty good alerts tell you from the home screen when your order processes ships etc.
i have a few invites message me if you need one pickles.

scroat on december pm think it's great was linked from the onions subi thought it was great too until they started serving ads through torads what really got me and caused me to abandon my accounts there is the fact that an ad that i was being served related to an organization in my country of origin that is either a huge coincidence or ip address data is possibly being leaked indicating the country of origin now mind you i've got adblock running and my hosts file is bulging with the addresses of most online advertisers redirected to the loopback address despite this the ads are still showing up the long and the short of it is that i no longer trust this service ymmv spitfir.
if this doesnt work try b ty iuj freeclanforum co.
problem solved me had locked my funds because i withdrew without making any purchases funny that the whole agora deposit problem happened almost simultaneously i was convinced that was the issue.
i think this info was somehow scraped from the forums or front end of the market it doesn't mean anything i found my 'nym in there never bought anything most of those names are market names not linked to any public or private presence the people who 'leaked' this are trying to extort the owners or claim they hacked the market if it's still up i assume it hasn't been hacked afaik dhl is a wallet to wallet service and has no big bag of bitcoins behind it the anti dhl people think dhl is weak they don't know or realize that the site was intended to be hackable that is a hacker would get nothing from the site ingenious really.
the hidden wiki is scams thats why if you want a marketplace list go to dnsstats net or grams grams enufi jmdl onion there s like markets right nowthe main ones are black bank agora nucleus middle earth and tm.
if you can get someone else to open a post office box for you best option a homeless bro or really old person pay them and they forget about it they just need id make sure you are the only one with a key most boxes give you two keys they will need to be re registered annually your next best bet is to open a po box in your real name and later order magazines sign up for things that will send junk mail like call some s from adverts requesting info or forms from different companies you can do this in someone else's name then after a while that name will be associated with your po box by the sorting computers and friendly po employees whom we love and smoke ganja erryday so now you have at least two peoples mail going to one box this is common as people tend to be social and cohabitate you could add a whole brady bunch to the box but that is silly and sorters will get annoyed if they ask you who bob is you can tell them its your buddy from way back crashes on your couch and you are sure that is his name you can even make fake online facebooks and stuff then have bob friend you just do it from a low level surveilence high volume computer or burner phone public wifi new ip etc one problem is that sometimes they ask for id now or the name on the pack usually its just the name if you tell them its yours next step have a good ordering strategy dont just order a fuckton of darknet shit mix it up make it a random act of kindness to yourself maybe once a week maybe once a month maybe days and use different vendors don't order the same thing twice from the same vendor use your head try first class v priority never ever order express mail it requires too much scrutiny lastly know what will fit in your box and what size orders are if you pay more you can get a bigger one so you don't have to use the desk at the po don't use ups store they are sneaky and will fuck you the postal service wants people to open po boxes for ebay and home businesses etc do them a favor another thing is location don't have it be in a shit neighborhood or a really rich one somewhere nice but diverse culturally this will help later good luck.

retaining a lawyer how to handle getting caught or entry into the series on security is how to handle getting caught let us face it we are all human and we make mistakes unfortunately you only need to make one mistake and the law enforcement commonly referred to as le on these forums can bust you maybe they will wait for you to do something more serious before they nab you but if you slip up and they feel you are worth going after you can expect them to get you no matter where you live with rare exception the first thing i want to do is link you to another thread i just came across on these forums main question is should i keep an emergency lawyer fund on hand and how much should it be the response i think was most appropriate for this question was the following  vanillaroyale on january amgive your lawyer k and put him on a retainer don't have a emergency fund 'stash' lying around if that is what you mean you should already have your lawyer paid plus extra in case he needs to post bond for you and they seize the majority of your drug funds once you get arrested by le they can seize your money based on the assumption that it is drug related so you need to have a lawyer paid for ahead of time that way in the unfortunate case that you get a visit from the feds you have a lawyer ready to go the agreed upon amount was around next i want to talk to you about what to do in case you get interrogated by le there is a great thread about this the take homes from this thread are basically keep your moouth shut the feds are going to try all types of tactics on you to get you to admit to guilt of the crimes you are being accused of they will likely use the good cop bad cop on you first they will tell you that they want to help you and that they are after the big guys they just need your help to put away the big guys do not listen to this i have never cooperated with a good cop le and have it end up working in my favor once you admit to being guilty you can kiss your freedom good bye secondly if you refuse to cooperate their attitude will change to bad cop they will say ok fine you do not want to cooperate i tried to help but now you are going to be in a lot of trouble do you have any idea what kind of charges you are facing you are going away for a long time unless you start talking they are going to try and scare you into admitting guilt again keep your mouth shut and continue to ask for a lawyer hopefully the one you put on a retainer prior to this happening never speak without a lawyer present and never do anything you do not have to do legally if you have the right to remain silent then exercise that right i know there are some circumstances in which you do not have that right but unless that is the case you are better off staying quiet third drop the attitude do not argue with the cops about having nothing on you or something for that matter act scared anxious and confused act like you have no idea what is going on and that you are scared for your life tell the cops they are scaring you and you want to see your lawyer because you do not know what this is about they need evidence and solid evidence at that to charge you with a crime they are going to try and correlate posts you made on forums phone numbers you called perhaps a package shipped to your home all forms of communication bank transfers and so forth until they can find a way to link you to the crime you are being accused of but the biggest piece of evidence will always be your willingness to admit your guilt for a lesser sentence when sabu found that he was facing years in federal prison he quickly spilled everything and started working for the feds again talk to your lawyer find out the evidence against you and only answers questions your lawyer advises you to answer and answer them in a way your lawyer advises you to answer them try and be as honest as possible with your lawyer your lawyer can not and will not share any admittance of guilt you have with the prosecutors or le this is called attorney client privilege please note there are a few instances where this does not apply.
thanks buddy so kind of you.
So I friend recently turned me on to bridges and leveled my OPSEC up but I'm still having some issues He gave me bridges he personally uses and said they were all solid However when I put them in and the connectiing to Tor thing comes up it just gets stuck there I don't know if this just takes longer than I expected but I waited a good min and it never connected The progress bar started but stayed frozen in one place Any help would be greatly appreciated.
Stay away I wouldn't even log onto the site It was left with nobody at the helm for several days before it went down Then it pops back up with no explanation There is a strong possibility that it has been taken over by LE with vendors and buyers of bulk being at the greatest risk.
Thank you.
Amazon Dark ok fine jokingAbraxas seems to be the best choice atm.
I want to go to the most active market now that Agora is going inactive Can anyone help.

Quote from cotlakqueque on April pmWhere do I find the market All I can see are the message boards This is a garden full of wise people you can learn from every day The market is over there There There.
hello recently my local supply has dried up and so I have deciced to turn to the internet for all my needs having done a lot of reading I think I have the gist of everything security related and I have been trying to find a place to buy my first bitcoins and I've hit a wall As far as I can tell the most popular places are coinbase or localbitcoins I dont want to do any bank transfers but rather just walk into a bank and make a cash deposit into a specific account or at most just do a paypal transfer with no details but a reference number or something Quite annoyingly localbitcoins seems to require a stupid amount of ID checking Even if i wasnt bothered with handing over ID scans and phone numbers and proof of addess etc that amount of screwing about would still put me off due to all the hasstle So I thought fair enough these are legit exchanges there must be sellers on markets such as nucleus etc that are selling bitcoins apparently not My question is how do you guys get your bitcoins without having to perform the labours of hercules.
The word Categories is misspelled Cartegories on your site The word Precursors is misspelled Precousors The Steroids is misspelled Steriods The word Opioids is misspelled Opiods Just trying to help Hard to look professional with bad spelling at least to the peeled back tweaker.

Quote from vitaminLSD on June amQuote from ssod on June amCurrently i am connecting to the darknet via tails tor bridges i feel as this is not a very safe unless i am wrong Anyone have any advice on additional security measures to protect my real IP I get bulk so safety is a big concern to me let me know if my lack of faith in bridges is invalid though Tails is not secure for serious DNM activities and here's the first reason why USA Feds have already conducted Tor attacks that have landed significant DNM figures behind bars the above article has more details about how the Feds did it and who they have arrested so far a former Silk Road lieutenant for starters Also Tor bridges are practically useless for hiding from the NSA because the NSA harvests the tor bridge addresses from the emails send to from the Tor Project the NSA knows you're using Tor anyways if you're using a Tor bridge Tor bridges were designed for people in repressive third world countries not US citizens hiding from the NSA It also gets worse and this is information that every DNM user serious or small should know about but since the Edward Snowden leaks the NSA has talked about if not bragged that they have timing attacks for de anonymizing Tor users at the NSA In the Washington Post revealed that the NSA had figured out various ways of unmasking and penetrating the anonymity of the Tor Network Since according to a page research paper titled simply Tor the agency has worked on several methods that if successful would allow the NSA to uncloak anonymous traffic on a wide scale effectively by watching communications as they enter and exit the Tor system rather than trying to follow them inside One type of attack for example would identify users by minute differences in the clock times on their computers And it still gets worse Tor prioritizes fast relays and so if you consider that plausibly speaking many and possibly most of the most high speed Tor relays are run by Western intelligence agencies and not just grassroots Tor volunteers it makes timing attacks so much easier for them From the pando com article from above QuoteIn Tor co founder Roger Dingledine revealed that the Tor Network is configured to prioritize speed and route traffic through through the fastest servers nodes available As a result the vast bulk of Tor traffic runs through several dozen of the fastest and most dependable servers on today's network clients choose one of the fastest exit relays around of the time and of their choices come from a pool of relays This information above has already been public since the Edward Snowden leaks so now everyone reading this has no excuse not to get off Tails and learn Ubuntu or your other favorite flavor of Linux and start using a reputable VPN impeccable track record of standing up against government requests keeps no logs and you can pay them in bitcoins You can start on this now or end up like the silk road lieutenant who got arrested because his Tor connection got de anonymized by the government to what was probably his home IP address And if you're a serious DNM user you don't do business hours a day online from a public wifi spot This is not an acceptable solution for power users Bonus points if you use a pre paid g hotspot with your non Tails flavor of Linux a reputable VPN where your face was never on camera buying the hotspot think fake wig cell phone at home and paid in cash True story Great advise I however use a preconfigured travel router can be found on Amazon called GL iNET and flashed it with DD WRT and Open VPN I then uploaded several VPN config files onto the router itself and foced all traffic through the VPN Add to that I ONLY PLUG IN I never use WiFi So the travel router is connected to the WAN port from Ethernet over Power extender and then wired through the LAN port into my machine I run Tail when on the go and whinox when home I also 'bridge' into the tor network on start up and never use persistant memory I feel it is more secure to have my content Keys Keymanager etc stored on a seperate encrypted USB thumb drive that I then upload my keys before I go live So im essentially between my machine and the VPN that is then relaying those packets through a bridged connection into the tor I highly suggest you use AWS to spawn yourself a VPN I feel it is more secure to have your very own VPN config rather than use one that is shared by others.

Quote from luxaeterna on April pmWould it be safe enough to continue to use online back transfer so long as I wash them before sending them to vendor here I plan on doing TAILS PGP LBC Electrum wash helix market vendor How does this sound Thanking you This would be safe as long as if you're not buying k of bitcoins per month Then you'd just better have a believable story what it's for or pay for and consult consult a bitcoin attorney if it's that serious have seen law firms on search engines before that specialize in bitcoin law Also I would even recommend sending from Helix back to a fresh address in a new bitcoin wallet we can call your tumbled stash Like for GammaGoblin's LSD to buy it when you go to checkout it locks in the bitcoin price But if you use Helix sometimes it ends up sending a few dollars or cents less so you can either overpay in a situation like this or pay twice The better solution would be Electrum Wallet A Helix Electrum Wallet B since then the exact amount will get sent to your vendor marketplace This also gives you a tumbled stash to play with instead of feeling like you're forced to send it all to the market immediately and have your extra coins sitting on there Does this help.
Well I don't have anything to say about grammar or syntax but I do have something to say about Reddit r DNM First of all it doesn't matter what the vector of attack or particular vulnerability is the problem is that correlation of aggregates and UIs unique identifiers can identify people just as much as posting pictures combined with site history or what have you all of this is irrelevant It is all information which can and will be aggregated and used against someone Talking about purchases on clearnet and getting into specific details about how business is conducted along with dangerously innacurate or biased information are threats After much lurking and reading I believe that some of the moderators of r DNM after analysis are informants I do not have proof other than psychological traits from stylography and demeanor I have been on internet forums and chats since the days of Gopher when CERN had the only webpages People give away quite a bit when they talk and that is something that makes a clearnet site dangerous They have a corporate structure and have to abide by regulations and I do no trust Conde Naste reddits owners anymore than I trust Wal Mart or CostCo This is why I tell people to stay clear of RC vendors that take Paypal or CCs on the clearnet they can be compelled to provide evidence against you On Reedit lol they can track if you go to A B and C subreddit after browsing r DNM don't need money you go to r furry or r worldnews and then you browse r gratefuldead r LSD etc then you log in tommorow then the next day do the same thing there could be a UI even if you use TOR I have been told that using JavaScript on TOR alone cannot reveal your identity IF your browser is set correctly but there are a number of settings in TBB which can be queried and further added to a UI of a user So while grammar might not be the issue there are issues and at least onion forums are not owned by corporate media won't encourage you to do risky shit someone on actually recommended that no one order MDMA domestically in the US because Canada is foolproof and cheaper because they want people to take risky orders the LE want people to break the law and brag about it publicly I don't take sides in this shit but after Evo I'm feeling negativity on a whole other level from r dnm and while we will still read your shilly reviews I have not and will never post or login to that section of the website or browse it outside of a totally new TOR connection with scripts off and cache cleared I suggest others do the same don't post comment its a trap and not a good one like in r trapmusic or r traphouse or what have you thanks for reading out.
thanks for the link yes i saw the section I've never placed an direct order before so its still kinda sinking it no more going to markets and waiting for deposits and gettin' scamme.
I'm going to be out for awhile I'll PM you when I return I can try using my current and new key to see what the problem is Thank you so much because what he said didn't make absolute sense at all It's just text how can one send a virus that way.
Damn Free Ross I guess He was to the DNMs today as what Zeppelin Hendrix was to rock.
I have to make a transaction on AB but i'm wondering if I have to go though with it or notThe scam reports are making me uneasy.
I logged in friday morning gmt timeAll my funds were sitting there same number nothing touchedI m fairly confident agora is still safe At the same time p p action seems to me as the best solution TMG.
Has anyone ordered from this guy Here is his page on agora wares consist of stashes containers scales and bags for a reseller Which is what I am in need since I do that frequently Can anyone vouch for this guy Thanks.
Personally I'll be using Abraxas I've used it in the past as a backup and they've been extremely reliable Not the most active but it's worth considering due to the fact it will be picking up activity wise when people go looking for alternatives What I have most vendors switch to so far is Abraxas and or Middle Earth.

Tails on a USB disk is pretty good The only problem is that as the system partition is writable an attacker could tamper your system When using a DVD on each reboot you know that you have a clean system as long as you used a clean image when burning the CD You then can have an encrypted partition to store your files on a USB disk or a microSD You'd then have to open it manually and work with text files or manually link folders you'd need during your cession You can always have a better OPSEC TAILS on a DVD for internet access and a second offline computer to encrypt and decrypt documents software isolation or physical isolation to protect your tor process tor over VPN over anonymous wifi live DVD software isolation on top of some physical isolation on a system that can't be tampered with possibilities are endless It's up to you to decide if it's worth it or not If you're a small time buyer Don't worry Tails is pretty good as it is If you have fun working your OPSEC up are a paranoid geek or a high profile target this might not be enough for you If not you'll probably fine On your VPN question it will be needed only if you feel the need to hide the fact that you are using TOR to your ISP That will do nothing more If you use an anonymous wifi connection you probably don't need it Remember don't tell too much on your setup We don't need to know if you use a wireless connection or your own DSL router That might help an attacker find who you are and what are the weaknesses of your setup.
Abraxas vendor bond BTCI won't use abraxas simply because I don't trust them to have their site configured correctly See vendor bond BTCI won't use Nucleus because I've seen all kinds of vendors saying crazy shit about them their site obviously requires javascript to display correctly check out their site without javascript it looks broken as fuck Any market that relies on javascript I will never trust DHL vendor bond BTCI'm hesitant to use DHL because I don't like the UI I saw some reddit threads with people saying their code is basically Evolution's code so it could be the same people though I don't think DHL looks much like Evolution did they have very few vendors I think I'm not exactly familiar with how their vendor approval process works but seeing their site made me think it is not like that of a normal market some parts of their site look broken without javascript Seriously who allows javascript while using tor AlphaBay vendor bond AlphaBay works great has a lot of nice features It's not the prettiest and it's run by people who are obviously ok with theft which is not a good sign at all but it works very well and it is a large market MEM vendor bond BTCMiddle Earth Marketplace looks good to me I was put off at first by their theme but after seeing the site I realized that does not really matter They have a lot of categories which is cool Silkittie vendor bond BTCSilkittie is a very nice looking market very clean UI I like it but it is mostly EU resident members pretty small To check it out see vendor bond BTC I dont' recall Hansa market looks nice and more like Evolution than DHL does Small userbase See.
It been down again all morning for me.
reportedly the prosecution in the SR trial exempted every potential juror who had internet and at the end they had to take a yo IT guy a yo woman and people over with no technological background p Anyway one of the major reasons not to have charges lead to rediculous sentences is that when facing life in prison only an idiot would accept a life sentence in the US federal system as a plea What Ross did was intentionally lose a trial that was unwinnable in hope that his defense will be able to get the verdict possibly thrown out or sentence reduced If you are already fucked might as well go to trial and get it out of the way good luck Ross.
Quote from Knuckles on October pmI'm still iffy on meo its decent less manic and more clear headed But MXE really gives that euphoria something meo lacks in I thought meo was supposed to last longer but it seems about the same length as mxe Although one day on meo it gave me a shitload of energy but this chemical is so odd that everytime I've taken it its always been a bit different in what it does Completely Agree Everytime I take it It's different and it doesn't have the sensational euphoria that MXE provides It's a shame I mean it's enjoyable but I don't know there just seems to be more confusion but I think that's because it's just THAT dose dependant TBH When I did mg precisely measured and mg an hour later I had a clear headed good euphoric experience in fact I got news during it that my grandma had passed away and it was just rather spiritual at that point other people had texted me at the same time as well all in a serendipitous fashion nothing relating to my grandma but people important to me never the less and it just was unreal All just a coincidence though and a bit off topic If I wanted to use volumetric dosing with MEO PCP I think I would do mg diluted in Vodka at at ratio so that each CC would hold MG and CC would provide me with precisely MG Is that essentially what you where describing but with only mg at a time.

sometimes it takes a long time to connect to Tor depending on different factors Have you tried just leaving it alone for up to or minutes and seeing if it connects to Tor then.
Yup sent.
sad I know the TMG isn't perfect well sort of But if a vendor goes rouge we typically know before major scam can be pull off The Gardeners here work the fields and we enjoy the fruits of their labor as it should be Thanks for news Helps to remind us why we are here.
There is a topic on the hub about this being a scam would check it out frequently before joining I would highly recommend you join use at dream instead.
Is TOR that effective when it comes to wallets and anonymity To my understanding TOR only disguises the activity you're doing but anyone who's eavesdropping at the exit node can get my IP pretty easily So if I use TOR for my electrum wallet the electrum servers may not know where the coins came from but LE can always know it by watching the exit nodes Could it really be Haha I guess I'm too paranoid Quote from crepuscular on February pmBut for people who may have trouble getting coins that are totally unlinked to them Maybe some information about different tumbling options advantages disadvantages current status reputation etc would be helpful BTW I second this I think about new tumbling methods since BTCFog at least according to what I read on reddit is latelz being sketchy as fuck.
Quote from cerver on February pmQuote from OldIsGold on February pmWhat's the best and most trustworthy btc mixer out there right now Bitcoinfog I would say that bitcoinfog is the best Blockchain info privides shared send and I believe it's also quite good If you're really paranoid you can chain them like you btc fog you shared send you but it's also more expensive I also think that bitcoinfog requires a minimum deposit of btc which isn't that much if you're placing a big order but should be kept in mind nonetheless.
Quote from Organix on March pmAre you talking about dream or nuc On nucleus they do that but on dream the pgp is optional I have asked how to make it a pgp required login and never got a reply from adminOops you are right I was actually thinking of DHL Dream is the one where you just enter username captcha then decrypt Sorry about my confusion.
Alphabay may be one of the biggest markets right now but that still doesn't take away the fact that it's ran by a bunch of carders In fact no market should be trusted Either way they just might be implemending a tumbler service just to try and get as much coins moving through their market as possible so that they can pull a fast one on over us I'm not pointing fingers or anything just saying Just my btc Have a nice day.
You don't want to trust them to tumble your coins if they get seized or if the feds get an image of the server you're screwed See what happened to SR They had a tumbler But the feds won the coins and the databases They probably can correlate everything Not to say that you can trust tumblers that don't do anything else than that not to be run by LE or not to keep logs of each and every transaction.
Lately I've had a good experience with Bitblender The laundered coins are available almost immediately so the whole process didn't take more than minutes But you could probably find some other mixers with lower fees as Bitblender is definitely not the cheapest.

Just a heads up Ive deposited coins to my account days ago and despite seeing them enter my account via Blockchain I have never received my coins I've messaged support multiples times but they have never responded Im not the only one with this problem either if you check the agora Reddit pages or the bugs section there are plenty of posts about the same thing I have always loved and supported agora and would love to continue to do so but so far no one has heard back from support regarding this issue Just be careful with your coins atm I recommend sticking to Abraxas or alphabay until the situation is resolvedI will update this post immediately if I receive my coins or hear back from support.
You can also loose BTC on the way But it sounds better than using a mixer as we don't know how they work and if they keep log Aren't there two many fees on the way I guess each exchange takes some little fees isn't it If the rate is going up it's all good but if it's stable did you calculate how much your system would cost to mix BTC.

Quote from DiMiTreeZ on March pmI agree Oasis is pretty awesome It is a nice looking site it is designed well Can someone explain the donation thing though So there is absolutely no fees that they demand Its just what you feel like donating If so that sure is different and very respectable But I sure do hope that people are donating so they have the drive to stay legit and grow in popularity Yes they are completely donation supported They require a bond for new vendors but they waive this for vendors that can confirm they are already established on other markets and the bond is returned to new vendors after orders Listings and sales are completely free Oasis does not take a percentage or fee for listings or sales We are donating of our sales to the market and we plan to continue doing that From what we can assess they do not need our donations to support maintain and continue to develop the market They plan to continue with or without significant vendor donations and sound like they are set up to do so We get the impression they know what they are doing We think we are good at recognizing these things We feel safe on this ship.
Thanks for the guide Would be useful to me if I actually knew what multisig was I would include that on your blog I know myself and probably others would find it very useful.
Quote from rec on July amProblem I see is that as not many people use it there isn't much you can do with those And you can't blend in with thousand users as it is possible with BTC Hi That's a good point But about Monero for example there is enough people already using Monero and the daily volume of trafic is high enough transactions previous week AND the Monero system is designed to be private without VPN or TOR an ISP can see you are connected to Monero network and could maybe see Monero trafic transactions but can never tell to who you send XMR or from who you receive them and the transferred coins are automatically mixed by the system they can not be traced unlike BTC The blockchain is opaque and crypted only you your wallet with a private key of an outgoing transaction can log in the XMR blockchain to decrypt and trace ONLY this one transaction of you Today on Poloniex Monero is the second coin after Ethereum in volume of BTC There are less people using Cloakcoin network now and the daily volume of Cloak is low traded on Bittrex but it's the same Monero is also a perfect way to tumble or anonymize the BTC you bought with a link to your real indentity see my post or.
For info DNM adopting Monero XMR altcoin th August Alphabay and Oasis the biggest Darknet Markets are discussing XMR implementation August Oasis confirms XMR implementation no longer debating about it August SIGAINT and Monero Tor node enables a Tor user to easily transact in Monero using a thin client while securely maintaining the keys to their wallet on their computer all while not even exiting Tor The SIGAINT operators firmly believe that Monero is the next logical step in Darknet commerce It solves most of the privacy problems that plague cryptocurrency systems such as Bitcoin SIGAINT Monero Tor node.
Quote from tortrip on April amQuote from Spitfire on December pmI thought it was great too until they started serving ads through Torads What really got me and caused me to abandon my accounts there is the fact that an ad that I was being served related to an organization in my country of origin That is either A HUGE coincidence or IP address data is possibly being leaked indicating the country of origin I've also been using sigaint org but I've never seen any ads there Perhaps that's because I'm browsing with JavaScript disabled and Ad Block enabled The service has so far been quite reliable I just found it freaky they now seem to have fixed whatever the problem was and I have resumed using the service once more Spitfir.
Quote from HalfPint on August amI would be weary of switching It sounds like it isn't an Agora specific problem For opsec I would refrain from any markets at the moment Much Love what he said Remember this is a vulnerability issue with tor not just Agora Thanks for slapping some sense into me It isn't just the markets it could apply to this forum as well I feel like if your encrypting your data and taking all the necessary precautions you'll be okay though.

Quote from sillywabbit on May pmQuote from dardush on May amThanks sillywabbit Do you have by any chance an invite code I did not need one Did they close regs Yep.
Abraxas for sure the referals is mint as im earning a fair few btc just from referals also everything runs perfect there.
have faith in Agora they put up a message saying they were having issues dealing with all the new traffic from Evo peeps they are most likely just upgrading their infrastructure like they said they would ACID.
GOOD idea lets get on it.
I understand that electrum is the best way to go but if someone ever needed an online wallet which one would be the one to use Also should you use it on Tor because I heard somewhere that BTC over Tor somehow deanonomizes you Also do you need to use a mixer if you're sending it to a unique BTC address you're given when doing a direct wallet to wallet transaction with a vendor I don't really like using mixers but I will if it's critical to OPSE.
fuck the centralized markets man trusted vendor boutique sites and email forum direct trades is the ONLYway to go with any kind of assurance that your coin or identity is not being compromised For all we know every market is run by LEO or their informants.
I came here to rub my tummy.

Ok have seen this question come up a few times so thought I would write up some thoughts that might help stimulate some conversation SAFETY NOTE If you are a vendor it is probably best advised if you refrain from discussing the particulars of how you handle your coins In general try to avoid mention what software or hardware you use BTC WALLETSWhy trust a web service at all You can download a lite client and handle sending and receiving from your own computer NOTE You MUST configure this to run through tor if you are going to use it for buying Code Select can you purchase btc through electrum Not AFAIK can you explain why electrum would be anonymous compared to coinbase online wallet It is a client side wallet ie it lives on your computer Therefore as long as your ensure it is configured to run through tor it means you can receieve and send btc wihtout needing to logon to an online wallet This comes with its own ramifications One consideration is that when you start a blockchain wallet using tor perhaps blockchain notes that transaction as having been through tor can we ensure that their serves are safe from government hacks However having a bitcoin wallet on your computer means that you have total control over your btc this has its ups and downs if i were to send btcs from an online wallet to my electrum wallet would it still be anonymous Were the coins bought with anything that can identify you Have you ever logged onto a service that is connected to your btc over a clearnet connection therefore associating your IP to those coins this is a bit simplistic but you get the idea If they were anonymous to begin with and you have electrum setup to only run through tor then they will remain anon Online Blockchain if you need a wallet on the fly then you could set up a brand new wallet for each transaction You don't need to use an email address and it can be one time use only on OPSEC for online wallets if using them to purchase controlled substances ALWAYS access them through TOR never link your real life identity to these services ie register with an email that is linked to your IRL identity If you logon to it NOT through tor this means your IP physical location is linked to that wallet abandon it IMMEDIATELY never logon again and create new wallet Start a new wallet for each transaction you don't need to use an email at all What to do if you bought BTC with your credit card across an clearnet connection Suggestion Blockchain shared send Blockchain shared send bitcoinfog Will update this as we get more input and specific questions.
So test kits would not be an approved item since it is not listed am I reading that correctly.
Well in my case it had nothing to do with Agora deposits it was because ME marketplace had locked my funds preventing withdrawl because I broke a rule by withdrawing my funds without making a purchase Although they were very quick in releasing them once i'd explained the situation but it makes me wary of depositing BTC there again.
Quote from Lobster on November pmQuote from DarcM on November amEverything was okay in the end Just got a bit worried there for a moment PSo what happened You had to go pay postage at the post office Is this a normal occurence And finally is it frowned upon when a vendor does this Yeah i had to go receive the package at the post office NO this is absolutely not normal and YES it is completely frowned upo.
Why is it called Apple Market Why should I be interested in Apple Market over all the others.

My withdrawal pin is not working on AB I have not used it in months but it is correct Has anyone had issues of their correct withdrawal pin on AB not working I do not have the mnemonic from account creation either so I cannot reset it.
idk but it seems kinda covert like using burner phones and dead drops.

Quote from ch m ra on June pmHey UncleAl I would reccommend using a separate USB key CD DVD microSD for keys and other sensitive things that you need to have encrypted Persistent volumes never sit well with me Take this analogy I see all these cell phone cases that double as wallets holding credit card ids money etc If someone were to steal your cell phone they would now have access to your complete identity Since TAILS is amnesic if you do not use the persistent volume you will be able to keep all your other files separate TAILS itself is not illegal One more thing An SD card is extremely easy to destroy Chew Microwave Swallow The possibilites are endles If you have any other questions feel free to ask CThanks friend I'm not really good with this kinda stuff It took me forever to figure out how to install TAILS on USB I wish there was just one single package you can just install and all your OPSEC needs are taken care of I guess TAILS is the closest thing to that but it seems like there are a million other things when you go around the Deep Web and see what everyone else talks about.
Is the LSD test kit a time use or is it many uses Also what is the price.
I'm gonna be upgrading my OPSEC to TAILS on USB and I'll most likley be using public Wi Fi since I don't have my own on whatever laptop comes my way Obviously VPN and other things like that aren't an option so is there anything else I need.
Quote from bombheadie on January amIf anyone paid for anything they did not receive please message me Before all this happened I ended up getting a printer and was going to make everything PERFECT I apologize from the bottom of my heart I was NOT trying to get one over on anyone I promise you that more messages have been sent without response Bombheadie is a scamme.
sorry can't help but had something similar happen with another vendor who was very highly regarded back in the day who also went private never thought they would do something like that either was doing lots of business with them ended up scamming me out of nearly k after doing private deals for half a year in some emails they had hinted they'd be doing a lot of drugs since they went private as a vendor not sure what but that it had been the cause for some delays we had had than I sent over k and was fed little lines of i'll send it soon etc stalling than they just went dark never heard from them again It might be the case once some of these vendors have made their millions and slow down to being private vendors quit they have enough money to live quite comfortably and other fall to the wayside Free time and drugs also go together quite well maybe the passion has faded with them who knows anyways long rambling post but I wish you luck getting scammed sucks especially when its someone you thought you could trust and have rapport with.
has anyone tried these blotters from john any feedback on the quality.
BlackBank id say yeah however i prefer Agora over any other platform Cheers Dolmi.
I have taken a look at the Apple Market and it does appear to have some good features however before i hand over a bit coin to become a vendor here is my list of complaints If I want to search products by a country it appears that it does not function very well Say I want to search all drugs available in Canada the search feature will not do that Many customers on the dark web prefer to shop domestically so they can avoid the hassle of having their purchase go through customs Having a search feature which allowed the user to isolate all items or sellers domestically would be a standard feature as a must Why is Apple asking for a full bit coin deposit for vendors You are not the Big Apple and myself i do not trust such a new market asking for such a big deposit My feelings is that I do not like to gamble money that i could lose if Apple goes rotten Plus with so few vendors on site it would probably take months as a vendor to even probably have a sale To give an example When i became a vendor on Alphabay i earned over my deposit in bitcoin within a week Dream Market i have yet to make a sale so they are a waste of time WTF why are your percentages so high for your commission Why would i put much stock in trade on your site when Alphabay is offering me is just a bit too far over the top My advice is until your site grows up and catches up to the big boys you would be better to lower your commission I suggest you start at about seeing as how presently your site is just a baby Good luck.
Quote from uncleal on February amQuote from sillywabbit on February pmvery likely although from the rise of other markets the fact that evo and agora are still up and the further development of p p networks like Bitmessage etcI doubt they can do much to STOP it Deter yes but those who are TOP Notch in their OPSEC and know how to make robust websites The ONLY shot they have is to get in on the inside like they did Agree The cats already out of the bag and LE knows it and that's percisely the reason why LE turns to scare tactics because they know they can't do anything about it legally at least But more and more bills keep being brought up that would allow LE and the NSA to infringe on our rights even more and this also needs to be addressed and stopped yep like who knows how about just warrantless opening of people's mail How about cameras installed in peoples' homes bathrooms floors in your body I think these LEO will either continue on or maybe their policies will become some extravagant and rediculous that they will see the absurdity in it all especially when it is obvious none of it is bettering society In fact it will all just lead to greater discontent more acts of violence and revolt Look at alcohol prohibition They need to just stop But I see the next step will be some kind of USPS control system maybe a change in our internet laws but whatever we are in the digital age hackers rule and it cant be stopped freedom fighters will find a way around anything One thing I've wondered lately is there a noticeble surge in MAIL and even so it's just more of the same thing but im sure their is profiling and thats why vendors gotta switch it up allot make packs look plain and unassuming I jst dunno how vendors can just drop s of packs a week and not be suspect oh and maybe blue boxes will get replaced by control centers that are monitored with scanners that have cameras too it could get that craz.
I used to go on r darknetmarkets for a month or two It was a OPSEC fuck up and I'll admit that I've since deleted my reddit account But I'm still not sure wether I can ever recover from that OPSEC blunder I used a fake persona and told many lies on there and never made a single order while I had a reddit account so maybe I discreditted myself to LE as just some teenage kid telling lies to seem cool on the internet but I'm still not sure wether my OPSEC will ever recover from that My advice to everyone is stay away from there As for grammar Come on guys this place is supposed to be different from the clearnet We're all supposed to spread love not be grammar nazi's and argue like the fools on reddit As long as the message intended to be sent is recived I really don't see the big deal.
AlphabayDream seems to be fairly popular as well Valhalla I personally don't care for the layout.
thanks for the replie.

I really appreciate it what would be a really good place for a new person like me to start buying stuff from here like im really into cannabis and I live in the extreme south coast so I am unsure if anything is safe to order on here or not hmm I also heard that you shoudn't order anything to be sent to your address why is that is this true Where should I have my stuff sent to what is your most reliable place how many times have you made a transaction sorry for all the questions these are just things i really want to know.
Quote from on April pmit's more like a dating is illegal but what happens between two consenting adults is drugs online is still illegal though correct However TMG is an informational research and educational platform where educated individuals can share life experience's.
Quote from bruce on August pmQuote from anon on August amThis place is really cool I just made an account and have been browsing the boards I too was expecting a market but honestly this is way better There's already a ton of markets this is a COMMUNITY Exactly Welcome to the garden I appreciate the welcome any advice for starting to join conversations.
Postage due handwritten etc Makes you think a high school kid w o a scale or a clue is slinging this gear.
I am not sure if it is clever to use tor for your coinbase account I assume you want to buy bitcoin via a bank transfer In that case your real identity will be linked to your coinbase account anyway so no reason to use tor Buy the coins using your clearnet browser then transfer them to a wallet not linkable to you you create and access this wallet only through tor and from there to the market vendor you want to buy from You can also configure tor browser to pick exit nodes from a specific country see good way to anonymously get bitcoin besides coinbase is localbitcoins com It allows you to buy bitcoins in person or via cash deposit or bank transfer directly from other people.
Quote from bubblybubbles on February pmQuote from sterlingsword on December amQuote from ultrabear on December amI for one love the idea Sterling but do not see the issue with some type of small fee to help cover operational expenses on your end Please keep me updated on your progress as I am extremely interested in your concept Thank you I will I'm trying to negotiate a deal with a vendor for free LSD anually to run the service I know I could make a lot more by taxing transactions but that's not what I'm about I'm a firm believer that more money leads to more problems Don't get me wrong I love money But I'd have to deal with laundering it getting it in the first place which would require more time just stuff I don't care for I make a good living and this type of merchant system is very easy to create All of the extra stuff are the challenge But I'm only interesting in helping people out I sincerally believe that anyone that wants LSD other drugs used sparingly should have access too them to free their mind and to not only help themselves but help others If I can provide a community to peolple that will offer that That's money in and of itself for me Plus I'll habe a reliable market to buy LSD on But Hopefully this vendor I'm in contact with will be interested in purchasing it I have him in mins for the top vendor so he'll probably get the source regardless Just with LSD I will offer more I'll see how it goes lol Either way I'm developing it though Quote from on December amWow so much thought went into this but working directly with vendors whom have proven themselves This system is hard to beat I send coin they send product simple i will never join an open market againThank you for your feedback Mod That's the idea A community based on human principle trust And that is exactly what I'm aiming for An entire community of completely trusted vendors of which vendors have the ability to ban if it comes down too it You can almost gurantee that so long as you're a good customer and don't lie cheat or steal that you'll have an entire community of people such as yourselves Also harder for LE to penetrate with typical social engineering Hi Sterling Great idea I agree that vendors shouldn't or probably wouldn't have an issue with at least donating a small fee to help run the site I also like money and I'm currently helping out a friend with his business and even though I don't ask for money but just to clarify how we would work things out I asked in the beginning Now I am comfortable with accepting his paying for resources fuel and whatever else I might need to work and running gear I make sure of it I rarely ask for anything but he's great anyway I think it's great how you are in a way giving the control back to the vendors and really focusing on Trust being what drives the wheels You remind me of myself Question I was wondering how the exact product pp Price Stock Item count the Victorious Vendor Sale method might work if a vendor of a smaller magnitude was to go up against someone like ToR or the like Or maybe I just haven't worked that out yet but you have I suppose this wouldn't be showed off publicly in respect of the Vendors Which is a shame It's a cool idea But instead just the transaction would initiate I don't quite understand how Trust of the Vendors toward each other works I thought at first it was Trust amongst Vendors and Consumers Anyway Goodluck with this I hope you see it through Maybe at first you could keep the numbers down until all the kinks are ironed out and keep it a bit easier for you and the mods to operate Goodluck Hello It's been a while but I'll attempt to answer your questions Question I was wondering how the exact product pp Price Stock Item count the Victorious Vendor Sale method might work if a vendor of a smaller magnitude was to go up against someone like ToR or the like Answer We would still show the calculations but factor them toward a percentage This would create a scale that is similar amoungst a user perspective Moving forward we would plan on still listing the total sales or similar so that the user could also gauge how relevent the percentile actually is Perhaps we would implement another factor that indicates the sales margin such that a user could more accurately depict one vendor from perhaps a scammer with only sale that was shipped still Question I don't quite understand how Trust of the Vendors toward each other works I thought at first it was Trust amongst Vendors and Consumers Answer The method of trust would implement a purely bias trust mostly as an experiment from the biased perspective We would not intend on biased trusting but that would probably be the inevitable result given we are humans and tend to choose only what can give us something Moreso the trust is more or less a way to boast The entire website would be built with a focus on honesty We are considering accounting rating with number of other vendors invited Essentially and ideally we would be creating a market place that fosters honesty trust diversity and competition while rewarding all aspects of the philsophy The primary reason a vendor should and would want to invite a new vendor that they trust is so that they can provide more product to the consumer More vendors more hubs So a vendor in theory that wants to hold all of the customers for themselves would and should inevitably fail because well they can't They need support This is a team project We are all working toward delivering LSD not buying brand new lambo's that we can look at when we're older and wonder what other outcome these decisions could of had I mean think about it How many vendors have you seen rise and fall More or less due to stress and large consumer load If vendors can learn to share customers when convinient and learn that in the end they'll still get theres we'll be one step closer towards progressing to a better world.
Welcome bombheadie very nice thread look forward to seeing you grow in the Garden Be safe Peace E.
Quote from uncleal on April pmWhat's up with that Agora link Is that a pishing link or did they just add a second URL That's the former URL that's no longer being used The new one is onionMore info here Agora Marketplace Changes Url Due to Heartbleed SSL Bu.
Does anyone know which of the current markets have the biggest userbase and the most listings.
Quote from britneystoke on May amI would not recommend currently using Agora I have always loved the site but a lot of peoples deposits are not showing up lately My deposit has not showed for days with no reply from support I would recommend using Alphabay or maybe Abraxas till Agora gets there shit figured out Agora is now up and running FULL SPEED AHEAD CAPTAIN COOK.
Seems like Agora is down again since this morning.
Lizard labs does ship to the US and if anyone wishes for an invite I have one for you.
hahahahaahahha I saw a picture of him good luck in Jail or not getting hurt from anyone Maybe this will be a lesson to the others However I do wonder if he has information saved from Sheep in order to get a lesser sentence Here's some info on the arrest Notes about the translation The article is a bit confused mixing narratives together mixing official sheep market narrative meaning someone external stole it with Tom s official narrative I had nothing to do with it it was on my server by acciddent and with police story he has the money we proved it It also doesn t really mention it was darknet marketplace with drugs it only mentions that it was an online marketplace and it says that Tom was the hacker that stole the money but again it s a confused article in general So at times it doesn t make that much sense I think that s because the reporter didn t really follow the case that well and mixed stuff together Anyway let s do this How the bitcoins were laundered millions from abroad a house written on granddad note this idiom written on somebody means in Czech officially owned by officially done by as in officially granddad owned it Police officers blocked house costing million Czech Crowns bought by Czech programmer for suspicious bitcoins note all amounts are in Czech Crowns million is eur usd million is eur usd Czech from Hodonin city in Czech Rep area is being investigated for stealing money from online market from which million Czech crowns disappeared Czech criminals are increasingly using the virtual currency for saving their gains say Ministry of Finance dirty money house villa in Lu ice a small town is according to police a proceed of crime It was supposedly used for laundering dirty money That s why police seized it Last year in January a new bank account of years old Eva Barto ov had a payment that made Air Bank Czech Bank safety controls flash an idiom Almost thousand Crowns from a foreign company that exchanges virtual bitcoins into real money The young woman could not credibly explain to the bank officers the source of the money Only additional investigation revealed that millions already went using this road And that behind it was a certain Tom Ji ikovsk that was connected by amateur internet investigators with stealing money from web marketplace Sheep Marketplace where people traded in large numbers with the bitcoin currecy The damage was described by the operators of the marketplace as more than million My note to the above as I said the article is confused According to HN short for the news name Hospod sk Noviny police officers seized his house near Hodon n that he bought for bitcoins and that he wrote on his granddad The case is in a phase where we cannot comment told Petra Vedrov a police spokesman for South Moravian district Profesor signed grandson paidThe story can however be reconstructed from documents saved on cadaster note I don t know how is it in other countries in Czech we have a cadaster with information about real estate ownership and it s perhaps suprisingly public and open According to the decree about seizing the house with a pool and garden in the town of Lu ice the police officers wrote that the programmer Ji ikovsk and his wife Eva Barto ov note the girl from earlier from laundering dirty money The million that was used to buy the house can be from the funds stolen from Sheep Marketplace Your money our provisions all were stolen wrote the operators of the marketplace on their web not long before they had to close it two years ago They thought that someone found an error in the system and took Bitcoins According to the exchange rate at the time around millions My note Again they are confused and keep on writing that sheep was some legit online marketplace and Tom is the hacker that stole money from it The officers of Ministry of Finance s Financial Analytical Office that are detecting suspicious transactions mapped how the Ji ikovsk s money travelled They first left from the abroad company Bitstamp Limited that is selling and buying bitcoins The millions then arrived with several transactions either on the account of Ji ikovsk and Barto ov or on the account of the real estate company and the lawyer that worked on the house sale Part of the money went to the original owner of the house another part of the money went on her bank as one time payment of a mortgage The house is however in the cadaster written on Jan Goli a granddad of Ji ikovsk that added no money to the transaction That it was just an effort to conceal the real owner is demonstrated by the police by the fact that Ji ikovsk was the one that insured the house The real estate properties were fully paid by the finances acquired by the transactions of the virtual currency bitcoin say the detectives Ji ikovsk according to bank data took thousand Czech crowns in cash from bank Again from bitcoin The mobile number that was used by Ji ikovsk before is owned by somebody else HN tried to contact his wife through Facebook but without a reply And his granddad Goli was not available in his office on Mendelev University On this university the yeat old professor works as a renowned expert on fruit production Note the next two paragraphs are very confusingly Ji ikovsk never talked publicly at the time of the Sheep Marketplace affair he made an announcement that he only allowed the so called webhosting meaning that for money he allowed place and service for other internet pages Even a website that a fans of Sheep Marketplace made But he had nothing to do with the market When Ji ikovsk found in the fall that the web is illegal he turned it off He did not expand on why it would be illegal but it could have something with drug selling that people today sometimes buy with bitcoins Key question the money originBecause of the police silence we cannot tell how deep are the police officers in the case If they only investigate money laundering or if they want Ji ikovsk for his role in stealing money from the marketplace They should because so called legalization of procceeds of crime can only be proven if the police officers clearly name the exact crime where the dirty money comes from In the past the detectives thought that they are on a trace of billion laundering in Prague exchange They stopped the investigation of the owners they couldn t prove that the money were dirty not sure if they are talking about BTC exchange probably not the money is too big for that and this paragraph is kinda irrelevant The worldwide trend of dirty money ending in bitcoin more and more is confirmed by the Ministry of Finance specialists We detected a growth of suspicious trades where the gains from criminal activity end up in virtual currency warned last year annual report of Financial Analytical Office End Full details about the Sheep marketplace scam can be found here among some other details This was the owner of sheep that turned out to be the real person behind the market In Dec during a media interview Thomas denied being the person responsible for the Sheep Marketplace scam Thomas was never arrested until know even though that his name details were well known and reported to the Czech police soon after the scam.

Quote from NordicShrooms on September amAnyone have any experiences with Dream Been trying to set up there but I'm getting some weirdness with my account Interested in hearing any experiences with the site Just to update on this Dream has really fast customer service so everything turned out OK We can now be found here as well PS We ship to Brazil.
Hey there people To the people that called dibs and told you that you were in can you please send me your addresses today This is US US only so for that I had another spot open I have spot open right now for those that were interested If the address don't come from the others that made dibs I will have another spots open Also to the people that did call dibs I'm also going to be throwing g of MDMA in with the order also Enough for people If you would not like the MDMA please let me know and I will not send it along Much love TMG B.
someone mentioned this one before and so I post here supposedly multi sig only which is promising.
Hey everyone as much as it pains me to do so I simple need to switch marketplace while Agora gets there shit together I've been using Alphabay and have been quite happy with it Especially with there DDos protection and up time That being said I'm wondering if there's anything better out there Anyone got any suggestions experiences etc with other markets that have a stable up time Any info is much appreciated Thanks.
Got it you're reselling SB's MDMA Good to know Glad to see no other actives no problem in my opinion I saw Rex's had like caffeine cut which is fine I just don't ever want to see any amphetamines etc I'm a class psychedelic LSD Mushrooms DMT Mescaline MDMA Cannabis type of guy and don't want anything else no alcohol no coke etc gotta decalcify that third eye more EDIT Forgot to say thank you for the quick reply Thank you.
Quote from koolcid on March amI was copy and pasting and when i went to past into PGP I must've misclicked or something and recopied the original text not looking i just clicked Ctrl V and Send so i'm just wondering if messages are stored on TMG servers even after the message is deleted and whether i should burn the address now Thanks I'm still in disbelief that i did that Playing devil's advocate so you have proper safety What if TMG is really a LE honeypot Someone COULD say that messages are deleted and you are fine but now your private shipping information is in LE's hands You would be communicated that everything is OK but all TMG is designed for is tracking monitoring activity and also waiting for people to mess up and not PGP communications The choice is yours and I'm not saying I believe the above but servers have been compromised in the past elsewhere so one should be very prudent If you are buying low volumes or getting free samples probably no big deal even if LE was involved but if you are buying sheets and sending addresses unencrypted I'd be a little nervous Again I'm not saying I think the servers are compromised or that this is a honeypot but I think it's wise to ALWAYS assume everything is and never reveal information without encryption and if you do consider it burned You will make the best risk reward decision for yourself though.
OK I quit being lazy for a second and just looked up how to default this off for all new members This just tested out successfully for a new user on a test forum Edit the file Sources Register phpAround line right above Registration options are always default options add this regOptions 'extra register vars' 'show online' It already knew that was a potential possible registration option so maybe there's a simpler way to do it but it works So that would obviously cover all new user registrations but you would still want to run that query to disable it for all existing users just once update smf members set show online obviously use whatever your forum table prefix is if not smf I try to forget how horrible PHP is so hopefully someone actually runs with this and the minutes it took to check this out wasn't in vain.
Done thank you kind sir.
I put the link to the blog on Tor about the problem Using SSL on a hidden service is stupid and unnecessary as Tor makes it a HTTPS connection by default The problem is from my understanding that openssl is used to generate the private key or how it hands the private key to the primary relay node But if you were using a server that had openssl pre or generated your key using openssl pre then you were unsafe For the hack to work The server would have had to directly connect to a node that was compromised an attacker The chances of that happening with the little time the bug was out meant that all of our servers were not identified but the locations were changed just to be safe And new url's were generated with proper openssl.
I have several problems I changed my email from mailtor net to safe mail net I'm trying to change my PGP signature that appears at the bottom of my forum posts because it still ends with my old email address I can't find my PGP signature from within my PGP program I am also confused because apparently there is a sig that starts with at the beginning and ends with my email address which appears at the bottom of my posts and in the signature field in my forum profile I don't remember how I was ever able to find my sig and enter in the sig field in my profile in the first place I tried entering my new PGP public key in the PGP signature field in my profile per the instructions in the new members thread hoping it would somehow convert it to a sig but that didn't work Apparently there is also something much longer about a fourth the size of a public key that starts with BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE that I see on a vender's thread that is referred to as their sig So that means there are types of sigs I can't figure out how to find either one of these types of sigs for my own PGP key I also tried to change my email address in my forum account settings but it says I must enter my old email address in order to make any changes How can I change my email address in there if it needs my old email address in order to make changes Also someone said I should be able to obtain their public key through the link in their sig They were referring to the long one that starts with BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE Does anyone know how to obtain their key from that Many thanks to all who can help me.

A local street vendor friend of mine was worried about having open communications with his team and cut down on communication errors while trying to talk in code over cell phones I have studied the situation and am ready with a solution The system would have to use android and can be use in conjunction with or without Cell service you will just need to be on wifi for a connection to the internet The solution will not work through tor connection lag so it would have to be a special set up with a dedicated server VPS is OK to handle the communication streams A server closer to the outlet of the internet phone service provider would have the best results There is an app that will allow for end to end communication just like OTR for XMPP jabber The encryption is protocol was made by the same inventor of PGP Made me happy to read that one The application on the android phone would have he setting for the server and will be the dialer for it This will use the data connection on the phone and NOT the cellular phone service The app will encrypt the call fom one end to the other and the server will be set not to keep logs and to allow pass through communication that will enable the encryption to be done from one client to the other The starting price for a FULL package would be that would include year of the server required for the communications android smart phones Using JellyBean RootedQuad Core GHz GB RAM GB ROMduel sim cards so you can jump between networks and dump prepaid sim cards easily Frequency and Networks GSM MHz WCDMA MHz touch screen and TF card up to GB if you want need more storage I am also willing to do a server set ups and you can use your own rooted phones The server setup will include the price of the server for one year and would be around depending on the level of support you need If you are smart just need me to poke a few buttons the price is lower If you ask the same questions over and over again every time you add a phone the price will go up And don't forget you can use the IM server over tor for text communication already using OTR on some android clients.

Tried Apple along with other markets besides alphabay and these markets just doesn't jive with me I'm usually found on DHL here and the avengers.
Quote from herpiusderpius on August pmAgora has posted a message stating that they're moving their servers while they take down paus the website Who knows if when they'll be back up Would advise against doing any further business there in the mean time potentially in perpetuity Although this seems like a smart move on their part if they are to be believed We are still moving BTC out but hopefully we can direct some of our customers here Regards Sant.
Sigaint shared that on The Hub users who access Tor hidden services websites that are only accessible inside the Tor anonymity network is easier than de anonymizing users who use Tor to access regular Internet websites Security researchers Filipo Valsorda and George Tankersley showed Friday at the Hack in the Box security conference in Amsterdam why Tor connections to hidden services are more vulnerable to traffic correlation attacks One of Tor's primary goals is to provide anonymity for Internet users This is achieved by routing their Web traffic through a series of randomly chosen nodes or relays before passing it back onto the public Internet The nodes that make up the Tor network are run by volunteers and they can have specialized roles There are nodes called entry guards that serve as the first hops onto the network and there are also exit relays that pass the traffic back onto the Internet Internet servers that receive traffic from Tor users won't see the real IP Internet Protocol addresses of those users What they'll see will be the IP addresses of randomly chosen Tor exit nodes The Tor hidden service protocol extends the anonymity protection to servers as well It makes it impossible for users to see the real IP address of a server that runs a Tor hidden service like for example a website Hidden services use addresses that end in onion a pseudo top level domain that doesn't exist on the Internet and only resolves inside the Tor network This anonymity protection for both servers and users makes hidden services attractive to political activists in countries where free speech is not well protected or where Internet surveillance is common but also to criminals who use such websites to hide their activities from law enforcement The infamous online bazaar Silk Road where users sold drugs arms and other kinds of illegal goods and services operated as a Tor hidden service The FBI eventually shut it down and arrested its owner but other similar marketplaces have taken its place The biggest threat to the Tor network which exists by design is its vulnerability to traffic confirmation or correlation attacks This means that if an attacker gains control over many entry and exit relays they can perform statistical traffic analysis to determine which users visited which websites The Tor developers are closely monitoring exit relays and removing bad ones from the network so it's relatively hard for someone to pull off such an attack In addition if an attacker wants to identify Tor users visiting a specific Internet website they'd have to gain control over a very large number of exit and entry nodes in order to increase their chance of success since the relays will be different for every connection That's not the case with Tor hidden services and in fact attackers could quite easily and with percent reliability take control of all the rendezvous points between Tor users and specific Tor hidden services at least for a period of time Tor hidden services rely on nodes with a special HSDir hidden service directory flag to advertise themselves on the Tor network so they can be discovered by users Every hidden service will select six HSDir nodes to serve as its rendezvous points on a given day This selection is done from a pool of around nodes based on a predictable date dependent formula With this formula both a Tor client and a Tor hidden service should select the same HSDirs on a particular day However the researchers found that they could use brute force techniques to generate the keys needed for their own nodes to take up those rendezvous positions for a specific day The researchers managed to place their own nodes as the HSDirs for onion Facebook's official site on the Tor network for the whole day on Thursday They still held of the spots on Friday Brute forcing the key for each node took only minutes on a MacBook Pro and running the Tor relays themselves cost US on Amazon's EC service New nodes receive the HSDir flag automatically after being up for around five days and attackers could set up nodes to become the HSDirs for a particular hidden service for the next five days with around US the researchers estimated This technique will give attackers control over one end of the connection but in order to perform traffic correlation attacks the attacker would also need to have visibility into the entry point This can be achieved by someone who can monitor users' traffic before it enters the Tor network For example a government monitoring its Internet users through ISPs could use this attack to perform traffic analysis and determine who visited a dissident site hosted on Tor A law enforcement agency could do the same with the help of ISPs to identify who is visiting an illegal website that runs as a Tor hidden service The goal of the two researchers was to prove that hidden service users face a greater risk of targeted de anonymization than normal Tor users because it's much easier to reliably control all HSDirs for a specific hidden service than to control all Tor exit relays that might be used to access a website Runa Sandvik a security researcher and former Tor developer who was at the conference agreed that it's technically easier to pull off such an attack than to monitor Tor exit traffic but pointed out that the Tor Project is aware of the issue and has been working on a fix for some time There is a proposal for the next generation of hidden services that will address not only this problem but also other potential issues Sandvik said In the meantime the Tor developers have tools that can detect relays trying to attack users of Tor hidden services she said A change in Tor that will be implemented soon will make it harder for new nodes to become HSDirs by forcing them to obtain a stable flag first Valsorda and Tankersley said This will require nodes to be online for a longer period of time before they can become HSDirs so it will make the attack more expensive but not technically harder to pull off they said While users can't do much to defend themselves against this the operators of Tor hidden services do have one option They could use the attack themselves so that their own nodes will become HSDirs for their own hidden services This won't prevent others from trying to take over the rendezvous positions because the attack is essentially a race condition However if this happens it will be very easy to detect that an attack is going on the researchers explained They released the brute force tool they created for the attack on Github as well as a separate HSDir analysis tool that can potentially detect such attacks Source link be careful if you decide to setup your own shop El Presidente said on The Hub Quote from El PresidenteThis was first publicised by Donncha O'Cearbhaill in mid He described this technique and published some code since removed for calculating the relay key necessary to become an HSDir for a given HS at a given time looked at silkroadvb piz r amongst othersIt's good to remind people but we're kind of suprised this made the news again We will chime in with our standard response which isRUN YOUR OWN GUARDS or use guards you trust Stay safe.
I use that its annoymous and works great.
Nothing came today either I'm officially writing this off tomorrow if it doesn't land.
I would like to call dibs will be sending a PM really interested in this offer And would be glad to write up a nice trip report.
anybody can sendme a convite or referral link to this market thanks.
I can attest to receiving some sunshine blotters very quickly with poor stealth rather soon after he offered it from then on I can't say much Wouldn't order again Very amateur.

Quote from love is all around us on May pmI do NOT miss logging into Agora and seeing pornographic images used in many listings plastered all accross my screen that face when you've bought a account of evolution in the past and are not proud of it.
Fantastic guide I was able to get TAILS set up in an hour last night with this.
Hopefully the dosages aren't absurd to ruin the experience of all three.
Yes of course for me too until now I used BTC for all my psychedelics drugs I began on Evolution then here and it worked but I'm really not at peace of mind if the police would really trace my BTC trail to my real identity And of course it's now only a theorical discussion XMR or CLOAK as no vendor accept them But if nobody speaks about it if no customers ask vendors about it no vendor would never start to try to use these better and safer altcoins I'm only trying to inform and open eyes and maybe with chance have a little positive impact on the way the market evolves And REALLY the methods I gave here above are AT LEAST as good as any BTC tumbler system Helix to get clean BTC not linked to your identity Even if yes I understand we won't be able to pay vendors in XMR soon Still BTC XMR BTC exchanges are already great tools And last but not least if you buy XMR at low price and sell them at higher price you can get or BTC in return on BTC invested I do it quite often But you need to follow the XMR or CLOAK markets exchanges everyday and also have a little bit of chance.
And the next biggest popular after Agora.
Totally majestical as fuck dude I enjoy being in the company of like minded individuals feels like I'm a part of some secret society which only we understand Membership is paid in love and doses That's what always drew me to psychedelics The nature of these substances is so deep and profound that it naturally filters out those who don't have the capacity to understand or embrace these facets of existence Deep shit bruh.

Take a look at the new members thread here you need to get going bruc.
Abraxas being down is most likely due to the bitcoin surgeOr that is what we hopeCheers S.
Quote from dxuutx on May pmThis is why I would never trust a DNM with something important that would affect my real life like IRL dealers who borrow money for their supply and then a DNM goes down and it's all Fuck I'm dead I owe money to some bad people or heroin addicts on some WHERE'S MY DEPOSIT and going through withdrawal Like this is technology guys ever use it If so you know it breaks when you need it most Don't put in more money than you can afford to lose and don't rely on it for important things Thank you I couldn't agree more I've already swore to myself I'm sticking to micro transactions from now on I'd rather have BTC on the line than what i had put myself into And exactly I've never felt comfortable with sharing that I even use the market with anybody but close close close friends When they would like help with using it or want me to over see a transaction for them I let them know I risk my money when I use these marketplaces so when you want to use them you're risking your money too Basically saying I'll do my best to make sure they get a clean transaction but if it goes to hell in a hand basket which I've seen happen very easily it's not up to me to fix or compensate anything for them.
Quote from scroat on August pmIt was actually a particular key that was causing the problem It still is but I figured out I can use any other key just not that one Is the key expired PGP will not use expired keys to encrypt messages Spitfir.

HiQuote from luxaeterna on April pmDoes this sound ok where could I improve TAILS PGP LBC online bank wire Electrum wash helix market vendor If you pay with your bank account then your LBC account will be tied to your identity Better buy on LBC with cash by mail or find someone you can buy from in person Then send from LBC to an electrum address in tails mixer another electrum wallet using various addresses most mixers support that and that's better market vendorThe good thing with that is that it will allow for an anonymous wallet where'll land your washed coins and your change If you want to be extra careful you then can send not directly from this wallet but use an other mixer in between your anonymous wallet and the seller If you move coins between addresses wallets it also adds some plausible deniability Remember that the blockchain is public and that mixers could be run by your enemy Good luck.
It looks like he was apprehended recently That may have something to do with i.
Luckyduck are you active here or should we be reaching out to you in other places.
Is tails only for Linux based systems.
Looking to buy LSD in New Zealand south island today Other seller fell through now trying this avenue Can pay.
If Canada GFN went direct I would never need to use a market ever again.
Hi all delited to be here seem like a lovely bunch of peoples Just wondering A while back I was pretty bad with my opsec I bought btcs with online bank transfer on LBC then sent them to blockchain and then straight to a markets wallet What leak could happen to me here If the LE got the person I bought the product off would they be able to track back to me Also the other way around if the person I bought them off was LE could they see I sent the BTCs to blockchain and then to a market Would it be safe enough to continue to use online back transfer so long as I wash them before sending them to vendor here I plan on doing TAILS PGP LBC Electrum wash helix market vendor How does this sound Thanking you.
helloI was wondering if there is a way to safely chat over tor environment P P encryption anonimity I read some threads about it some recommend TorChat Other say is not safe anyone has an idea for this It would actually be cool to be able to chat with a vendor when you are working on an order Some vendor take days to reply messages and things can get longer than expected I dont know if this is against opsec or what please any of the Tech Gurus out there throw some light on the matter.
It was actually a particular key that was causing the problem It still is but I figured out I can use any other key just not that one.
my number Market atm is Abraxas iv loved it since the start i can see its only going to get bigger and bigger with more and more drugs for us Cheers Dolmi.
If you still manage to get coins out it goes without saying TUMBLE.

Quote from rec on July amWhy not using Qubes OS Comes with whonix Easy to use Possibility to chain VPNs easily VM are read only so it would make it harder for an attacker to modify your system than using Ubuntu Well I took your advice and tried Qubes OS Now before I go any further I am very technically capable and experienced Qubes OS in my opinion is HORRIBLE Here's why It's way too slow Data transfers between app vm's are th of what they are normally Even installing app's via the Konsole lags on a system with very good hardware TAILS is slow But Qubes is times as slow as tails I have the minimum system requirements and the system is still not usable as a desktop replacement Simple things like converting audio video would be impossible due to the speed of the OS It is EXTREMELY difficult to install use It took me around hours to get the damned thing installed on a system that is tested confirmed working by the developers After installation it took hours upon hours of reading through the crappy documentation to learn how to get basic tasks done There is absolutely no way an average buyer vendor could figure out how to use this OS they would need a tech specialist Compatibility with most laptops PC's is poor VERY buggy even on a system fully tested by the developers the OS was still incredible buggy using the standard Fedora Debian templates that it comes with I'm talking graphics displaying improperly freezing crashing etc I did figure out how to work around all the bugs but it was by no means a pleasant experience Very small development team If people start using this I doubt they will be able to keep up with patching exploits As we know no system is un hackable and it is mostly dependent on the end user GUI was not very well built of everything has to be done from a command line Maybe it would be awesome for someone who is a huge fan of Xen But for the average user be prepared to puke.
This trial should of been extremely highly publicized From everything that I read this makes it so that website owners can be held responsible for what their users do And yea the whole thing was rigged a mess.
Still looking two I like this forum tho nice background.
Just an FYI RedPhone and TextSecure both fill this need and are free open source and audited Grab an android burner for with these apps and you're good to go.
went with zalas approach except deposited cash in a bank via a machine so no face to face with bank person and no leaking of id to buyer only thing is banks cameras only problem there I can think of is if buyer is LE and wants to know who I am they could use the time stamp on the recpiet I had to take a screnshot of and go to the cameras of that bank around that time however that's a lot of hassle and they would have to try id me by face only put up posters.
Quote from ZergRush on June amI'm curious what everyone's problem drug is if you care to share Not necessarily right now but in your life in general the substance that has been the hardest for you to kick that's turned your life upside down the most that's threatened your life to most I'm curious because I'd also like to know how you overcame it or what you do to resist or where you are at now I'd like to share and hear others experiences so that maybe we can get tips from each other to help us overcome our problem drug or new methods for resisting Mine is opiates I am currently opiate free and have been for awhile But I had a mild to moderate addiction and it is the one drug I cannot even dabble in anymore because of the possibility that it might take over yet I still crave it regularly Mescaline LSD and mushrooms are what helped me to kick the habit and keep it away Also exercise and meditation and just keeping myself busy I love hiking and riding my bike I used to struggle with adderall had a script but that never really had a hold like opiates did I'm grateful to be passed them and hope strive to stay that way Psychedelics really just helped me to see that there is a better life other than nodding off all the time and doing nothing with my time I don't have any problem drug Thank you for sharing this experience I am happy that you overcame it Sharing love on your way.
Quote from on March pmNice addition to the garden and those are all great psychedelics Thank you I just hope an can contribute a little something to this site.
I see no one at all talking about Abraxas I like it Good uptime.
Thank you guys so much for the intrest the sports are now all but I have tabs left for sale if you guys are interested I am so happy that I can be able to spread this chemical right now I just re uped on my MDMA This MDMA is more of a cola color but still produced in the Netherlands.
Quote from DoseHeavy on November pmYou're a little late to the party DHL is already trying to capitolize on that I think we can do it better with less infrastructure We have a multisig system implemented here now in theory and all of the trusted vendors are here Why would we want to pay a market to mediate the transactions when we have the resources trustworthy vendors to mediate ourselves AFLAO crypto SRR is finishing bitwasp I asked for the amended lighthouse code be worked in so they have auction I have given all of the resources for vendors to get a vps and load whonix with AMP so you can run a storefront forum or blog If you want to do some work help wizardx get the collective moved to TOR and then we will work on a different phase of DN drugs It will go from the chemist to PGP signing for the vendors so people can tell quality and purity We were selling on the backend of the PMs on thehive so there's no reason not to update it all and make the chemists players in the scene agian so the information isn't hoarded by a few and purity of product suffers Thats what happened with the helio split I banter about OPSEC continuously and to make these changes happen everyone needs to be on the same albeit safe and secure playing field I'm going to build my idea and show you what kind of magic I'm working with If nobody wants to join it that's fine But when it comes to this sort of stuff I'm not so good at taking orders from others Working with a community on their idea But if you have any comments for how this system could be improved I'd love to here about it Not to mention there isn't any market doing this that I'm aware of My goal is to have a market with disputes because every single vendor is well trusted I was able to join DHL just be going to their site and registering And moreover you would want a market that's trusted to mediate it for you because you can rest assured that at the click of a button everything will be taken care of with no reason for concern stress or distress over anything you do on the site Based on the nature of all of the vendors being trusted and within their own circle it either all turns to shit or it's all working correctly In theory Or unless the majority of the vendors go on vacation and there's one little scrappy guy left in the corner snatching money from people But that's always a problem in any enviornment.
I just placed an order the other day via that thread pgp e mail etc Hoping to get it within a few days but CM's always been a stand up vendor Just throw the address down somewhere and get their pub key.
Not bothing with this anymore Upon reading Android wont be enough.
I considered face to face but I live in a fairly small remote town.
Honestly if I could afford it I would buy grams and grams of ALD and pass it out to EVERYONE Unfortunately the funds aren't there yet But more lucky people will be able to try this chemical When I get more ALD I will be doing this EVERY TIME sometimes it'll be only maybe Maybe people Depending on the quality that I receive Sorry it will only be for people that have not got samples from me yet I will have some for sale prices are a little high right now but when I start to get more the prices will DEFINITELY be lowered I am making VERY little what the prices that I have listed right now I try to get my product out there as cheap as possible without breaking my bank.
Nonya I tried your exercise It worked Thanks I sent you a PM.
Abraxas runs very well No issues so far with orders.
Hey guys i have a private invite into lizardlabs They are the original source of LSZ and AL LAD and have the cheapest prices on both the clearnet and darknet excluding mssource but they sell minimum orders of a gram Their prices for crystal AL LAD are USD for mg for mg for mg for mgas you can see their prices are really awesome and cheaper than anywhere else around you could buy crystal AL LAD and resell it on blotter to make a considerable profit Their prices for LSZ are more expensive because it is on tabs USD for x ug LSZ for x ug however it is still cheaper than anywhere on research blotz com agora market silk road organic synth com et cetera However I am offering this as a trade What do I ask for you to get an invite A fee of dollars in bitcoin will do or mail to me a package of one single tab of LSD perhaps or so micrograms just one single dosed tab Either that or grams of mushrooms Something small and not pricey Now wait a minute a lot of you right now are asking why you'd trust some dude who just got an account on this site like a few days ago that none of you know except for fartbomber whom i recently bought off of Here's the trade off i am willing to make because i have zero reputation as a seller of anything I will give you my side of the deal FIRST i will invite you into lizard labs and AFTER you have registered and logged in to make sure it works you can give me the payment If you decide that I don't deserve anything and don't pay I will do nothing other than feel a bit disappointed that being said however i don't want to end up giving away most invites for free so i ask that you have AT LEAST posts or AT LEAST two points of karma in order for me to give you the invite BEFORE payment this is to prevent just any troll making an account and talking friendly in order to get a free invite and then ditching payment let me know if you guys are interested or just bored thanks.

This is the th time of rechecking the PGP certificate I cannot trust nor verify their PGP key it keeps stating their key is expired Devs have been notified but no action has been taken feel free to notify em this has been going on for way to long only method of integrity check atm is to multiple checksum using rarely used checksums along with our standards.
UPDATE IN ORIGINAL POST.
Just did.
Check out reddit in the dnm's thread there is a warning up now I use AB on occasion although everything is encrypted so I am not worried Treat everyone asif they could be LE and you will be fineedit in terms of an AB exit scam I feel like its inevitable What are the other possible conclusions to the AB story It wont last forever so do they scam or do they bow out gracefully and give all vendors and users their money I would hope to say option but they really dont seem like the kind of group to do that my tip always keep your coin in cold storage offline no matter what even if it takes mins to process each transaction take your coins with you when you leave.
Omg this is some high level phishing x.
IDK Agora is target by the FBI and other LE A safe person I guess would stay off the markets entirely and see how things play out I just think it's kind of strange that none of the other markets are going down right now as well If its a TOR problem then none of them are safe I saw someone post some link about some vulnerability that was found about a month ago This is definitely horrible news IDK if we will ever see agora up and running again I haven't received my withdraw yet nor has the majority of people Now the site is down For those brave enough to go to another market I would used each one of those before during agora downtime with success Why can't things just run smoothly I only got into these darknetmarkets about months ago and it's been nothing but chaos and bad news I guess that comes with the terroitory I'll be pressing on myself Direct deals only though for now.
Nuclues market seems my favorite.
So I'm new to this whole thing amd still trying to figure this out I have a few questions I hope someone will take the time to answer First what exactly is pgp I know it's an encryption key or something How do I find out mine How do I use this to encrypt an email And is there anything else I need to know to order from vendors Most want you to use the key to send them an email but honestly I'm lost if someone could help that would be great thank.
I'm really starting to dig DHL They may not have many vendors but I only really purchase LSD and MDMA and my two new favorite vendors for both substances are there JoR and Vitamin E They have a lot of escrow listings and only takes confirmations for deposits which is nice Abraxas is good too plenty of vendors nice setup never had a problem there.
Seems like a pretty bad time to be depositing coin to Agora even when they come online for hours and it seems issues have been solved it seems like a big tease everyone who can't wait to get back on and get shit done and hasn't been scared off yet is like Hope it stays up Oh What's that It's staying up seemingly Oh wait nevermind fuck Fuck fuck fuck At this point I think it would be ambitious to get too comfortable even if it goes consecutive days with uptime oh and I'm not mocking the OP I've fallen into the semi comfort of a little bit of responsive uptime a bit too easily too.
Tails stands for The Amnesiac Incognito Live System Tails is a live system that aims at preserving your privacy and anonymity It helps you to use the Internet anonymously almost anywhere you go and on any computer but leave no trace using unless you ask it explicitly It is a complete operating system designed to be used from a DVD or a USB stick independently of the computer's original operating system It is free software and based on Debian GNU Linux Tails comes with several built in applications pre configured with security in mind web browser instant messaging client email client office suite image and sound editor etc Tails relies on the Tor anonymity network to protect your privacy online the pre installed software is configured to connect through Tor and direct non anonymous connections are blocked Tails is being constantly updated for security flaws you WILL need to do this all over again soon to stay safe This comes from the Tails website It's very important to keep your version of Tails up to date otherwise your system will be vulnerable to numerous security holes The development team is doing its best to release new versions fixing known security holes on a regular basis You will need x GB USB thumb drives GB may pass they are very cheap and available almost everywhere Download the latest version of the Tails iso file from here remember where you save it If you are an advanced user you can download the cryptographic signature on this same page and then verify the download with the Tails key from here Download the latest version of the Linux Universal USB Installer from here Run the newly downloaded Universal USB Installer a Read and 'agree to' the disclaimer b Select Tails from the first drop down list it's towards the end of the list step c Browse to and select the Tails iso file step d Select your USB drive letter format the drive if its not empty already step e Click 'Create' button then wait for it to finish Will be a few minutes at least Restart the computer and boot into Tails from the USB drive see below for details on Booting from a USB drive Booting from a USB drive If it does not automatically boot to the USB drive you need to select the boot order some newer computers will allow you to select which drive to boot to with a small menu without changing BIOS settings You might instead need to edit the BIOS settings restart your computer and watch for a message telling you which key to press to enter the BIOS setup It will usually be one of F F DEL ESC or F Press this key while your computer is booting to edit your BIOS settings You need to edit the Boot Order Depending on your computer you should see an entry for 'removable drive' or 'USB media' Move this to the top of the list to force the computer to attempt to boot from USB before booting from the hard disk Save your changes and continue Many Flash Drives ship USB FDD formatted and some systems will not detect or even boot USB FDD Most systems can however boot USB ZIP and or USB HDD If you are having a hard time getting your BIOS to detect your flash drive you can try to format it as USB HDD or USB ZIP using the BOOTICE program or similar Caution this is a very advanced program Use with caution follow links for the latest version more detailed instruction on how to boot from USB you can read you have problems accessing the BIOS read this other questions ask away or PM I will not accept donations for this tutorial I offer this only in hope that more people will start using Tor If you have excess bitcoins you feel like donating to a worthy cause please send them to Tor or Tails up Installing a Persistent Volume alongside a LiveUSB copy of Tails this is why you need TWO USB drives You should now be presented with a log in prompt for a temporary session administration password this is reset every time you load Tails it is optional to enter this it is used to allow current session access to system functions if you get any errors about access rights try using an admin password at log in Also at this point you can optionally select to use a Windows XP camo 'skin' to make Tails look more like XP if you're in a public place for example this is also optional Once Tails is up and running insert the second USB drive Click the 'Applications Accessories' menu then highlight 'Tails' then click 'Tails USB Installer' a Click the st option Clone Install b Select your target device from the drop down menu your second USB drive c Click 'Next' then wait for it to finish however long to copy about gb to a USB drive usually a few minutes This will install a new copy of Tails onto your second USB drive this will be your new proper Tails USB Shutdown this session of Tails with the Power Button up in the right hand corner Don't forget to take out the FIRST USB you created and BOOT INTO THE NEW SECOND TAILS USB You can format the first USB drive later on that copy of tails is no longer required Log in to the new Tails USB once logged in click the 'Applications' menu then highlight the 'System Tools' sub menu then click on Configure Persistent Volume The size of the persistent volume is automatically determined by how much left over space is on the USB drive after installing Tails in the previous steps a Choose your pass phrase for the persistent volume you will need to enter this every time you login to Tails The persistent volume is an encrypted partition protected by a pass phrase Once the persistent volume is created you can choose to activate it or not each time you start Tails It is a good place to store sensitive materials When choosing your pass phrase remember that short easily guessed pass phrases are very easily cracked it would take one Intel I k CPU over YEARS to brute force crack an AES encrypted random character pass phrase using lowercase UPPERCASE p c characters b Click Create and wait for it to finish c On completion a window will popup allowing you to select what Tails will save in the new persistent volume automatically internet shortcuts PGP keys nudie pictures application settings etc I recommend selecting everything Close and reboot with your modem plugged in and switched on log back into Tails with your new persistent volume Make sure your modem is plugged in and turned ON Click the 'System' menu then highlight the 'Preferences' submenu then click on 'Network Connections' Now only YOU know what type of internet connection you pay for I cannot help you with that My personal internet connection was amazingly simple to setup I was quite surprised by its pre configured setups it has many different countries options for local telcos pre installed Another note Tails is PRE CONFIGURED to go through Tor It is pre installed with Vidalia and a Torified browser called 'IceWeasel' It SHOULD automatically open up when connected to the internet If not Use the 'IceWeasel' browser menu shortcut to get onto the Road Also this operating system is NOT persistent for security measures meaning that any changes you make that are not saved in the persistent volume will not be saved on restarting Tails You are now finished Feel free to click through all the menus and play with the applications.
Abraxis has been working fine for me.
I saw a post a bit ago about how all the big sites have been getting DDoSd pretty hard lately And then agora is getting the evolution 'refugees' too so i can believe that theyre not planning on going out of business any time soon oh also i was able to log in today its off and on.
Just a heads up you dont need an invite Just leave the invite code box blank and it creates an account for you Dont mean to step on OP's toes for getting some free shrooms or acid but it doesnt seem fair asking to be paid for something that is free anyway.
ACAS has too many bugs imo I tried out the market and error pages kept cropping u.
Buy a PC laptop from craigslist your local recycler etc.
Thanks for adding Hansa.
all VPNs and Proxys will do is hide the fact from your service provider that you use Tor If you aren't concerned about anyone finding out you use Tor then you'll be fine.
i always use grams when i'm looking to find a particular product but then stick with a vendor once i've found someone reliable it is a great service and the helix mixer is also nice though the consolidation of dark net services in one place seems a little risky from an opsec perspective requires a fair bit of faith in those in charge their customer service is also great so if you need to edit your pgp information as a vendor and have both keys available for verification i'm sure they'll work with you to fix your profile good luck.
anyone else not able to get on agora right now Cheers S.
Quote from on February pmThe friendly admins have enabled the feature that allows us to opt out of appearing online when we are To do this Go to Profile Account Settings then uncheck the option that shows people you are online EVERYONE DO THIS Here's some food for thought on why QuoteThis is because of all those FBI probability attacks They monitor when you activate tor when you log into sites like say this site if it is ever compromised or safe mail which announces to everybody when you are online and then present this incourt and it's apparently solid evidence because plenty of people like Jeremony Hammond of LulzSec fame got convicted through simple meta data this guy appeared on IRC at this time we monitoredhis wifi signal yes they can pinpoint your wifi signal if under surveillance and he was using tor exactly the same time That's all it takes Looks like the topic where you get this  should be pretty interesting and full of information Can you paste the link Tks for the tip.
Ive been using oasis regularly now it works amazin.
Quote from Alberthoffman on March pmHelloWhat so you have your money in your wallet me and my friends wallets are competly empy i can clearly se how some one transfered my bitcoints from agora to another wallet on blockchain That's the internal mixer bud It's importnat to know how things work before making statuses that could cause hysteria SCIdm.
Did you find out which iOS app is a pg.
Agora seems to be down Cheers S.
I can also vouch for Oasis market I have only been open on Oasis for a couple weeks now but its very user friendly for both buyers and vendors and so far I have no complaints everything has been smooth sailing lol Much Love Family.
Another option is to use a service like purse io You trade your bitcoins to a person who uses their money to buy you something from Amazon You get the privacy benefits plus a discount on items because people are willing to pay a premium for BTC I've never tried it but it's something to look into.
thanks everybodyi start to learn a little nowto MirrorMirror thank you for answer that is safe enough without more specific layer of security will be ok sure it's not for big purchases or sellingmy next step will be about crack wifi access point change mac and use itmust be even more safe i can immagine people using mobile burning phone for dnmthank you to al.
Guys I am ao fukcking sorry The screen broke on my laptop I didn't run I rpromise you this Let me catch up on everything that I missed I can't begin to tell you how sorry I am about this.
thanks I know vendors do when they withdraw But I am wondering if a marketplace wallet is known to be a market when shown in the blockchain or does it look like a normal coin wallet seems like a lot of money spent on tumbling if I tumble my coins before sending to a market and then the vendor tumbles again when they withdraw But safety first just want some clarification on this matter.
Only shipping to continental USA to begin We are technically shipping a small amount of hazardous material as the test itself contains some liquid I personally hope we can one day ship world wide It will take some more finesse at that point as we want to be sure to sell these at the lowest cost possible without going in the negative With world wide shipping this becomes more complicated We are also going to limit item per customer per days We feared not doing this may open the possibility of vendors purchasing a majority of them and we also want to reach as many people as possible to make hopefully save someone from being put in a possible dangerous situation We will be putting them up once I have followed the moderators rules here We are running into many roadblocks with rules on other markets so bare with us for a few days we want to ensure we don't break and rules and can help as many people as possible all the while being a good member of the community On a personal matter this is something that is very important to us and something that is very important to me I have a huge sense of community and have also seen first hand what can happen when someone falls to the victim of greed For the time being these chemicals are NOT made in a clean Pfizer lab They are often made in sheds barns sewers and god knows where by god knows who with god knows what materials All this with the intention to get rich by any means necessary If taking a few hours a week out of my week to help people experiencing their own conscious a little safer that is better than any drug I will ever experience Stay safe Guardia.

I haven't been able to login to nucleus all day I can't even get the start screen Anyone else have a problem with it.
I just spoke to a vendor I like to use he said its the site having trouble not an exit scam hopefully this puts minds at ease a littl.
I tried it out when it was first created The taint analysis left much to be desired over traditional tumblers I use helix light from the grams website and have never had any issues.
Anytime we are here to help.
Do you have tails on usb if so I'd just start over with the application on tails OS generate a new public key post it here and we can try and send you a message not sure what you mean by you ''can't decrypt message to other people'' If your refering to you cant decrypt a message your sending to someone else that's correct once you encrypt that message with their public key they're the only one who can decrypt it.

Quote from throwaway account on April amWell Evolution Abraxas and Middle Earth were not run by carders as far as we know but they exit scammed AB is the biggest market right now and everyone who got phished is complaining maybe there are some real problems and bugs going on but I don't see any other market who constantly improve things in favor of their customers They improved their security and always adding features What I see is other markets constantly bashing AB to get bad reputation And I think they won't exit scam just because they're carders They need the community they created I'll correct you real quick Evolution was known to be run by carders Middle Earth and Abraxas we have no idea as to what sort of nefarious characters ran those BOth of which burned me a combined k BUThey Thats what you get as part of operating in the space It's in the nature of the elements.
TMG doesn't use SSL it seems so they're unaffected Not sure which if any darknet sites do use SSL but I imagine it'd be a huge hassle You could self sign but that would alarm so many people when their browsers start yelling at them about it and I imagine it'd be hard to get one signed for an onion domain from the various CA's out there.
Next best markets are the following no specific order they are about equal to one another.
Quote from Summa Iru on April amYou just made a thread in the best market you're already there here As far as psychedelics everything you could want is here and in my opinion psychedelics are the only 'drugs' worth pursuingWell put Cannot agree more.
So far Abraxas has been so smooth and there's a good amount of vendors setting up shop there AlphaBay has been fucking shit for the past couple of weeks don't know what's up there besides the influx of traffic from this week I am trying to verify some vendors on Abraxas currently but they seem to not check messages often.

Quote from JustMe on September pmShort and simplified answer Because it is not end to end encrypted when somebody catches your traffic everyone hosting an exit node can catch that LE hosts some exit nodes for that purpose you are fucked you just gave away your address and time of arrival PM me if you want me to link you to some good safety stuff I would strongly advise you to do so I wouldn't mind seeing that link as I am new to this stuff and don't want to fuck up Where do you guys usually get your packages sent if not you own place.
for now it seems not possible to register new useraccounts full speed maybe if someone has usefull register links would be much appreciated Stay safe fre.
I did a grams search and the only NZ vendor I saw was thunderjew on Nucleus.
Reasons for not using Abraxas in that scenario When using Albion's shop you only need to trust him whereas when using Abraxas the admins could run away with your funds in escrow Or even if you finalize early they could run away with the funds in Albion's wallet before he has time to withdraw them And IMO Albion is trustworthy Plus I think you don't need to create an account to use his shop A working PGP GPG identity is all you need if it works like gammagoblin's shop Finally there are no fees if a trade is made directly with Albion on his shop I think Abraxas takes a commission on every transaction.
Would just like to make a shout out to Within a couple of days of registering I ran into him and we arranged something Curteous prompt and to the point Lovely fellow great deal Will review when the tabs come around.
You're a little late to the party DHL is already trying to capitolize on that I think we can do it better with less infrastructure We have a multisig system implemented here now in theory and all of the trusted vendors are here Why would we want to pay a market to mediate the transactions when we have the resources trustworthy vendors to mediate ourselves AFLAO crypto SRR is finishing bitwasp I asked for the amended lighthouse code be worked in so they have auction I have given all of the resources for vendors to get a vps and load whonix with AMP so you can run a storefront forum or blog If you want to do some work help wizardx get the collective moved to TOR and then we will work on a different phase of DN drugs It will go from the chemist to PGP signing for the vendors so people can tell quality and purity We were selling on the backend of the PMs on thehive so there's no reason not to update it all and make the chemists players in the scene agian so the information isn't hoarded by a few and purity of product suffers Thats what happened with the helio split I banter about OPSEC continuously and to make these changes happen everyone needs to be on the same albeit safe and secure playing field.
It would do well to become a market things look very comfortable here.
Quote from Salamander on June pm You can sort of look at it as a place that you can come to discuss products vendors and other markets or anything else really Hell a lot of vendors out there are on here daily It is a place where you can meet those vendors and their costumers and chat with them so that when you do decide to order you can order in confidence knowing that they have been vetted through the community This place really is magesticVery well said plus it seems like all the best deals float around here and unmatched generosity and love Its nice being able to talk with the best vendors of multiple markets.
bumpcan anyone help me with this Or at least point me in the right direction on who where i should ask this.
Agora is fine atm.
ok so I'm sure some of you are questioning the credibility of their message so what is the fear that the site is taken over by LEO Well since there is no way to prove or discern that what would make one decide to leave AG It would seem foolish to leave AG for some other market that possibly could also be run by LEO on speculations alone Their message seems legit like they really have the best interests in mind Personally I believe if a website was being overtaken by LEO there would be no announcements Things would just appear to be run as normal Being the Devils' advocate I don't think I'd want to create disinterest rouse suspicion or otherwise affect the sentiments or trust of the user base I'd want to stealthily investigate and takeactions as needed Meh I'm sure allot of these markets are sponsored by LEO They are getting their drugs on the markets too But Really The War on Drugs is effectively over even if not in law there is just no way to stop people and transacting They might try to nab people who resell IRL and will certainly succeed in many cases but that's not going to stop the continual flow.
There is no exact way to answer this question except that your concerns are valid It's very possible for a vendor to be LE It's also possible than inexperienced vendors keep more detailed records of your private info than they should This being said it's also possible that experienced vendors are making mistakes they should be avoiding You should probably assume your identity is compromised and wipe everything change addresses change PGP change username Sticking with vendors others have reported success isn't but it's definitely a worthwhile precaution in this environment.
chances are it will be okay but i understand it is a horrible feeling to think that someone has personal info on you and you don't know what's going to happen its that period of waiting for the letter that can be so stressful the biggest thing really is to get a drop address that isn't connected with you and so can never link your address with your internet activity Live and learn hope everything turns out okay.

Quote from on March amThis will be my last post in this thread and I am opting out of the sample or any future purchases BombHeadie has been communicative with me before and after his computer issues but the entire experience was a little nerve racking as to why a domestic package would take days Anyways BH has taken responsibility that he believes he did not send my package and has offered to make it up to me which is a very kind gesture All that being said I'm just going to move on myself and encourage the community to make their own decisions There can be new vendor blues and would expect some to give him a second chance and there will be others who say they don't want to risk anything ever the call is yours Thanks to everyone else who has been posting publicly on this topic as it helped raise an issue to the community and glad the problems appears to be packs not ever being sent rather then interceptions or CDs I do appreciate you Bomeheadie taking responsibility for the not sent packs and surely expect you have learned some valuable lessons from all of this Good luck to you in your future endeavors Thanks for this update from both you and Bombheadie Gives more confidence that this is simply a case of a new vendor getting their feet wet I'll look forward to dealing with bombheadie if he gets a good track record going.
there is not such thing as a we love avengers marketplaceis just a lame attempt to scam phish and or tarnish LSD avengers reputation nothing to see here keep walkin.
Quote from dolmio on April ami dont see why buyers have to fear about this Because LE would try to match the timing of you being online and your TOR or VPN activity NOT But some paranoia is healthy it doesn't hurt I guess But I like to live dangerously so fuck it.

I'm going to take the post minimum off of this I believe that everyone should try this beautiful chemical The only thing that I will REQUIRE IS THAT YOU WRITE A TRIP REPORT OF YOUR EXPERIENCE If you guys like this chemical like I'm sure you will I'm going to be purchasing bulk on ALD and pass ALOT of it out to members on this board But like I said times I REQUIRE a trip report on this page on how you like this beautiful chemical LOVE you TMGers B.
Yeah that's from the recent ACMD report which proposed a ban although it hasn't taken into effect yet LizardLabs wrote hopes this stock will last until the ban of his newest AL LAD batch so hopefully the ban won't be too soon Sadly lizardlabs does not ship to the USA.
Quote from love is all around us on February pmIs there a particular reason your ALD blotter is nearly double the price of blotter and nearly x the price of lowest tier bulk at SI I get you've got expenses time put into laying your own gear but geez SI just recently lowered their prices for ALD I did not buy alot of it so my prices were pretty high buying it when I decided to do so Remember these are EURO prices and not USD ALOT of people don't have access to SI Also most people don't like ordering illegal chemicals over seas It has to do with the risk also plus the the multiple hours I have spend learning how to keep it as ALD and have it not hydrolyze into LSD Plus the prices are not that much higher than than what they charge Most of it will be sold around town as it is but me offering it on here was just something that was spur of the moment in case people would like to try ALD since there are VERY FEW people around that are offering it at this time.
Quote from Cidkid on July pmhas anyone tried these blotters from john any feedback on the quality I can vouch for them Took tabs of the ug Bear's Love last night and was blown away John claims they're overlaid by at least so I had approximately ug The visuals and introspection were crazy I highly recommend them especially at only bucks a tab.

I was going to order mushrooms from them on Alphabay and started running into all kinds of negative reviews I figure I would find the opposite since they require FE but now that I read this post I'm staying away from them Thank you for spreading the word.
Quote from xncsux on March pm That's odd I wonder why I received my sample L LNo idea Maybe the pack was actually sent later than BH told me and it will show up in a day or so Curious to see if BH can update the group since he made a quick appearance yesterday and can let everyone publicly know what is going on and if everything was truly sent or not.
To create a persistent volume you must boot from CD DVD or USB After that even if you booted from a USB drive you have to create a new USB drive by using the Tails installer and install by cloning This new USB drive will allow you to configure a persistent volume.
What are Lizardlabs exactly.

On the streets I used an old android phone with no service and only messaged people using internet messaging services twitter kik ect And I wouldn't even talk business on it I'd just ask someone to meet up and we'll talk then.
accessing darknet via iPhone simply makes no sens.
I do believe that they will be back but it won't be for weeks.
Thanks.
Just a heads up if mixed coins are available almost instantly it's not a good sign as you might be prone to timing attacks That's why it's good to always add some random time delay if a mixer offers such option.
electrum already uses change addresses which makes it harder to be tracked back to your wallet Nothing is safe.
Quote from Rasputin on June pmWell in my case it had nothing to do with Agora deposits it was because ME marketplace had locked my funds preventing withdrawl because I broke a rule by withdrawing my funds without making a purchase Although they were very quick in releasing them once i'd explained the situation but it makes me wary of depositing BTC there again really i have moved funds btc in and out of agora since they opend up no problems why is this the first time i have heard about this Cheers Dolmi.

will you be shipping worldwide.
Bitblender is a good one however they were hacked a while ago so still proceed with caution I'm suprised Helix wasn't mentioned here Another good way to mix coins is to buy Alt coins then trade with other alts then convert to bitcoin Best be SURE of your exchange rates though don't want to screw yourself.
Once the NSA and their buddies release all the backdoors and ways they track your activity online then you'll be able to delete everything incriminating w o nuking the whole drive Until then this is the only way to be sure.

Quote from vitaminLSD on June amTails is not secure for serious DNM activities and here's the first reason why USA Feds have already conducted Tor attacks that have landed significant DNM figures behind bars the above article has more details about how the Feds did it and who they have arrested so far a former Silk Road lieutenant for starters Also Tor bridges are practically useless for hiding from the NSA because the NSA harvests the tor bridge addresses from the emails send to from the Tor Project the NSA knows you're using Tor anyways if you're using a Tor bridge Tor bridges were designed for people in repressive third world countries not US citizens hiding from the NSA It also gets worse and this is information that every DNM user serious or small should know about but since the Edward Snowden leaks the NSA has talked about if not bragged that they have timing attacks for de anonymizing Tor users what does this breach have to do with Tails Isn't it just a live version of Linux Is it because it's not designed to be used with a VPN and that VPNs are the safest way to access Tor I'm not disputing what you're saying I just don't understand it Thanks.
Is there any market place online right now I've tried a few and had no luck with any of them what's going on I'd be glad for some input Cheers Freddi.
Looks like you've been keeping yourself busy I applaud you on your efforts to make the darknet a better place I don't really have any tech skills but I would love to help you if there is anything a non tech savy person can contribute.
Time will tell if this is scare tactics or not But I would assume that they are too busy to prosecute everyone whose address is available to them I don't see neither why buyers don't use PGP nor why many vendors still use keys they seem to have created years ago If you read a few threads for newcomers you can acquire all the knowledge you need.
So I buy it from local with cash or someone else pays non cash for another one he sends it from local to helix and then from helix to market sure thats enough or helix to another helix what if cash its not optional give me some couple of a to c options thank.
So let me get this straight i pay for using this market the vendor pays Vendor adds to his product and the buyer ends up paying more in the end i like what i have trusted vendor great prices and no hassle But hey to each their own good luck.

Quote from ultrabear on December amI for one love the idea Sterling but do not see the issue with some type of small fee to help cover operational expenses on your end Please keep me updated on your progress as I am extremely interested in your concept Thank you I will I'm trying to negotiate a deal with a vendor for free LSD anually to run the service I know I could make a lot more by taxing transactions but that's not what I'm about I'm a firm believer that more money leads to more problems Don't get me wrong I love money But I'd have to deal with laundering it getting it in the first place which would require more time just stuff I don't care for I make a good living and this type of merchant system is very easy to create All of the extra stuff are the challenge But I'm only interesting in helping people out I sincerally believe that anyone that wants LSD other drugs used sparingly should have access too them to free their mind and to not only help themselves but help others If I can provide a community to peolple that will offer that That's money in and of itself for me Plus I'll habe a reliable market to buy LSD on But Hopefully this vendor I'm in contact with will be interested in purchasing it I have him in mins for the top vendor so he'll probably get the source regardless Just with LSD I will offer more I'll see how it goes lol Either way I'm developing it though Quote from on December amWow so much thought went into this but working directly with vendors whom have proven themselves This system is hard to beat I send coin they send product simple i will never join an open market againThank you for your feedback Mod That's the idea A community based on human principle trust And that is exactly what I'm aiming for An entire community of completely trusted vendors of which vendors have the ability to ban if it comes down too it You can almost gurantee that so long as you're a good customer and don't lie cheat or steal that you'll have an entire community of people such as yourselves Also harder for LE to penetrate with typical social engineering.
Quote from DRBT on April pmI just spoke to a vendor I like to use he said its the site having trouble not an exit scam hopefully this puts minds at ease a littleI hope that's true Nucleus seemed to be a very well run site and it would suck for everyone to lose their wallet escrow coin due to it never coming back.

Tech Specs UpdateWhile writing and designing I've came up will the following new additions that will make this new market extremely difficult to take down and give a fresh breath of confidence to the DarkNet Marketplace Users will no longer have to fret about Bitcoins being locked into a marketplace if they choose to use mine Internal X CA and SpooferI've developed my own spoofer and my system stores every single bit of data using a kB X Certificate to spoof every single last detail Plain text isn't stored anywhere and no CPU power is saved when it comes to encryption Even if it's a simple Hello WalletMy website is going to use an auto generated BitChain wallet and provide backup abilities Your funds won't ever be dependent on my system Simply download the wallup backup directly relayed through TOR too you via BitChain If my site goes down simply do your thing and log into the wallet using your backup The wallet will also be completely accesable through my website All it will do is connect to BitChain to determine balance etc No funds will be stored on my site Auto migrationThe server will automatically put up special text in specific areas to indicate time When timer goes off the website will peridiocally shut down for a period of hours and transfer to an entirely new server again to thwart LE This will happen as desired or x per week Databases won't migrate as often due to their security in design Maybe per week and imagining the size of the database as it grows While a migration is in place users will be able to use the Direct Trade information posted by vendors if they do so post it During so you may log into your system wallet via BitChain and send your BTC to the wallet address that you have In doing so the description and the text will show up The vendor will have the ability on system restart to archive the order and thus enter it into the system thus depleting stock etc Purchase will continue to process as if it was purely done in the system.
where i live u can buy them straight at pay points type in your wallet address and insert cash and voil Pretty simple ain't the same over there LBC has just the best prices and the biggest headaches.
Looked at it no links work no products shi.
ccleaner and bleachbit a must.
Currently i am connecting to the darknet via tails tor bridges i feel as this is not a very safe unless i am wrong Anyone have any advice on additional security measures to protect my real IP I get bulk so safety is a big concern to me let me know if my lack of faith in bridges is invalid though.
What an amazing discussion After reading everyone's posts I thought I would mention something that may have been overlooked Here's a disclaimer I'm sure everyone at Mullvad are spot on in what they believe in when it comes to privacy and with what they're trying to accomplish at Mullvad and I am in no way doubting that at all I'm only looking to disseminate information and perhaps my humble opinions Sweden is one of the Eyes and Mullvad being a Swedish company with their home servers located in Sweden operates in the Land of the Eyes and I've always stayed away from ALL VPN providers that operate out of any of the Eyes countries Whether they have a strong association or a weak alliance with the American NSA countries that make up the Eyes are NOT privacy friendly and I would only use VPN services and VPN servers located outside of the Land of the Eyes Here's something about the Eyes for those who might be interested.
Yeah like June s.
hello all i've heard some whispers of a market that's more geared toward strictly psychedelics stocking a little bit more obscure of the chemicals along the lines of HO MiPT HO HiPT etc a partner i are looking to complete the PiHKAL TiHKAL list as well as explore different level geometries any help would be greatly appreciated.
I will say that his packaging was decent but the outside of the envelope was extremely amateur Handwritten by what appeared to be by an adolescent and also took the customers last name and made a fake name as the return address I would be hesitant to order again due to that reason alone.
Hi Altcoin means alternative coin yes it is a different electronic currency So Cloakcoin for example is a different thing than Bitcoin The concept and way of working are the same except for the anonymity technics but these coins are not compatible So no you can't transfert Bitcoin to a Cloakcoin or Monero wallet To get Cloakcoin or an alternative currency you can buy directly the altcoin for CLOAK for example and ask the shop to send the CLOAK to a receiving address given by the CLOAK wallet installed on your computer Or you can exchange Bitcoins into Cloakcoins on a free Bittrex account You create an account you send Bitcoins to your online Bittrex account and then you buy Cloakcoins or any other altcoin listed on Bittrex with your BTC Then you can leave your CLOAK on your CLOAK Bittrex online wallet or ask Bittrex to send the Cloakcoins to your home computer desktop CLOAK wallet Bittrex and other exchanges seems difficult to use because of many infos graphs and numbers on the screen but not it's really easy don't be afraid CLOAK is the official shortened name of Cloakcoin as BTC is for Bitcoin or XMR for Monero For information today CLOAK is at a historical very low price good time to buy CLOAK costs BTC This past few months the CLOAK price was in average BTC for CLOAK So you can buy now and resell later on Bittrex even if you don't use your CLOAK for anything else it should be an easy way to make money because the price of a CLOAK is going to rise again It was mid March About Monero XMR the price is now BTC for XMR the average price last few months was BTC and it was BTC end March I hope I helped Don't hesitate to ask newbie question on Monero are some really bad guys but most are very nice people who are going to kindly help you Ask kind and nicely.
If you have any doubts I say go ahead and tumble a percent fee is worth peace of mind.

Quote from tm on August amI've seen more clearnet sites that sell trypamines than I have on DNMs You can find al ist of vendor shops on reddit All depends on where you live of course i live in good ol' 'murica and i'm just a little sketched out about ordering thru the clearnet especially not that it really matters i guess i'm getting other international packages with hella drugs in them anyway q.
I thought only TMA and TMA were sched I could definitely be wrong about that though The vendor I saw stocking these was European and doesn't ship to the US unfortunately Apparently it's a Chinese lab making them I'm sure you could get them shipped from there They don't give a shit about our laws just getting our money.

Quote from gardener on June pmKeep in mind that Tails comes with a firewall set up to allow only tor traffic You will have to set this up manually if you decide to maintain your own Ubuntu system Tails is amnesiac and can be run from a DVD that way you are sure that when you boot your system you start a clean system as long as your original Tails iso is safe and trustworthy This type of behavior isn't desirable on Ubuntu since you want to keep your packages updated as soon as there's security updates Firefox patches for security updates for any clearnet web browsing you may do over your VPN etc and these firewall rules wouldn't allow Ubuntu to check for security updates Plus unless you configured your iptables firewall just right your VPN couldn't connect either If you are ultra paranoid you can actually replicate the amnesiac ness of Tails like this You can basically install Ubuntu in a VM update all packages tweak everything just the way you like it plus if you're going to run a double VPN get your certs or your Mullvad client etc set up now harden Firefox for any clearnet web browsing harden your Tor Browser for any clearnet web browsing but don't visit any sites on either of these yet Then take a snapshot Now a would be attacker has a near zero attack surface against your Tor Browser or Firefox unless they had a zero day exploit for it With turning JavaScript off in Tor Browser this pretty much eliminates of their attack surface and if you have good web hygiene with NoScript in Firefox and also have Flash disabled this also eliminates most of a would be attacker's attack surface Now the best part is that you can revert to your snapshot every time you close your VM Whenever there are any security updates for Ubuntu Firefox or Tor Browser install your updates without visiting any other websites while the update is installing then take a new VM snapshot after the update is done You now have what's basically an amnesiac system that reverts to a clean and secure state every time you start it Bookmarks are a pain in the ass doing things this way but if you are crafty you can export your bookmarks to a VM folder share then when you start your VM again to your most recent snapshot you can import your bookmarks and snapshot it again It would be incredibly difficult for the feds to compromise your VM this way even with a zero day drive by download exploit against Firefox on Ubuntu or Tor Browser Since you would just revert to a fresh start again the next time you started your VM Quote from gardener on June pmA VPN will hide the fact that you use TOR from your ISP don't expect any more protection If the cops want to get you they will get you Wanna be sure you won't do the time Don't do the crime I completely disagree that the cops can get you if you use a good VPN The Mullvad servers in Sweden are some of the most hardened commercial VPN servers in the world VPNs not to use include are HideMyAss that comes first to mind They collect logs and say this up front in their Log Policy and they gave the feds logs that got a LulzSec member arrested to use well lets just talk about Mullvad for a minute Mullvad is run by some of the most badass computer security professionals in the entire VPN industry Back when the Heartbleed vulnerability was publicly disclosed in April of one of the Mullvad co founders was one of the first people to set up a test OpenVPN server successfully steal the SSL private keys from it also patched their VPN servers as soon as the OpenSSL patches for Heartbleed were out The are headquartered in Sweden and are under no obligation to any gag orders or court orders to the United States Government to reveal any information about their users In fact Mullvad has actually gotten user information requests before and here is how they responded taken from Quote Interviewer What steps are taken when a valid court order requires your company to identify an active user of your service Has this ever happened Quote Mullvad We get requests from governments from time to time They never get any information about our users We make sure not to store sensitive information that can be tied to publicly available information so that we have nothing to give out We believe it is not possible in Swedish law to construct a court order that would compel us to actually give out information about our users Not that we would anyway We started this service for political reasons and would rather discontinue it than having it work against its purpose Not only do they not keep logs but it's probably not possible under Swedish law for them to be court ordered to turn over information about users And they don't keep logs or any personally identifiable information anyways your account ID is literally a numeric ID and that's it there isn't even any place to give an email address when you sign up And what they mean by we would rather discontinue it than having it work against its purpose is that they'd rather pull a Lavabit if they were ever going to be legally forced to decrypt traffic or turn over user information Lavabit was Edward Snowden's personal email provider They were based in the USA and a USA court ordered them to turn over their SSL private keys so that the government could decrypt SSL TLS traffic to the Lavabit servers and the Lavabit owner decided to shut down the entire service rather than comply The Mullvad Sweden servers would almost certainly be the most secure ones since they are in Mullvad's home country and when the Mullvad writer here is referring to servers they've assembled and configured themselves and that are in data centers with ambitious physical security this would almost certainly include the Sweden one Quote Interviewer Do you have physical control over your VPN servers and network or are they outsourced and hosted by a third party if so which ones Where are your servers located Quote Mullvad We have a range of servers From on one end servers lovingly assembled and configured by us with ambitious physical security in data centers owned and operated by people we trust personally and whose ideology we like On the other end rented hardware in big data centers Which to use depends on the threat model and performance requirements Currently we have servers hosted by GleSYS Internet Services Services and Leaseweb in Sweden the Netherlands USA and Germany They are very clear about their no logging policy and say this up front can also pay them in Bitcoins They even accept cash in the mail And possibly one of the best parts why Mullvad is x superior to any other VPN provider for Linux is because Mullvad has its own client for Ubuntu Debian that has a kill switch built in to it So with this kill switch if your VPN connection ever drops the Mullvad client stops all network traffic For DNM ops you absolutely do not want your Tor traffic leaking out if your VPN ever drops and the Mullvad client prevents this information leakage from happening Gleeful You'll still want your VPN besides just Tor Browser on Ubuntu so to install Mullvad find the Linux download on the Mullvad website under the downloads page at and install it with Quotesudo dpkg i mullvad all deb Then install the dependencies with Quotesudo apt get f installNow you can run either mullvad from the command line or easier yet find the GUI icon pin it to your Ubuntu taskbar and you can run it in one click from there now Just installing the client gives you a hour trial period to test it with if you want to play with it first.
I'd say there's a big question mark here at this point proceed with caution.
According to a report in archiv ihned cz The owner of Sheep Marketplace Thomas Ji ikovsk who was responsible to one the biggest exit scam in Dark net history of around M at the time when the Bitcoin value was extremely high was arrest for money laundering after purchasing a luxury house and trying to launder the stolen money after converting it from BTC using fake companies and transferring it to his girlfriend account Link to the story below Warning Clearnet.
Quote from DoseHeavy on November pmYou should look at a modded version of AFLAO bitwasp It will save you a lot of time All you are doing by the vendor anonyminity is creating extra scripting to be hacked Make sure you have it all locked down If not you will have to trust in people to refund Its not just a payment code with a ledger created for an escrow account and then dropped in real addresses Anonymous listings lead to a whole vacuum for scams Are you logging the anonyminity to the vendor so when a scam occurs there is a way to locate the scammer Yes their will be internal data logging Disputes are still able to be made and messages sent to from vendors through the product page there will be a spot to ask questions No identiy from vendor will be shown unless question is answered This allows vendors the ability to conceal themselves should a user that's been suggested as LE somehow gets in and hasn't yet been banned will still display vendor names The anonymity for the vendor buying would only be for the listings Once a question is asked on the product the instant chat window if java enabled would still display the vendor you're communicating with If java isn't enabled you'd have the same typical HTML HTML screen as MEM did Also one vendor voted by all of the rest with the best reviews undecided will ultimately be given king status on the site Giving them the ability to override small features and veto console votes that have been performed by the community They will be able to prioritize vendor inventory such as auto direct sales to vendor's stash instead of vendor's stash if vendor has an item that vendor has There will be a Smart Sense feature that dissalows similar items to be posted as a means to bypass this King admin will have ability to modify but this feature will be stricly difficult and will require much more approval from the vendor congress Vendors on vacation mode will opt out and or auto vote Not yet decided Still working on the philsophy and bugs within the business logic aspect of the site But overall that's the general solution I'm thinking of Essentially a Darknet Congress I don't have the full plan layed out yet which is why I'd like some feedback And I didn't mean to be nasty in my previous message DH I'm sorry if I came out that way at all I don't want to DOXX but I do this type of work fairly often so I'm extremely confident that I can architect a flawless system or atleast should a flaw be noted a solution would be implemented that would please everyone I have no interested in making anything off of the site either I just want LSD So no fee's for transactions or tax withdrawal crap that I've seen at other places BUT there might be a tax for funds that are transferred in and withdrawn without a purchase THe system won't be intended to be a tumbler service so that type of activity will be looked down upon EDIT I have added donation abilities and details onto the original post if anyone would like to assist.

What's the best and most trustworthy btc mixer out there right now Bitcoinfog.
Blockchain info also has a mixing service Any reviews of that The helix site seems outdated with links to agora still unremoved is it safe to use.
Hmm might have to check it out since Agora registrations seem to be closed and I forgot my login credentials As for noscript I am using TAILS but the browser always seems to start up with scripts enabled so I have to disable them manually Is there a way to have scripts disabled by default I could not find anything in the preferences edit found it in the Tor Button options security needs to be set to high.

In all my years of psychedelic exploration I have never come across the opportunity to try ALD although I've read about it pretty extensively I would be so grateful for the opportunity to try some and share this rare experience with a close friend Of course I would write a full review and trip report if you would be so kind to give me a chance to try a sample Much Lov.
also have a look.
So first House says this and now you I've never used that subreddit but I see it as nothing but a bad thing honeypot or not It brings people who should not be part of this here thing into it It's nothing but a bad thing.
glad to have you but please read.
Thank you I know about that part but everytime I put it in it says it's connected but yet it still won't work I'm thinking I might have to just start all over I looked online some more and apparently a lot of people are having the same issue sadly though I still have not been able to find a solution.

Quote from bbkf on February pmThe upgraded kernel is the same flavor of Linux used by Redhat which works very closely with the US Government Does this mean that you're concerned about there being something unsafe in the software because the U S government works with Redhat The beauty of open source software is that security experts can and do pore over the code to make sure that there are no security issues That means that nobody can easily insert malicious code into the program without it being detected.
You aren't wrong So I've set up a fresh copy on a partition installed tor truecrypt and PGP Are there any more security measures I can be taking If it isn't too much hassle for someone could you try sending me an encryped email which I can reply to just to get to grips with how it works That would be much appreciated Is there a computer based email client I could use safely such as Thunderbird Thanks a lot.
OK thanks for many answers For the moment I got apply vendor here black bank nucleus alphabay this is my profile on grams have very cheap offer in the moment I sell sativa skunk for g I only sell in bulk but I will put soon a little amount g for every peoples can try my product Before I was vendor on evolution and I got very good statistic sales level If someone is interested let me know Take Care everybody.
I have had many successful transactions there The admins take a different approach towards problems but it all works well.
I found crypto market too It look good I am going to try For the moment I get order only with nucleus and middle earth Nothing in the other market And nothing here I miss evolution I don't understand because I have very good price g about weed and very good review on grams Anyway thanks for answer Someone have good link with market list like hidden wiki.
Is this information still current.
i can't believe how much people say confess brag lie brag about on the reddit subreddits so stupid you shouldnt even be replying commenting to anything w a clearnet username at all.
EDIT No longer qn issue Resolved Thanks I haven't been able to log into Nucleus for a bit Not sure what's going on or if there's any kind of technical fault this morning in GMT UTC anyway but I keep trying to log in but I keep getting the same error message saying that I've got the captcha wrong And yeh it's definitely the right url Can anyone else lig in to Nucleus right now Might just be a temporary fault t's pretty inconvenient so I'm interested to know where the problem lies to you all S.
I gave up and asked for my vendor bond back I got an account on Dream instead.
Quote from Wilderness on June amNice thanks friends Loving Agora atm as for any other market place i dont use any off them aprt from AGORA.
TMA is still available on the clearnet along with ALEPH and MEM.
First get the coins out then get the popcorn out the silence from the market admin is hilarious lma.
Quote from Fatfreddie on December pm ES Okay thanks for the info It kind of spooked me out yesterday Jf There is no such thing as We Love Avengers marketplace the word has just been put in there by the admins to stop someone from spamming this place the original reference was to d r e a m m a r k e t Is this the phinshing site you speak off is this site Legit.
you can trust a Hobbit.
Wow so much thought went into this but working directly with vendors whom have proven themselves This system is hard to beat I send coin they send product simple i will never join an open market agai.
Quote from Smokey on June amI think if they really did sift through every message and order on SR and were charging people who didn't encrypt their address there would be a mass amount of arrests I think more than anything it's scare tactics Reminds me of the days of MPAA RIAA actively attempting to fine people for downloading movies music There is obviously no way they will prosecute everyone so they pick a few slam dunk cases to try to scare people into not doing these things But you're definitely right there are people STILL that don't encrypt addresses Just seems crazy to me that you wouldn't take this simple precaution.
Generate your own PGP key pair Public Private Left click on the clipboard icon on the top right menu bar and select Manage Keys Make sure that GnuPG keys is selected in the left pane of the new window Select File New from the top menu of the Passwords and Keys window Select PGP Key on the seahorse window Hit Continue Enter the name that you used to register on the market must be at least characters long Do not enter an email address or a comment Click on Advanced key options Hit the plus sign on Key Strength until you get to Hit Create Enter a passphrase to protect your secret key Don't just hit enter with no passphrase it will error out Your new key should now appear in the Passwords and Keys window You may have to expand the window to it's maximum size or scroll to see it.
Quote from humblebumble on September pmAlthough if you log into a public wifi your MAC address would be recorded on that network So maybe the best case scenario would be to utilize the unprotected browser in Tails Check the package as much as you want IMO Even if they had my IP address and MAC address attached to a package that ended up having drugs i'm still not testifying againesy myself so that's gonna be a hard one to prove in court You could be expecting a package from bon macy's victoria secret or porn from germany and the sender could've sent you bullshit nothing or even drugs The part where people get fucked is when they open and have drugs at the same location that the package was sent to even physical address attached to PO box If you're super paraniod and you check the package at free wifi locations than they see that someone was still expecting a package and someone KNEW that package was on it's way The safest bet is to check the tracking at the sending location there's still room for denial with that.
Update yes there are PGP generating key tool apps I got one called PGPTools and it works Its.
I have used Helix a handful of times and never had any problems at all however after just checking their link a few minutes ago i saw that it is indeed down I'm not sure how long it has been or will be but from my previous experience with them they always got the job done adn within a reasonable timeframe.
there not safe if they use java script Cheers Dolmi.
Here.
I would like to know about this vendor too So UP.
make a new key encrypt send to me I am running an OS that is a very rugged Linux variant there is no way to catch a virus this way.
Quote from beetlejews on August ami havent gotten my btc yet either withdrew two days ago yall figure it will still come i hope i dont lose like i did on blackbankI recieved my btc after about days It sucks waiting but I think you will get it eventually Hope it comes through for you Much Love HalfPin.
Oh thanks for clearing that up Thought I was going mad Nice to see some of then old names from SR on here.
Well people could be worried about backdoors in their encryption software allowing commands to be executed in memory or scripts of some kind Malware is so common through other vectors that people are over protective of their OS' This is good but windows PCs will crash if you fart I used Symantec PGP for a while until I found out it might be less secure I'm almost sure this was an error in generating your key.
Hi guys I feel really stupid asking this but what is a working link to join the we love avengers marketplace I've been trying lots of invite links on here but they don't look like a normal onion url Thanks.
sorry if it sounds stupid but what is PGP I really appreciate your help One more thing I was wondering where I can find like a site that talks about hacking or an underground hacking place or forum or something Thanks again.
I'm asking this because of the post I saw about having no javascript but I'm still a bit skeptical I've never used a market before so I'm wondering if this is good or bad Could anyone provide any information Thanks.
is higher than just about all the other markets Nucleus is only I would not sell on a new market it has to prove itself first Customers are not going to be happy being asked to pay an upcharge which will discourage sales Whats this bit about selling ipads and iphones Is it a joke It may turn out to be a great market perhaps later I will look into it but for now I'm satisfied with the markets I'm on.
That's a good question I assume the NSA has eyes everywhere and connect using public WiFi at a distance I'm the guy parked in the s VW Campervan in the very back of the Starbucks parking lot with the massive antenna on the roof HaHa But on a serious note if Mullvad is in an eyes country should I not use VPN in any of the eyes countries Has anyone heard of Cryptostorm Are they NE good.
Quote from xncsux on March amQuote from missinghouse on March amI will say that his packaging was decent but the outside of the envelope was extremely amateur Handwritten by what appeared to be by an adolescent and also took the customers last name and made a fake name as the return address I would be hesitant to order again due to that reason alone This Thanks Missing I was hesitant b c I wasn't sure how to word it but you did a fine job L LThanks homie I wasn't sure either but I felt the need to let the community know Poor stealth imo especially when a few pages back in this thread BH spoke of how he wanted to have top notch stealth Not worth the risk Stick with the professionals.
According to many people Golden Era has stopped replying to emails and sending orders entirely despite people completing and sending bitcoin I personally made a purchase and didn't get a confirmation email but did get my package within a few days He is a research chemical vendor.
I plan on checking it out Where are most of the vendors shipping from Do they have a decent selection.
I had actually hoped to remove only incriminating data from from my windows without using dban Anybody know of a way to do this I suppose I may have to restort to just encrypting my hard drive Anybody know the best way to do this with windows I've heard a lot about truecrypt unfortunately it does not work with windows As for the blockchain question I've seen comments from people who use blockchain through tor but in order to due this scripts must be enabled so I wondered how people were comfortable doing this The same goes for reddit Scripts must be enabled to post How are people comfortable doing this.
Also never enable javascript to log in or create your account It could expose your IP address Most onion email sites offer a javascript free option to log in like SquirrelMail.
Yea I just saw an article on deepdotweb earlier about this who incident I'm glad that justice is finally being served I never used Sheep marketplace but it pains me that so many people lost money Hopefully the heavy hand of justice will fall upon Kimble and Verto now.
We decided to do ug since that's how the tabs work out Yes I will be reporting back in a month actually.
Please stay away from markets under ddos attacks or suffered such attacks There is a technique that forces a server to enter a insecure circuit a circuit made entirely from dickbleedable nodes by constantly ddosing it Here is a good read from the tor dev forums warning clearnet.
Monero seems real nice The problem is you need BTC to get Monero If it takes off exchanges will pop up There are so many altcoins.
looks like its back up nao.
thanks for that mine seemed to get stuck as well so i cancelled it first time aroun.
ehh dont bother Agora is shutting down dood dont make an account or deposit money.
You're probably fine just washing your coins once make sure to use a different name and buy them in cash through localbitcoins You can use helix to send the coins directly to your market wallet i e Agora or Nucleus and then you will be able to make purchases.
Quote from dardush on May amThanks sillywabbit Do you have by any chance an invite code I did not need one Did they close regs.
I've agree about it being relatively benign I haven't had any negative side effects tbh only positive and now I've switched to trying meo pcp Which is much more powerful even my dollar scale doesn't do well enough a job of weighing precisely mg and I've been told take mg then mg an hour later for the best trip I did successfully do it once and it was wonderful extremely close to MXE but not as social not as enlightening much more superficial which I didn't dig very much Too many people are capitalizing on the MXE drought right now that I don't trust any of these vendors selling out of India on Abraxas but maybe someone will and I'll be able to go off their reviews.
Quote from dolmio on July amQuote from Rasputin on June pmWhich are the biggest and most popular of the markets at this time Agora is the biggest and BEST look no futher Agora has it all Cheers Dolmio Error Cannot register at this time user limit reached Please wait until the full release.
thanks for all the guidence and help here some few questions what do you mean about note your seed Buy a cheap laptop remove the harddrive get tails on a usb sorry I dont know what tails it but I will look it up Buy storing in TOR wallet do you mean by the market wallet again sorry for the newbie question.
None of those markets exist anymore sorry I suggest looking at the top post in this section and checking out agora and or blackbank those are both rather popular.

We can only hope seems like a long time down now thoug.
This might sound pretty basic to some but if it can help just one user it will have been worth writing Please feel free to add your own ideas on the topic Never use a user name password that you have ever used on the clearnet Never use the same user name password on more than one site Always try to write in a neutral language Change identities from time to time and change your writing patterns at the same time If you change your identity don't disappear from the old one and appear with the new one but let both personae stay alive at the same time or take some deserved rest from the network If you change your setup it can be the right time to change your online identity Avoid using windows for your darknet browsing it is insecure You can either create your own custom linux distribution with security in mind full disk encryption firewall to block non tor traffic hardened kernel tor process browser isolation if you feel like it or use whonix or tails if you decide to trust those who made these systems Tails is good because it will leave no tracks on your computer Whonix is good because it provides some kind of isolation Remove your hard drive when using tails if you can If you use an hard drive blank if from time to time and start fresh again Learn encryption gnupg is a great tool create your own or more key and use it as much as you can If you are a vendor a journalist in an oppressive country or a paranoid mind traveler you might want to work with encrypted material on another machine that stays offline That way the computer connected on the internet would only be used for encrypted material making it harder for an attacker to know the content of your encrypted documents in case your computer got compromised or had a backdoor Try to leave as little tracks of your activity as possible on the machine s you use Use an open wifi if you can to make it harder to get to you if tor was broken or you made an mistake in your OPSEC Remember that using tor might get you flagged as suspicious individual even in democratic first world countries Have fun be kind to others and remember if you're not ready to do the time don't do the crime Stay Safe.
i remember reading somewhere that SharedCoin on Blockchain isn't as good as the proper tumbling services will try and remember and post the lin.
Decrypt a message Copy the message to be decrypted into the clipboard Left click on the clipboard icon on the menu bar and select Decrypt Verify Clipboard Enter the passphrase you used to protect your secret key and hit OK on the pinentry window A GnuPG results window should pop up with the decrypted message If you don't get the menu entry Decrypt Verify Clipboard when you left click on the clipboard something is wrong with the formatting of the message that you copied into the clipboard to be decrypted Make sure that you are copying all of the message including the five dashes at the beginning and end of the message and the BEGIN and END statements PGP is very picky about formatting errors.
Quote from gardener on June pmMaybe some VPN providers can be trusted but it's hard to tell before there is an actual problem Their claims are mostly marketing in my opinion The market is competitive who would be stupid enough to admit logging And who would go to jail to protect a month user I mean Mullvad already has a history of denying government requests and the USA doesn't have any jurisdiction to jail a Swedish VPN provider And for contrast a lot of VPN providers do admit up front to logging Like HideMyAss Mullvad's co founder was the first person that we publicly know of to successfully exploit the Heartbleed vulnerability against OpenVPN this is one thing they have standing out for them above all other VPN providers why they're worthy of your business They take cash in the mail too That's how you know they're serious about protecting their users' privacy Quote from gardener on June pmI don't know swedish law their claims can be true but they could be greedy entrepreneurs logging as much as they can to be on the safe side or even a honeypot sadly we have no way to tell I sincerely believe Mullvad isn't logging anything When a VPN provider throws somebody under the bus like HideMyAss did with that LulzSec member everybody hears about it There has not been one story ever of Mullvad giving up any information about even a single user Likewise with HideMyAss this was their excuse for their actions Quote HideMyAss Our VPN service and VPN services in general are not designed to be used to commit illegal activity It is very naive to think that by paying a subscription fee to a VPN service you are free to break the law without any consequences since Mullvad is a VPN provider and based in Sweden they're not even legally obligated to keep logs under the EU Data Retention Directive because in Sweden this doesn't apply to VPN providers IANAL but they can't even be legally forced to keep logs on users and I've seen no indication that they are Their entire reputation and business depends on it If a Lavabit style situation ever happened Mullvad has already stated they would rather discontinue their business if they were somehow forced to give up information on any user Quote from gardener on June pmMullvad software seems to only create firewall rules to block anything that's not going through VPN network interface Setting up iptables to do this would work as good If you can figure out how to do this in iptables yourself please share this since this would be a big benefit to the community This iptables configuration is on my bucket list to get working not for Mullvad's sake but for the sake of other VPNs I use but I haven't started working on these iptables rules yet Quote from gardener on June pmRestoring an image is nice but if the host is compromised your image can be compromised too A skilled attacker could escape the VM A DVD can't be compromised by a distant attacker the BIOS could be but it's harder and probably not worth it to catch a small time buyer If the host is ever compromised your entire box including your VMs are compromised too then So don't let your host get compromised With a Tails setup your main threat model is not a compromised DVD but a zero day exploit against Tor Browser On Tails you have no extra layers of security compared to doing everything in VMs If a zero day exploit compromises your Tor Browser on Tails your entire OS including your PGP private keys your PGP private key passwords your decrypted KeePass entries after you unlock your KeePass all of this is theoretically accessible to the attacker now And if the government is doing some sneaky shit going after Tails users to get after say serious people in the drug trade then these above things would be the keys to the castle that the feds would target on a Tails system With this VM setup I described all you would pretty much ever do with your host OS at that point is install Ubuntu security updates and that's it And you should do it over a VPN that has cover traffic over it too so the government can't profile you that you run Ubuntu on one or more systems from your house or what packages you keep updated The Ubuntu packages you install from apt are signed too So if your initial Ubuntu iso you installed was a legitimate one the signed packages you're downloading from Ubuntu should be legitimate as well For an attacker to compromise your host OS through the VM you're basically talking about a zero day exploit against either Tor Browser or Firefox if you use NoScript correctly plus a privilege escalation exploit against your Virtual Machine software to get the bad guy to root This is basically just not going to happen but running everything in a VM like this gives you another huge layer of security because they'd need the privilege escalation exploit and then also the VM breakout exploit And if they didn't know you do everything from VMs then the chances of an attacker having this type of VM breakout exploit against a patched Ubuntu VM and up to date Virtual Machine software is practically non existent We're talking about possibly hundreds of hours of exploit development work if there's even a VM breakout exploit that is possible when the VM is a patched Ubuntu install Hell you can even run Tails in a VM as your main way of using Tor Browser and a VPN from your host OS Now you've solved the Tor de anonymization problem and you have insulated yourself against zero day exploits from the government But I don't even recommend running Tails as your main VM OS for Tor Browsing and here's a few reasons why When I tried using the built in Tor Browser feature to update Tor Browser in Tails at least in a Tails VM I had I don't know if this is different in Tails the newest now Tor Browser complained that it does not have the system permissions required to install it This can be remedied by installing the newest Tor Browser manually but this is kind of defeating the purpose of why you'd want to use Tails in the first place So basically the next time there's a Tor Browser update that has any security patches in it your Tor Browser on Tails has known in it and I don't think anybody bothers in Tails to check if their Tor Browser is up to date every time they boot up Tails Whereas with Tor Browser on Ubuntu there's a simple on click button to upgrade the entire Tor Browser install and Tor Browser at least on Ubuntu checks every time on startup if there's a new Tor Browser version Also Tails only runs normal Tor Browser and not Tor Browser hardened the latter of which has been hardened more against exploits Qubes OS praised by Edward Snowden and other esteemed computer security professional is actually built around the concept of everything being done in VMs but using Qubes proficiently is out of reach for most DNM users But basically if you don't use VMs but still use a VPN on your host OS or an alternative like a prepaid cash only g hotspot or the VPN router setup Cosmic Consciousness described you have protected yourself against the Tor de anonymization problem that was the original issue in this thread Then even without VMs if you have good Internet hygiene and don't run untrusted downloads and don't allow JavaScript from all websites when clearnet browsing using NoScript with Firefox you're a pretty damn difficult target at this point Just Linux with a good host VPN and good opsec hygiene would be good enough for most DNM users who need to be concerned about getting de anonymized But if you want to take things a step further and decide to do everything in VMs and you do it right you've now made compromising your host OS and your most valuable data PGP private keys and passwords in KeePass near impossible Quote from gardener on June pmPhysical isolation is said to be better than software isolation More complicated and costly to set up but should be solid even more so if each system lives in RAM and starts from a read only media Physical isolation is a good idea it's just that Tails isn't good enough in my book What if you are targeted with a zero day exploit against your Tor Browser in Tails You could have been using Tor Browser from a hardened VM but now instead your entire Tails OS and this could include all your keystrokes your PGP private keys your KeePass entries after you've decrypted them all of this could be compromised Tails just can't provide VMs Quote from gardener on June pmFor most users Tails or TBB on Linux with a strong firewall is probably enough don't you think so If the government knowing their DNM username the day they de anonymize a Tor connection of theirs and find that it's coming from their home IP address isn't a concern to them then Tails is good enough But if you're making repeat purchases or posting on darkweb forums with that same username or posting about things that would get you arrested then a VPN is absolutely a necessity unless you want to leave yourself open to ending up like that Silk Road lieutenant Bonus points if you do everything serious from VMs but for now just having a VPN would keep you from getting de anonymized to your home IP unless you're using a prepaid g hotspot and have good Internet hygiene like using this g hotspot for only DNM activities and don't ever log in to your Facebook from it or you're using a VPN router setup like what Cosmic Consciousness described Quote from gardener on June pmIf you want to be extra safe use an air gaped machine to encrypt your stuff and keep your private key At worse if your tor box is compromised there won't be keys or unencrypted messages on it This is super paranoid in a good way I think if you need this level of security go for it but this wouldn't protect you from having your Tor connection de anonymized to your home IP still The thing is that if your Tor connection ever gets de anonymized to your home IP address and they do decide to raid you or do physical surveillance on you and then raid you or the places you do business at you wouldn't be expecting any of this to be coming The feds would tear through every single flash drive hard drive and unencrypted piece of data that you own to try and pin this on you that you actually are username xyz online plus if you have any drugs in your house or they physically follow you to say your trap house this would almost certainly spell doom for you It is better just to use a VPN to begin with and sleep much more soundly at night because you use a reputable VPN provider with a server in a good country Mullvad is month when you pay them in Bitcoins there's no reason not to be using them unless getting de anonymized isn't a concern and it should be for all of us who make serious repeat purchases from the same username Quote from gardener on June pmTails is nice because you don't need to read a lot of documentation to get started it works out of the box and it is supposed to be secure if you trust those who created the iso If you wanted to fight against anonymity and be willing to add a back door somewhere wouldn't a distribution aiming at providing anonymity be on top of the list I trust Tails they're in it for the right reasons but you just can't run VMs in it and it's not VPN friendly.
Quote from Mist on April pmHey everyone Update your PGP keys this was pointed out to me by another beautiful soul and realized they were right My key was old and leaked information like what operating system i had Not a major issue but you may want to consider it some examples of old key headers showing operation system and versions version GnuPG v GNU Linux BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK Version GnuPG v MingW BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK Version GnuPG v MingW SO take the few minutes to check you PGP and be safe update it and keep your old key in case someone needs to know you are who you are yes you can delete the header when you post but its still old This has been a public service message from the Mist love lighton linux you can save yourself from manually deleting the version line or forgetting to delete it with the gpg option no emit versionlike so gpg no emit version armor export yourke.
I have one more question Do I use Blockchain as a stand alone wallet or use a popular mainstream one that i can easily transfer from my CC or bank account and then transfer them to Blockchain Im new to bitcoin so i'm a lot clueless right now.
I'm sure I'm indexed in their lost forums wherever those servers went obviously in the hands of EYE SKUM Anyways point I was going to jump at Nuke afaik has had the BonesKoopa Tread with ultimate caution stamp of disapproval their whole framework has been broken since day one and the admins have never made an effort to improvise or fix it their PGP Public Key system how it works on the marketplace has been broken for a long time what I mean is with my OPSEC on my computer browser Nuke looks broken I can't place a PGP Public Key 'cause I need to lower my end of SEC I don't think so I mean it was bad enough I had to take a learning curve using Hansa multi sig system which I find it very questionable and true fashion of HoneyPot protocol make everyone use a newer supposedly opensourced cutting edge multi sig platform pen tested by who again IDK End story I made out plenty pen testing Nukes flawed escrow system hope you guys fixed that by the way hint digital backend vendor listing settings I wouldn't shop there myself unless I knew a vetted vendor and them I'd just offer to do the whole transaction off the market or somewhere else It's amazing people still use it after all this time no forum proven exit scams straight up hijacking of the site lol IDK I'm not h x r but holy shit Nuke lives up to it's name goes to shows not many people keep up with forums or just no fucks given attitude has come to many buyers and this is how major scams bloom Shit I've been slacking on the Social Engineering Game lol shit does pay off just ask Abraxas Marketplace Sorry figured I'd finally put a BonesKoopa Un Marketplace Tread with Caution on Nucleus Marketplace Just to stir up a little shit with you paranoid motherfuckers Nucleus sold DHL the GUI The similarities are uncanny specially as aforementioned under my configurations I have to actually lower my SEC to navigate DHL also though not as compromising as Nuke Food for though like i said I know shit I'm just a junkie with the balls to test out every marketplace and it's vendors international or not any drug to prove that' we're winning Stay safe stay awesome kids.

Running tails on a virtual box is also a secure way Some expert VPN folks should start renting out sandbox RDP's with tails for some coins.
oh and in case if anyone was wondering yes lizardlabs do small orders They start from x ug tabs then x then x and so on for both LSZ and AL LAD.

Quote from vitaminLSD on June pmQuote from Gleeful on June pmQuote from vitaminLSD on June amTails is not secure for serious DNM activities and here's the first reason why USA Feds have already conducted Tor attacks that have landed significant DNM figures behind bars the above article has more details about how the Feds did it and who they have arrested so far a former Silk Road lieutenant for starters Also Tor bridges are practically useless for hiding from the NSA because the NSA harvests the tor bridge addresses from the emails send to from the Tor Project the NSA knows you're using Tor anyways if you're using a Tor bridge Tor bridges were designed for people in repressive third world countries not US citizens hiding from the NSA It also gets worse and this is information that every DNM user serious or small should know about but since the Edward Snowden leaks the NSA has talked about if not bragged that they have timing attacks for de anonymizing Tor users what does this breach have to do with Tails Isn't it just a live version of Linux Is it because it's not designed to be used with a VPN and that VPNs are the safest way to access Tor I'm not disputing what you're saying I just don't understand it Thanks Basically yea you want to always use a VPN before Tor And Tails doesn't have built in VPN support so unless you're using a VPN router like how Cosmic Consciousness explained then if your Tor connection ever gets de anonymized they would see your home IP or wherever you're connected from and that by itself has been enough to land some unlucky people in jail and prison like the Silk Road lieutenant from that article The NSA even brags about how it can de anonymize Tor users so not using a VPN first is like going out and having sex with women a night without a condom and hoping you don't get an STD after a year One of the worst ways you can be de anonymized is like this Tor basically uses three hops to send your data to the final destination Node the first node or the guard node Node the middle node Node the exit node So if you log in to Reddit com through Tor using the same username you buy with on the markets with your connection without a VPN would look like Your home IP Tor Node Tor Node Tor Node RedditBut if you got unlucky and the government runs all three of those Tor nodes and your Tor prioritizes the fastest Tor nodes Tor Node would know your home IP but not the contents of your connection Tor Node would also know that it's sending data on to Tor Node Tor Node knows that it received a connection from Tor node although it doesn't know what the contents are Tor Node also knows that its sending data to Tor Node Tor Node finally sends your data to Reddit Tor Node can always see your data in plaintext for any website not just Reddit unless that connection to the website used Even if your web traffic to Reddit is all sent over encrypted to the Reddit server Tor Node knows that this is one of the Reddit servers for instance because in the connection during the SSL TLS handshake the Reddit server openly says says before everything gets encrypted that this server belongs to Reddit If Reddit has been put under some type of government gag order to give all IP addresses login times to the Feds the feds would know you logged in through Tor But if the feds are doing de anonymization attacks right now if Tor Node was one of their own they could see this connection to Reddit And Tor Node knows it received a connection from Tor Node and Tor Node knows it made a connection to Tor Node Likewise if we roll this back one more time Tor Node knows that it received a connection from Tor Node and Tor Node knows that it made a connection to Tor Node at a very specific point in time down to the second Then finally Tor Node knows this connection came from your home IP address This is how the Feds can de anonymize you if they control your entire Tor circuit your Tor Node But the NSA even brags that it can de anonymize people just based off when you made your Tor connection combined with when the request came out of the Tor exit node so it's possibly they don't even need to control your entire Tor circuit for that connection Just run one of the Tor Node 's and use their NSA mass surveillance visibility to know when a connection came out of one of the Tor nodes Plus they can combine this roughly with the size of the encrypted data being sent back to you to narrow down how large the page you viewed was which can help them pinpoint you even closer with this second method I think the second one is sloppier but the NSA was caught bragging from information in the Edward Snowden leaks that this method still works Ubuntu is really easy to learn I highly recommend it as an alternative to Tails if you've only ever relied on Tails before Mullvad the VPN provider even has a Linux client for their VPN you basically just click a button and it connects They're probably the best commercial VPN provider in my book you can pay them in bitcoins the only personally identifiable information with them is a numeric account ID they keep no logs and they have repeatedly told off governments when they asked for information about users And they know the people who run their Sweden data center and they used their own hardware for the nodes there so the USA government can't just show up there with a gag order and take one of their VPN server's hard drives with their SSL private keys on it like they could possibly to VPN servers here in America regardless of what company runs the VPN server Ubuntu has all the bells and whistles that Tails has and there is an enormous amount of documentation available for you You can find the answer to just about any problem in Ubuntu by search engine ing xyz Ubuntu You can also give it a full disk encryption password during your Ubuntu install Thanks for the great explanation I use Ubuntu already since I have essentially abandoned Windows because it sucks so hard With Ubuntu and the VPN set up does it make sense to run Tor through the VPN as an extra layer If so what package does Ubuntu have available to run Tor Thanks.
Experimented with various benzos for about a year or two the most dangerous one was Phenazepam ultra long half life I ended up blacking out for days during one session and stopped using them recreationally after that Never experienced withdraws because I never took too much or took them on a daily basis but you can become dependent fast panic attacks upon quitting if you get used to your medication and seizures if you get physically dependent My DOC and problem drug class Dissociative with MXE moved on to Ketamine and then on to PCP PCE and their derivatives I was IM'ing fully anesthetic doses of Ketamine every night for about months strait at one point Quit for a while and then when I relapsed I got right back into it I became tolerant to the sedative tranquilizing effects which is when Ketamine MXE became a problem An anesthetic IM dose of mg S MXE or mg IM Ketamine no longer caused ataxia sedation and I was effectively dissociating myself and blacking out but would then get up and start walking around working in a manic dream mode I started using PCP PCE derivatives because they were much more potent x as potent as MXE and like x as potent as Ketamine A non tolerant user would be fully anesthesized by like mg of meo PCP or ' Oxo PCE mg is a fully active and VERY strong dose At the peak of my use I was injecting mg of ' Oxo PCE x the recommended dose in a session Once I started consuming such large amounts I became tolerant immune to the sedative effects and it started getting dangerous I would black out and be up and active while manic blacked out Ever hear about those people that lift cars or take like bullets and keep beating up the police because they're high on PCP and can't feel pain or fear That's me I never got violent or hurt anyone but I was NOT aware and posed a great danger to myself and others At that point I was actually experiencing pain physical withdraws when I came off my dose and was redosing every single day multiple times a day to keep off baseline I even woke up one morning laying in bed like nothing had happened I remember taking a shot and getting ready to lie down for bed When I woke up I was covered in cuts bruises and scuffs it looked like I had been in a car accident or had fallen out of a tree or something I was beat the hell up Furniture had been mangled destroyed by my body colliding with it furniture had been re arranged and there was a trail of blood drops on my carpet and blood stains on the walls where I had made contact I was in so much physical pain I could barely walk for the next couple days I kept injecting every day Didn't really start weening my dose down and attempting to cut out my use until I was shown a min video of me blacked out on consecutive shots Ever seen a video of yourself blacked out drunk at a house party This was worse heartbreaking My last dose was earlier Today and I'm dancing around the idea of dosing right now I've made progress but its hard The reason I started using was to control my bipolar My mood swings had gotten so severe that I was jumping from suicide risk to full blown mania multiple times per day I became addicted to MXE because it helped me rationalize and understand my emotions and keep me from hitting the suicidal depressive lows It later became a substitute for suicide I was k holing m holing myself every day because ego death was better than actually killing myself This is why Ketamine isn't on the list of approved substances here on TMG It is Schedule because it is a needed surgical anesthetic It is a powerful psychedelic and great tool for exploring your mind Please be careful and don't let it become a habit Ketamine is a very strong but fleeting high.

Quote from sabbatical on July pmHonestly I don't bother with anything labeled over ug because I find they usually seem underdosed Now a lot of the vendors around now are pretty legit but it's just a rule I personally follow It doesn't matter so much whether I'm eating one piece of paper or three Besides I'm usually eating five or six well i dont follow that rule because the more lsd you take the more depth and spiritual awakening you find and if you can get that in one blotter instead of three well then you found yourself a bargai.

Considering that the Tails team is constantly checking for bugs they are smarter than me I'd rather let competent people make the security suite.

Doesn't sound all that World Changing to me Sounds like all the other markets with the word Apple added on.
What's up with that Agora link Is that a pishing link or did they just add a second URL.
It's back up.

VeraCrypt full disk encryption is also a good way forward The encrypted file system is not very secure though.

Also the point of wearing a male wig hat and basically an entire disguise that shouldn't make you stand out but instead make you unrecognizable as your normal self even while under camera is because if you study the CD's on Reddit the of them where people got caught without going to the counter is because the feds were waiting for them on the inside and knew already exactly what they looked like and so they apprehended the person inside the lobby after they grabbed the package or the feds knew what the person looked like and also knew what car the person drove and they approached and arrested the person after they got into their car with the package Don't let this happen to you.
Quote from sterlingsword on December amQuote from ultrabear on December amI for one love the idea Sterling but do not see the issue with some type of small fee to help cover operational expenses on your end Please keep me updated on your progress as I am extremely interested in your concept Thank you I will I'm trying to negotiate a deal with a vendor for free LSD anually to run the service I know I could make a lot more by taxing transactions but that's not what I'm about I'm a firm believer that more money leads to more problems Don't get me wrong I love money But I'd have to deal with laundering it getting it in the first place which would require more time just stuff I don't care for I make a good living and this type of merchant system is very easy to create All of the extra stuff are the challenge But I'm only interesting in helping people out I sincerally believe that anyone that wants LSD other drugs used sparingly should have access too them to free their mind and to not only help themselves but help others If I can provide a community to peolple that will offer that That's money in and of itself for me Plus I'll habe a reliable market to buy LSD on But Hopefully this vendor I'm in contact with will be interested in purchasing it I have him in mins for the top vendor so he'll probably get the source regardless Just with LSD I will offer more I'll see how it goes lol Either way I'm developing it though Quote from on December amWow so much thought went into this but working directly with vendors whom have proven themselves This system is hard to beat I send coin they send product simple i will never join an open market againThank you for your feedback Mod That's the idea A community based on human principle trust And that is exactly what I'm aiming for An entire community of completely trusted vendors of which vendors have the ability to ban if it comes down too it You can almost gurantee that so long as you're a good customer and don't lie cheat or steal that you'll have an entire community of people such as yourselves Also harder for LE to penetrate with typical social engineering Hi Sterling Great idea I agree that vendors shouldn't or probably wouldn't have an issue with at least donating a small fee to help run the site I also like money and I'm currently helping out a friend with his business and even though I don't ask for money but just to clarify how we would work things out I asked in the beginning Now I am comfortable with accepting his paying for resources fuel and whatever else I might need to work and running gear I make sure of it I rarely ask for anything but he's great anyway I think it's great how you are in a way giving the control back to the vendors and really focusing on Trust being what drives the wheels You remind me of myself Question I was wondering how the exact product pp Price Stock Item count the Victorious Vendor Sale method might work if a vendor of a smaller magnitude was to go up against someone like ToR or the like Or maybe I just haven't worked that out yet but you have I suppose this wouldn't be showed off publicly in respect of the Vendors Which is a shame It's a cool idea But instead just the transaction would initiate I don't quite understand how Trust of the Vendors toward each other works I thought at first it was Trust amongst Vendors and Consumers Anyway Goodluck with this I hope you see it through Maybe at first you could keep the numbers down until all the kinks are ironed out and keep it a bit easier for you and the mods to operate Goodluck.
That's why a setup that leaves as little forensic evidence as possible is needed Tails on a DVD is an option to consider You keep your computer clean add your private key to en encrypted USB partition that you can wipe easily in case you feel like it without having to wipe your HDD Good luck and consider that a truster vendor could get caught and keep vending being LE This did happen with fake IDs this could and probably did also happen with drugs You don't seem like an high profile target though Have a clean house and sleep well.

Quote from on March amNothing came today either I'm officially writing this off tomorrow if it doesn't land Could we move this vendor out of active until some reputable members have landings I'd be happy to see this be just a small mistake with shipping from bombheadie but with sketchy accounts having landings and reputable members reporting weeks with no arrival coupled with way too many good products prices smells fishy Having this as an active vendor puts many people in danger of a potential scam as s he possibly string people along for weeks I my self almost went with this vendor earlier I'm glad I decided to throw caution to the wind and wait Weeding Marble.
Hello all My question is how likely is it for LE to pose as a vendor on a dnm New to the deepweb and dnms in general I recently got some coin and made a purchase on Nucleus from a trusted vendor However I was then left over with a little change and went searching for something to buy with what I had left over I found a vendor selling single blotters and decided to buy one even though they had zero feedback On top of wanting to spend my change the product promised was something I desparately wanted to try What could possibly go wrong Maybe the guy's a scammer and I lose No biggie I thought The day after however it hit me is it not possible for a vendor with no feedback to in fact be LE I am extremely frustrated with myself for being so careless I spent so much time learning all of the necessary OPSEC protocols to stay safe and anonymous only to possibly hand over my personal info directly to the Luckily it was only one dose and I am from another country than the vendor claims to be from But aren't I still at risk Should I abandon my current address for all future transactions Should I wipe my computer clean Suffice it to say I am anxiously awaiting this package and will never make this mistake again Any knowledge on this topic will be very appreciated mps.

Alcohol amphetamines and dissociatives are all basically poison to me at this point Of course each built up over time at different points in my life I really don't have any answers on how to overcome addiction it's probably something I'll always struggle with SassNaps can definitely relate to coming around to broken furniture and a busted up body from dissos I abused the hell out of MXE for a long time without any issues life seemed totally peachy then suddenly it turned on me and all dissociatives now basically turn me into a blacked out zombie Major change in brain chemistry there I would say pretty scary.

Hi guys My apologizes to every single person on this fourm weeks ago my grandmother passed away And this this Friday we were at a concert and got to a hotel room after the show no one knew anything he was doing the whole time He had mg of Xanax in his system and mg of opitates in his system Hos BC was He did it all insntantly after the show is what he told me He died in my lap before the paramedics arrived This is not how I wanted this to be I wanted to be a good sorry GREAT vendor on here but with everything going on I just cant continue doing this right now I think you would would understand if your best friends died in your lap If anyone paid for anything they did not receive please message me Before all this happened I ended up getting a printer and was going to make everything PERFECT I just want to apoloigize to the TMG community for my screw up It's just very hard to when you have people very close to you pass away in a week especially your best friend in your lap All because of a female I know I going to have PTSD from this event When I come back the only thing that I am going to be selling is ALD That's if you guys still trust me enough I apologize from the bottom of my heart I was NOT trying to get one over on anyone I promise you that Again I apologize to you guysLove and lightBHP S I would appreciate any good vibes sent my way thanks for that.
Another thing I sent out packages this is why I would like to know who received and didn't received there there packages I very easily could have missed a couple packages And I fully apologize if that is the case.
thank yo.

I deposited into my agora account on around pm I sit here on May th at pm days after my deposit and nothing has shown in my agora account One would hope that with such a big deposit agora support might respond to messages However they have yet to respond to the messages I have sent with just questions regarding deposits They said withdraws are fixed however they are working on deposits I hope Agora comes through on this and doesn't drop the ball Depositting BTC shouldn't be the scary thing about the DNM the mailing of drug should be However I sit here scared worried confused and very irritated at the very simple transaction of BTC to my account I hope Agora fixes this soon as well Because if a normal order takes weeks after vendor sends out package I am looking at a solid month on one order This is sad and not what customers pay commission to see.
There are also prepaid debit cards that you can buy with cash that may be able to suit your need.
All i really need is the great people of the garden Although i do really like the look and feel of DHL and plan on making a couple select orders there pretty soon to get things i can only get there.
If u figure this out maybe u let us all know We are all confused that's why we come here on the other hand Reading never hurt anybody Ohm.
If you see the pictures of this guy he def won't last long I'm pretty sure he will give up any info he has to get a better deal I swear for all the know how all types of other stuff people know its always weird when they just do dumb hotbox type shit.
I'll PM you an encrypted message if you like what's your public key Mine's available in my signature below you can import it and practice encrypting to me if that is something you need to do as well EDIT nevermind I found your key PMing you.

Let's hope not.
Quote from on August pmwhat would you say about simply using a mobile PGP program and using text messages Have you ever tried to decrypt or encrypt a message on an android device The last time i tried it took me minuets.
Quote from flourpower on August pmI thought so too didnt take too long to figure out it's more like Craigslist than eBay Still in my limited experience a better forum than the Reddit oneLike night and day This is a community of like minded seekers hoping to benefit one and other Reddit is well Reddit is Reddit Welcome.
Quote from Greenbuddy on May pmQuote from unit on May pmu I couldn't agree more I've already swore to myself I'm sticking to micro transactions from now on I'd rather have BTC on the line than what i had put myself into And exactly I've never felt comfortable with sharing that I even use the market with anybody but close close close friends When they would like help with using it or want me to over see a transaction for them I let them know I risk my money when I use these marketplaces so when you want to use them you're risking your money too Basically saying I'll do my best to make sure they get a clean transaction but if it goes to hell in a hand basket which I've seen happen very easily it's not up to me to fix or compensate anything for them unit I also use markets for mostly BTC deals its less of a worry and below a certain amount is IMO much less dangerous than a larger amount Some may say that it requires more orders to get the same amount but I'd rather get caught with a oz decriminalized amounts in some places of bud than a whole zip or QP Not that it matters if the feds get you but if you get pulled over with it then unless you live in the deep south just a ticket The same is true for RL I used to have this strategy when buying weed I'd go to my dealer and if I was getting a half or a zip I would never tell them first I'd check it out and if the weed was sub par I'd just get a dub or a slice There are exceptions like if I wanted some primo bud from a vendor like CultMadeline who only sells Oz's but their bud is fire and they are trusted Even then I'd rather direct deal One thing about direct deals though I would place a very basic order one item and maybe a small cheap second but you don't need to make it confusing or overly complicated Final note there are some things that make sense to buy in bulk the one thing I don't is with MDMA I don't have many friends who do it although getting rid of it is easy the reason I don't is that I know that for myself I will do higher doses and more often If I bought a whole g If I had friends who would buy it I could sell it very fast for a nice profit Most of my friends don't even know if the 'molly' they got of some uni student was real MDMA and are averse to pills never had good ones or think they are cut thanks to pop culture its crazy smart people too That is what is so liberating about DNMs you don't have to take what everyone else in your area or circle of friends does It cuts through ignorance like a machete love and light ACID Ever sense i found out how to use the DNM I don't allow my friends to get something somewhere other than me unless it's tested It's sad but a very true statement I trust DNM vendors more than drug dealers in real life With reviews honest in most aspects I can see if a vendor is notably good before i buy from them instead of being forced into whatever is in town at the time And my knowledge on these substances has multiplied in the last years sense SR and DPR I dont believe stupid stereotypical hippy mumbo jumbo either such as can't cut LSD with water from the store or brown molly is MDA and white molly is MDMA With DNM I've skipped passed the typical salesman and have jumped right to other entrepeneurs that share in like interest and care to look into the science rather than what most people i know do follow the guy that's eaten acid the longest nonono I'm too analytical to just go off of hear say I want to know from a person that's dealing with portions that IF their stuff was bad they wouldnt move it because I'd order grams make a bad review greenbuddy might order grams and write a bad review than when someone else comes to maybe buy grams they see two bad reviews and a vendor trying to sell them SHIT AGAIN i trust DNM vendors more than I do RL vendors.
I only found this place as I used to order from Lucymcgee a lot she used to advertise her shop on here so I guess it is like a market in that respect I think essentially this is just a forum like the hub only more chilled out.
I've been using Helix light and it seems good enough unless there's something better.
Which are the biggest and most popular of the markets at this time.
For info.
Quote from mps on June amis it not possible for a vendor with no feedback to in fact be LE Of course it is It is also very possible that a vendor with lots of feedback is LE If this possibility has only just occurred to you and you don't have a clear and satisfactory answer maybe it's a sign you're not ready to be playing around with it yet.
Well Evolution Abraxas and Middle Earth were not run by carders as far as we know but they exit scammed AB is the biggest market right now and everyone who got phished is complaining maybe there are some real problems and bugs going on but I don't see any other market who constantly improve things in favor of their customers They improved their security and always adding features What I see is other markets constantly bashing AB to get bad reputation And I think they won't exit scam just because they're carders They need the community they created.
Also as i said before in my country it's even easier to buy btc u go to a Cash machine in a wall wearing whatever u like and u put the address where u want the btcoins pay with cash and voila No way someone can trace u This machines are in public places and if u are scared of cameras u can go by nightime wearing a mask Why complicate things more when they work flawless this way Ok i see it someone somewhere has something to win out of this cool.
Update in original post.
Ironically I just posted in the MDMA section I was looking for a vendor of MDMA for personal amounts g and I'd love to sample yours before buying Please PM me details my key is on my signature You can check my recent commitments to samples with Zicot and SirLucy and see I always make good on a full deep trip report in a timely manner Thank you.
Agora is backup and running.
Which market do you prefer buying or selling on and why.
TAILS can be a pain with Wifi on new machines I find Works wonders on hunks of crap like old thinkpads bought for cash bricks are the way forward Have you considered Whonix VM instead.
Quote from bombheadie on March amJust an update ALL orders samples either were dropped off in the mail yesterday or today So expect your packs this week Has anyone else received their packs besides xncsux or Psymbionic.
Thanks I'm back on.
When I try to decrpyt a message I get this error decryption failed secret key not available I'm using a key a created myself in Tails then saved to a USB flash stick Any ideas what's wrong.
Ive heard nothing but great things from john i need to save up coin and jump on those microdots thats my dream.
i was able to order from him last month Arrived and had an awesome trip If he's really scamming then he must be doing it randomly Try to checkout the TMG Shrooms forum maybe you can find some trustworthy vendors.
Interesting when I wrote the word that has been replaced I got the following error message The following error or errors occurred while posting this message You are using forbidden words please improve your language It is d r e a m m a r k e t check it out.
Reddit is the complete opposite of lowkey and low visibility This is an important message and im sure most serious buyers vendors understand it.
HI Someone have this link I looking for new market for register I heard hydra pandora and drug market are a good website for make business So if somebody can give me link for register that's great Thank.

Very nic.
Quote from DMaTe on June pmWhen I try to decrpyt a message I get this error decryption failed secret key not available I'm using a key a created myself in Tails then saved to a USB flash stick Any ideas what's wrong This is likely because the key needed to decrypt is not loaded onto your system We often get this error when a customer has used a different key to encrypt their message often their own key mistakenly and we ask them instead to use our public key If you are using a key created yourself then all you have to do is load the private key that corresponds You can do this by locating the key right clicking and selecting Open With Import Key and you should get a notfication to say it's been loaded Be Good Sant.
Hi I'm looking for a marketplace where industrial mahinery and operation manuals are offered Does anyone have a suggestion on where to look.
Saw that No explanation as yet but Agora had closed lips in downtime and it never did them any harm only strengthening their reputation Think the yanks are still sleeping but I'm sure the reddit kids will get their popcorn out in the next hours.
I think I meet the minimum and I'd like to compare it to the ALD I get from Spain ug You probably know who I'm talking about May make an order for molly while I'm at it let's talk.
Very interesting take on a DNM market Nice.
Quote from Paranonymous on February amAll i really need is the great people of the garden Although i do really like the look and feel of DHL and plan on making a couple select orders there pretty soon to get things i can only get there Guess it depends what you need but yeah I'm perfectly happy with the vendors here as well and no risk of exit scams either.
Dream Market seem s to be pretty stable I've listed all my products there Give it a try Dream Market registration link.
Quote from Pretzel on January pmTo create a persistent volume you must boot from CD DVD or USB After that even if you booted from a USB drive you have to create a new USB drive by using the Tails installer and install by cloning This new USB drive will allow you to configure a persistent volume Yeah then that makes sense I was trying to create a persistent volume with the original usb drive Thanks.
I think if they really did sift through every message and order on SR and were charging people who didn't encrypt their address there would be a mass amount of arrests.
Is there any way to have this enabled by default.
You have everything you need right here.
Lelantos has had great uptime and I suggest them to everyone USSRmail was down half of the time so I switched over to lelantos Just make sure to encrypt everything and be careful about what you put for subject headers.
Just confirming that all commissions have been disabled on Acropolis Market until the th of April Thank you.
Due to the recent news about Ag I figured I would do a little bit of research to see where everyone is moving Total Listings Drug Listings Vendor Fee Agora BTC Alphabay BTC Nucleus BTC Abraxas BTC Middle Earth BTC Oxygen FREE Dream BTC DHL Amazon BTC Silkkitien BTC East India Company BTC Mr Nice Guy BTC Outlaw BTC DNM listing count as of All the sites have open registration except Abraxas if you need an invite there is one in my signature.

There have been a lot of posts on reddit about security issues The site itself looks nice and multi sig only is a plus I have a vendor account there just waiting for a little bit to put up listings SCIdm.

Quote from Organix on March pmThey don't really have fa though many have requested it They have optional pgp login but you can't set it up so that no one can login without both password and pgp so its kind of weak I have to enter both my password and then a decrypted code.
TMG is more like a hook up market you can converse with vendors or customers alike and strike up a relationship of sorts share info etc not a market in the traditional sense of the word.
I believe it did have a rebound effect in that way I remember when she laid on her death bed she had just had a stroke and she was staring off into space into what seemed like an abyss she was a little responsive if I said something she would grunt I felt like she was still making thoughts out but something else was going on in her mind I looked at her and I gently kissed her on the forehead and asked her What do you see Do you see something beautiful Is it the most beautiful thing you've ever seen in your life She made a slight sound nothing legible I said it's ok if you can't tell me just blink twice if what you see is the most beautiful thing you've ever seen and she blinked twice right then and there I knew I was communicating with her during a long experience with death she had a stroke and died days later and was in that state the whole time but when that moment happened I knew she was seeing something unlike anything before like she was experiencing nothing but bliss and beauty things only humans can truly appreciate I always ask If you where the universe this great big endless expansive universe what would you want more than anything and the answer to me has always been Someone to appreciate my existence I had this realization when I realized that without a conscious entity living in the universe it would be as if the universe didn't exist We are here for a reason and that is to admire and appreciate the beauty the universe has and to live and love and manifest beauty in every way we can however we can even in the face of adversity because if we don't We may as well consider ourselves asleep.

I'd have to say my problem child drug is alcohol For a while I was getting damn near black out drunk several times a week I don't get aggressive or anything on alcohol but if I'm experiencing tons of anxiety sadness in my daily life when sober I find that carries on into my drunken state and I wind up getting pretty severely depressed I've always loved how confident anxiety free alcohol has had the power to make it and that's what's always drawn me to it I had quit drinking entirely for a while after a very beautiful and insightful LSD trip but some due to some negative circumstances in my life I have since relapsed but I am gradually decreasing the amount that I drink I don't believe in total abstinence from anything that I enjoy so I may always enjoy a few drinks in moderation here or there I've dabbled in making some home brew in the past and I'd love to do it again but it would be very easy for me to get carried away when I have that much alcohol at my disposal.

I'd wait a while before announcing things like that All my coins seem to be where I've left them.
Quote from goodfornothing on April pmQuote from uncleal on April pmHere TMG is in a league of it's own and entirely different I meant commission taking escrow offering money handling markets of the risk your capital kind not this open honest trust based forum that asks nothing in return for letting people find each other and communicate freely And there's no risk of take down This isn't really a marketplace it's just a network There's nothing ilegal about this forum.
this Tails update works as a charm best one so far Make sure you backup that wallet seed somewhere safe other than your persistent drive cheers.
Quote from uncleal on February pmQuote from KnucklesFromSR on February pmThis trial should of been extremely highly publicized From everything that I read this makes it so that website owners can be held responsible for what their users do And yea the whole thing was rigged a mess Apparently from what his family was saying they denied a lot of evidence from the defense from even being presented I wouldn't be surprised if the whole thing was rigged I think they're trying to make an example of Ross and disuade from anyone following in his footsteps very likely although from the rise of other markets the fact that evo and agora are still up and the further development of p p networks like Bitmessage etcI doubt they can do much to STOP it Deter yes but those who are TOP Notch in their OPSEC and know how to make robust websites The ONLY shot they have is to get in on the inside like they did AND Ulbricht dropped his guard sadly They knew exactly how to lure him by having him goto a specific admin page See but he already was flagged months prior because of his 'email' flub The weakest link dxuutxThat is correct If Ross had made the markets in a way that said 'do whatever you want here but I don't condone nor tolerate any illegal activity'and did not specifically have 'drug listings' they would of had nothing The vendors could have made their own special product listings perhaps using code words which were only known via clearnet channels or irc eg then Ross could not be held liable If even if those posts listings were not taken down that is not necessarily condoning or allowing Ross could have just defended by saying it was an oversight And I am sure even in the clearnet that there have been PM deals conducted over shroomery irc google groups etc again private engagement between forum usenet members is never in anyway something for which site admins could be held responsible so long as they assume plausible deniability.
I know it is hard to trust people on these forums given situation I for one woulld like to say to you BombHeadie I am so very sorry that you had to go through all this I had someone die in my arms it never goes away completly I wish you the best durring this difficult time Thank you for your generousity in the past I will look forward to seeing you here in the future Peace be with you.
Quote from Doses Lysergic on January amQuote from dxuutx on December pmIf anything this is more proof that HoS or whoever is a major target of law enforcement and that we really shouldn't be talking about this business on the clearnet anywhere than any notion that the whole sub is just a honeypot I think the arrogant sense that people on the sub have that their crimes aren't worthy of targeting from law enforcement these are people who live to make drug arrests I also think it's a bit alarmist to assert that it exists only for this purpose and that no worthwhile discussion takes place thereon And it's not insignificant seemingly to me that HoS didn't have any overt problems with reddit when the reviews were adulatory and the attitude changed when they started to turn critical Lol speak english its not insignificant it is not not significant when you use a double negative you obscure your meaning thereon this word has been used not since again not one knows what the fuck not insignificant' again that 'hos didn't' have a problem when the reviews were positive adulatory if you yern to be not unlike Leo Tolstoy well then i'll just not continue writing now By not insignificant I mean to caution against thinking the timing is insignificant as one may I'm sorry you have a problem with the way I speak I don't think it invalidates my points.
Thanks again dude you're a very helpful person.
Yeah I have imported the key and everything.
Assume you create a Blockchain wallet that you access ONLY through Tor with no email connected to your real name or IP email address would be through an overseas service How secure is it to transfer BTC straight from thatwallet to a vendor for a purchase Or should I use a coin tumbling service regardless.
I can see domestic weed Vendors doing it from borrowed WiFi using TAILs and generally having bullet proof OpSec no one cares about weed anymore like they did the vendors aren't really giving anything away except raising their profile a bit I used a vendor that advertised there no problems for the buyer though its probably ok to browse it if you must from a secondary device but don't post especially pictures I think that might be what's going on since every reviewthey want pix maybe watermarks or extra strings in the jpeg headers or something its the people buying from abroad big amounts of MDMA that the le want and it sounds like halfof the people are on amphetamine selling MDMA which is fine but dangerous Weed is only as much penalty as MDMA per gram federally in US with added for import and even legal decrim most places not hating on the hustle it should be somewhat mystery and not admitting to where you are how far from source etc a good review just say on TMG it got here and it was good deal then describe your experience r DNM doesn't do that it makes it all about documenting the persons drug deal I feel bad bro but fuck that then there's the smack n crack n meth reviews the place is like the skid row of the markets I swear because anyone can write on it with a phone and maybe WiFi even if it isn't networked stay safe folks.
I love Apple it's great I have been using it and the vendor base is growin.
Quote from Doses Lysergic on January amIt's v its Got it Lazy on my part Language is a reflection of culture and culture changes over time To use outmoded language is improper in my opinion We don't use words such as thereupon anymore because they are superfluous figures of speech Thereupon has no necessary meaning and really no meaning at all it is just word filler It's an old fashioned fancy equivalent of like The word I used was thereon which doesn't mean anything like like In this context it's just a more concise way of saying on the subreddit in question I don't think there's any basis for arguing that it's an archaic word or that nobody uses it anymore I see it often enough Again I don't know why we're so hung up on language here I was trying to make a a serious argument clearly and logically You've seen two reasoned arguments for the rhetorical use of the double negative and have failed to address either only repeating your earlier assertion just as you failed to address the actual substance of my post in the first place Either way on thoroughly derailing this discussion.
Tbh ever since I became a part of the TMG family I have never went back to any actual market When I first started I swore by only going escrow The relationship between customers and vendors is unbelievable here in the garden Never have I felt so comfortable doing DD Today its been nothing but DD with success I sure hope it stays that way here Cheers.
I thought blackbank had a large fiasco a while back What happened with that was it a scam.
It's not even possible to log in atm because there is no captcha What's that all about.

ledger called the Block Chain This means anybody can see any transaction made see The tough part the part that makes Bitcoin the currency of choice for anonymous purchases is linking transactions to people To reduce the chances of transaction being traced back to yourself you can 'tumble' your Bitcoins Tumbling your Bitcoins is a way of swapping your original BTC for other people's BTC in order to sever your Block Chain trail This makes it more difficult for people to link your purchases to you It is important to Tumble your coins through either a Tor hidden service or using a wallet routed

you are using unless you ask it to explicitly encrypt your files emails and instant messages using state of the art cryptographic toolsLinux on a thumb drive or CD running Tails is widely usedVirtual Private Networks VPNs VPNs can offer an additional layer of protection HOWEVER not all VPNs are secure This article on DeepDotWeb can help you separate the good from the bad and the downright ugly NEW use these sites to see if you are really anonymous while your VPN is up running IP leaks testing resources DNSLeak Leak IP Leak is one of THE most important things for you to learn as it allows you to keep your communications between only yourself and the person you are talking to Take the time to learn PGP even if you do nothing else Windows to learn the difference between your Public Key and your Private Key failing to do so could ruin your efforts to remain anonymous Tor ProjectAlways check up on any updates that are made available as they are usually very important people are trying to break TOR all the time and many times these updates are designed to combat any faults found version of TBB is this version has an option when you select the onion and the dropdown appears there's now a Privacy and Security setting you can now adjust to diferent levels of privacy and security Physical Safety Harm ReductionYou are free to choose what you put into your body I believe that fully However you should make this choice only after fully informing yourself of the potential consequences Here are some great links Know what you blow Raging Hard onweogeta y onion KET MXE MDMA ETC A site for sharing knowledge and experience with chemicals that have an influence on how your brain works PILLS Testing ProductsThis trend in fake drugs is serious I have heard too many bad stories for my liking You can buy test kits at are on Ebay as well Do it and be safe Remember that buying a test kit is NOT a crime don't stop yourself buying a test kit because you're worried what it might say about you as a person it's always smart to keep yourself safe physically EmailAlways use encryption for personal safety I'm not a fan of email however I realize it's a necessary tool at times Use TOR at all times when accessing them and make sure all sensitive conversations are properly encrypted Lastly no one is sure that these e mail providers won t comply with Law Enforcement or that they are really private so treat this as information not an endorsement.
Currently waiting on btc for the past days now myself this is naturally worrying of course and I would not be worried at all if Agora could just answer my support message which they haven't over the past days but I guess this is the name of the game and if you deposit money you cannot afford to lose into a DNM well that's exactly what you shouldn't do Really just hope they get back to me soon even a little ''Don't worry we'll sort it for you eventually in coming time'' would make me a happy man because I trust Agora but I'd prefer a wee little bit of communication over a weeks period Anyone else have an update on anything Lepp.
Great idea I'm under the impression that if I have coins totally unlinked to me and I use a blockchain wallet only ever logging on through TOR then I am quite safe to send the coins to the vendor But for people who may have trouble getting coins that are totally unlinked to them Maybe some information about different tumbling options advantages disadvantages current status reputation etc would be helpful.
If you're really worried about security buy a laptop locally with cash and only use it for browsing DN however a TAILS USB is easy to use and offers basically equal security Never send any identifying incriminating information over Tor without PGP encryption or to an untrusted source and never trust any third party such as a market or even TMG to encrypt your messages for you As MirrorMirror said don't torrent over Tor You can use a VPN or proxy to torrent safely from your home TAILS automatically offers MAC spoofing by default across the board as well.
He was recently banned I bought g and at this point it's an unknown substance He won't reply to any messages or anything either I have bought a marquis and mandelin test that are on the way to help identify what this substance might be at first I was worried I had shitload of Nbome I tested MG and felt nothing I went ahead and smoked mg and blasted off into a stimulating euphoric extremely visual and actually very enjoyable experience with perfectly clear headspace I didn't feel once like I was at risk of death My heart rate and pressure remained normal Although I was already on about mg of Etizolam taken about hours before doing all this which who knows may have saved my life if I had OD'd I smoked mg first and felt no visuals but even slightly likely placebo but since it wasn't nbome i felt safe doing another mg and BAM wam I was gone to the moon and I didn't even finish smoking it The letters on my monitor where like I had just smacked my monitor and it went into boggle mode what I mean is it look like someone turned my monitor into a word I had tracers similar to when I had taken C C My guesses are that it's a c of some kind If i could just find out what I had I'd be happy because I love c's But the danger of not knowing is ever present Im going to mail a sample to ecstasydata org and pay to have to analysed For all I know it's a mix of drugs although color and consistency are all perfect I did a tinfoil burn test and it turned yellow then dark red burgundy and eventually black which is alot like what MDA does when burned on tinfoil and it smelled like MDA but shit we're talking bout burning random HCL salts and freebases here a tinfoil test is not foolproof Thank you for reading Edit wanted to add that I didn't know MXE wasn't allowed here when I originally posted this Will follow rules from now on.
Hey everyone I am trying to learn to navigate through tails I know that I must go to the 'Applications' drop down at the top of the window select 'Tails' then select 'Configure Persistent Volume' But what to I do in order to keep my PGP keys and text files and anything else Should I just select everything when I am configring the persistent volume Any helpful input is greatly appreciated UPDATE I figured it out I'm not sure why it wasnt allowing me to create a persistent volume besides the following possibilities I was using another usb drive a Lexar GB and maybe for some reason there is a bug in that type of drive I think there were more reasons but they have slipped my mind Long day at school beer I'll update if I remember All the best.
Hey everyone Update your PGP keys this was pointed out to me by another beautiful soul and realized they were right My key was old and leaked information like what operating system i had Not a major issue but you may want to consider it some examples of old key headers showing operation system and versions version GnuPG v GNU Linux BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK Version GnuPG v MingW BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK Version GnuPG v MingW SO take the few minutes to check you PGP and be safe update it and keep your old key in case someone needs to know you are who you are yes you can delete the header when you post but its still old This has been a public service message from the Mist love ligh.
I did try this I typed the text that I want to encrypt and saved the text file to the desktop Then I found the file in the file in the desktop folder hilighted it and selected Edit then selecting Encrypt It then allows me to check the key of the recipient After I do that it creates another file that ends in pgp This seems like it should work just fine but when I open the file it looks like there is heiroglyphic symbols mixed in with normal letters about of each Not sure what is going on still.

It seems safe in that it's a no taint mixer that works and won't run away with your coins be careful if you want to use it for a lot of coins though better make a few smaller transactions Use to addresses where the coins will be sent to as this really improve it's security as the fee is fixed it would be really easy to get back to the original transaction if you use only one address Random time adds something too The guy that runs grams seems to be a greedy person Maybe he logs everything and would give away all the information he haves if asked by LE There is no way to know Use more than one mixer if you need some real anonymity But remember that both mixers could be run by LE Buying alt and selling for new BTC can be a way make your BTC anonymous too Another mixer that seems good is bitblender always cross check url of those site and send a small payment first to try if it works well Good luck.
Needing some love for the summer just a sheet if this violates rules please remove Been looking on alpha and dream and thought to come here where the love is If any help its greatly appreciated Kinda new to TMG But have a almost year accnt on reddit if need to anyone wants to msg to verify i'm legit and been around thanks again brothers and sisters.

Hello guysWho has lost theyre money from Agora me and my friends wallets are empty.
BlackBank is gone Fuck those guys took my vendor fee and closed the site.
No I haven't I will see if that works Thank you.

Not to mention the bug that was found just a few hours ago I hope any AB users have been using PGP because a bunch of users dox has just been found via unencrypted pm's that were made available to the public due to the bug I would be shitting myself right now if had unencrypted pm's on AB Stay safe people H.
I have used Pay Shield a few times now with no problems Its super easy to use I like it so far.
Problem solved ME had locked my funds because I withdrew without making any purchases Funny that the whole Agora deposit problem happened almost simultaneously I was convinced that was the issue.
I'm confused Is Majestic Garden a marketplace just like Agora Evolution Nucleus etc If so where is the link to it.
Quote from MirrorMirror on September pmSomeone with more knowledge can feel free to correct me but it is my understanding that using a VM is almost never as safe as just using tails from a usb The reason for this is that you have to trust that there are no backdoors in the VM most likely there wouldn't be but if your are running your virtual machine on windows you can never be sure As for your other question your ISP can see that you are using tor but not what you do there Think of it as a helicopter watching you enter the subway Sure the helicopter knows that you're using the subway but it doesnt know where you are going to get off Using a VM would add an additional level of security if you're engaging in hacking activities Ideally you create a new MAC from your existing This includes spoofing of a new address This allows you to accomplish the same task as having a throw away computer in nearly every aspect except that you cannot just burn it Meaning delete the VM The way hard drives store information except SSD's are based on flags Deleting a file on your computer does not erase the bytes stored on the disk All this does is flip flags on thr hard drive letting the OS know this area is writeable To fully delete any fine on any computer you must overwrite the bytes at that sector This means your OS must write data back to the sector that flag exists at If you do not over write the data at that sector it is still recoverableIf you're interested in permanently erasing data I would recommend either writing a program in C that generatesa text file until the disk is full and deletes it or I would recommend downloading CCleaner and use Drive Wipe option But in anyca I do not think this is necesarry unless you're Edward Snowden and leaking classified documents from an organization You should be completely safe VPN'ing and using TOR from your home so long as A if you use wifi its encrypted a even if you have wifi encrypt it with a password Once on a network you can packet sniff all informationB Unless your ISP logs your activity If you want to practice safety the best way only access markets when not from your home And only buy when not from your home You don't ever need to be on a market unless you're looking at stock communicating with a vendor or placing a purchase.
All coins have made it safely into my anon blockchain wallet and are now ready to send to a vendor of my choice Yay c b for me Anyways Bit Blender is very quick and looks very legit i mean obviously USE THIS SERVICE WITH CAUTION AND AT YOUR OWN RISK as previously stated but really it helped reduce a lot of stress for me that normally goes along with cleaning btcs I know that I will be using bit blender again Thanks for the advice peace Mrs B.
According to someone on here I'm sending out terrible messages when I encrypt them I sent one to OOTD on here and a few others and I hope this hasn't been an issue I don't know what the fuck is going on right now and I'm flipping shit I just want to buy some drugs man not have more complications.
It came back up within a couple hours.
Quote from cotlakqueque on April pmI'm confused Is Majestic Garden a marketplace just like Agora Evolution Nucleus etc If so where is the link to it this is not correct.
Quote from Summa Iru on April pmRight now apart from TMG my favorite is Nucleus very professional user friendly interface easy on the eyes it works everytime i go to login and most importantly has a few of my favorite vendors with Agora so unreliable in my opinion it looks set to take over from EvoI like MiddleEarth but that's because i'm a crossbreed between an Elve and a Hobbit I can understand why you like Nucleus but I seem to have problems everytime I login and the images are nowhere to be found I hope they'll fix that soon.
I'm not big on markets everything I could possibly need is right here But if you are looking for something that's not here I would suggest Agora is the best option at.
Quote from Greenbud on March pm Well I don't have anything to say about grammar or syntax but I do have something to say about Reddit r DNM First of all it doesn't matter what the vector of attack or particular vulnerability is the problem is that correlation of aggregates and UIs unique identifiers can identify people just as much as posting pictures combined with site history or what have you all of this is irrelevant It is all information which can and will be aggregated and used against someone Talking about purchases on clearnet and getting into specific details about how business is conducted along with dangerously innacurate or biased information are threats After much lurking and reading I believe that some of the moderators of r DNM after analysis are informants I do not have proof other than psychological traits from stylography and demeanor I have been on internet forums and chats since the days of Gopher when CERN had the only webpages People give away quite a bit when they talk and that is something that makes a clearnet site dangerous They have a corporate structure and have to abide by regulations and I do no trust Conde Naste reddits owners anymore than I trust Wal Mart or CostCo This is why I tell people to stay clear of RC vendors that take Paypal or CCs on the clearnet they can be compelled to provide evidence against you On Reedit lol they can track if you go to A B and C subreddit after browsing r DNM don't need money you go to r furry or r worldnews and then you browse r gratefuldead r LSD etc then you log in tommorow then the next day do the same thing there could be a UI even if you use TOR I have been told that using JavaScript on TOR alone cannot reveal your identity IF your browser is set correctly but there are a number of settings in TBB which can be queried and further added to a UI of a user So while grammar might not be the issue there are issues and at least onion forums are not owned by corporate media won't encourage you to do risky shit someone on actually recommended that no one order MDMA domestically in the US because Canada is foolproof and cheaper because they want people to take risky orders the LE want people to break the law and brag about it publicly I don't take sides in this shit but after Evo I'm feeling negativity on a whole other level from r dnm and while we will still read your shilly reviews I have not and will never post or login to that section of the website or browse it outside of a totally new TOR connection with scripts off and cache cleared I suggest others do the same don't post comment its a trap and not a good one like in r trapmusic or r traphouse or what have you thanks for reading out Thanks for the awesome advice.
Quote from sillywabbit on February amQuote from uncleal on February amQuote from sillywabbit on February pmvery likely although from the rise of other markets the fact that evo and agora are still up and the further development of p p networks like Bitmessage etcI doubt they can do much to STOP it Deter yes but those who are TOP Notch in their OPSEC and know how to make robust websites The ONLY shot they have is to get in on the inside like they did Agree The cats already out of the bag and LE knows it and that's percisely the reason why LE turns to scare tactics because they know they can't do anything about it legally at least But more and more bills keep being brought up that would allow LE and the NSA to infringe on our rights even more and this also needs to be addressed and stopped yep like who knows how about just warrantless opening of people's mail How about cameras installed in peoples' homes bathrooms floors in your body I think these LEO will either continue on or maybe their policies will become some extravagant and rediculous that they will see the absurdity in it all especially when it is obvious none of it is bettering society In fact it will all just lead to greater discontent more acts of violence and revolt Look at alcohol prohibition They need to just stop But I see the next step will be some kind of USPS control system maybe a change in our internet laws but whatever we are in the digital age hackers rule and it cant be stopped freedom fighters will find a way around anything One thing I've wondered lately is there a noticeble surge in MAIL and even so it's just more of the same thing but im sure their is profiling and thats why vendors gotta switch it up allot make packs look plain and unassuming I jst dunno how vendors can just drop s of packs a week and not be suspect oh and maybe blue boxes will get replaced by control centers that are monitored with scanners that have cameras too it could get that crazyMaybe a new decentrailized mail service is need.
With this sort of system the vendor is particularly in danger of being scammed by the customer Why would anyone decide to sell on this marketplace.
I call it apple because I feel that people will resonate with the brand and feel that they know it Apple is one of the most valuable brands in the world People all over should know it Moreau Filters will be coming up in a few days Stay Tuned pastorseeu Our strength as a market lies in our simplicity We want the market to be as intuitive as possible So that People can Use it Naturally.
play a little bit with the electrum btc wallet u find inside Tail.
Sorry guys to make such a with XMR or CLOAK altcoins on this kind and fun psychedelic forum but why keep a BTC steam machine that is proven to regulary explode and spread your privacy on a large scale when there are new robust XMR Tesla cars specifically designed to avoid anonymity holes on every road Tried to make the best image I could but it's really so in the present day The new modern tools exist they work and have been tested and validated and continue to be improved actively developped now vendors and customers only need to make effort to integrate them to the market system for the safety of everybody As opposite Bitcoin only prove more and more every day that it directly leads to you in a way or other and there are more and more new tools every day to quickly and better trace BTC use to the identity of users I apologize my English is very bad.
I agree Oasis is pretty awesome It is a nice looking site it is designed well Can someone explain the donation thing though So there is absolutely no fees that they demand Its just what you feel like donating If so that sure is different and very respectable But I sure do hope that people are donating so they have the drive to stay legit and grow in popularity.
I don't see what apple has over hansa or TMG.
I have an update but it's unfortunate I've decided that this isn't worth it for me I'd still very much like to do it but I haven't received nearly as much support as I'd of liked Generally everyone appears to agree that this is a good idea But considering I'm risking a potential of life in prison for orchestrating designing and running a criminal enterprise I cannot do this until I have more support from vendors and from the community If there are any developers out there you can have my ideas for free Send me a PM and we can discuss the concepts Or if you're a vendor that wants to support me on this send me a message and we can discuss.
I think Nucleus is the best market around and it has gained my trust Nucleus is also very secure with all the security features including FA etc longevity and importantly it is DoS DDoS proof with rotating url links DHL isn't as well stocked and I find it's UI to be far too overly complicated and gimmicky The primary Nucleus url is nucleuspf izq o onio.
Quote from Pretzel on January pmTo create a persistent volume you must boot from CD DVD or USB After that even if you booted from a USB drive you have to create a new USB drive by using the Tails installer and install by cloning This new USB drive will allow you to configure a persistent volume Is it possible to find this guide in youtube.
Sorry for confusing you Dolmio It is Middle Earth who have this rule not Agora My case was nothing to do with Agora after all.
Quote from nordicwhite on November amCan anyone recommend a good burner laptop for darknetmarket shopping vending use mostly large shopping I plan to use TAILS on usb or dvd ASUS C Inch Chromebook ARM Tails not available for ARM yetUsed or refurbished ThinkPad X Used or refurbished ThinkPad T All three should be under and support free and open source firmware BIOS through ThinkPads can be easily repaired with cheap replacement parts As they are popular enterprise laptops it's easy to find refurbished ones in good condition.
if it were me i'd take the acid first and less that what you propose and then in hours take the other two together never done all at once though so please report back after your experience.
Does anyone here know if macbooks work ok with TAILS I read before that some of them do not work well with TAILS but can't find out which ones do or dont if anyone has any info let me know.
I haven't made any transactions on Middle Earth yet but hot damn it's a pleasure to navigate Fast and silky smooth And nice to look at The fact that they have a shopping cart feature is a huge plus imo I'd imagine that's as convenient for vendors as it is buyers BlackBank feels clunky to me Pages seem to take longer than they should to load The text is hard to read Always having to zoom in which causes everything to be crammed in And of course no shopping cart like Agora purchasing multiple listings from a vendor is more complicated and time consuming than it needs to be On a more positive note I do appreciate their deposit withdrawal speed btw I'm glad to see you're still around GFN.
Quote from pinto on November pmhmm good question I'm not sure about the safety between the two I use an online wallet blockchain That might be a good post if this doesn't get much attention Make sure you google or use the search function and see if a topic has already been posted about the difference in safety and reliability in a downloaded vs online wallet Thanks and best of luck Feel free to ask anymore questions you have I'm more than happy to help out I'll probably just use blockchain as well then I don't want to risk downloading anything So paxful with chrome transfer it over to your wallet on tails and tor What if I wanted to use helix How would I do that and is it worth it Also just in case I don't figure this out how exactly would I transfer stuff to my wallet or through helix and then to my wallet.
It's v its Got it Lazy on my part Language is a reflection of culture and culture changes over time To use outmoded language is improper in my opinion We don't use words such as thereupon anymore because they are superfluous figures of speech Thereupon has no necessary meaning and really no meaning at all it is just word filler It's an old fashioned fancy equivalent of like A linguistic anacronism Similarly the use of double negatives just obscures your true meaning and while they are english words they do no convey a clear meaning as the English language should Historically this use of language served as a separation between economic and racial classes While I will admit there is still such a thing as class in modern society I am happy to say that language is not a barrier between them.
Just seeing this now after being here for quite a while thank you But this should really be default shouldn't it.
Quote from DelicFriend on August amQuote from bruce on August pmQuote from anon on August amThis place is really cool I just made an account and have been browsing the boards I too was expecting a market but honestly this is way better There's already a ton of markets this is a COMMUNITY Exactly Welcome to the garden I appreciate the welcome any advice for starting to join conversations Read Get the feel for the different forums and ask questions if you need help with something Shoot me a PM if you have any questions about OPSEC PGP etc.
I have no idea about the volumetric dosing I still have yet to do any big doses of mxe meo Ive found that low doses do what they have to do so I don't want to really get into the higher dosing I just want to take the minimum needed for it to make me happy One really great thing with meo is that it has eliminated certain pains in my body that make it incredibly hard to sleep or sometimes do stuff during the day Just the other week I was looking for weed in order to sleep but now when I take meo it just makes everything go away and I'm able to actually fall asleep within an hour Sorry to hear about your grandma Truffle After it all wore off did it have any rebound effect making it any easier harder to deal with her death.
Even if its SSL encrypted its still possible for the receiving server USPS to notice that this requests comes from an TOR exit node Given what we nowadays know about surveillance I wouldn't take any chances Rather use a VPN good Proxy SOCK from a public network When it comes to you worrying about mac addresses fake it.
Thanks So big market only agora right now The problem it's it don't works anymore now Except Agora only little market right thanks for your answe.
Or would you be more interested in a small onetime fee to learn how to easily do it yourself.
Would this method be sufficient LBC Wallet Clearnet MultiBit wallet Clearnet Helix or BitBlender DNM.
Quote from Cosmic Consciousness on April amQuote from throwaway account on April amWell Evolution Abraxas and Middle Earth were not run by carders as far as we know but they exit scammed AB is the biggest market right now and everyone who got phished is complaining maybe there are some real problems and bugs going on but I don't see any other market who constantly improve things in favor of their customers They improved their security and always adding features What I see is other markets constantly bashing AB to get bad reputation And I think they won't exit scam just because they're carders They need the community they created I'll correct you real quick Evolution was known to be run by carders Middle Earth and Abraxas we have no idea as to what sort of nefarious characters ran those BOth of which burned me a combined k BUThey Thats what you get as part of operating in the space It's in the nature of the elements Yeah you're correct my mistake I haven't used it much though so I don't remember if they had carding section However my argument was that carders or not does not change much We don't know who we are dealing with either way.
i havent gotten my btc yet either withdrew two days ago yall figure it will still come i hope i dont lose like i did on blackban.
Another thing you can do is to buy bitcoins normally with the idchecks and whatnot and then tumble them around obfuscate so to speak TL DR have clearnet bitcoin wallet tied to your irl name then have darknet bitcoin wallet which in theory should be really hard to link to your irl person.
Nucleus seems to be where all my domestic sellers ar.
sounds like he's stringing you along dude still might come through but that's whack as hell regardless no real excuse for that lack of comms if he does make it right I still wouldn't mess with him.
Export your public key Left click on the clipboard icon on the top right menu bar and select Manage Keys Make sure that GnuPG keys is selected in the left pane of the new window Left click on your PGP key to select it in the right pane of that window Type Ctrl C or do Edit Copy from the menu bar for that window Your public key is now in the clipboard You can paste it out to a gedit window Applications Accessories gedit Text Editor to make sure that it looks good Paste it out to the PGP text entry area in your profile on the market place.
WarningI got a massage from a very trusted vendor and they asked me not to say who it was for thier security this is a warning part from his massage DO NOT USE REDDIT please spread everywhere that reddit darknet markets is just a honeypot All arrests or whatever it was the only thing in common was having posting there Scripts as ever are still not safe In fact the tor project themselves should be notifed about that reddit registration page and figure it out I guess I dont have tell anyone here that but its good to remind you Dont use the same name on the DN for any clearnet sites and dont buy drugs there Just asking for troubleBe SafeLSDAACID.
ES Okay thanks for the info It kind of spooked me out yesterday Jf There is no such thing as We Love Avengers marketplace the word has just been put in there by the admins to stop someone from spamming this place the original reference was to d r e a m m a r k e t.
I can't respond as a buyer don't have any experience with depositing funds there But as a seller its all crickets over there Not a lot of activity for mushrooms I've found In light of that though the few transactions I've had went smooth customers finalized and I was able to transfer my funds Several hundred dollars out of the system into my own wallets easily and with no hassle So grain of salt Galindo.
This is cool I have been looking forward to Bicylce day for a while now.
I downloaded tails and got everything set up but for some reason it won't connect to the internet It says that I am connected has the blue bars but the videlia sp onion is nowhere to be found and I can't get on Tor or the unsafe web browser I've tried unspoofing that didn't work I tried to put in a bridge and it wouldn't go through i guess i put it in wrong i don't know how though I don't know what else to try and i've been going at this for two days now Any help is very appreciated Thank youSnow.
Thanks for adding Hansa Death to centralized markets.
I don't meet the minimum but I do promise to post a review I have never tried ALD and would love to so dibs.
Thank you for understanding and replying sciDMT this was more of a venting location I was so stressed IRL and could not speak to anyone about it I almost wish there was a DNM therapist for times like this some people just need to talk it out however it's hard to open up to people in the real world abou this type of thing Agora fixed the deposit and I'm speaking with my vendors to get my orders out now Agora came through like they always do but this is the reason why majority of business should be done off market I think marketplaces are a good spot for buyers to find vendors however there should be no reliance on a third party agora ie site administrators to fix and or overlook transactions Last time I go through website marketplace I trust agora and they came through for me but in real life I was a mess for days straight just on the hook of if I own my money anymore or not.
Quote from marbled on March amWas hoping to make an order from bomb in the upcoming weekend week but I'm going to hold off until more successful landings occur Nothing against bomb but talking about drugs you don't have yet multiple large extended posts reporting current drugs only two small posters saying they had landings one a guest looks quite strange to one who has been in the darknet rc scenes since the beginning Especially since domestic usually only takes but a week at most I'm hoping deeply that he's not a malignant vendor but just felt like expressing my concerns Looking forward to a positive conclusion Marbled The reason my other post went to guest is b c I deleted my account in frustration with the Zicot thing but I realized that was not the best idea so I reactivated my account but I did receive my sample as bombheadie promised and decent stealth but one minor issue Still have not tried the ALD yet but will in the near future Hope this helps L L.
Yeah nothing happens Weird indeed Thanks anyhow.
Nice post SnackTime will stay on Agora and TMG exclusively until further noticeCheers S.
Are the withdrawals working for everyone now I had a small change back on the site but i've nicely forgotten about it since it went down Would be nice if they returned it back with an interest.
Yeah Agora's been in limbo for a while now I would advise you not to deposit or accept any money there until it's been stable for a while Great market when it's more stable but this has been a bad time.
Honestly guys I have no Idea why some pack shows and some packs didn't They were packed the same exact way to blend in with millions of other pieces of mail I'm about sure that I sent out every sample out to eveyrone who asked for onee However I went through my stash the other day and I saw a prewrappwed sample of ALD in there So there might be a chance that I misses someone Can al you guys that recieved yours packs and the the guys that didn't recieve your packs please let me know Im now starting to think this is a misstake on my end Much love guys B.
Definitely interested in some ALD.
Just an update ALL orders samples either were dropped off in the mail yesterday or today So expect your packs this week.
Quote from Alberthoffman on March pmAre you working for agora defending them dude why the hell should i lie about swedish sek on my bitcoint wallet on agora that was stolen i read on other forums like reddit that it happened another guy to they stole hes money and they answered him on support that he had some keylogger virus that got into hes wallet thats bullshit my computer is secure as possible im working with IT and computer in my eyes they are scammers and i wont deposit there anything moreHow long ago did you send a message to support there and what did they say.

Hey guys I now have more spots open for hits of ALD I also have more spots open for g of MDMA If interested PM me Much love TMG B.
Is the address for blockchain info through tor I think you have to have java script enabled for most of the functions to work And use Helix to wash coin.
I am back and active with premium LSD just having trouble figuring how to be listed as an active member again You can check my feedback on alphabay or search grams Thanks L.
Quote from on March pmGot it you're reselling SB's MDMA Good to know Glad to see no other actives no problem in my opinion I saw Rex's had like caffeine cut which is fine I just don't ever want to see any amphetamines etc I'm a class psychedelic LSD Mushrooms DMT Mescaline MDMA Cannabis type of guy and don't want anything else no alcohol no coke etc gotta decalcify that third eye more EDIT Forgot to say thank you for the quick reply Thank you Definitely From the stuff I've tried from other multiple vendors I like SB's stuff the best So do my customers I hear ya on that one Ever since I started eating more LSD than anything I quit drinking Completely With that being said for some reason when I eat ALD I like to throw back a few beers Why I'm not quite sure lol.
I was on aa hour or so ago with no problems This happens from time to time with them.
Any advice on cleaning my computer now that I am using tails exclusively whereas before I was using windows Does tor store any information about sites visited onto my computer or do I only need to worry about deleting pgp keys and such What's the best way to go about completely wiping these things Anything else I should be worried about What are the risks associated with enabling scripts on blockchain or reddit.
Early June.
It's not a forum setting for starters but it's a simple change in the forum code I don't know why they haven't done it yet.
if you can't pay the drop cash or in btc then you need to cultivate another drop with fake information Could be renting a house they don't need to know your name or anything about you just what you give them or you can find someone in a pinch but has a sofa Could be someone you meet in a bar and you are passing through town there are an infinite number of ways to craft your story But that's all about the drop first you have to disconnect your clear net fingerprint from your identity This all would be great advice for someone looking to take security seriously but really you can just do BTC GYFT etc consumer site if you just don't want it on your CC bill.
This place is so much better than any market I've ever been a part of.
I thought so too didnt take too long to figure out it's more like Craigslist than eBay Still in my limited experience a better forum than the Reddit one.
I'm sure you are correct most of the mods are carders and thieves who don't need a second invitation to steal someone's coins.
They always seem to come back and manually process btc transactions if need be or times it's happened now they must be making real good commission money.
Having the same issue Im so close.
Why is this even an option at all No real reason to have this on just an extra pattern to be analyzed Stalking your fellow TMGers is never appropriate If you are refreshing your page waiting for your vendor to sign in so they can reply to your PM then maybe you don't have the patience to fully appreciate these great chemicals.
Love you man.
I personally don't care if people see I'm online as I'm here to help newbs and such some people want to appear as online there is enough traffic now that correlation is reallyonly a concern for people already under surveillance if you are chances are you shouldn't be ordering anything on the darknet if you are here for the conversation not the vendors I don't see why it shouldn't be an option it is a minor dent in your opsec hardly something that should be mandatory AFAIK the forum software automatically opts in so if you want to opt outfeel free to I'm not because I like getting PMs in real time its your choice.
What link is that Will search the forums for it.

Hi all I've had a hell of a time with bugs in gpg win encrypting messages I ended up downloading an older version and it seems to be working but not sure because I can't encrypt messages to other people If someone could help me can you please leave your public key and ill use it to encrypt a message here and i'll paste the message back If you could go ahead and decrypt it and let me know if it didn't show up blank I would great appreciate it Thank you in advance.
seems like alphabay nucleus and abraxas are the best alternate markets right now I do like the look of haven but only time will tell if they are reliable or not On a side note agora is working well right now maybe they got their problems worked out.
yea Abraxas has most of the vendors and some support but i like to keep an eye on most of the others as you can pick up a lot of info that you wouldn't otherwise I have just started looking at TMG i did look briefly ages ago but could not find the market url but now iv come back and taken a closer look thats quite funny what a twat i am I dont know yet if this is the site for me i suspect not for buying but if could well turn out to be a better forum to talk in general regarding all the other markets vendors specific drugs Abraxas forum is such a PITA with its captcha that everyone and his dog comments about but they wont change it The hub is ok but it seems like there are many more users on here Apart from abraxas i have used dream market i have accounts on most of the others but have never actually traded on them i say why expose yourself to more markets than you absolutely have to have even got a vendor on Necules to start up on abraxas just so i could buy from him turned out he had crap but thats life in the day of a drone head in UK nowadays frigging joke.
I hope this isn't a silly question but is there an alternate url for Ag I know a few other markets have given out alternate addresses since initially going down this last time I've only been able to log onto Ag once since then and am not sure if I overlooked it or what.
Just an Update AlphaBay is now the biggest market with abraxas being down for the time being Vendor Buyer Registration would highly recommend using dream though as they are the longest running and most reliable DNM to dateDream Registration link.

I am pleased to announce a brand new DarkNet market called ACAS Like other DarkNet Markets before us our focus is on selling controlled substances We can confidently say that the only thing common between ACAS and other DarkNet markets is that we are all on TOR and we are all focused on facilitating the sale of selling controlled substances With ACAS we hope to have created a DarkNet Market with a superior user experience to other DarkNet Markets ACAS aims to be extremely user friendly and we will listen to our vendors and users to implement features they suggest to us so that they can have a DarkNet Market built to meet the requirements of it's users Referrals You can only Join ACAS Market by Invite Every user has a special referral invite link You can find this link on the right hand side of the settings page Vendor Friendly ACAS is vendor friendly and we will reward vendors who invite the most people with their referral URL Any vendor with any specific request or complaint can always contact us and we will do our utmost best to make sure that vendor gets what he wants Commissions ACAS will offers our vendors commission until January st after that the commissions will be So vendors can always offer the best prices for their products to DarkNet users on ACAS Two Factor Authentication ACAS offers two factor authentication using PGP to enhance the security and privacy of our users accounts All you have to do is upload a PGP key to ACAS on the settings page Speed ACAS currently loads very fast We will make it remain that way and as we grow we know it will get slower So ACAS will always make significant investments to boost hardware capacity and network bandwidth so that you can spend less time waiting for page loads and more time browsing ACAS and placing orders Customer Support ACAS is a great marketplace easy to use with awesome Customer support ACAS will respond promptly to user messages and try to resolve issues quickly and if there is any Problem we will get back to You ASAP We have a dedicated support team that is solely committed to customer support Encryption Everything on ACAS is encrypted so much that even if a server was seized it would be impossible to retrieve any data Every body using ACAS is safe including users vendors and it's operators With ACAS your data is in competent hands Security ACAS is impenetrable to XSS attacks SQL injections and most attacks geared at taking down a DarkNet market We can boast that with our current implementation you will never lose any coins to a security breach Product Listings Over the next few weeks ACAS will be working very hard to attract some well known vendors to our market We will do all we can to get the best vendors with the best prices to ACAS So watch out for our new vendors Mobile For those who prefer to use mobile devices our market has a mobile version that will display properly on small screens and can be used on android with orbot though for increased security it's always preferable to use a computer running Free Open Source Software like Tails All Vendors we invited are all welcome to join ACAS Market Our Sub Reddit PGP ONION URL Invite URL ACAS Managemen.
JOR has an alternate key for people having just this issue it was his main key that was giving troubl.
yeah I just tried to log into DHL to check if my order had shipped apparently that's down as well this is a message from the forum We are sorry something went wrong with the deployment I only noticed that right now Since I need multiple signatures to change this system specific permission I took the market down for a few hours to avoid any data corruption We'll be back within hrs maximum I'll keep you updated sig.
Sample received very decent stealth will report back in due time after testing the ALD Thanks bombheadie Everything looks good.
Quote from bombheadie on March amThat list is not correct at all I sent samples You only have peple saying they received theirs person I missed and it will be in the mail tomorrow and I'm not sure what is going on with the other guy But that list of people never confirmed their addresses with me What am I supposed to do with that weeks and still no communication from vendor Just FYI my order was placed before the laptop incident Edit I was on the list of but you did confirm my order and told me it would be sent out the next day Please send an update.
Quote from Serendripity on June pmI've been using Helix light and it seems good enough unless there's something better Bitcloak is new and good Quote from the owner The differences compared to other tumblers mixers like helix or payshield are many the amounts prediction javascript checks and PGP implementation are not present in others Another big difference is speed no tumbler currently is this fast when sending clean coins Like payshield it offers a pay someone feature for exact amounts payment.
More specifically I want to buy something that I do not want to be related to my identity I will have it shipped to a safe drop but they only accept credit cards Non DN related What is the best way to go about procuring this some way to go from BTC anon bank drop credit cardwith a socks any help would be appreciated Thank yo.
Didn't know where else to put this but is there some setting I'm not seeing to adjust the number of listings on a page I like the market but this is super annoying.
Start a new account and contact them on that one Tell them your username and that you forgot your password Usually if you know what btc address you have withdrew with they will resest it Good luck.
What about Safe bad Anyone know.
So im having some trouble im re establishing my buisness both on agora and TMG after i hit a rough patch i do not wish to discuss you may read about it in my other thread if you wish im starting out with a new email Lelantos i've decided that slacking on email security is not going to cut it anymore i also was having trouble getting my DYMO Labelwriter to print through tails if someone can walk me through this that would be S.
Someone with more knowledge can feel free to correct me but it is my understanding that using a VM is almost never as safe as just using tails from a usb The reason for this is that you have to trust that there are no backdoors in the VM most likely there wouldn't be but if your are running your virtual machine on windows you can never be sure As for your other question your ISP can see that you are using tor but not what you do there Think of it as a helicopter watching you enter the subway Sure the helicopter knows that you're using the subway but it doesnt know where you are going to get off.
Quote from scroat on April pm but I wanna order now yeah ffs these vendors seriously need to set up a paypal account.
Quote from Jojen on November pmI am not sure if it is clever to use tor for your coinbase account I assume you want to buy bitcoin via a bank transfer In that case your real identity will be linked to your coinbase account anyway so no reason to use tor Buy the coins using your clearnet browser then transfer them to a wallet not linkable to you you create and access this wallet only through tor and from there to the market vendor you want to buy from You can also configure tor browser to pick exit nodes from a specific country see good way to anonymously get bitcoin besides coinbase is localbitcoins com It allows you to buy bitcoins in person or via cash deposit or bank transfer directly from other people I don't have a bank account Typically I just put money on a card I get from the dollar store that isn't re loadable What website would you recommend to purchase bitcoins with this disposable card other than localbitcoins really And what wallet would you recommend and should I get Helix.
I didn't include AlphaBay in my poll because I didn't realize it had the userbase that it now does and new markets without many users I'm weary ofbut after checking it out I like what I see I have a good feeling about it Decently feature rich some new ideas I could really see some of the features or ideas behind features there being improved in cool ways that would make them a little more useful I like seeing a market that has unique or less common features to me that's a sign that they value improving the service and that there's a decent likelihood of site improvements I dislike that a lot of markets tend to stay the same when they feel they've got the essentials down when innovative features could really imrpove the overall experience I realize we've got this dillemma where it seems all markets inevitable exit scam or get busted but amusing the very hypothetical possibility that multiple markets see a lot of growth and outlast people's expectations with integretiy and by eluding law enforcement organizations I'd like to see people gravitate towards the ones that are well designed feature rich and offer a streamlined vending experience of oustanding efficiency minimal redundancy tediousness and anything that would improve the customer experience too I'm of the mindset that improving the vendor side experience where heavy work loads can be much more manageable with the right features design is potentially as good for buyers as it is for vendors because the more efficiently we are able to work the better our customer service will be and some vendors will likely even charge less where the work process is less tedious and more efficient because they will be able to accomplish more in less time I know I would there's a handful of features that I'd outright lower my prices right away for and other features that would make me want to do frequent temporary discounts.
It Necessary to tumble bitcoins before transfering to a markets wallet Can they track if I am sending bitcoin to a marketplace from a personal bitcoin account.
My verdict is in Nucleus is where it's at for me right now Does anyone else find the interface on BlackBank to be god awful As a vendor I find the design to be very poor It takes most work to do absolutely anything I ever have to do I find it to be about as functional as it is aesthetically appealing barely at all I don't care about the aesthetics if the interface is well thought out and practical but I can't stand the interface on BlackBank Middle Earth I find much easier to use there are a few little things I dislike like how conversations without unread messages have to be sorted alphabetically by the other person's name and can't be sorted like a NORMAL inbox so you can come back to a RECENT conversation even if you don't remember who it is because you're talking to a hundred different people and a few common features I'd like to see added like listing cloning which isn't that important to me but is definitely nice as well as some features I've never seen before but keep suggesting for the most part the interface works for me there I like that both Nucleus and Middle Earth auto FE for FE listings unlike Blackbank where even on a FE listing the buyer has to wait for you to accept before they can finalize and then you have to wait for them to finalize after that before you can withdraw so there's this whole correspondence dynamic that can leave funds sitting in limbo indefinitely whereas on Middle Earth and Nucleus the second someone orders an FE listing you can withdraw and secure the funds Middle Earth has one issue that I find quite bothersome though Buyers can't withdraw Wtf is that It's their money I don't care if ME doesn't want to be a free tumbler if that's their excuse they can charge a withdrawal fee like BlackBank People deposit more coin than they need all the time to make sure they have enough for their order during BTC fluctuations if nothing else They also should have the right to change their mind and pull their coin out What if you deposit as much as you need to buy something the BTC drops or the vendor raises the price or hits vacation mode and you can no longer afford it and want to take your coin back or order a smaller listing or something else and now have a bunch of leftover coin you can't withdraw I really like the vendor side of Middle Earth but this troubles me To prevent it from being used as a tumbler if people actually use it as such and that's problematic they could charge a withdrawal fee for people who deposit then withdraw withut buying anything no withdrawal fee for people who spend more than half of the coin they deposit before withdrawing the remainder or something silly like that I still wouldn't like that but that's not nearly as bad as not letting people withdraw at all If they're willing to let me vend there for a mere commission they should let people tumble their coins at a slight cost as well even if most buyer withdrawals aren't even for that purpose but rather just because people want their money where they want their money somewhere safer than an anonymously run darknet market primarily used for drugs that are illegal in most of the world for example Again I really like Middle Earth from the vendor side of things but they lose major brownie points for this issue I've had multiple people refuse to buy there for this reason and I completely understand why If they resolve this they'll be one of my favorite markets of all time As it stands I'm having a great time vending there but this doesn't sit right with me and Nucleus Nucleus scares me Design wise it's one of my favorite two markets of all time along with Evolution In fact it reminds me so much of Evolution I feel like it's too good to be true Yes I would like to see more features but this has all the essentials I can think of and it's laid out in a very naturally accessible way The UI for Nucleus like Evolution makes for a wonderful work experience on the vendor side Evolution was my favorite marketplace design wise but I was only there for weeks steady before they made off with all the moneys I don't want to fall in love with Nucleus like I fell head over heels with Evolution only to have my heart broken again Yes Nucleus I find you attractive and I really enjoy being with you but I'm jaded from all my past relationships gone wrong and have my guard up and am not going to let myself get infatuated with you and get careless again as I have before I'm going to make the most of what we have together and hope it lasts but at the end of the day too much trust in your kind always ends badly so when the day comes when you lose the fight or stab us in the back I'll be ready and I'll move on like it aint no thing.
I have noticed that a great number of you appear to be using Safe Mail net as your email provider of choice I would strongly urge you to re consider On January Forbes contributer Runa A Sandvik published an article entitled The Email Service The Dark Web Is Actually Using You can read this article at I reached out to Safe mail for comment Amiram Ofir Safe mail s President and CEO responded in an email that the company and its employees certainly are not aware of any criminal activity adding that the company does follow court orders that are issued in Israel by an Israeli court Any other law enforcement agency should contact the Israeli authorities It s worth noting however that Israel signed a Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty MLAT with the U S in An MLAT request was used to image the Silk Road web server according to the criminal complaint of Sept Ofir told me that communications between users and the web service are SSL protected and that information stored on the server is encrypted with user specific keys When asked if Safe mail has received court orders issued by an Israeli court on behalf of a non Israeli law enforcement agency such as the FBI Ofir replied with a short Yes My followup email asking if Safe mail has the ability to decrypt information without a user s key went unanswered You can bet your life that if Safe Mail's owners operators didn't know about any criminal activity before being contacted by Forbes they sure as hell know about it now They may or may not have known about the huge number of people from Silk Road and other DNMs using their service but the Forbes article if nothing else will have forced them to take action lest they be considered complict if they do nothing to curb such activity It would not surprise me in the slightest to learn that emails are now scanned for certain keywords certain patterns of usage may now be flagged as well On Agora there is one vendor who claims his Safe Mail account was disabled or shut down meaning he can no longer access it My tests have shown this account is still active meaning that messages sent to this account are likely being collected by the authorities For vendors especially please remember that even if you use PGP the header information is NOT encrypted or protected The authorities even if they cannot read your messages nevertheless know who wrote to you and when Spitfir.

Just saw this god damnit can't say im not surprised.
It's possible to use Tails with a VPN but it's not really necessary Unless you are administering a Darknet market or hacking NSA servers you will be quite safe even with the standard Tails installation that doesn't support VPNs But it's possible to install a VPN on a router and then configure Tails to route everything through this router You'll find plenty of good OpenVPN providers eg airvpn org But you'll have to pay a monthly fee for this service preferably using bitcoin Then you'll have to choose whether you want to run Tor over VPN or VPN over Tor But unless you know well what you are doing it's probably better to just use Tails without any VPN.
Topic pretty much explains it It seems I missed the train on DOI DOB C X's were about to be bought before Agora went down So if anyone can point me in the right direction that'd be wonderful Looking for blotter on the DOI DOB and powder for the C X's Thanks.

Quote from Gleeful on June pmQuote from vitaminLSD on June amTails is not secure for serious DNM activities and here's the first reason why USA Feds have already conducted Tor attacks that have landed significant DNM figures behind bars the above article has more details about how the Feds did it and who they have arrested so far a former Silk Road lieutenant for starters Also Tor bridges are practically useless for hiding from the NSA because the NSA harvests the tor bridge addresses from the emails send to from the Tor Project the NSA knows you're using Tor anyways if you're using a Tor bridge Tor bridges were designed for people in repressive third world countries not US citizens hiding from the NSA It also gets worse and this is information that every DNM user serious or small should know about but since the Edward Snowden leaks the NSA has talked about if not bragged that they have timing attacks for de anonymizing Tor users what does this breach have to do with Tails Isn't it just a live version of Linux Is it because it's not designed to be used with a VPN and that VPNs are the safest way to access Tor I'm not disputing what you're saying I just don't understand it Thanks Basically yea you want to always use a VPN before Tor And Tails doesn't have built in VPN support so unless you're using a VPN router like how Cosmic Consciousness explained then if your Tor connection ever gets de anonymized they would see your home IP or wherever you're connected from and that by itself has been enough to land some unlucky people in jail and prison like the Silk Road lieutenant from that article The NSA even brags about how it can de anonymize Tor users so not using a VPN first is like going out and having sex with women a night without a condom and hoping you don't get an STD after a year One of the worst ways you can be de anonymized is like this Tor basically uses three hops to send your data to the final destination Node the first node or the guard node Node the middle node Node the exit node So if you log in to Reddit com through Tor using the same username you buy with on the markets with your connection without a VPN would look like Your home IP Tor Node Tor Node Tor Node RedditBut if you got unlucky and the government runs all three of those Tor nodes and your Tor prioritizes the fastest Tor nodes Tor Node would know your home IP but not the contents of your connection Tor Node would also know that it's sending data on to Tor Node Tor Node knows that it received a connection from Tor node although it doesn't know what the contents are Tor Node also knows that its sending data to Tor Node Tor Node finally sends your data to Reddit Tor Node can always see your data in plaintext for any website not just Reddit unless that connection to the website used Even if your web traffic to Reddit is all sent over encrypted to the Reddit server Tor Node knows that this is one of the Reddit servers for instance because in the connection during the SSL TLS handshake the Reddit server openly says says before everything gets encrypted that this server belongs to Reddit If Reddit has been put under some type of government gag order to give all IP addresses login times to the Feds the feds would know you logged in through Tor But if the feds are doing de anonymization attacks right now if Tor Node was one of their own they could see this connection to Reddit And Tor Node knows it received a connection from Tor Node and Tor Node knows it made a connection to Tor Node Likewise if we roll this back one more time Tor Node knows that it received a connection from Tor Node and Tor Node knows that it made a connection to Tor Node at a very specific point in time down to the second Then finally Tor Node knows this connection came from your home IP address This is how the Feds can de anonymize you if they control your entire Tor circuit your Tor Node But the NSA even brags that it can de anonymize people just based off when you made your Tor connection combined with when the request came out of the Tor exit node so it's possibly they don't even need to control your entire Tor circuit for that connection Just run one of the Tor Node 's and use their NSA mass surveillance visibility to know when a connection came out of one of the Tor nodes Plus they can combine this roughly with the size of the encrypted data being sent back to you to narrow down how large the page you viewed was which can help them pinpoint you even closer with this second method I think the second one is sloppier but the NSA was caught bragging from information in the Edward Snowden leaks that this method still works Ubuntu is really easy to learn I highly recommend it as an alternative to Tails if you've only ever relied on Tails before Mullvad the VPN provider even has a Linux client for their VPN you basically just click a button and it connects They're probably the best commercial VPN provider in my book you can pay them in bitcoins the only personally identifiable information with them is a numeric account ID they keep no logs and they have repeatedly told off governments when they asked for information about users And they know the people who run their Sweden data center and they used their own hardware for the nodes there so the USA government can't just show up there with a gag order and take one of their VPN server's hard drives with their SSL private keys on it like they could possibly to VPN servers here in America regardless of what company runs the VPN server Ubuntu has all the bells and whistles that Tails has and there is an enormous amount of documentation available for you You can find the answer to just about any problem in Ubuntu by search engine ing xyz Ubuntu You can also give it a full disk encryption password during your Ubuntu install.
USPS blocks tor exit nodes However you can use another end to end SSL encrypted USPS proxy such as packagetrackr com I agree with SnackTime though spoof your MAC and check it at an internet cafe.

thanks UncleAl very appriciated i understand using proxy vpn will hide my isp that i use torhoping that there is nothing wrong with it they will see only that i use it but not what i do with it hoping i'm not wrong hereusing tor for download torrents movies application with utorrent software the end as they say with vpn they keep logos and even if you pay maybe open vpn is the deal paing btc anonymous or just like i do only tor sure the best option must be cracking wifi around thanks.
I just want to say thank you for bringing to light how important a VPN is I've been using TAILS for quite some time at public spots and it's great to know that for only a year you can get a reputable quality VPN I have been running Ubuntu for a while now but for some reason the Mullvad client would not install until a did a FRESH install of Ubuntu I tried everything I swear There was some strange error saying it couldn't install Python Most likely due to some other application I had installed conflicting in one way or another So if your going to be like me and trust these guys and upgrade to Ubuntu a VPN and get off TAILS Might wanna start with a fresh wipe if you have issues What I really want to know is if there is a way to clear the system memory upon shutdown like TAILS does Are the any other features we can copy over The one thing I'm REALLY going to miss is that little GPGApplet with the clipboard That made encrypting decrypting with PGP SO MUCH FASTER.

No love for markets lol we've outgrown the.
Quote from ssod on June amCurrently i am connecting to the darknet via tails tor bridges i feel as this is not a very safe unless i am wrong Anyone have any advice on additional security measures to protect my real IP I get bulk so safety is a big concern to me let me know if my lack of faith in bridges is invalid though Tails is not secure for serious DNM activities and here's the first reason why USA Feds have already conducted Tor attacks that have landed significant DNM figures behind bars the above article has more details about how the Feds did it and who they have arrested so far a former Silk Road lieutenant for starters Also Tor bridges are practically useless for hiding from the NSA because the NSA harvests the tor bridge addresses from the emails send to from the Tor Project the NSA knows you're using Tor anyways if you're using a Tor bridge Tor bridges were designed for people in repressive third world countries not US citizens hiding from the NSA It also gets worse and this is information that every DNM user serious or small should know about but since the Edward Snowden leaks the NSA has talked about if not bragged that they have timing attacks for de anonymizing Tor users at the NSA In the Washington Post revealed that the NSA had figured out various ways of unmasking and penetrating the anonymity of the Tor Network Since according to a page research paper titled simply Tor the agency has worked on several methods that if successful would allow the NSA to uncloak anonymous traffic on a wide scale effectively by watching communications as they enter and exit the Tor system rather than trying to follow them inside One type of attack for example would identify users by minute differences in the clock times on their computers And it still gets worse Tor prioritizes fast relays and so if you consider that plausibly speaking many and possibly most of the most high speed Tor relays are run by Western intelligence agencies and not just grassroots Tor volunteers it makes timing attacks so much easier for them From the pando com article from above QuoteIn Tor co founder Roger Dingledine revealed that the Tor Network is configured to prioritize speed and route traffic through through the fastest servers nodes available As a result the vast bulk of Tor traffic runs through several dozen of the fastest and most dependable servers on today's network clients choose one of the fastest exit relays around of the time and of their choices come from a pool of relays This information above has already been public since the Edward Snowden leaks so now everyone reading this has no excuse not to get off Tails and learn Ubuntu or your other favorite flavor of Linux and start using a reputable VPN impeccable track record of standing up against government requests keeps no logs and you can pay them in bitcoins You can start on this now or end up like the silk road lieutenant who got arrested because his Tor connection got de anonymized by the government to what was probably his home IP address And if you're a serious DNM user you don't do business hours a day online from a public wifi spot This is not an acceptable solution for power users Bonus points if you use a pre paid g hotspot with your non Tails flavor of Linux a reputable VPN where your face was never on camera buying the hotspot think fake wig cell phone at home and paid in cash.
Ah I've been out of the garden for awhile How is everyone doing I wanted to know about a jedi flip me and my friend are going to conduct for an upcoming party of mine Here's the amounts we planned on doing ug of Lucy vial of liquid shrooms g of MDMA with a g boost maybe if we find an adequate source that is Any precautions for the flip we need to know about We're really excited but not stupid about the flip and wanted to make sure everything was okay Yes we've done them before and have been fine Now just altogether How do we dose this EDIT If this is incorrect should we redo the dosages.
RRSOLVED All good.
I'm actively avoiding the markets The only advantage markets have is escrow Buying from a vendor directly here is like having to FE on the markets but you avoid having to send money to the market where you are susceptible to being phished or having the admins either take your cash directly or in an exit scam Every day people are claiming that their money is being stolen on AB I think it's easier here to establish trust with a vendor and not to have to worry about a market being shut down and having your BTC lost and having your orders in limbo If a vendor starts scamming here it's evident pretty quickly and people will just stop sending them their money Long live TMG.
not back for me yet I really hope it comes back lots of good connects over there plus all the coin that I had.
Quote from Gleeful on June pmThanks for the great explanation I use Ubuntu already since I have essentially abandoned Windows because it sucks so hard With Ubuntu and the VPN set up does it make sense to run Tor through the VPN as an extra layer If so what package does Ubuntu have available to run Tor Thanks Yes absolutely you want to run Tor through your VPN at all times For your VPN on Linux I recommend Mullvad and just to keep things neater in this thread for anyone reading it later I'm typing up my next post after this why Mullvad is badass for DNM ops and how to install it on Ubuntu What you want to install to get Tor Browser working on Ubuntu is the Tor Browser file from the Tor Project website If your computer has GB of RAM I recommend the Tor Browser hardened version only available for Linux and it's hardened against certain types of exploits but it's a memory hog and uses about times as much memory as normal Tor Browser on Linux but if you have the hardware for it the hardened version is totally worth it You can download Tor Browser hardened from this page on the Tor Project website It's under its own section called Hardened Tor Browser you can't miss it Be sure to download the signature file too and verify the signature if you've never done it before here's the command But first you'll need the Tor Browser Developers PGP public key if you haven't downloaded it already Instructions how to get it are on the webpage here on Ubuntu the command would just be Quotegpg keyserver x hkp pool sks keyservers net recv keys x E C E You can verify that this key says Tor Browser Developers and that you didn't typo it by running this command if you like Quotegpg fingerprint x E C E This will output something like Quotepub R expires Key fingerprint EF E D DA EA A BA DE E C E uid Tor Browser Developers signing key sub R F C expires sub R D E expires Then this is the signature verify command assuming you are in the directory where you saved both of these files Quotegpg verify tor browser linux a hardened ALL tar asc tor browser linux a hardened ALL tar should say something like Quotegpg Good signature from Tor Browser Developers signing key if it verified successfully Then to run Tor Browser hardened it's honestly just as easy as extracting the tar file if you are in the same directory as the Tor Browser hardened tar file it goes like this Quotetar xvJf tor browser linux a hardened ALL tar will have made a folder called tor browser now change directories there and run the start tor browser desktop file like this Quote start tor browser desktopIt should respond with exactly this QuoteLaunching ' Browser start tor browser detach' Then you are good to go There are also a few very specific config changes and setting changes and so on that should be made in Tor Browser to harden it even more maybe I could write a Tor Browser hardening post for Linux to share here on TMG this week And if your DNM computer doesn't have the hardware for Tor Browser hardened you can just use the same commands as above just replace the Tor Browser hardened filenames with the normal Tor Browser filenames for the download you get from that same page as above on the Tor Project website Gleeful If you run into any problems feel free to PM me or better yet just post it in the thread here so if anyone else has the same issue we can fix it together I'll check in here a few times a day this week in case you have any issues you run into.
Ya if Agora was planning an exit scam I don't think they would have warned people ahead of time to remove their coins cause they were going offline duhh.
That truly sucks Sorry bud I think that is the nature of those Markets You need to be careful who you FE with The anonymity offered online allows seedy individuals to pull this shit.
Oh I had no idea Thank you for letting me know.

This is why I love this community so much We start with a warning about some kind of danger and end up disscussing gramma Also a small warning if you have a drastic style of speach or writing you leave a huge trace behind you That's why I often write as if I have multiple personality disorder ranging from an old british gent to a warlord brute.

Quote from Astraltraveler on June amSo I buy it from local with cash or someone else pays non cash for another one he sends it from local to helix and then from helix to market sure thats enough or helix to another helix what if cash its not optional give me some couple of a to c options thanksLocal bitcoins has a variety of ways to buy coins the most anonymous would be meeting someone with cash or doing a cash deposit into a BTC sellers account For a buyer you would be fine sending them from LBC to BTC mixer to the markets SC.
Thanks as well.
I'm not buying it What are you offering that other markets don't I think right now Oasis is the safest market in terms of buyer protection What can you offer that oasis doesn't.
not down no just kinda slow at points.
I'm reading for some macbooks they have wifi problems but it looks like it can be solved by getting a usb wifi adapte.
GFN My thoughts exactly On all accounts ME is very nice but the no withdrawl thing is terrible I have not personally moved coin there and don't plan to I literally only have two vendors I buy from at this point three including GFN Canada They are now spread across each market which makes me feel comfortable that I can always find them I think the main importance here is having an ability to directly contact your vendor in the case of market collapse I appreciate all the vendors that spread themselves as wide as they can and make themselves easy to find.
Quote from Astraltraveler on June amNote your seed A few words needed to get your wallet back in case you loose your private key or run your system from a live DVD and don't backup your key You'll understand the first time you'll use electrum Quote from Astraltraveler on June amBuy a cheap laptop remove the harddrive get tails on a usb That would be better and safer than running TBB on your main system TAILS is a tor and privacy oriented live dvd usb with strong firewall rules to avoid reveling your IP address URL read the doc check your download with their gpg key Running from a DVD is great as if an attackers hacks into your system it's impossible to write any change to the disk and each time you reboot you are sure you use a clean system Running from an USB disk is easy as the system updates automatically and you can enable persistence easily to save your bitcoin wallet gpg key bookmarks I'd recommend that as you are a newbie it's pretty good and you'll be able to get your OPSEC better in the future Quote from Astraltraveler on June amBuy storing in TOR wallet do you mean by the market wallet QuoteI meant electrum A bitcoin wallet that comes with tails It's better to store your bitcoins on your own computer than on a market wallet as the market can disappear anytime with your money You just send to the market what you need for a purchase right before you purchase Keeping money on an online wallet can be insecure Markets come and go Keep your BTC in your own software wallet I'd advise you to read that thread long but worth it you come back with a better OPSEC you can create and use a new username on the Garden in case your previous setup was not secure enough Keep learning Read as much as you can and please ask if you need any help Learning proper OPSEC before doing any mistake is worth it.

So i just woke up to the mailman at my door Saying that i owe for a package to be delivered that the postage was due and he would be back by later today to drop the package and collect the moneyAnyone have any experience with this.
Hi everybody I'm absolutely not new to the DNMs but I'm completely new to the direct sale trade I guess I'm going to use electrum embedded in TAILS to proceed to the payments but I'm a little bit scared about the errors I could do I boot TAILS with USB flash but I didn't configure persistent volume and I'm not really fond of that option I clearly prefer to opt for a small SD Card as my storage device So st question is it OK to use electrum even if I don't enable persistence At the launch of Electrum TAILS advises me It is strongly recommended to only run Electrum when its persistence feature is activated Following step TAILS tells me Electrum could not find an existing wallet what do you want to do Create new wallet Restore an existing wallet from its seed Create a watching only version of an existing walletWhy it doesn't ask me to look for my wallet on another device Was my idea to store it on a SD Card a stupid idea Is my only choice to restore my wallet from its seed When I have created my wallet I now want to send funds to my wallet The BTC addresses I should use are the ones under Receive tab Main account Receiving addresses got addresses there Am I right Concerning the saving of my wallet I just have to go under File then Save Copy save it on my device and keep a written copy of my wallet seed Is it enough or should I also export my private keys to my storage device When my BTC vendor has proceeded to the sending of the funds in my wallet and when I saved my wallet I can close it and shutdown TAILS before they show up in my wallet Is that correct How much fee should I give to the BTC network to proceed to my transactions For example what you guys are you giving Many thanks for your answers Cheer.
If you google pgp encryption site the first listing is Igolder A gold trading site with pgp help Then software wike etc My first question is If you use a clearnet site like that one that does the encrypt decrypt can all you type in become open to prying eyes I know that sounds naive but I really don't know Second How important is key size And a bonus third question Say I'm browsing my favorite vendors for fun and then go to search a word on google Is mixing tor with clearnet a security problem.
For information Cloakcoin CLOAK is re branding into Project One or One Currency ONEC Only a change of name nothing else change See to be confused with the One Coin scam it's something else totally Not sure this re branding with this new name is a good idea but their anonymous system doesn't change and is good Wait and see.
There is a way to get XMR anonymously with cash like Localbitcoin Bitsquare added Monero but I did not read how it works But if you buy XMR with BTC and you send your XMR from XMR wallet A to your XMR wallet B they are completely clean and private anonymous untraceable.
Good guide to you I've always heard about tails but never knew really what it was until now I'll be doing this very soon thank.
I am starting a service to clean Bitcoin as well as exchanging Dogecoin Litecoin Nubits Peercoin Dashcoin Blackcoin Reddcoin and Feathercoin I would be charging of the transaction plus for the mining fees of the needed transactions.

Hey man you might want to check out this sight to read up on all of this it is clearnet Clearnet warning.
Quote from Greenbud on February pm reportedly the prosecution in the SR trial exempted every potential juror who had internet and at the end they had to take a yo IT guy a yo woman and people over with no technological background p Anyway one of the major reasons not to have charges lead to rediculous sentences is that when facing life in prison only an idiot would accept a life sentence in the US federal system as a plea What Ross did was intentionally lose a trial that was unwinnable in hope that his defense will be able to get the verdict possibly thrown out or sentence reduced If you are already fucked might as well go to trial and get it out of the way good luck Ross My understanding of the way the system works is that each side defense and prosecution both have a certain number of challenges that can be used to eliminate jurors for any reason Likely the prosecution used its challenges to eliminate anyone with any real technical background That is why one or two people who actually may have had a clue got on the jury as the prosecution likely ran out of challenges by that point Spitfir.
Quote from magicflight on February amYou aren't wrong So I've set up a fresh copy on a partition installed tor truecrypt and PGP Are there any more security measures I can be taking There are many more security measures you could be taking Grab a router or Raspberry Pi and configure an anonymizing middle box with PORTAL or Corridor or Whonix Gateway Use virtual machines to isolate apps from each other Get a second offline computer for air gapped PGP Get a third computer for air gapped BTC cold storage Encrypt and backup your Bitcoin wallets in at least places If you want to get really adventurous you could roll your own hardened Gentoo with the grsecurity and TRESOR kernel patches I don't know why Qubes isn't based on hardened Gentoo Fedora was an odd choice of base operating system In any case you probably don't need to do all that unless you are a major vendor.
Hey there jw if you got my order on ME from Friday I PM'd you.

Quote from love is all around us on April pmWhat's the deal with Agora was in the middle of a transaction and had the site stop responding According to the subreddit they are moving server locations Apparently they do this a lot possibly for security reasons.
That's new lol I've never had a message like that appear on here and I've been here since around the forum first started That's super weird Hopefully one of the admins sees this and has a response regarding it.
You just made a thread in the best market you're already there here As far as psychedelics everything you could want is here and in my opinion psychedelics are the only 'drugs' worth pursuin.
The following information is advice It comes from sources IRL and my own thoughts Use common sense when reading I am just relaying the information If it does not apply to you or you cannot do it well then skip it These are some general methods to hide your identity or at least your regional writing identifiers Especially if English is not your primary language There is no reason not to do this if you are able Terminology slang word choice and spelling vary tremendously around the globe and over short distances within English Use universal terms if you can Currency units of measurement and references to common objects or actions should be watched closely besides cultural references What is the area you make toilet in called Depends on where you are Greetings and farewells also tend to be regional Drug slang it should be obvious is regional Use what the community generally uses even if it sounds odd Word check everything you can pick from British or American standard based on what program you use Become friends with a thesaurus If you use a word commonly use a synonym instead Read blogs or personal websites from English speaking countries Take the speech of the native speakers and use it Grammar and syntax give distinct patterns but usually require more writing samples to analyze Punctuation usage of an exclamation point comma and emoticons should be watched Do you write like this Or maybe like this How about this one Pay attention to these things Your spacing sentence and paragraph pattern too Do you write very long sentences that could be broken up into little sentences but instead tend to keep going on and on then finally end Then a small one next That is a pattern Even if you vary all your other identifiers most people miss this I would advise against writing in a completely different style every time You will make mistakes that will show you are giving false information and then that information will be ignored for recurring patterns These patterns left will be your native patterns It takes less writing samples to cross check than most think Better to be consistent pick a style and stick with it Establish and maintain false patterns that will be confused with true ones Last do not fall into your false patterns IRL or outside of Tor Any other general ideas.
thank you We have lots of funds tied in escrow right now An exit scam would devastate not only our business but a small chunk of our lives for awhileCheers S.

The only trouble is most people have a horrible time dealing with mulisignature escrow it's just too hard to understand especially for newbies I ecommend Dream Market Mindful Shama.
It was down all day yesterday and all day today It may or may not come back I hope no one had a lot of coin in it I was told months ago that it was going down but I kept selling because I take my coin out soon as its available and depending on how long it stays up I will make a profit Turned out I had no orders waiting to finalize and took my last little bit of coin out tuesday Saw an order tuesday night but wednesday when I went to log in to retrieve the order site was down Tough luck for the customer but what could I do Lots of people lost money no doubt Lets hope it comes back but since the forum has been down forever it does not look good.
sorry i meant TAILS not tor lo.
Im not sure on this so I don't expect any reward or anything but can't you just sell your BTC through local bitcoins It's anonymous that way as you'd be getting cash for BTC and also you can typically charge more per BTC than any of the other exchanges If you live in a particularly small city I think you can also accept moneypak.

the avid posted this list comparing privacy conscious email providers to r list thread.
That list is not correct at all I sent samples You only have peple saying they received theirs person I missed and it will be in the mail tomorrow and I'm not sure what is going on with the other guy But that list of people never confirmed their addresses with me What am I supposed to do with that.
I just used bitcoin blender for a small amount of coin under and it worked The whole process took under an hour.
Thanks for the encouraging words I am definitely a very low target As in the single dose was my third order ever a strip was my largest and I cannot imagine LE communicating across borders and wasting thousands of dollars on me especially since they know it is impossible for me to give them any info that they do not already have Also apparently only people from my country have ever been caught using DNMs most of them vendors who were sloppy IRL This has been a good learning experience though Again thanks for the encouragement I am very grateful for having found this community.
I spoke of no phishing site but spamming and I have no idea what the site you mention is.
Quote from LMNT on July amSo I just switched over from using TAILS I'm now using the latest desktop version of Ubuntu with a VPN Hardened TOR browser Armory KeePassX GPA Are there any other tools I could be using to increase my security or for cleaning up after using my tools Particularly interested in tools to erase the traces in the RAM or other traces of my usage Thank you for your help Good switch Did you enable full disk encryption when you installed Ubuntu.
to OP and the kind soul who PM'd me.
To my knowledge the vendor wasn't selling here.
I had no issues sending coin to Agora or placing orders withdrawing my coins.
Just ordered from Study Buddy on ME a couple hours ago JS is not enabled Could not have been smoother or quicker Order is already marked as sent Looking forward to trying out some of the Asian xtal.
I should add that the reason why I am looking into another NP vendor then Value Lucid is his stealth packaging The blotters aren't sealed and are subsequently at risk of damage through water The stealth is probably the worst I have seen It might be OK for within the EU but I live in a country with somewhat tricky customs and do not want to take unnecessary risks I was going to source some from OOTP but my strip of NP got lost on its way he has very generously reshipped a strip but he no longer sells NP if I'm not mistaken.
Quote from bombheadie on March amAnother thing I sent out packages this is why I would like to know who received and didn't received there there packages I very easily could have missed a couple packages And I fully apologize if that is the case Like I posted in an earlier post I did received my sample L L.
yeah that woulda freaked me out i dont know if i would have been brave enough to go get it i had something say postage due but was only cents and no one collecte.
You need to enter your wifi password every time you start up TAILS unless you're using a persistent volume which remembers stuff like wifi passwords There should be a little network icon near the upper right corner of your screen which becomes a drop down menu when you click on it You should be able to just enter your password in there If you enter your wifi password correctly TOR should be able to connect.
done thanks for the heads up.
I believe shared send option has now been removed from blockchain info.
Dont think RC and stuff are really welcome around here.
Be careful with clearnet redirect links could lead you straight to a phishing site.
Really excited about this sample Will update when received.
my very first order on the DNM was on Middle Earth Ordered some adderall for a friend from addguy even though i was anxious and checking in with addguy everyday order went through very smooth addguy was great and communicative and when the order i went back to ME and withdrew the remaining BTC that was left with no issues i would order through ME again with no hesitation Just don't have Java Script enabled.

Nice addition to the garden and those are all great psychedelics.
Quote from Astraltraveler on June amOkey thanks I see folks writing about that u should use adresses and mixers to make it most unknown Do you guys have any advice where I can get an email adress that is safe For the mixer you'll need several bitcoin addresses and no email address but when you need an email address sigaint seems to be a good choice gpg encrypt everything though I'd recommend using tails on a second hand laptop you buy for cheap locally and you remove HDD you can start using it on your own computer also it would be better than using only the tor browser bundle It comes with electrum that goes through tor Create a new wallet and NOTE YOUR SEED few random words somewhere secret where you'll be able to find again in the future On next boots you'll be able to get back to your wallet again using this seed In electrum you'll see there are addresses where you can receive founds Give to of them each time you want to send money to the mixer of your choice If you use only one address be it your own TOR wallet agora a seller it's pretty easy for anyone looking on the blockchain to see that there is BTC IN and BTC minus fee if you use helix for example OUT from another address And even if you have plausible deniability you'd be better using more than one address to make your mixing stronger If you are to pay to remove your coins'taint then better do it right Localbitcoins with cash cash in the mail or any thing that won't leave tracks back to you mixer tor wallet is quite good If you need more privacy you could send from mixer to mixer then to BTC wallet but it's probably not needed if you're a small time buyer and you use tor to connect to the tumbler.
PM'd about sampling both Please respond at your earliest convenience.
Wondering if anyone has had experience dealing with vendor b g mpact on Evo Checking out his DMT crystals that he claims to be pure looks like his reviews are ok with one neutral and one neg product never arrived As he ships from outside the US wondering if it's worth while before investing Thanks for any assistance Yes I'm new and loving every minute.
we have a sale bucks for hits of ug.
We have some ug doses laid with like ug of LSD tartrate These are some fire tabs and are laid with a special blend These are cool because you can get one hit and either share it with a couple friends or have the trip of a lifetime A lot of dots and blots back in the day were ug so some people like having the option for some old school hits.
Sending a tracking number without PGP is the equivalent of sending your address without PGP Basically as bad as it gets You should let the vendor know to never do that again to anyone Big fuck up.
I was scammed by BCDirect for two orders in May June Both were for oz mushrooms for They claim they were shipped but they have no proof and I have no love letter Both shipments never arrived in reading the feedback this happens a lot to BCDirect I tried to reach a agreement but I was told without a love letter they would do nothing How can I have a letter when it wasn't shipped and they offer reship only with letter ri god damn diculous All we can do those that were scammed is to let people know and look out for each other I advise not to use not to trust.
I'm on Middle Earth almost exclusively Love it You can diable Javascript I never have it enabled.
Debian which Tails is based on is not compatible with all Wifi devices inside computers For example it is not compatible with some of the newer MacBook models because it doesn't come with the right drivers You can do some searching to see if Debian comes with a driver for the Wifi device on your computer model If not it is possible to buy a USB connected Wifi dongle compatible with Debian It's also possible to install the missing driver to Tails in some case but there are negative sides to doing that from what I've heard.
Did the same thing a while back I messaged a mod to ask if a deleted message is really gone or if it was still in the database somewhere Mod confirmed that once deleted it's really gone Sender as well as receiver should delete.
Thanks a million Liquid Everything is working now even decryption Old version of kleopatra saved the day.
If it was on the hidden wiki its pretty much guaranteed to be a phishing scam site What are you looking for I'm sure there's a vendor here that probably sells it.
you can use the same pgp to verify it is me I sell only the best LSD at the lowest cost I can Every order is shipped priority mail free of charge My most recent batch that is selling now is the same as the previous one Very nice stuff You will not be disappointed You can check my credentials using GRAMS Search for 'luckyduck' or read the rules below before ordering Rules Double then triple check your address before submitting an order The only problems I have ever had are because people don't write their address correctly I copy and paste what you give me Use a real name to a real address No fake names no abandoned homes or empty store fronts No free samples Don't ask if a package will arrive at a specific time I do not control the postal system For example I cannot guarantee your package will arrive by the weekend Priority shipping usually takes a max of days but sometimes for whatever reason it takes Everything will be shipped within hours of purchase and your item will not me marked shipped until after it has been dropped off at a postal box I also do not under any circumstance ship using overnight delivery There will never be a signature required for anything you receive from me I won't answer a question that can be answered by reading this page however I will do my best to respond to your inquiries quickly but my first priority is getting your orders packed up and in the mail I only ship from the USA to to others in the USA If you would like something sent to another country PM me and we might be able to work something out PGP only this is serious All non encrypted orders will be canceled non address related communication does not need to be encrypted Please log back in and finalize as soon as you can once you receive it's just good manners I treat my customers well and expect the same in return If there is any problem with your order talk to me first before leaving feedback If poor feedback is left without trying to resolve the situation with me first there will be no resolution refund or reship given I am very easy to work with so just message me and we will work it out Be safe and have fun The product Each batch is tested I will turn down a batch if it does not meet my standards I have never once received a single complaint about the quality of my LSD in fact I've only received glowing reviews Every site that I have ever vended on has always had a spotless record never anything below a so you can buy with confidence I will not sell a product that doesn't meet my high standards This is a business and I run it like one Security is important to me Your safety is a big priority for my customers and myself All precautions are taken very seriously from the start beginning with using a secure OS and a highly regarded PGP tool with an extremely strong password for decryption The computer that is used was bought with cash hard drive was remove and only boots from an encrypted memory card This computer never touches the clear net it has also has never been exposed to any Java script and never will Hardware and software firewalls are used I never store any of your information aside from the order number and the corresponding tracking number which are kept encrypted and well hidden This information is deleted using a very through piece of software as soon as the order has arrived Packaging is done in the utmost clean environment Packing materials are all bought with cash from different locations All postage is bought with cash from locations no where near the places your orders are dropped All packages have printed labels that are printed using an extremely common printer that was bought with cash Every package employs a decoy While packing quality gloves are worn every step of the way and are changed frequently throughout the process Stealth is something I take seriously I've done this for a long time and have never had a package seized I have been a vendor for several years on many markets and have done so without incident I won't state my prior usernames for security reasons Sometime I take long breaks from operating when a site goes down exit scam or seized then I start fresh with a new identity so as not to be linked to previous compromised sites Each time I come back I start out as a new vendor and each time I quickly gain a good reputation and loyal customers I have never acted dishonest scammed or stolen in anyway from anyone online or in real life It's just not something I could do and still sleep at night Even when there have been incidents of seized sites like SR or exit scams I have always honored the pending orders placed even though I loose money those customers also lost money and I feel like they should get what they paid for or at least what they tried to pay for I'm not greedy nor do I have a big ego so you will not see me on forums or elsewhere doing any kind of self promotion I let my feedback and word of mouth do that for me This is a one man band and I keep my prices low and quality is high therefor my profit margin is slim You will sometimes see others with lower prices but that may be because they import their product They don't know the quality or even if it is real LSD until it arrives While I pay more for my product and source it locally so I know that before I purchase it is LSD and high quality You get a real product from me as well as good stealth and quick shipping that you can count on When you buy from me you are keeping your money in our country economy and helping those that work to produce it as well BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK

Quote from prarp on August pmHunting down the Shulgin chems is part of the fun Visiting the markets reguarly all sorts of stuff pops up for short windows Every now and again something fairly obscure will get listed and if the right price and vendor seems ok I'll nab it for my collection There was some TMA on Alphabay a few months ago but very expensive A new vendor on Dream has a few Psilocin analogs at the moment although only in gram listings Due to their reported relative instability and my infrequent opurtunities to partake I'm reluctant to buy anything but small samples of these Who's the vendor on Dream you're referencing If you're looking for psilocin analogues you might check out ion on Alphabay or occasionally here He at one point anyway had AcO DMT HO MiPT HO MET and AcO MET.
Quote from Root on May amI think the only marketplace that I can say I have no love for is AlphaBay I don't like a site devoted to theft of ones identity I have had multiple family members put into an endless cycle and a hole of debt trying to recover from identity theft Other friend with ruined credit that made it hard to find a job and imposable to get a good rate on home purchase because they were taken advantage of in the same manor While I don't like the identity theft part either AlphaBay is actually the best darknet market currently for drugs They a large amount of listings and the site is almost always up with top notch DDos protection.
hmm good question I'm not sure about the safety between the two I use an online wallet blockchain That might be a good post if this doesn't get much attention Make sure you google or use the search function and see if a topic has already been posted about the difference in safety and reliability in a downloaded vs online wallet Thanks and best of luck Feel free to ask anymore questions you have I'm more than happy to help out.
Thanks guys Well I know it's not just me because there is a thread on the Agora forums about it Everyone's getting it I'm just new to Agora so got a bit worried.
If anything i trust Sigaint's serfices the most they've proven their with their email client for a long time.
Best thing about RC vendors is finding one stop shops I usually buy small quantities of a bunch of different chems and would rather receive one international letter than several Also pretty partial to my primary vendor they've done right by me for four years I think they deserve my coins if I'm looking for something they stock.
Loading TAILS off of a USB drive will be more than enough in terms of keeping your hardware hidden secure Java is much different than JavaSCRIPT JavaSCRIPT is a lightweight computer programming language scripting language that allows small scripts or programs to be run over the web Java is basically a programming language for portable cross platform computer programs Cracking someone else's WiFi won't really help you much and I don't condone using other individuals' internet connections for illegal activity How would you feel if one day police broke down your door and arrested you for absolutely no reason other than someone living half a block from you had poor OPSEC Learning to properly test attack and break into someone's network takes lots of time and a fair understanding of networking and can get you in trouble as well Not worth it A VPN IS NOT THE SAME AS A V M VM stands for Virtual Machine which is a program that is used to create a virtual computer inside the memory of your physical computer VPN stands for Virtual Private Network This is a service provided by many companies where and this is a very basic explanation all incoming and outgoing information is first sent through a remote server It hides your internet usage from your ISP Internet Service Provider.
Confirmed scammer RIP s s s sigant org This is actually the real from Silk Road that has used two diff handles now since going private that I am referring to I won't tell anyone currently doing business with him what to do I will only present the facts Be careful guys.
Who's the vendor on Dream you're referencing If you're looking for psilocin analogues you might check out ion on Alphabay or occasionally here He at one point anyway had AcO DMT HO MiPT HO MET and AcO MET UK vendor Curious something or other New only feedback is for some Aco caps AcO MET HO DET and a couple of others of the top of my head.
is their any way to contact Oasis Admins I forgot my password.
Is it official TMG policy not to mention the d word any more If so why Am I missing something fundamental here.
HiDid someone send some founds to Agora Did it work well Heard they had problem last weeks and would like to know if it's fixed as they claim or if it isn't Thank.
aflaomarket serverlux me or to learn more If this group really finishes bitwasp it would be great for the community.
Best of luck guys Did you drop the buyers fee in the end.
Even better here's a thread for PGP help right here in the garden topic.

thanks Mist I updated mine Love the Clergy.
hm I'm honestly not sure then Have you made your own key already.
No other way besides you should be switching up your bridges every week or two.
I have to assume they have been compromised in some way the lack of communication is bafflin.
You can find all of that on the clearnet.
Set up some bridges if you can Done correctly they can hlep hiding your useage from ISP DPIs are stilla worry though for some Tor Document have some good info in it but I find it can get a little nerdy for me to decypher That's me thoug.
Quote from woopieG on July pmWhat an amazing discussion After reading everyone's posts I thought I would mention something that may have been overlooked Here's a disclaimer I'm sure everyone at Mullvad are spot on in what they believe in when it comes to privacy and with what they're trying to accomplish at Mullvad and I am in no way doubting that at all I'm only looking to disseminate information and perhaps my humble opinions Sweden is one of the Eyes and Mullvad being a Swedish company with their home servers located in Sweden operates in the Land of the Eyes and I've always stayed away from ALL VPN providers that operate out of any of the Eyes countries Whether they have a strong association or a weak alliance with the American NSA countries that make up the Eyes are NOT privacy friendly and I would only use VPN services and VPN servers located outside of the Land of the Eyes Here's something about the Eyes for those who might be interested wonder which is more risky Using a company that resides in the lower tier of the eyes but has an excellent reputation IE Mullvad Using a less well known VPN in a country that isn't part of the eyes but may or may not log you and give you up if they are asked.
Quote from Bonobo on February pmLOL it looks ugly sorry if I am straight forward hereThe days of search bars sticking out of the UI are all over look at some of the newer markets the design is as important as the features Besides what is your UPS over say AlphaBay or Dream or Nucleus I'm not sure looks would be my first concern if I were to use a market Do you recall Agora I can't say that it was the loveliest UI in all the land but they left honorably and their operation was flawless Although I did not create an account I did pop my head to see the login page Doesn't seem all that ugly to me Good luck with your endevour AM.
Quote from Rainbow Weaver on August amthanks I know vendors do when they withdraw But I am wondering if a marketplace wallet is known to be a market when shown in the blockchain or does it look like a normal coin wallet seems like a lot of money spent on tumbling if I tumble my coins before sending to a market and then the vendor tumbles again when they withdraw But safety first just want some clarification on this matter It looks like a normal coin wallet The reason for tumbling is so your real identity isn't tied to the coin you purchased.
Thank you for all the info Problem I see is that as not many people use it there isn't much you can do with those And you can't blend in with thousand users as it is possible with BTC.
Maybe some VPN providers can be trusted but it's hard to tell before there is an actual problem Their claims are mostly marketing in my opinion The market is competitive who would be stupid enough to admit logging And who would go to jail to protect a month user I don't know swedish law their claims can be true but they could be greedy entrepreneurs logging as much as they can to be on the safe side or even a honeypot sadly we have no way to tell Mullvad software seems to only create firewall rules to block anything that's not going through VPN network interface Setting up iptables to do this would work as good Restoring an image is nice but if the host is compromised your image can be compromised too A skilled attacker could escape the VM A DVD can't be compromised by a distant attacker the BIOS could be but it's harder and probably not worth it to catch a small time buyer Physical isolation is said to be better than software isolation More complicated and costly to set up but should be solid even more so if each system lives in RAM and starts from a read only media For most users Tails or TBB on Linux with a strong firewall is probably enough don't you think so If you want to be extra safe use an air gaped machine to encrypt your stuff and keep your private key At worse if your tor box is compromised there won't be keys or unencrypted messages on it Tails is nice because you don't need to read a lot of documentation to get started it works out of the box and it is supposed to be secure if you trust those who created the iso If you wanted to fight against anonymity and be willing to add a back door somewhere wouldn't a distribution aiming at providing anonymity be on top of the list.
i oasis uzed it for most of my orders i like it pops up a msg when you make a deposit no matter what page your on the layout is also niceseem friendly to and make me not as nrrvous if i ever have to plafe a ticket in the futur.
It's great to see new people learn and discover the wonders of the darknet one quick note though you shouldn't be torrenting anything through TOR Not only is it bad OPSEC but it slows the whole network down see for more In response to your original question yes using a TAILS usb should be fine from home.
Agora is notorious for having delayed withdraw deposits Grant it they always pull threw but it's been at an all time high lately Not to mention there is a BTC stress test going on until the morning.
Quote from SCIdmt on October pmMaybe we could throw vendors personal sites up there as well I've got one I know albion does and Gamma SCIGreat Idea Anyone who wants there market added please post in the thread.
Keep in mind that Tails comes with a firewall set up to allow only tor traffic You will have to set this up manually if you decide to maintain your own Ubuntu system Tails is amnesiac and can be run from a DVD that way you are sure that when you boot your system you start a clean system as long as your original Tails iso is safe and trustworthy Of course it would be very interesting for LE to create a backdoor in Tails as well as in Ubuntu or Debian Without auditing everything you have to trust someone A VPN will hide the fact that you use TOR from your ISP don't expect any more protection If the cops want to get you they will get you Wanna be sure you won't do the time Don't do the crime.

Quote from LSD Avengers Spokesperson on January pmQuote from Doses Lysergic on January amQuote from dxuutx on December pmIf anything this is more proof that HoS or whoever is a major target of law enforcement and that we really shouldn't be talking about this business on the clearnet anywhere than any notion that the whole sub is just a honeypot I think the arrogant sense that people on the sub have that their crimes aren't worthy of targeting from law enforcement these are people who live to make drug arrests I also think it's a bit alarmist to assert that it exists only for this purpose and that no worthwhile discussion takes place thereon And it's not insignificant seemingly to me that HoS didn't have any overt problems with reddit when the reviews were adulatory and the attitude changed when they started to turn critical Lol speak english its not insignificant it is not not significant when you use a double negative you obscure your meaning thereon this word has been used not since again not one knows what the fuck not insignificant' again that 'hos didn't' have a problem when the reviews were positive adulatory if you yern to be not unlike Leo Tolstoy well then i'll just not continue writing now Thanks professor DL some of my friends try to say as many double negatives in one sentence I aint got no nothing or anything to say sometimes but i try anywho My post has nothing to do with HOS and they are not the messenger The bottom line is no one should be posting anything about DNM on Reddit period My initial reaction is not opposed to your proposition The discussion of our present cloak and dagger endevours should be kept not on this superflous clearnet reddit.
What pope says is spot on and that program is very good pop.
Like kushmaster says local bitcoins would be the easiest place to sell coins Selling coins for ukash vouchers will often get more per coin than any other method If selling for ukash make sure you have the voucher code before releasing coins to buyer I sold a few coins this way without issue I'd put the ukash on to a poker account and would either withdraw the money myself in any of the ways the site allowed or I'd pass lose some to friends so they can cash out.
Rep points for Luckyduck he's good in my books Used to get some other high quality product from him and it was always the best Will be placing an order with you here this week.
Just a warning to everyone if a new forum member posts links to a marketplace mixing service bitcoin site any site where you send money they might be fake links designed to spoof the original site and steal your money Verify those links before you send your bits to them.
I remember reading on chemsrus that lizardlabs doesn't ship to the US is that still true.
I'll take one for LSD and one for Amphs if you got them on hand.
Short and simplified answer Because it is not end to end encrypted when somebody catches your traffic everyone hosting an exit node can catch that LE hosts some exit nodes for that purpose you are fucked you just gave away your address and time of arrival PM me if you want me to link you to some good safety stuff I would strongly advise you to do so.
Thank you everyone for your help I was looking around cause I thought I had another AP but I don't I'm either going to look at the Usb lucidmotif suggested or just try Whonix VM that DiMiTri Coolbreeze suggested The computer i'm using isn't new early 's I wish I had a Macbook though lmao for everyone because you are all so kind and helpful Thank youSno.
No problem did you check out that link we sent about setting up electrum in tails.

MeO PCP is one of my all time favorite RCs Here's a little trick for you get a mL glass vial I use the vials etzplatinum sells his etiz liquid in once I kill a bottle lol and some Everclear or equivalent high proof grain alcohol Weigh up mg of the PCP and funnel it into the bottle Pipe up mL alcohol with a mL oral syringe and pop that into the bottle with the PCP Shake vigorously and gently heat the mixture with a lighter until it all falls into sol'n Pair your bottle up with a mL oral syringe and there you have it With this preparation I normally take mL and follow up with mL in an hour or so And yeah the MXE scene is taking a huge hit right now I used to host frequent bulk HQ MXE group buys and I had a superb consistent source that always had top of the line stuff and he just up and disappeared right before a buddy of mine was about to start his own buy Sucks cuz he had some serious products at some SERIOUS prices That and all his C x's were pure Best C B I've ever seen I'm actually a bit lost without him TBH.
Fascinating Not much you can do against it if a vendor stores your data you're fucked But this did happen in Germany in many other countries I don't think you can do something if you have no other proof BTC trail or drugs seizure Did they also catch some of those who didn't encrypt their addresses just based on SR database.
Awesome Thank you for all the info I really hope vendors markets will start accepting cloakcoin and anonymous bitcoin here soon.
Everything works withdrawals as wellAlthough sometimes the support system is really lackin.
On MultiSig Haha xD It seems a bit complicated to me as well though but I want to be free from sending coins on market excrow mind you I dont order often just once in a while but that tends to be a medium large sized orde.
Quote from sillywabbit on February pmvery likely although from the rise of other markets the fact that evo and agora are still up and the further development of p p networks like Bitmessage etcI doubt they can do much to STOP it Deter yes but those who are TOP Notch in their OPSEC and know how to make robust websites The ONLY shot they have is to get in on the inside like they did Agree The cats already out of the bag and LE knows it and that's percisely the reason why LE turns to scare tactics because they know they can't do anything about it legally at least But more and more bills keep being brought up that would allow LE and the NSA to infringe on our rights even more and this also needs to be addressed and stopped.
Although if you log into a public wifi your MAC address would be recorded on that network So maybe the best case scenario would be to utilize the unprotected browser in Tails.
True China had has much easier access to reagents and precursors than we Westerners do Plus the way their society works they don't demonize people for doing work so long as it isn't breaking any export laws But if we were to have a massive number small scale production labs synthesizing semi bulk quantities of chemicals as opposed to multiple kilos one such lab could work completely under the radar while managing to fill a decent amount of the demand without having to order quantities of reagents that would be deemed suspicious in terms of the DEA watch list It would also be harder to take down many scattered small labs than it would a few strategic factories In short it's not likely it will happen but it is certainly feasible Back on topic though yeah it's a shame that MXE is on the decline IME it's fairly benign as far as safety is concerned Sucks that it has come to people passing off chems of an obscure choice as I think your India guess will prove to be on point though I hope that our favorite Chinese lab technicians decide to make the move out there themselves to resume their business as they're already experienced as well as trusted for the most part Like you said though it's up to us to make sure that no one from us and further down the chain get hurt.
Replied in the other thread as well to your question update your bridges check for new bridges at.
It would be interesting to see how much these increase in a week from now.
On Monday BH said my pack would be sent out the following morning It should land sometime in the next few days I'll update if it does.

I for one love the idea Sterling but do not see the issue with some type of small fee to help cover operational expenses on your end Please keep me updated on your progress as I am extremely interested in your concept.
You should look at a modded version of AFLAO bitwasp It will save you a lot of time All you are doing by the vendor anonyminity is creating extra scripting to be hacked Make sure you have it all locked down If not you will have to trust in people to refund Its not just a payment code with a ledger created for an escrow account and then dropped in real addresses Anonymous listings lead to a whole vacuum for scams Are you logging the anonyminity to the vendor so when a scam occurs there is a way to locate the scammer.
Quote from uncleal on April pmHere TMG is in a league of it's own and entirely different I meant commission taking escrow offering money handling markets of the risk your capital kind not this open honest trust based forum that asks nothing in return for letting people find each other and communicate freely.
Thanks for the heads up Happy new year.
I don't think I've ever seen a market act like EIC They seemed so legit to me Site was clean functional and responsive Then all of a sudden the admins went dark I can't for the life of me figure out why they are still live with the withdrawals and deposits not working It's a very situation indeed Definitely do not put any BTC into the site until everything is functional Even if does become functional again I would proceed very cautiously.
Why shouldn't you track packages through TOR.
Quote from on March pmSo recently I received a tracking code trough PM that wasn't encrypted with PGP I don't know how the postal system works with tracking but I assume the tracking code is coupled with the address the pack is sent to Meaning that if the platform is compromised and LE gets a hold of the tracking code they can determine the drop address Anyone have any knowledge on this subject Is sending tracking without PGP a major opsec flaw Thanks for your insight If it's a market like AlphaBay point out the mistake to the vendor then politely request that he delete the entire conversation then do the same once he has confirmed he deleted the thread That will permanently delete the entire thread at least on AlphaBay Be sure to copy paste any relevant parts of the thread to someplace encrypted unless you don't need the thread contents ever again.
Just a heads up that Mr Blotter from the Hansa is a scammer See here at Reddit for more information on this POS CLEARNET URL.
Agorra is the best.
There are many reports of Helix not releasing the coins wonder whats up there And Sigaint has been having network issues lately.

Hunting down the Shulgin chems is part of the fun Visiting the markets reguarly all sorts of stuff pops up for short windows Every now and again something fairly obscure will get listed and if the right price and vendor seems ok I'll nab it for my collection There was some TMA on Alphabay a few months ago but very expensive A new vendor on Dream has a few Psilocin analogs at the moment although only in gram listings Due to their reported relative instability and my infrequent opurtunities to partake I'm reluctant to buy anything but small samples of these.
I dont understand what you meant by it being ugly But it looks pretty good and modern the search bar is just fine Our USP is an improved user experience.
Quote from koolcid on May amI don't see what apple has over hansa or TMG You know I've always felt the same way about Apple For years I've been tellin' people that Android is far more superior why spend that kind of money on Apple products Oh wait is this something different.
Just posted it here but this seems to be good place too I sent btc to bitcoinmixer info yesterday and I still haven't received anything back I've sent a note to the site asking what's going on but they haven't answered yet Has anyone any suggestions on what to do Guess there isn't much I can do except warning everyone not to use the service until the matter is settled I'll update as soon as I get word from them hopefully Should this really turn out to be a scam I'll open a separate thread to increase visibility Please please let it be some kind of mistake.
Quote from Doses Lysergic on January amQuote from dxuutx on December pmIf anything this is more proof that HoS or whoever is a major target of law enforcement and that we really shouldn't be talking about this business on the clearnet anywhere than any notion that the whole sub is just a honeypot I think the arrogant sense that people on the sub have that their crimes aren't worthy of targeting from law enforcement these are people who live to make drug arrests I also think it's a bit alarmist to assert that it exists only for this purpose and that no worthwhile discussion takes place thereon And it's not insignificant seemingly to me that HoS didn't have any overt problems with reddit when the reviews were adulatory and the attitude changed when they started to turn critical Lol speak english its not insignificant it is not not significant when you use a double negative you obscure your meaning thereon this word has been used not since again not one knows what the fuck not insignificant' again that 'hos didn't' have a problem when the reviews were positive adulatory if you yern to be not unlike Leo Tolstoy well then i'll just not continue writing now Thanks professor DL some of my friends try to say as many double negatives in one sentence I aint got no nothing or anything to say sometimes but i try anywho My post has nothing to do with HOS and they are not the messenger The bottom line is no one should be posting anything about DNM on Reddit period.
Quote from ohdonpiano on November pmBecause the thread was started in AugustAnd facepalm.
OP updated with latest agora link.
So recently I received a tracking code trough PM that wasn't encrypted with PGP I don't know how the postal system works with tracking but I assume the tracking code is coupled with the address the pack is sent to Meaning that if the platform is compromised and LE gets a hold of the tracking code they can determine the drop address Anyone have any knowledge on this subject Is sending tracking without PGP a major opsec flaw Thanks for your insight.
So this is tough to write but I believe either something bad has happened to IMB or more likely now that I may have been ripped off I have had an order with him unresolved since the beginning of April One that he claims was recently seized in Europe an order he made me place to receive only a reship on a previous pack that got me a CD and TWO knock and talks He claimed that he had been disappointed in the past with customers leaving me due to screwing up once and said he needed another order to have the energy and motivation to do a reship he should have just honored as per his policy Just to give you some context since returning as a customer this past September to 'hedge my bets' so to speak with another M source so I can get more packs to a drop as they have diff stealth and shipment areas I only got my first two orders from him with the same quality service that I had come to know IMB for since SR My third order was the CD in which packs of M got a CD No big deal right But the quality of his customer service from that point then dropped off into nothing it seemed So I send him the coin for the new order and give him a new drop for the reship and a separate one for the other order It was odd that in this new order he didn t send his bullet point order template he was strict about using up until the order in question So he only ships the reship out and says he wants to wait until the reship lands A little frustrating but probably the best practice to avoid losses So the reship lands and I ask him to get the new one out ASAP and this is where the problems really seem to start IMB's communication and response time was becoming even more abysmal He started frequently taking days to respond to emails often over days sometimes up to ten days and longer He always had an excuse and his last one in early April when I was inquiring if this new order had shipped was that his shipper was in the hospital and he was by his side For ten days I have heard the sick relative sob story before from scammers and it was a red flag to be honest but he says the order will ship the next day so I have faith and wait Almost three weeks go by with no pack so I ask for the tracking number and he responds w o the tracking number but claims it was seized and writes me an almost frantic message telling me to clean house and abandon ties with the drop He seemed more animated and panicked than he normally is during these types of things So he actually replies the next day for once with the tracking number and says it didn't update and was removed from the system But curiously you get the same message from the tracking system when you enter in a random number formatted like a real tracking number The tracking says it is not registered in their database and to wait two days if it was posted recently This is something I have never seen before personally So yet again a week passes by with no word but IMB eventually takes responsibility for the mistake saying they shipped too close to the border where the checks are harder and they will never do that again This is now the st of May and he's had my coins since the end of March So I push for a reship since it was clearly his fault which he agrees to but says it will take three weeks for him to do test runs and to contact him on May th So I wait and then email him on the th with a new unused drop specifically set up for IMB in case I have more issues with him lol He hadn't responded to that email on the date I was instructed by him to get in touch I waited about days then sent another message asking what's up with this And to tell him that if he can't get my reship out in the next hours I would like a refund to order from CP like he suggested whom I already have been doing business with and should not have strayed from And I get no response again I wait another days and send him another email expressing my frustrations with all these problems and delays and just ask for refund as this is beyond ridiculous at this point Still nothing no response My last message to him was on Wednesday with a subject title of It Appears You Are Scamming Me and pleading for a resolution with a reship or refund or I may be forced to air my grievances publicly And not much surprise here he still has yet to respond hours later So he hasn't responded since May st over a month now and it has been days since the th of May when he told me to get back in touch about the reship I don't know what else to conclude here with all the problems leading up to this and the total lack of communication that got worse and worse up until now It really appears as if I am being fucked over by IMB So now what I am now asking of the community is if any of IMB s current customers have received email responses since the th of May Because if they have that to me is a smoking gun And would pretty much prove that he s been ignoring me If anyone can chime in here to help that would be greatly appreciated Now I sincerely hope I am wrong about this and he has a real reason for going dark but it's hard to keep the faith I will retract this statement apologize and go back to doing business with him if he can fix this for me But until then this is where it stands I only hope that my information will serve to help others make informed decisions about who they conduct business with.
hang on as I jump up on my soap box I always feel that it is important to provide some awareness about I know how good they can make one feel and I know that they provide much needed relief to a great number of people I am reasonable and respect their value to man and animal alike However like most things those benefits aren't free When it comes to benzos just be aware how quickly those tiny little fucking pills will snatch your life You will never hear me tell anyone what to do or not to do when it comes to any meds But be aware that these are some of the most powerful chemicals that you can ingest They will change your life if you consume them with any frequency And when you stop you will get the cunt punt of your life delivered in the form of seizures and a very unique detox If you get past the seizures the detox is one of the gnarliest emotional rollercoaster rides that one can take and it aint a short ride We are all different in the ways in which our bodies react to chemicals clearly But in my experience what I have described is universal I hope that I am wrong but please respect benzos and be safe as you can Be safe and well.
You could try right here on The Majestic Garden go check the Vendor section I think we have a few people selling Cannabis Make sure you know PGP Nothing is safe stuff can always get intercepted bad vendor lost mail etc All your other questions I can't help you with Other markets to try Nucleus Earth.
Tails Devs have not renewed their PGP certificate they are well aware of this Therefore you cannot verify the integrity of the Tails ISO Try adding and certfying the Tails key you'll see that it has expired despite showing a expire date in The only option for now is to use as many checksums as possible and downloading from multiple places.
Never had a problem with Helix either Works great in my experience Where can I find these reports of Helix not releasing coins I'd like to know the details.
there is away to use electrum in Tails without persistence It does however require an external usb or sd disk where to store your wallet and the electrum app We will not use the TAILS pre installed electrum version we will be using the downloaded one I ll explain below how to start it BTW I am not saying this is the correct way to do things I personally will use Tails persistence but since you asked here is a way to do it In your external data disk create a secret password protected partition using TAILS disk utility This will be only visible from TAILS and it will be like a persistent drive for your data Here is where you store your wallet and electrum app In electrum site downloads get Installation from Python sources and download Linux version Once unzipped you ll have a folder save this in your secret disk All you need to do is access this folder from your terminal in terminal command line type cd and drag the folder from your desktop to terminal it should look something like cd amnesia externaldisk Electrum This opens the folder in terminal and once you are inside the folder command line shows something like amnesia exernaldisk Electrum Once you are in the folder run electrum type electrum Electrum app should open The you create a wallet and save this wallet in your secret disc file looks something like mywallet dat By default each time electrum starts will load the last wallet used Make sure to create a backup copy of your wallet in another secret disk just in case hope that helps sorry for the short technical explanations on Linux terminal but I am not expert just an average user.
Quote from stehillag on February amOn a scale of brown to white how brown is it If it was brown I would say brown If it was tan I would say tan It's white so that is why I'm saying it is white.
I'm not exactly an expert but I would probably go with blockchain info if forced to use an online wallet It also has an onion address but I don't have it handy But I think it is worth the extra effort to get TAILS Electrum set up if only to nullify the risk of your online wallet becoming compromised That can't really happen with offline storage and with the regeneration seeds you're still not SOL if your disk becomes damaged without a backup like you would be if your online wallet decided to exit As far as mixing tumbling goes it's not really necessary as long as the coins were purchased without any connection to your identity There's arguably less risk when doing direct deals compared to sending to a known DNM address but I personally will continue to tumble because is worth it to me for the added peace of mind Although there is always the possibility that the tumbling service could run with your coins Probably not a cut and dry answer.
Quote from OldIsGold on February pmWhat's the best and most trustworthy btc mixer out there right now Bitcoinfog I would say that bitcoinfog is the best Blockchain info privides shared send and I believe it's also quite good If you're really paranoid you can chain them like you btc fog you shared send you but it's also more expensive.
Alphabay seems best bet to me no history of compromis.
MAJOR UPDATE IN THE OP I will now be carrying LSD Needlepoint LEGIT Needlepoint purity and I have a very VERY limited supply of ALD Orange Sunshine pure available also Feel free to message me with any questions you may have Much love TMGers B.
The active vendors forum is generally kept up to date Have a look around a bit there to find someone who meets your need.
The change to a new kernel and reports of users having issues including dirtysouf not being able to verify the signing key has me stuck on TAILS Is there an alternative that includes USB mounting persistence and memory wiping at shutdown Anyone very knowledgeable feel safe using the upgrade The upgraded kernel is the same flavor of Linux used by Redhat which works very closely with the US Government.
Hey guys I am a vendor on other marketplaces and I figured I may as well try and expand my horizons a little bit I currently offer a bookie service that allows anyone to place bets just like they were in vegas On any sport even cricket for any dollar increment at any time Payouts are given right away but we do sleep too so hours max is required at most BTC betting using full escrow is actually much safer than dumping money into Pokerstars or Full Tilt who have proven themselves to be shady as well Either way i just figured id ask before i buy a vendor account because everyone loves this service dating back to SR Please chime in and let me know what you think.

Quote from dardush on February amIs it just me or does this market looks exactly like Evo The evo code is an open source code many markets copy that code today Check out Real Deal Market it even looks exactly like Evo i mean they didnt even bother to slightly modify the colors and layout.
Hello guys I've come over from the silk road with a new user name I'd been scammed out of a little money on a couple market places now and I think what you guys have here is probably the way forward What I would like if it isn't too much hassle is a little help with PGP on android I have an email address and I think a PGP client called AGP If someone could tell me what to try to send and receive back n encrypted message that would be great And good luck with the website.
This is why I would never trust a DNM with something important that would affect my real life like IRL dealers who borrow money for their supply and then a DNM goes down and it's all Fuck I'm dead I owe money to some bad people or heroin addicts on some WHERE'S MY DEPOSIT and going through withdrawal Like this is technology guys ever use it If so you know it breaks when you need it most Don't put in more money than you can afford to lose and don't rely on it for important things.
Couldn't hurt The security forum sure is sneaky down here.

I saw the news article it names specifically Long term investigation that culminated in six arrest across Europe and the US Dang.

You can sign with electrum.
Technology for encryption is one solution but not cost effective If a phone was taken it can be used to pose as that person easily when unlocked The code should work for all local LE except very well funded large cities if used correctly Caution if higher LE are suspected involved as they may have access to a cryptographer Everyone eats daily Develop a code based on talking about eating using date meal time location and types of food to encode Have each category represent some piece of information Never have a one to one correlation of terms but embed them Potato may be the identifier but it would be embedded in saying you want a local meal which includes potatoes somehow Better would be to use a class since items would be variable within the class Fruit could be used by asking for any local dishes which contain fruit with other items The same thing can be done with each category just varying the terms With times you could use a range anything between minutes after the hour or every time with the third digit as means one thing Be creative and test it first by talking it out to each other To put this in use a call is placed Talk about nothing but discuss eating sometime during the start middle or end Person A asks when you are free to eat Person B says I m free for lunch on May at they have good there Can then agree or offer another place to eat or what they had to communicate back Person A and B know from those four bits of information four separate things if decoded This could be the real location and time number of units needed or have type of substance and one bit of useless information to distract You don t have to use all four but no reason not to Vary the structure of the sentenceand conversation as well This method allows no physical trace since it can be easily memorized and causes decoding trouble unless told the code Voice verification should be used Not fast since you should be talking for a while to add similar sounding excess information Does not work well if you need a lot of communication.
This is a forum but you can also use it to directly contact vendors They post their offers in the Active Vendors section You'll also find reviews here so you can decide which vendor is trustworthy and reliable But there's no escrow which means you'll have to pay upfront It also means the admins can't steal your money as they aren't in any way involved with the orders.
Quote from on August pmIf Canada GFN went direct I would never need to use a market ever again Who.
I've had nothing but great experiences on BlackBank Originally only signed up there because I saw was on there and I'm pretty glad I did because it's been pretty consistent Only thing is not too much variety but I'm only really on these marketplaces for acid anyways so it's fine with me Agora is sometimes up sometimes down like now Middle Earth marketplace is pretty quick now too Eventually I think I want to just work direct with some of these vendors through this forum Seems better to develop a long term relationship that way.
Dont use for shit TheGermanhIT takes days to fucking send lipstick instead of half oz of speed and coke at least i like to wear it when i get fucked i didnt fe i got pic and proof he sen it after weeks and i asked for a refund but were abraxasa gon.
OOH ooH i have relevant information So far as I am aware at the moment there are currently up markets not counting agora in addition to the ones you've listed Outlaw Market Dream Market Drug Market and Abraxas Ive got links to register for all of them on my blog which you can find the link for l l l ldown Vthere.
any one have an idea if their tumbling service tumble efficiently does it ressist to blockchain analysi.
Quote from KnucklesFromSR on February pmFrom everything that I read this makes it so that website owners can be held responsible for what their users do I don't agree with this I still don't think you'd get in trouble for making a platform like craigslist which can be used for illegal activity but Ross knowingly set up a black market website actively recruited drug dealers and knowingly and directly profited from illegal transactions.
Attempt by whom It looks like some search replace has been played here What was the original word that has been replaced I don't quite remember Is it just me who thinks that's strange.
Yea I don't think the Agora guys are going to scam exit but it will take them a couple weeks to move stuff around and get all their servers more secure It will be frustrating to have your coins in the ether for a while but my bet is Agora will be back and all of your coins will still be there if you didn't manage to get them out in time before they shut down Patience can be hard especially where coin is involved but don't freak out if you can help it.
if abraxas is not coming back and need a place to buy or sell the Dream Market is the place to go All my main Vendors are already there Registrations are currently open invite for Dream Market safe and have funregardsFT.
That was a piece of work and YES how did buyers NOT see that coming how long is a guy gonna move those numbersDon't blame Nucleus It's the fucking piece of shit vendors that just keep it going There's scams on ALL marketsGolden Rules If it looks too good to be true it probably is Belive none of what you hear and half of what you see ANYTHING is.
strange So when you type it out in the text editor select copy and go to sign encrypt on the clipboard it does nothing yeah no problem really wish I could help you out man but I have no idea what the issue might be.

Thanks for the thorough response Bombheadie I'm curious to see if I can tell a difference my initial thought is No unless duration or something else is noticeably different I'm hoping it's more spiritual as you mention due to its cleanliness.
Thanks Evil Genius I'll chec.
Anyone have any experiences with Dream Been trying to set up there but I'm getting some weirdness with my account Interested in hearing any experiences with the site.
Not sure if to avoid or not This is like an employee dropping into work after months of uninformed absence.
Quote from bombheadie on March amHonestly if I could afford it I would buy grams and grams of ALD and pass it out to EVERYONE Unfortunately the funds aren't there yet But more lucky people will be able to try this chemical When I get more ALD I will be doing this EVERY TIME sometimes it'll be only maybe Maybe people Depending on the quality that I receive Sorry it will only be for people that have not got samples from me yet I will have some for sale prices are a little high right now but when I start to get more the prices will DEFINITELY be lowered I am making VERY little what the prices that I have listed right now I try to get my product out there as cheap as possible without breaking my bank Messaged dibs if possible.
It seems they may have reached such a high user volume on their servers for now they must not allow new users maybe This way the site shouldn't overload completely too much while figuring out a safe way to expand their server capabilities Then again who really knows the reasons but if they were purposely stealing deposits me thinks they would also be allowing new users.
I would not recommend currently using Agora I have always loved the site but a lot of peoples deposits are not showing up lately My deposit has not showed for days with no reply from support I would recommend using Alphabay or maybe Abraxas till Agora gets there shit figured out.
I'm curious what everyone's problem drug is if you care to share Not necessarily right now but in your life in general the substance that has been the hardest for you to kick that's turned your life upside down the most that's threatened your life to most I'm curious because I'd also like to know how you overcame it or what you do to resist or where you are at now I'd like to share and hear others experiences so that maybe we can get tips from each other to help us overcome our problem drug or new methods for resisting Mine is opiates I am currently opiate free and have been for awhile But I had a mild to moderate addiction and it is the one drug I cannot even dabble in anymore because of the possibility that it might take over yet I still crave it regularly Mescaline LSD and mushrooms are what helped me to kick the habit and keep it away Also exercise and meditation and just keeping myself busy I love hiking and riding my bike I used to struggle with adderall had a script but that never really had a hold like opiates did I'm grateful to be passed them and hope strive to stay that way Psychedelics really just helped me to see that there is a better life other than nodding off all the time and doing nothing with my time.
Another UPDATE OK I have decided to do this also I will be passing out Samples of g This is good for TWO people samples of the MDMA that I have also This is VERY STRONG MDMA I saw recently on the Advengers Website that the quailty of this MDMA is if you would like to see this report I will gladly give the link to the website But same rules apply as it did with the ALD US US onlyTrip report MUST be posted And I would like the members to have posts Or be in good standings with other boards or websites Thank you guys Much love TMG BHI've just been in a very good mood lately this is why I am doing this.
Quote from on February pm can you purchase btc through electrum Not AFAIKQuote can you explain why electrum would be anonymous compared to coinbase online wallet It is a client side wallet ie it lives on your computer Therefore as long as your ensure it is configured to run through tor it means you can receieve and send btc wihtout needing to logon to an online wallet This comes with its own ramifications One consideration is that when you start a blockchain wallet using tor perhaps blockchain notes that transaction as having been through tor can we ensure that their serves are safe from government hacks However having a bitcoin wallet on your computer means that you have total control over your btc this has its ups and downs Quote if i were to send btcs from an online wallet to my electrum wallet would it still be anonymous Were the coins bought with anything that can identify you Have you ever logged onto a service that is connected to your btc over a clearnet connection therefore associating your IP to those coins this is a bit simplistic but you get the idea If they were anonymous to begin with and you have electrum setup to only run through tor then they will remain anon.
If this does exist then I'd love to be a part of it The DNMs that I use barely have an novel tryptamines I really want to try them all I guess I've been pretty lucky just to experiment with the ones that have found me so far I think the biggest barrier is just getting the capital to get them synthed and with a medium sized group to contribute that shouldn't be a huge problem.
The safest and most reliable way to ship illegal items is first class I really only ship First Class for the safety of the customer.

Quote from dxuutx on December pmIf anything this is more proof that HoS or whoever is a major target of law enforcement and that we really shouldn't be talking about this business on the clearnet anywhere than any notion that the whole sub is just a honeypot I think the arrogant sense that people on the sub have that their crimes aren't worthy of targeting from law enforcement these are people who live to make drug arrests I also think it's a bit alarmist to assert that it exists only for this purpose and that no worthwhile discussion takes place thereon And it's not insignificant seemingly to me that HoS didn't have any overt problems with reddit when the reviews were adulatory and the attitude changed when they started to turn critical Lol speak english its not insignificant it is not not significant when you use a double negative you obscure your meaning thereon this word has been used not since again not one knows what the fuck not insignificant' again that 'hos didn't' have a problem when the reviews were positive adulatory if you yern to be not unlike Leo Tolstoy well then i'll just not continue writing now.
Absolutely These are factory NIK Reagent Tests They will be sold at cost If there is enough interest I will follow your vendor thread directions Stay safe.
Quote from on March amDamn I should make posts real quick I've always wanted to try ALD Should've jumped on the TMG train earlier sigh Hey buddy If you PROMISE to write a review of your experience I will send you.
That would be Amazing But i personally think that TMG is more than that And who knows in the future there are more choices of safe substances.
OP more than likely you sent coins to an incorrect address You gotta be on your toes And please stop spreading FUD what you're saying is a completely ridiculous statement Agora is tops right up there with BMR and backopy Falco.
does this market exist still Cheers Dolmi.
I use reliable never down and fee is between and.
I have tabs of Meatball's swiss needlepoint but I haven't tried them yet I can tell you that my order arrived to EU within days and stealh was pretty good This guy knows what he's doing Can't wait to try his product.
I found a BTC ATM in my area that was camera free and didnt even require a cell phone for verification I simply scanned a QR code for my wallet or any vendor you want to send to then inserted cash and in seconds the transaction was complete and showing in my wallet This seems like an even better option than Local is Bear in mind the first ATM I found had a camera and did require a cell phone for up to a deposit and ID for anything more The second one however required nothing and I deposited at one time The fee was pretty painful as their BTC rate was around when Bitstamp showed around But complete anonymity for bucks per bitcoin seemed ok to me If you trust the vendor or the shop you can send direct without needing to mix without ever putting your name to those coins This excited me greatly Hope it helps someone else out there with their OPSEC.
Wow good to know I'll make an account on alphabay right now and for any trying to get in abraxasReferal.
Quote from Alberthoffman on March pmAre you working for agora defending them dude why the hell should i lie about swedish sek on my bitcoint wallet on agora that was stolen i read on other forums like reddit that it happened another guy to they stole hes money and they answered him on support that he had some keylogger virus that got into hes wallet thats bullshit my computer is secure as possible im working with IT and computer in my eyes they are scammers and i wont deposit there anything moreI'm a vendor trying to help you figure it out I logged in yesterday and withdraw a fairly large amount and it went into my wallet within minutes SCIdm.
As far as I remember when I looked some time ago exchanges BTC XMR or shapeshift have very low fee instead of darknet BTC tumbler and has fee.
Be careful with bitcoinfog There is some indication they might be selectively scamming and their support has been absent for over a year Helix seems like the new gold standard.
Best of luck with your sales here Luckyduck.
If it's around for good now I have the unpleasent duty of eating my Fedora.
There are two main trusted tumblers and a third which was just released that I will post here along with some information about each I will also post an extra free method that you can use on top of tumbling First BitBlender This service has been around for quite some time and is one of the trusted tumblers BitBlender works with a shared coin system one huge wallet sending many small payments while the others seem more sophisticated many wallets bigger than your deposit that will send amounts to the addresses you gave In both cases it should work as far as blockchain analysis goes Thanks Wilderness BitBlender also has a high volume bonus program where if you send BTC within days your fee goes down by They also have a referral program where once combined deposits from a user and his her referred users reaches BTC in days the referring user will be credited of all deposits Fee Randomized BitBlender my ref link ref Helix by Grams Grams started in April of as a simple search engine for products on the markets After a few months they started Helix and have since created many useful services such as TorAds InfoDesk and GramsFlow Helix has a regular version which requires a grams account and a light version which does not The full version of Helix has more fine tuned controls like delays and sending the clean coins in more than one transaction In the light version you send your coins to the address it gives you and as soon as it gets confirmations it sends the cleaned coins in one transaction to your specified address In the light version it can take up to hours but most transactions are completed within minutes Fee Minimum withdrawal amount BTCMaximum withdrawal amount BTCHelix account cost not needed for Helix Light BTCHelix Pay Shield by SIGAINT SIGAINT has been one of the trusted darknet email service providers for about a year now and has just announced their new tumbler on June I have not had a chance to try it yet but it claims to complete the tumble in minutes What's unique about Pay Shield is that it has a Pay someone with mixed coins feature From their website Pay someone with mixed coins is primarily used to pay someone else with maximum privacy Simply input the payees' Bitcoin address and the amount they expect and Pay Shield will generate a mix for you and calculate how much you need to send to make the mix work out to that amount Fee Randomized Pay Shield on to the free method This is not recommended as a stand alone method There are many websites that store a large amount of bitcoins stores casinos exchanges etc I personally use casino websites send in your BTC play a few rounds penny slots or you'll regret it and send it to your final destination You can also send to your preferred website of choice first before sending it to your tumbler With exchanges it's best to find one where you can send your BTC and convert to LTC or another currency then back to BTC Please beware of Phishing links I highly recommend using dnstats com or deepdotweb to confirm you are always using the correct address these sites have been providing Darknet market info for years and can be trusted I have verified all these links but please feel free to do so yourself.
i used it successfully even had to deal with admin and they were a pleasure to do business with Some vendors have mentioned that they aren't logging in though so make sure that the vendor is active before you place an order.
I feel like this should be shared on other forums as well I see many vendors posting on Reddit now and it kills me to know they could be setting themselves up for an investigation.
Agora is the bulk of my new customers But after an order or two most people are moving to direct deals I'm probably at agora and direct deals it has an ebb and flow to it Galindo.
yeah thought as much I already bought what I needed from a marketplace just wondered about this site because the prices are kinda low lower than the most though.
Update TMG has banned all market link except for ACAS and Dr D from being said on the forum due to spam You can find all the active market invites here Link D Link Customers drddrddig z v onion session register D C A Vendors drddrddig z v onion session register vendor D C A Thank you and enjoy Dnstats co.
Quote from daytripper on March pmQuote from rictor on March pmHope this isn't true as I just made an order with him a couple days ago Just to be clear I'm not sayin that he's a scammer or anything Right now the order has just taken longer than expected without great communication Shit happens we all know that so I'm still hopefulJust looked back on the first page and he says that he ships first class so this could be why its taking longer Just a bit worried myself as Ive already been scammed twice in a row within the past several weeks.
Apple Market is too basic for me I couldn't see any filters for searching The product listings don't have the names of the vendors There doesn't seem to be a feedback facility I checked out one of their star vendors the star rating is from their Grams profile there was no information about when they were last online and no sales history If it's still around in three months time I'll maybe take another look to see if there have been any improvements.
check this link should get you all the information you nee.
iPGmail or oPenGP work.
I answered on.
Thanks.
Hi guysCan anyone please send me the link to the We Love Avengers marketplace I'm getting really confused I don't even know if it actually exists or whether it's a phishing scam site Thanks very much.
I'm with inanna on this one Lelantos is nice and I feel worth their cost They did however shut down temporarily to fight off heartbleed and I was worried for a moment They're back up and running now and doing great.
i just checked localbitcoin and there are plenty of people willing to do cash trades at a slight markup but their cell numbers are listed so it should be easy as making contact and meeting up in person no ID proof of address or anything aside from whatever phone number you use to set up a meeting and even then you could use a burner if you're paranoid.
If you practise proper OPSEC then it should not even be a concern LE or no LE The question is what's the next biggest market Sant.
Quote from Alberthoffman on March pminternal mixer what im intressted in acid from what country you send When you send your coins to Agora they mix with other coins that other users deposited So it might look like people withdrew your coins on blockchain it's just agora mixing your coins I send from the United States.
There is no bigger fuckup Name and shame is usually the rule in this case Either way that vendor needs to get the message real strongly that he is being a real asshole.
Anyone else not able to get on agora today Was having troubles with the captcha earlier today but now the site wont load at all Hope im not alone Cheers S.
I'm extremely confused Can you buy bitcoins and then transfer them into your Cloakcoin wallet Or is Altcoin a totally different currency.
Haha I started that topic and never noticed it was that's pretty cool Thanks for the shout out Scroat PGP really is quite a simple program to find and use I am one of the least computer literate people I know I still type with fingers and ask my yr old brother how to work an Ipad but I googled PGP guide and was able to set it up myself So young cabinboy eruger your quest begins Test out your best google fu and find yourself an installation guide Follow the link above to the PGP trial thread where you will find my public key send me an encrypted message Then plunder the darkweb fer all the treasure ye can carry Happy questing Captain.
It would no longer be a macbook but would be transformed into a beautiful linux distributio.
Going through every page of this thread I think the summary is as follows Receivedxncsux Interest Dibs but No Package ever zipstyle Never received reply from BHapostleofjor actual order and not sample rictor I know not everyone in the above list probably sent in a sample request or order formally but they postured in the forum as if they were so I included them.
This will be my last post in this thread and I am opting out of the sample or any future purchases BombHeadie has been communicative with me before and after his computer issues but the entire experience was a little nerve racking as to why a domestic package would take days Anyways BH has taken responsibility that he believes he did not send my package and has offered to make it up to me which is a very kind gesture All that being said I'm just going to move on myself and encourage the community to make their own decisions There can be new vendor blues and would expect some to give him a second chance and there will be others who say they don't want to risk anything ever the call is yours Thanks to everyone else who has been posting publicly on this topic as it helped raise an issue to the community and glad the problems appears to be packs not ever being sent rather then interceptions or CDs I do appreciate you Bomeheadie taking responsibility for the not sent packs and surely expect you have learned some valuable lessons from all of this Good luck to you in your future endeavors.

BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE Hash SHA In the PGP program you are using there should be an option under one of the tabs to Back Up Keys Use that option to save a text file of both your Public and Private keys As far as I know you cannot change the email address on a key You will have to generate a new one During the creation of that key the program should ask you if you would like to email a backup of you keys I recommend you do Once you have the key file I suggest saving it in more than one place Since Im almost positive it was my thread you were working with Ill try and explain this better Some of what your confusion is I think is with the terminology The signature in my post refers to the text links at the bottom of this post See the links There are of them Vendor Page Review Page and PGP key If you cut and paste those links into your address bar it will take you to those individual pages where Ive posted that info This is not to be confused with a PGP Signature The PGP Signature was generated with my PGP Keys on creation It allows me to sign a message Other users that have my PGP Public Key can use that to verify that The message was in fact created by the owner of the Public Key The message has not been changed or edited from the original content I will sign this message and include my Public Key From there you can copy and paste the whole message to your decryption clipboard and use the Verify function to see that it was indeed me that created this post After you do that try this Copy and paste the message to the clip board just as you did previously except this time pick a random word in here and delete it Because the content was edited when you verify it you will receive a different message With a standard message if you receive that error message you can now confirm or suspect that either the post was not made by the person claiming to have written it OR the original content of the message had been changed which is what happened when I edited my Vendor OP Hopefull this helps some Nonya BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK sEz bmGjTHow AqLTnjXpXNHQ kA ha Jl SswR gGCTTgtSBQpkeX SfI Hb mJTnN Rel m bvOr L H H KV Xd vpdEltg pUT gFr U Pv XEr fuL hZRR jTw iUxwGBmt uAXY t ItzvP J WrgCb XNq Wq R THZ ytHlrYYt rfnzqPCcC z vTsFanDWtiwKRw Krjsm UStwj fDwMR QaVJPj DDY JDmi M DmZnABEBAAG I vbnlhIDxOb YUJ c uZXQ iQE BBMBCgAhBQJTi TNMH Rg PVOxBPx JT jdThOTR JMBLibkHq BtODJ RyooClwBl xLSc TPBiySDFfnDc q vUvaZvjmza enB wErJH Kfl pgykL TXdL haB jhzR VfT x v qarP oCD nBfeQzffj MwhCWEnYuF GjG Y svLrb PZvyJU Fb ub Q CV rgkRvuKK OerRyM j M vcOsYACKOlp cEHrerrSW mdR pN U ja JaounEmTyT KEeS jD ukud AQ EU ujKAEIAKlYK aVmVIrf L to o tdcSU AvklzFC zYJfywz eiG vkOT CmjBe dmYCoir cmIkI nALS O fiIgy ShED DxdFQrPQ TVLqU Bk cJAxZE ob teS TRiY jhqJUlQx Kd xN P xNinfWLK zKGBY fPPKq N ZyQe V MVoxBmWVwUby fGkLEayt UDr Nj YbiNdXkLLO v Wmg udQ YV XU buLOY HSysrG RMo u pyKe UcpwmI cj ZZDhAZOj Ic rrCaPbo MfXnG F MOCC rAq gVNtE RLyNRafVj Jm lBH wQjgpUBL d RRKfe TP rV n Np NGsYIxEpRPvY Yh i rrGNtaDG mz FBlzkg Epos zwUqjz BjVs UntPHJXJrY GE PyHHpE ucMQT nFQ Z H e uP sw W EQ uHDd vec G yN jANno Y z Ihjt IP rgCc ZahZSyiAHqJ b dlLe END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE Version GnuPG v MingW V IAJs b niH nHFKeXP V iGNc mFvs JEvilwtqL PZ GoeG FejxT T P VI ToLUK WhFHTavCB iftzTzhh nLOzB x jpfLxLEMom B IxGI TtNEjFePZBLDO qWlAcZIYnVpz beg vj mx YUQkNQfwEXqv wXG cs b MdrParKgd t Un SGt Bi zplYTaqK dqyIQ iC JiqBi jGGxHPTsI pt hVwXuoGV Uo Ff m WqOCRM kQJJvaBZFk Mphg END PGP SIGNATURE.

Quote from Astraltraveler on June amvanilla reload moneygram are they like washing btc or just like a ewallet But bank option is connected to your real name if cash isnt optional Random person buys btc through local with bank and send it to helix and from helix to another helix then to market would that work sorry for all these newbie reload and moneygram are ways that you would send money to a person selling BTC on Local Bitcoins The bank option isn't connected to your name since your depositing cash into the Local bitcoin's sellers account you don't give your name at any point SC.

Quote from sterlingsword on November amQuote from darknetdreamer on November amSound interesting Would love to write a full review once the sites up Sounds excellent It's making good progress I'll post again with my milestone estimations for delivery I'll be sure also to register you an account Due to the nature of this market wishing to be secure and being based on vendor only inviting I may have to ask around about you just to make sure you have indeed ordered and used product before If a vendor can vouge for you I'll provide you with a valid one time registration link upon release Thanks Looking forward to the market and a full write up My Blog is basically all about Darknet security so I think your site will fit in perfectly given the nature of it.
Quote from unit on May amI deposited into my agora account on around pm I sit here on May th at pm days after my deposit and nothing has shown in my agora account One would hope that with such a big deposit agora support might respond to messages However they have yet to respond to the messages I have sent with just questions regarding deposits They said withdraws are fixed however they are working on deposits I hope Agora comes through on this and doesn't drop the ball Depositting BTC shouldn't be the scary thing about the DNM the mailing of drug should be However I sit here scared worried confused and very irritated at the very simple transaction of BTC to my account I hope Agora fixes this soon as well Because if a normal order takes weeks after vendor sends out package I am looking at a solid month on one order This is sad and not what customers pay commission to see The one positive you can look at is they fixed withdrawls first While that may be frustrating towards your situation and I can see why with that much money but in terms of a market doing an exit scam it wouldn't make sense for them to let vendors withdraw their coins SCIdm.
Quote from clagget on June pmIf you google pgp encryption site the first listing is Igolder A gold trading site with pgp help Then software wike etc My first question is If you use a clearnet site like that one that does the encrypt decrypt can all you type in become open to prying eyes I know that sounds naive but I really don't know No one should be caught dead using a site like igolder I wouldn't use it even in an emergency Quote from clagget on June pmSecond How important is key size You should be using a bit RSA primary key with a bit encryption subkey I wouldn't use anything smaller Quote from clagget on June pmAnd a bonus third question Say I'm browsing my favorite vendors for fun and then go to search a word on google Is mixing tor with clearnet a security problem I wouldn't do that either if you get distracted and use the clearnet browser for something that should be private Spitfir.
Quote from humblebumble on September pmRight Forehead slap I guess my assumption was that those sites would be SSL encrypted USPS tracking is indeed SSL encrypted should be noted that determined Law Enforcement Agencies only need to control a single Certificate Authority that browsers accept by default to successfully conduct a MITM attack on HTTPS However it would surprise me if they did I'd use Tails with JS off.
Have you tried from another AP Are the results the same.

Quote from SnackTime on August amAgora seems to be down Cheers STIt's back up now thankfully Sant.
I ship daily once in a while I'll take a Sunday off I try to ship as quickly as possible and I happen to liquidate quickly so now and then I won't have anything in stock for a few days but I wouldn't offer any sales during those times I won't post product unless it is in stock Thanks L.
has disabled account creation so people would use create other XMPP servers TBH I think it would be easier to use Crypto Cat The only difference is that you need to check the other person's identity manually this could easily be done with PGP.
Quote from Knuckles on August pmQuote from sillywabbit on August pmfuck the centralized markets man trusted vendor boutique sites and email forum direct trades is the ONLYway to go with any kind of assurance that your coin or identity is not being compromised For all we know every market is run by LEO or their informants I was just coming in here to say this I have no problem sending money upfront to trust worthy vendors Hopefully direct transactions like that are both a security benefit to sellers and buyers I prefer forums like TMG to deal with vendors i like it too but I also like dealing with active marketplaces where it's easier for buyer to find me That being said I'm on Abraxas and link.
I have a paxful account And a wallet that I have downloaded I buy bitcoins with cash deposits at BofA You dont even need an account at BofA you just need cash and tell the teller you need to make a cash deposit to an account Fill out the slip with information provided to you by the seller on paxful and there you go BTC within minutes after you deposit.
Quote from Gleeful on January pmStay away I wouldn't even log onto the site It was left with nobody at the helm for several days before it went down Then it pops back up with no explanation There is a strong possibility that it has been taken over by LE with vendors and buyers of bulk being at the greatest risk Agreed Looks sketchy as fuck Avoid.
Threatened my life the most Alcohol definitely The fact that it's so potent potentially dangerous yet also readily available legally and cheap never ceases to amaze me and while I don't drink as hard as I used to I still can't quite get over catching a LSD's helped me to see through to the deeper reasons behind alcohol's role in our society think of how most 'adult' social functions parties revolve around drinking on some level so now I imbibe with a little more awareness of what I'm doing and why.
just found out my login isnt working i used it just yesterday and everything was OK when i logged out but i'm trying now with the same password and im not able to get in no freaking way anyone could have guessed because its a letter generated PW good thing is that i had only chump change over there so haven't lost anythingi was going to order g MDMA now which is the next best market seen for outlaw but it looks awful really it makes agora look like a designing marvel im a sucker for gui no way im using thatDHL has a bunch of known vendors is it a good place to order from Nucleus had some problems recently so i'm not sure if i should go there looking for any inputs.
Hello So I'm thinking about going dark for a while But as with many of you I'm sure you'd like some security in dissapearing off of the DarkNet and wanting surity that upon return you'll still have access to customers vendors and their great product Well I think the time may be here Imagine this A vendor only market based on trust No user registrations and the site is essentially hidden on TOR PGP services by default and maximum security implemented Each and every source should in theory be a somewhat experianced darknet market buyer So essentially the concept is this Vendors start the market I have in mind JOR since he seems to be the most well trusted A vendor only community that when vendors like a customer they are able to provide a ONE TIME REGISTRATION URL that is then to be sent to the user they choose That user may then register on the site and take part in purchasing product NEXT PART I'm trying to plan is Anonymous Vendor buying But I don't quite know how this will work out Essentially since the community is based on trust to begin with vendors will be responsible for knowing how much stock they put into the store No vendors name will be shared and Categories and organization will be added For instance say you wand LSD Well mrPickles and JOR both have it but instead of it saying both vendors there's only one listing with the combined features both MrPickles and JOR both put up there If there's the exact same posting on both accounts the system takes from whomver has the most stock in their inventory to help balance out and for fairness Different categories of drugs if it gets to that point would have their own similar features marijuana would be difficult but i hopefully don't imagine anyone serious about buying drugs buys and ships marijuana or perhaps i'm just naive but i'd like to protect people against that since it's the most widely busted drug and quite frankly is probably within kilometer of anywhere you are at any given point in time that you are on this earth How does this sound I would also provide the solution Open Source so that admins could inspect it vendors and be sure there's no exit scam AWAL code developed in there that I nor anyone else would be able to touch Also the system would use bitchain info's public API to create destory transfer money from wallets and would allow downloadable wallet backups directly from bitchain info If my site ever goes down your coin is always right where you left it so long as you can remember where you wrote down downloaded your backup stuff too Comments Feedback plz I just want access to LSD for my whole life just incase I run through my entire stock pile and this whole thing dissapears Lol I plan on going dark for a while but if this sounds good to the community perhaps it can be a christmas present to everyone that's been loyal Also the vendors I imagine starting out with are JesusOfRave MrPickles and LiquidErgot If you know of anyone else that should be on that list they would need the approval of I don't know Some percentage of approval from all of the current active vendors If you see talk too any of these vendors please have them read this thread Thanks Love all of you EDIT If you would like to make anonymous donations for this service please donate to Quote hmGDQ LTHvdqYgNumU bYCubpkn ennbThe amount of donations received will vastly improve the quality of service I can provide and shorten the amount of time taken If I start receiving a large amount of donations I will put up a site as a placeholder for the service with accurate information If you donate be sure to send me a private message with your userID that you use across the Darknet or send me a PGP key and a message personally You will be heavily rewarded for assisting in the development process of this but it has been undecided as of yet It's possible you could receive a vast amount of free LSD MDMA if this takes off like I plan on it doing Update for Tech Specs Quote from sterlingsword on November amTech Specs UpdateWhile writing and designing I've came up will the following new additions that will make this new market extremely difficult to take down and give a fresh breath of confidence to the DarkNet Marketplace Users will no longer have to fret about Bitcoins being locked into a marketplace if they choose to use mine Internal X CA and SpooferI've developed my own spoofer and my system stores every single bit of data using a kB X Certificate to spoof every single last detail Plain text isn't stored anywhere and no CPU power is saved when it comes to encryption Even if it's a simple Hello WalletMy website is going to use an auto generated BitChain wallet and provide backup abilities Your funds won't ever be dependent on my system Simply download the wallup backup directly relayed through TOR too you via BitChain If my site goes down simply do your thing and log into the wallet using your backup The wallet will also be completely accesable through my website All it will do is connect to BitChain to determine balance etc No funds will be stored on my site Auto migrationThe server will automatically put up special text in specific areas to indicate time When timer goes off the website will peridiocally shut down for a period of hours and transfer to an entirely new server again to thwart LE This will happen as desired or x per week Databases won't migrate as often due to their security in design Maybe per week and imagining the size of the database as it grows While a migration is in place users will be able to use the Direct Trade information posted by vendors if they do so post it During so you may log into your system wallet via BitChain and send your BTC to the wallet address that you have In doing so the description and the text will show up The vendor will have the ability on system restart to archive the order and thus enter it into the system thus depleting stock etc Purchase will continue to process as if it was purely done in the system.
Low Randomized Fees When you deposit coins into your Bitcoin Blender account we will take a low randomized fee of between We make our fees low to keep coin mixing affordable and we randomize the fee to make analysis of our service less predictable In other words if our fee was a standard blockchain analysis would be made more trivial interested parties would need only look for suspected deposits and withdrawals tagged with a modifier Our randomized fee takes this tool away from those who would seek to tie your transactions to you.
Alot has happened in the past month it seems like a few rare events regarding markets and bitcoins have put people in a state of worried frenzy This may be a good opportunity to explore what all this means to us personally as well as a whole It certainly has been exciting I hope that this all wasn't too good to be true and if it is than that is the way it is meant to be.
Hi so I'm about the tumble some bitcoins again and want to ask a few questions to ensure my method is still safe I have been sending coins from my coinbase account to an address on my blockchain wallet from which I use shared coin to either send it to my personal wallet on my virtual machine or to another tumbler though lately my laziness and uncertainty about tumbling services has removed this step Now my questions are is this an effective technique Should I be creating new blockchain wallets regularly to add anonymity or are new addresses good enough And if I should use another tumbler what service do you guys suggest Thanks so much for the help Elli.

Abraxas I don't feel good about Nucleus Being a reseller I can't afford to have someone take off with my coin.
After testing marquis and sending it to labs it was discovered to be meo MIP.
Anyone have some information on how to properly set up about config settings for safe browsing.
it seems as if we all concur on some level I like it how Middle Earth and Nucleus show active listings and they are quicker more reliable than Agora which has tons of old listings that no one took down Nucleus looks more like Evo but I like it better Blackbank is ok but I'm not sold on it yet With these three markets plus a dozen smaller ones we have the right scale and enough diversity so that no one market is dominant running these services depends on having good traffic but not crazy high traffic which giant sites have The problem is that DNMs are really popular everyone is doing it ACID LSD.
or getting a fairly good price quick sheet domestic If can help thanks.
rictor do you want the Postal Police banging on your door asking for their cents do they still do that I've had them drop off a card and had to go down n pay to pick up the mail which would scare the shit out of me if it was a pack that was under postaged maybe rip off the section with the stamps and Postage Due info and just take it to a Post office they might ask for your address to set things straight maybe they DO keep track and will bother you with a request letter I'd consume the drugs in the house and go ask the mailman after they all wear off and the house is clean L.
Great discussion I wouldn't recommend ubuntu but if you decide to use it please check.
Quote from lucidmotif on November amDebian which Tails is based on is not compatible with all Wifi devices inside computers For example it is not compatible with some of the newer MacBook models because it doesn't come with the right drivers You can do some searching to see if Debian comes with a driver for the Wifi device on your computer model If not it is possible to buy a USB connected Wifi dongle compatible with Debian It's also possible to install the missing driver to Tails in some case but there are negative sides to doing that from what I've heard A great suggestion but if I'm reading queen's post correctly it is that this has worked in the past for her although I could be wrong.
is their anyway to contact the admins I forgot my password cause I really dont use the market much.
Check if you are you using the latest TBB Laters TAILS Whonix If custom system are you sure your setup is good If you are unsure I'd advise to use TAILS from a DVDR on a second hand laptop with no HDD You can find that for cheap on craigslist You also could use whonix on a hard drive if your machine is powerful enough TAILS is great if you don't run it from a USB stick in that an attacker can't modify the system and each time you reboot you reboot clean as long as the original system you burn is not compromised You can use an encrypted usb stick to store your bookmarks in a text file your gpg key and everything that you could need Whonix is great as it allow for better isolation If you safely store a copy of both images offline you will be able to start fresh from time to time to be sure you run a clean system.
dont use js on tor man its such a risky thing to doall the people the fbi busts for carding and hacking have leaked info through use of j.
Are you working for agora defending them dude why the hell should i lie about swedish sek on my bitcoint wallet on agora that was stolen i read on other forums like reddit that it happened another guy to they stole hes money and they answered him on support that he had some keylogger virus that got into hes wallet thats bullshit my computer is secure as possible im working with IT and computer in my eyes they are scammers and i wont deposit there anything mor.
Quote from Rainbow Weaver on August amIt Necessary to tumble bitcoins before transfering to a markets wallet Can they track if I am sending bitcoin to a marketplace from a personal bitcoin account I believe every BTC transaction is broadcast in the blockchain Yes it's recommended to tumble your coins.
It means either there was a remaining balance left unpaid by the sender or he didn't pay for the postage at all Maybe your sender dropped the package into a dropbox forgetting to put the postage stamp on it I've done that before but I realized immediately and had them send someone out to open the box so I could affix the stamp You should be fine they won't make you sign for it unless of course it required a signature anyway just for unpaid postage so there's nothing that could validate a search and seizure warrant If you're concerned at all though just make sure you clean house before he gets back.
Quote from on May pmAny advice on cleaning my computer now that I am using tails exclusively whereas before I was using windows Does tor store any information about sites visited onto my computer or do I only need to worry about deleting pgp keys and such What's the best way to go about completely wiping these things Anything else I should be worried about What are the risks associated with enabling scripts on blockchain or reddit I'm still learning about opsec but I will try and help If you are using tails exclusively on that machine I would recommend a dban nuke It deletes everything off of you computer Just google dban Download the file to a cd or usb and then you can wipe all contents of the computer while keeping tails safe on a usb Tails is an amnesia systems when you exit tails your computer system is wiped of all knowledge of the tails session Although I believe your isp may still be able to tell you were using tor not sure on this No need to delete pgp keys files or the like from your persistent folder tails is encrypted as long as your have a strong pass phrase for the system you are good to go As always forbid scripts globally see the S to the left of the url bar Click it I am not sure on the reddit question just don't associate accounts and use a new identity to view pages like that If you are using the blockchain for your wallet I recommend you stop Download and use the electrum wallet client there are many write ups on this If you have any other questions feel free to ask or pm me I do not know everything about opsec but I will help you if I can Cheers Rhet.
Quote from vitaminLSD on June amI mean Mullvad already has a history of denying government requests and the USA doesn't have any jurisdiction to jail a Swedish VPN provider Didn't know they had an history of non cooperation Is it just their claim could be marketing or facts Quote from vitaminLSD on June amMullvad's co founder was the first person that we publicly know of to successfully exploit the Heartbleed vulnerability against OpenVPN this is one thing they have standing out for them above all other VPN providers why they're worthy of your business Before or after the exploit was publicly published If it's after many people could have done that as all the code needed was public too Quote from vitaminLSD on June amThen since Mullvad is a VPN provider and based in Sweden they're not even legally obligated to keep logs under the EU Data Retention Directive because in Sweden this doesn't apply to VPN providers IANAL but they can't even be legally forced to keep logs on users and I've seen no indication that they are Their entire reputation and business depends on it If a Lavabit style situation ever happened Mullvad has already stated they would rather discontinue their business if they were somehow forced to give up information on any user That's what they say but couldn't they receive a secret court order Again I don't know anything about Swedish and European law so I can't comment on that but I doubt they couldn't be forced to reveal identifying information concerning a customer in case of a serious crime I don't know if drug related offenses are taken lightly or not in Sweden Quote from vitaminLSD on June amIf you can figure out how to do this in iptables yourself please share this since this would be a big benefit to the community This iptables configuration is on my bucket list to get working not for Mullvad's sake but for the sake of other VPNs I use but I haven't started working on these iptables rules yet There are many rule set available on the clearnet as well as many possible ways to achieve that You can limit outgoing connections to the IPs and ports of your VPN server and force all other traffic to go through tun Block all IPv traffic as it's not needed for TOR Learning iptables is worth it to understand what the commands are actually doing When you are done testing I recommend iptables persistent as you seem to be using ubuntu Quote from vitaminLSD on June amWith a Tails setup your main threat model is not a compromised DVD but a zero day exploit against Tor Browser On Tails you have no extra layers of security compared to doing everything in VMs If a zero day exploit compromises your Tor Browser on Tails your entire OS including your PGP private keys your PGP private key passwords your decrypted KeePass entries after you unlock your KeePass all of this is theoretically accessible to the attacker now And if the government is doing some sneaky shit going after Tails users to get after say serious people in the drug trade then these above things would be the keys to the castle that the feds would target on a Tails system Don't forget that Tails has a firewall blocking non tor traffic If the attacker can't either escalate privileges to the root user or change his user to debian tor there is no way he can guess your actual IP address They also use AppArmor Of course virtual or physical isolation would be better than Tails if you have no interest in the fact that's it's fully amnesiac and can be run from a read only DVD But Tails is better than running TBB on a windows or linux machine with no firewall rules For those of us who like an amnesiac system and don't mind using no VPN as well as for those who want a VPN and use a VPN router Tails seems to be a good option If you want to really protect your private key keepass and unencrypted stuff get a second cheap laptop and keep all these air gapped Even if you use virtual machines an air gapped computer remove the wireless card if you are paranoid can't hurt to manage your GPG keys and make sure they never touch a machine connected to the network Quote from vitaminLSD on June amWith this VM setup I described all you would pretty much ever do with your host OS at that point is install Ubuntu security updates and that's it And you should do it over a VPN that has cover traffic over it too so the government can't profile you that you run Ubuntu on one or more systems from your house or what packages you keep updated The Ubuntu packages you install from apt are signed too So if your initial Ubuntu iso you installed was a legitimate one the signed packages you're downloading from Ubuntu should be legitimate as well Hell you can even run Tails in a VM as your main way of using Tor Browser and a VPN from your host OS Now you've solved the Tor de anonymization problem and you have insulated yourself against zero day exploits from the government For anyone focusing on virtual machines Whonix is probably better than Tails as it provides software isolation and comes with supposedly strong firewall rules But it's not read only An attacker can theoretically modify your images even if as you said it's a complicated task And it's far from amnesiac It's even possible to setup a VM for VPN with VPN only firewall rules and use this as a gateway to the internet for whonix gateway You would have to start two VM before being able to use TBB on the third one but you'd be able to avoid leaks on each step Would be maybe better to use a VPN router so that an attacker escaping a VM would still be stuck behind the VPN But if the attacker is skilled enough to escape your VM couldn't he hack your router too Quote from vitaminLSD on June amBut I don't even recommend running Tails as your main VM OS for Tor Browsing and here's a few reasons why When I tried using the built in Tor Browser feature to update Tor Browser in Tails at least in a Tails VM I had I don't know if this is different in Tails the newest now Tor Browser complained that it does not have the system permissions required to install it This can be remedied by installing the newest Tor Browser manually but this is kind of defeating the purpose of why you'd want to use Tails in the first place So basically the next time there's a Tor Browser update that has any security patches in it your Tor Browser on Tails has known in it and I don't think anybody bothers in Tails to check if their Tor Browser is up to date every time they boot up Tails You probably would have to download a new iso each time there is a new release Quote from vitaminLSD on June amWhereas with Tor Browser on Ubuntu there's a simple on click button to upgrade the entire Tor Browser install and Tor Browser at least on Ubuntu checks every time on startup if there's a new Tor Browser version Also Tails only runs normal Tor Browser and not Tor Browser hardened the latter of which has been hardened more against exploits Right but Tails includes a firewall forcing traffic to the TOR network and avoiding leaks Tails also sets the system clock through TOR and wipes your memory when you shut down your computer won't work if run in a VM obviously Quote from vitaminLSD on June amQubes OS praised by Edward Snowden and other esteemed computer security professional is actually built around the concept of everything being done in VMs but using Qubes proficiently is out of reach for most DNM users But if you're making repeat purchases or posting on darkweb forums with that same username or posting about things that would get you arrested then a VPN is absolutely a necessity unless you want to leave yourself open to ending up like that Silk Road lieutenant A Qubes live DVD with whonix working out of the box would be nice and easy I've seen posts where some people ask for it Maybe in a close future it will be available A problem I see with Qubes is that you need recent hardware to be able to run it while a second hand laptop should be able to run Tails just fine I don't know anything about this Silk Road guy Was he busted because of a weakness in TOR Was he a Tails user Quote from vitaminLSD on June amThis is super paranoid in a good way I think if you need this level of security go for it but this wouldn't protect you from having your Tor connection de anonymized to your home IP still The thing is that if your Tor connection ever gets de anonymized to your home IP address and they do decide to raid you or do physical surveillance on you and then raid you or the places you do business at you wouldn't be expecting any of this to be coming It wouldn't protect you if TOR is broken If TOR isn't broken physical isolation will make it impossible to an attacker to get your real IP unless they are able to hack your TOR router as well as the system where you run your browser Quote from vitaminLSD on June amI trust Tails they're in it for the right reasons but you just can't run VMs in it and it's not VPN friendly I totally agree with you To use a VPN with Tails the best way is probably to use a VPN router setup like what Cosmic Consciousness described Another problem with Tails is that guards change too often Using bridges is an easy fix In the end it depends who your enemy is On the one hand if your enemy is powerful enough not much will protect you it can be easy for him to trace the VPN connection back to you spying on the network without your VPN provider or yourself knowing Targeted hacking would be an option too On the other hand for most people hanging out in this majestic garden who like myself are here for the community and not to conduct business I feel like Tails or Whonix can be good enough eventually with an air gapped machine for GPG and sensitive documents as usually recommended A VPN router if the provider can be trusted or to hide the fact that you use TOR to your ISP can be nice A setup as you describe can be great as well as long as there is a strong firewall and that everything is done the right way Using an OS like Tails or Whonix is nice as you don't need to be tech savvy to set it up You just need to trust the devs.
I'm sorry I have not heard of or used helix before As long as you don't send the coins directly from paxful to your markets wallet you'll be okay No much to worry about at all unless your moving lbs of marijuana and grams of xtal a week Just place a small dollar order for btc see if you can get that into your desired wallet that way you get the hang of it before making a bigger order.
Dude don't make these kinds of claims and allegations unless you've done your research and can back your claims up with solid facts If you're going to be that paranoid don't use Agora I'm taking a break from Agora for personal reasons for a little while myself.
Why would you use tails You can make a more secure setup on your own Use a larger USB stick like gb.
Thanks for the info It seems pretty sketchy glad everything worked out for you.
Using the veracrypt backend makes it encrypted Whonix is better than tails IMHO.
Bitcoin Blender is the first one i ever tried and it worked very fast I had no troubles and was able to withdraw instantly after depositing You can also set it to withdraw your coins later at random times with multiple withdraws to make it even harder to trace As for Bitcoin Fog i would avoid it I've read too many negative reviews saying that people never got their coins back Some do but some don't Apparently they might be doing a selective scam They don't scam all people so they can stay and look innocent and blame the issues on other services ect and keep people using their services so they can keep doing it.
Where is the problem with bitcoiners getting traced Never heard of one case.
Quote from pinto on November amI have a paxful account And a wallet that I have downloaded I buy bitcoins with cash deposits at BofA You dont even need an account at BofA you just need cash and tell the teller you need to make a cash deposit to an account Fill out the slip with information provided to you by the seller on paxful and there you go BTC within minutes after you deposit I looked into it Should I use Tor with this website I might use an American Express gift card something disposable from the dollar store.
For me it was alcohol It had taken over my life so much that it had actually gotten me into trouble with the authority A mixture of depression hopelessness and a REALLY high Roughly ug dose of LSD is what got me out of that pit It's not really what I'd recommend to treat your alcoholism especially when your troubles with it is just a week fresh but let's just say that I had much much darker intentions when I carelessly took the LSD tabs In the end instead of seeing hopelessness in life and beauty in death I ended up seeing hope and beauty in life That was Christmas night I have still had the occasional urges especially if I get stressed but I have not drank since that night Sometimes what I'll do is pour myself a glass of Up and pretend that it's Southern Comfort something that I used to like drinking.
I'm still iffy on meo its decent less manic and more clear headed But MXE really gives that euphoria something meo lacks in I thought meo was supposed to last longer but it seems about the same length as mxe Although one day on meo it gave me a shitload of energy but this chemical is so odd that everytime I've taken it its always been a bit different in what it does.
Well my order came in today I needed it for the past weekend however this will be nice to hold on to for future use Came mostly as small rocks with some powder It has a dull white almost bone color to it with some of the rocks being very translucent Stealth was ok for domestic could've have used a visual barrier Hand written address and poorly chosen fake name Now my biggest complaint is that there is postage due and a message on the envelope saying the postage needs to be paid and that the return address is not good I am not exactly sure what this means for as I've never had an issue quite like this.
Great info Thanks to you and the original writer.
It seems that while everyone else has begun receiving deposits again mine has not turned up yet quite concerning It was sent from my Middle Earth wallet which reads Confirmations Does this suggest it was not withdrawn properly or is it more likely to be a deposit problem on Agora Can I check Blockchain for the transaction.
I was able to log in this morning but then while sending a message it went down and has stayed down for a couple hours now The forum was down then up now its down again This does not look good and right after the untimely demise of nucleus Its a real shame if its gone for good Lets hope it comes back up.
I guess finding us here proves we already saw how we can handle this cryptocurency issue for me BTC rules and offers enough privacy and anonymity Good of u to think educate us on this will consider this when all will align Thanks.
Import a vendor's public key Copy the vendor's public key into the clipboard Left click on the clipboard icon on the top right Tails menu bar and select Manage Keys Maximize the new window that pops up On the Passwords and Keys windows select GnuPG keys Type Ctrl V or do Edit Paste from the menu bar for that window A window should pop up with the vendor's PGP ID Click on Import If you get a pop up with the following error Could not display 'Clipboard text'Reason Unrecognized or unsupported data there was a formatting problem with the key you copied into the clipboard Make sure that you are copying all of the key including the five dashes at the beginning and end of the key and the BEGIN and END statements PGP is very picky about formatting errors.
Agora has posted a message stating that they're moving their servers while they take down paus the website Who knows if when they'll be back up Would advise against doing any further business there in the mean time potentially in perpetuity.

Quote from SalviaGoddess on July pmi agree that crashing on MDMA while tripping on LSD is not pretty probably one of the worst experiences of my entire life i call it the candyflop That's probably one of these rare cases where a MDMA redose would have been beneficial.
Hey guys If anyone know the Tails OS good enough to give a concise step by step guide on how to encrypt a message without posting a link to the tails website or reddit post I would be forever greatful Thanks in advance.
talking about maya special edition from value lucid i have to say this those are claimed to be ug and i had a very good time with them i had a couple of times half of them another couple times just a quarter and once the entire before discovering tmg i always bought from him and being the first time that i bought blotters on the dnm with clearly declared dosage such dosage seemed totally realistic though i recently had the occasion to try some swiss bliss ug from mr pickles and seeing the effect of those let alone the ug black amber that's a totally different story i'm more and more convinced that the maya s e are underdosed still extremely good acid but most probably in the ug range.
Sound interesting Would love to write a full review once the sites up.
Quote from Cidkid on July pmwell i dont follow that rule because the more lsd you take the more depth and spiritual awakening you find and if you can get that in one blotter instead of three well then you found yourself a bargainWhy would a vendor ever give you a better deal on stronger hits Vendors just price in terms of dollars microgram For example John sells microgram hits for micrograms dollar and microgram hits for micrograms dollar You're only getting a better deal because you're buying more at once he sells microgram hits for or micrograms dollar I don't understand why people buy anything other than microgram hits.
Yes yes thank you much my broth.
I'm a bit worried about a deposit I made to Agora which hasn't shown up in my wallet yet Normally my Agora deposits appear within mins of sending them this one was sent about hours ago Should I be worried.

It seems that TAILS provides email services Anyone would have a comment regarding this Oops sorry I misinterpreted this post here will secure the email service I will use not provide an email service.
I've seen more clearnet sites that sell trypamines than I have on DNMs You can find al ist of vendor shops on reddit All depends on where you live of course.
I see one vendor managed to get btc free of EIC so there are signs of life but admins have left it too long to make an announcement RIP me thinks.
A DoS for ransom they are actually quite common from what I have seen Also there are a variety of other explanations Server maintenance taking longer than expected maybe Security measure being implemented Huge influx in traffic from the bitcoin flux coin in and coin out When a market gets taken down by LE or is the result of an exit scam you will basically know immediately.
You can host coinbin locally like electrum leaving no issues of j.
We have a lot tied up in escrow there at the moment as well but we are optimistic It doesn't feel like all the other exit scams before this Sant.
Lets not jump to conclusions hereDoes anyone have ANY real information relating to this Cheers S.
Well it would be best to customize the forum to set it off by default yeah but a quick simple workaround in the mean time would be to just run this query every so often to shut it off for everybody all at once update smf members set show online This could be done from a cron job to run every minutes a la someuser mysql u sqlusername ppassword dbname e 'update smf members set show online.
I have been using Oasis recently its a great market and admins are very friendly Its the only market that doesn't charge vendors thats pretty amazing not to mention they have all features of competing markets The UI is pretty nice too.

Quote from love is all around us on March pmPostage due handwritten etc Makes you think a high school kid w o a scale or a clue is slinging this gear Am I required to pay the postage that is due.
The friendly admins have enabled the feature that allows us to opt out of appearing online when we are To do this Go to Profile Account Settings then uncheck the option that shows people you are online EVERYONE DO THIS Here's some food for thought on why QuoteThis is because of all those FBI probability attacks They monitor when you activate tor when you log into sites like say this site if it is ever compromised or safe mail which announces to everybody when you are online and then present this incourt and it's apparently solid evidence because plenty of people like Jeremony Hammond of LulzSec fame got convicted through simple meta data this guy appeared on IRC at this time we monitoredhis wifi signal yes they can pinpoint your wifi signal if under surveillance and he was using tor exactly the same time That's all it takes.
Quote from on May pmI hope this isn't a silly question but is there an alternate url for Ag I know a few other markets have given out alternate addresses since initially going down this last time I've only been able to log onto Ag once since then and am not sure if I overlooked it or what I don't think there is According to lenged there used to be a link that only vendors could access but there definitely isn't one now.
Thanks I really appreciate it.
I hate seeing new markets having the evo design looks like a scam waiting to happe.
I was wondering is there a bitcoin service that will allow me to make bitcoin purchases without bank account or credit card information I would like to be more anonomou.
Yep Oasis is definitely my favorite market to use I just wish more vendors were active there.

Quote from Cosmic Consciousness on June amQuote from vitaminLSD on June amQuote from ssod on June amCurrently i am connecting to the darknet via tails tor bridges i feel as this is not a very safe unless i am wrong Anyone have any advice on additional security measures to protect my real IP I get bulk so safety is a big concern to me let me know if my lack of faith in bridges is invalid though Tails is not secure for serious DNM activities and here's the first reason why USA Feds have already conducted Tor attacks that have landed significant DNM figures behind bars the above article has more details about how the Feds did it and who they have arrested so far a former Silk Road lieutenant for starters Also Tor bridges are practically useless for hiding from the NSA because the NSA harvests the tor bridge addresses from the emails send to from the Tor Project the NSA knows you're using Tor anyways if you're using a Tor bridge Tor bridges were designed for people in repressive third world countries not US citizens hiding from the NSA It also gets worse and this is information that every DNM user serious or small should know about but since the Edward Snowden leaks the NSA has talked about if not bragged that they have timing attacks for de anonymizing Tor users at the NSA In the Washington Post revealed that the NSA had figured out various ways of unmasking and penetrating the anonymity of the Tor Network Since according to a page research paper titled simply Tor the agency has worked on several methods that if successful would allow the NSA to uncloak anonymous traffic on a wide scale effectively by watching communications as they enter and exit the Tor system rather than trying to follow them inside One type of attack for example would identify users by minute differences in the clock times on their computers And it still gets worse Tor prioritizes fast relays and so if you consider that plausibly speaking many and possibly most of the most high speed Tor relays are run by Western intelligence agencies and not just grassroots Tor volunteers it makes timing attacks so much easier for them From the pando com article from above QuoteIn Tor co founder Roger Dingledine revealed that the Tor Network is configured to prioritize speed and route traffic through through the fastest servers nodes available As a result the vast bulk of Tor traffic runs through several dozen of the fastest and most dependable servers on today's network clients choose one of the fastest exit relays around of the time and of their choices come from a pool of relays This information above has already been public since the Edward Snowden leaks so now everyone reading this has no excuse not to get off Tails and learn Ubuntu or your other favorite flavor of Linux and start using a reputable VPN impeccable track record of standing up against government requests keeps no logs and you can pay them in bitcoins You can start on this now or end up like the silk road lieutenant who got arrested because his Tor connection got de anonymized by the government to what was probably his home IP address And if you're a serious DNM user you don't do business hours a day online from a public wifi spot This is not an acceptable solution for power users Bonus points if you use a pre paid g hotspot with your non Tails flavor of Linux a reputable VPN where your face was never on camera buying the hotspot think fake wig cell phone at home and paid in cash True story Great advise I however use a preconfigured travel router can be found on Amazon called GL iNET and flashed it with DD WRT and Open VPN I then uploaded several VPN config files onto the router itself and foced all traffic through the VPN Add to that I ONLY PLUG IN I never use WiFi So the travel router is connected to the WAN port from Ethernet over Power extender and then wired through the LAN port into my machine I run Tail when on the go and whinox when home I also 'bridge' into the tor network on start up and never use persistant memory I feel it is more secure to have my content Keys Keymanager etc stored on a seperate encrypted USB thumb drive that I then upload my keys before I go live So im essentially between my machine and the VPN that is then relaying those packets through a bridged connection into the tor I highly suggest you use AWS to spawn yourself a VPN I feel it is more secure to have your very own VPN config rather than use one that is shared by others That's cool that you're using a VPN router that is definitely another good option besides the g hotspot I just threw out the g hotspot tip since it would be easier for most non tech folk to get working When you use your own AWS VPN server though are you ever concerned that if you logged in to a clearnet website or did anything that the feds would know that login was or just that web browsing traffic was you are you ever concerned that you're the only VPN connection going to that server Since the NSA could see you're the only connection going to your server on TCP or whatever port you configured it to listen on If your original network connection is coming from a g hotspot or something other than your home IP address you wouldn't be in bad of shape compared to if you were connecting from your home IP but you basically get no cover traffic by using your own VPN server Plus you need to pay for it anonymously but you seem crafty and there's a few ways to do anonymous payments like that To the credit of commercial VPN providers and not all of them but there is at least one company I know of that takes their security very seriously and in some of the countries where they run a VPN server they own their own hardware including in the most secure country where they have servers and in their most secure country too they personally know the people who operate the data center They also have a track record of not accommodating government information requests nor in the other countries but say with their USA nodes they would have no control if the feds showed up with a gag order and took their VPN server's second hard drive that had the server's SSL private keys on it But at least on their certain overseas nodes this will basically never happen since they know the people who run the datacenter and they own their own hardware there.

Yup my backup contact during market outtages or post closure is here on TMG and my secondary backup if TMG is also down is Grams if we get to the point where I actually have to use Grams to communicate I'll make a backup email contact but I don't want to be affiliated with an email address right now no I no longer use my old one because I have too many inboxes as it is and don't want to get a bunch of emails I'm not going to read It's easy enough to find me as it is when I need to use an email address I will resume doing so Making a point of making it known that TMG is my backup contact and Grams is my secondary backup because the amount of times people think I've disappeared off the face of the earth because they didn't check either of the two biggest markets around is mind blowing Yes I'm talking about you Agora buyers who think I've been inactive for the last year straight I'd tell you to look harder next time SR and Evo would have been the first placed I'd have checked if I was looking for someone who was vending since SR but instead of having to look for me at all just know that I'm here on TMG and if TMG ever goes down I'm on Grams.
This whole approach does not exactly cry I have my shit together.
Pretty sure Agora is number one I'm sure every one of these sites is crawling with cops working very hard to find anything I'm sure the fbi geeks have the biggest case of blue balls and the women with a nasty yeast infection trying to find the server If they only knewIts in the Alamo.
have you imported the PGP key of the person you're trying to send an encrypted message to.
What about Silk Road Unless there is something bad about it I'm not to sure.
lol nuke didn't sell anything to DHL nuke was run by bunch of incompetent peoples i was pretty sure at a point their mods were just copy pasting standard replies onto a dispute thread some gibberish i couldnt remember but two different mods posted the same generic response who sold what evolution probably sold their logo to nucleus wont be surprised if it were the same lot of mods who were left out and jobless from evo admin after kimble verto pulled their shit its downright stupid to trust a market thats been hacked yet people keep trusting market with escrow a vendor apparently lost over gees on an order its tough luck but gotta be smart ahead of the market.
though whonix doesnt offer persistence or usb mounting it uses inbuilt storage and also doesnt leave any memory trace on your host you can encrypt any data which you want as persistence storage.
Shot you a PM back Thanks fragbite.
Hello is Grams helix safe to use Anyone washed their btc there.
Just do LBC and a cash deposit to a stranger's bank The process is easy enough for anyone Any legit trader will be happy to guide you through it Before you buy please check out my listings on Hansa and my threads on TMG There are tons of great vendors on TMG but it can be difficult to navigate Look for any way that you protect yourself and your money Love LR.
IMO one of the safest ways is Tor XMPP OTR Basically put XMPP handles the chatting Tor handles the anonymity OTR handles the privacy encryption.
Glad it worked out.
Why not using Qubes OS Comes with whonix Easy to use Possibility to chain VPNs easily VM are read only so it would make it harder for an attacker to modify your system than using Ubuntu.
ug that would most likely overpower all of the rest IMO you should take in between ug and ug depending on how strong a shrooms dose you'll take with it vial of liquid shrooms how much would that be in terms of grams of dried shrooms The MDMA doses seem ok although honestly a booster dose may be unnecessary.

For information Cloakcoin CLOAK is re branding into Project One or One Currency ONEC Only a change of name nothing else change See to be confused with the One Coin scam it's something else totally Not sure this re branding with this new name is a good idea but their anonymous system doesn't change and is good Wait and see.
There is a way to get XMR anonymously with cash like Localbitcoin Bitsquare added Monero but I did not read how it works But if you buy XMR with BTC and you send your XMR from XMR wallet A to your XMR wallet B they are completely clean and private anonymous untraceable.
I like Nucleus Middle Earth I saw some kid was on Middle Earth at this coffee shop on his laptop those eagles they do look pretty harmless I wouldn't have known I'm setting up on Black bank soon OOTP is on there and a few other vendors I use feeling GOOD about everything NOT Agora we should have markets ideally so something for eeveryone but I'm trying to stay close to home if you know what I mean good luck markets.

Quote from luxaeterna on May pmwent with zalas approach except deposited cash in a bank via a machine so no face to face with bank person and no leaking of id to buyer only thing is banks cameras only problem there I can think of is if buyer is LE and wants to know who I am they could use the time stamp on the recpiet I had to take a screnshot of and go to the cameras of that bank around that time however that's a lot of hassle and they would have to try id me by face only put up posters this pay points are similar to ATMs are machines but i haven't noticed any camera on them even though there might be hidden ones are terminals for self service anything u can think of opened and if paranoia is so big u can go using it with a mask no jok.

Quote from Not Ron Paul on March amQuote from DiMiTreeZ on March pmI agree Oasis is pretty awesome It is a nice looking site it is designed well Can someone explain the donation thing though So there is absolutely no fees that they demand Its just what you feel like donating If so that sure is different and very respectable But I sure do hope that people are donating so they have the drive to stay legit and grow in popularity Yes they are completely donation supported They require a bond for new vendors but they waive this for vendors that can confirm they are already established on other markets and the bond is returned to new vendors after orders Listings and sales are completely free Oasis does not take a percentage or fee for listings or sales We are donating of our sales to the market and we plan to continue doing that From what we can asses they do not need our donations to support maintain and continue to develop the market They plan to continue with or without significant vendor donations and sound like they are set up to do so We get the impression they know what they are doing We think we are good at recognizing these things We feel safe on this ship Wow they don't take a or fee And they return excess coin to buyer's wallets How do they even make money.
I do miss the original Silk Road Seriously at this point it seems so nostalgic.
They don't really have fa though many have requested it They have optional pgp login but you can't set it up so that no one can login without both password and pgp so its kind of weak.
Where do I find the market All I can see are the message boards.
This sounds interesting No clue if such a site exists or not though Keeping my fingers crossed.
Well Bit Blender went smoothly took less than mins then I went to deposit to a blockchain wallet and it sent fine address was for sure correct and everything but now blockchain is giving me an error when I try to log on Error Web Server is Down My javascript is also temporarily allowed like you have to do to see the captcha so that's not it Hope this is resolved soon I was just logged onto my wallet and then the second I sent them to that wallet from bit blender I went to make sure they went through then it gave me the error EDIT Ok just found out blockchain is down therefore blender worked flawlessly in less than mins Hope the issues at blockchain get sorted out soon though that's for sure peace Mrs B.
When you find it let me know We are currently looking for any and all information regarding the Arthur Colton Company out of Detroit MI USA that made a power triturate machine These were said to be the best at making microdots.

I just read through the part where VitaminLSD describes creating a amnesiac like enviorment using a VM the only problem with that is that assumes your ost system is not compromised That would mean your running a super clean no script offline and completely secure Host system like OpenBSD Itsfar more likely that your host system is already compromised I don't suggest this unles your running a very hardened setup like OpenBSD You could deploy a similar but tighter setup like whinox Similar concept where one Machine is exclusivcely a portal for the client.
I was copy and pasting and when i went to past into PGP I must've misclicked or something and recopied the original text not looking i just clicked Ctrl V and Send so i'm just wondering if messages are stored on TMG servers even after the message is deleted and whether i should burn the address now Thanks I'm still in disbelief that i did that.
method of anonymizing bitcoin has even been recommended by Bitcoin Core developer Peter Todd For more information on how Monero protects your privacy you can visit Monerinfo The role of Monero in anonymizing your bitcoin will become more important as companies like Elliptic and BitCluster use advanced blockchain analysis that will be able to pierce the veil of obscurity offered by traditional bitcoin mixers.
Not had a single problem with Helix Just register for an account though the Heliz Light doesnt sound safe for larger amount.
Bombheadie it looks like you are logged in now Any update you can provide to the group Can you confirm all packs were sent as expected.
Hey bh Any chance you ship international Some love to Asia Tabs are easy to send along with adequate stealth even a domestic pack would be enough to clear international customs but the stamps have to be correc.

Yeah I have made a key I am going to shut down and restart Thanks for your help all the same.
LOL it looks ugly sorry if I am straight forward hereThe days of search bars sticking out of the UI are all over look at some of the newer markets the design is as important as the features Besides what is your UPS over say AlphaBay or Dream or Nucleus.

Quote from bombheadie on April amUPDATE IN ORIGINAL POST I sent my message to bombheadie again so we'll see Its been month since i ordered In that course of time the vendors laptop broke one week Then grandma died then friend OD'd but in the midst of this someone received their order on st based on an above post I'm gonna have to call BS.

Thanks for this Looks like that Helix link isn't working or maybe they're down right now.
Maybe we could throw vendors personal sites up there as well I've got one I know albion does and Gamma SC.
I don't trust anymarket now that evo exited like they did Prob agora gets my vote but i'm always quick in and quick out.
Multisig is imo the greatest thing to come to darknet markets in this year It protect all user funds from exit scammers I highly recommend you learn how to use it and support it so we can stop scams for good markets that I know support If you know of any others please let me know You can learn how to use multisig on my blog here.

Disable javascript and you'll be OK If you can't login with javascript disabled better forget about this site Check for how to do it for the reason You could use TAILS or whonix if you don't already use a better way than those to connect to TOR.

Abraxas market is down including all alternative links and there is talk on ddw about an exit scam I really hope it is not the case of my favourite markets but cant help not thinking about the predicament of human greed peac.
Is it just me or does this market looks exactly like Evo.
Just go buy an old ThinkPad you can find them all over the place for bucks without hardrives boot into tails via your usb drive cheap simple effective.

Hello Blue Dream and Root yes I saw that detail about is used to make a connection Trouble is I never saw that warning before ever only on two occasions when logging into TMG The only reason I saw it was because I had Vidalia running For those of you who dont monitor the behaviour of the connections how will you know if it is happening to you or not I checked everything on my side but found zilch Bit worried now Is there a way to directly contact admin without it appearing public when something like this happens Can use pgp but time If somebody is up to something maybe its better that they dont know we know hehehe they know now Not sure the best way to do it Anyway thanks for the response Feels good that people try to help each othe.
It was only down for a few hours a couple of mornings But still its disturbing to try to log in and its not there Seems to be doing fine now.
Im terribly sorry if this is not the right place to ask but when the agora website told me to click a certain link for an invite it ended up not working I was wondering if someone here could help me perhaps Thanks a lot and sorry again if this isn't a good place to ask.
Quote from Spitfire on December pmI thought it was great too until they started serving ads through Torads What really got me and caused me to abandon my accounts there is the fact that an ad that I was being served related to an organization in my country of origin That is either A HUGE coincidence or IP address data is possibly being leaked indicating the country of origin I've also been using sigaint org but I've never seen any ads there Perhaps that's because I'm browsing with JavaScript disabled and Ad Block enabled The service has so far been quite reliable.
Sorry if this is a noob question But Is it safe to access electrum org through Tor I have coin poss linked to my identity that I want to tumble around but would like to avoid fog if possible just because it seems sketchy to me however if there is no other safe option I will use fog Any way i could send them from a wallet currently linked to my ID to another wallet created and only accessed through Tor and repeat this times with throwaway wallets then to my vendor of choice Hehe idk any advice is truly appreciated peace Mrs B.
At least OP is polit.
The simplest PGP software is GPG USB IME It can be saved on a USB encrypted if you like although it doesn't have to be The software will make you a public key which you will give out to anyone who wishes to send you an encrypted message Likewise you'll use other's public keys to encrypt messages to them Encrypting a message will return you a big string of gobbledygook which can then be decrypted only by the holder of a corresponding private key GPG USB has some simple instructions wih it It's literally a few clicks of a mouse easy stuff.
Just needed to understand what was happening no guess work here The advice about tails from a dvd running on a non hard disc system i take on board Also glad to see the event is normal in some cases Thanks for the feedback.

Was hoping to make an order from bomb in the upcoming weekend week but I'm going to hold off until more successful landings occur Nothing against bomb but talking about drugs you don't have yet multiple large extended posts reporting current drugs only two small posters saying they had landings one a guest looks quite strange to one who has been in the darknet rc scenes since the beginning Especially since domestic usually only takes but a week at most I'm hoping deeply that he's not a malignant vendor but just felt like expressing my concerns Looking forward to a positive conclusion Marble.

Quote from Doses Lysergic on January amSimilarly the use of double negatives just obscures your true meaning Unlike some of your other examples the double negative is far from being an anacronism and is widely used today not just in English but also in Chinese French Spanish and other major languages Of course it can also be misused However I'm talking about English English not American English Australian English etc The double negative is used to add greater emphasis to the statement It doesn't alter the logical meaning but it changes the emotional meaning that is it conveys additional information on the writer's strength of feelings about what they have written So for me dxuutx was saying I consider this especially significant but in a low key way which didn't impose his view on the reader In speech it would be possible to lay extra stress on the word significance and thus give the option of avoiding the double negatiive In online prose emboldening or italicising significance could achieve a similar effect but personally I think these should not be used unless necessary because of the possibility of text being copied and pasted into other applications Notepad html editors social networking sites other forums etc where the mark up language would not be recognised Maybe dxuutx could or should have avoided the double negative but that would be a choice of style not grammar or syntax The English as it stood was correct A search for the phrase not insignificant including the quotes finds somewhere between and results depending on the search engine which indicates that the phrase is in everyday use Perhaps it comes down to different forms of English Eg what is common and acceptable in England may be or unacceptable in the USA and vice versa It's something of a stereotype that English English abounds with often tinged with irony If Jack Swigert had been English the phrase would probably have been Houston we've had a slight mishap here rather than Houston we've had a problem here Quote from Doses Lysergic on January amHistorically this use of language served as a separation between economic and racial classes No argument to your general polnt Very broadly speaking England has been bilingual since the Norman invasion of There was the Norman French Latin spoken by the new aristocracy and clergy and there was the older Germanic Anglo Saxon spoken by the peasants Writers such as Chaucer and Shakespeare helped bridge the gap and the invention of the printing press must have played a part but it wasn't until the late C th that the English caste system finally began to thaw Yet even with all the changes of the last years the differences in vocabulary grammar syntax and pronunciation between the top level of the establishment and the average worker are so distinct that it only takes a couple of seconds and half a sentence to know which is which.
There are too many marketplaces for everyone to keep up with There were also rumors that they were running a tor exit node on the same server as their service Not too sure if I believe it but here are a few links after Evolution many here have chosen to do direct trades with vendors they trust I think the only marketplace that I can say I have no love for is AlphaBay I don't like a site devoted to theft of ones identity I have had multiple family members put into an endless cycle and a hole of debt trying to recover from identity theft Other friend with ruined credit that made it hard to find a job and imposable to get a good rate on home purchase because they were taken advantage of in the same manor.
I've got a slow transfer outside of any market I just read on r bitcoin that there is company in the EU conducting a stress test Its got the whole system running slow The issue may not be Agora.
I would strongly encourage you to use a different method of accessing the darknet especially if you plan on placing orders or encrypting your address.

you can use the same pgp to verify it is me I sell only the best LSD at the lowest cost I can Every order is shipped priority mail free of charge My most recent batch that is selling now is the same as the previous one Very nice stuff You will not be disappointed You can check my credentials using GRAMS Search for 'luckyduck' or read the rules below before ordering Rules Double then triple check your address before submitting an order The only problems I have ever had are because people don't write their address correctly I copy and paste what you give me Use a real name to a real address No fake names no abandoned homes or empty store fronts No free samples Don't ask if a package will arrive at a specific time I do not control the postal system For example I cannot guarantee your package will arrive by the weekend Priority shipping usually takes a max of days but sometimes for whatever reason it takes Everything will be shipped within hours of purchase and your item will not me marked shipped until after it has been dropped off at a postal box I also do not under any circumstance ship using overnight delivery There will never be a signature required for anything you receive from me I won't answer a question that can be answered by reading this page however I will do my best to respond to your inquiries quickly but my first priority is getting your orders packed up and in the mail I only ship from the USA to to others in the USA If you would like something sent to another country PM me and we might be able to work something out PGP only this is serious All non encrypted orders will be canceled non address related communication does not need to be encrypted Please log back in and finalize as soon as you can once you receive it's just good manners I treat my customers well and expect the same in return If there is any problem with your order talk to me first before leaving feedback If poor feedback is left without trying to resolve the situation with me first there will be no resolution refund or reship given I am very easy to work with so just message me and we will work it out Be safe and have fun The product Each batch is tested I will turn down a batch if it does not meet my standards I have never once received a single complaint about the quality of my LSD in fact I've only received glowing reviews Every site that I have ever vended on has always had a spotless record never anything below a so you can buy with confidence I will not sell a product that doesn't meet my high standards This is a business and I run it like one Security is important to me Your safety is a big priority for my customers and myself All precautions are taken very seriously from the start beginning with using a secure OS and a highly regarded PGP tool with an extremely strong password for decryption The computer that is used was bought with cash hard drive was remove and only boots from an encrypted memory card This computer never touches the clear net it has also has never been exposed to any Java script and never will Hardware and software firewalls are used I never store any of your information aside from the order number and the corresponding tracking number which are kept encrypted and well hidden This information is deleted using a very through piece of software as soon as the order has arrived Packaging is done in the utmost clean environment Packing materials are all bought with cash from different locations All postage is bought with cash from locations no where near the places your orders are dropped All packages have printed labels that are printed using an extremely common printer that was bought with cash Every package employs a decoy While packing quality gloves are worn every step of the way and are changed frequently throughout the process Stealth is something I take seriously I've done this for a long time and have never had a package seized I have been a vendor for several years on many markets and have done so without incident I won't state my prior usernames for security reasons Sometime I take long breaks from operating when a site goes down exit scam or seized then I start fresh with a new identity so as not to be linked to previous compromised sites Each time I come back I start out as a new vendor and each time I quickly gain a good reputation and loyal customers I have never acted dishonest scammed or stolen in anyway from anyone online or in real life It's just not something I could do and still sleep at night Even when there have been incidents of seized sites like SR or exit scams I have always honored the pending orders placed even though I loose money those customers also lost money and I feel like they should get what they paid for or at least what they tried to pay for I'm not greedy nor do I have a big ego so you will not see me on forums or elsewhere doing any kind of self promotion I let my feedback and word of mouth do that for me This is a one man band and I keep my prices low and quality is high therefor my profit margin is slim You will sometimes see others with lower prices but that may be because they import their product They don't know the quality or even if it is real LSD until it arrives While I pay more for my product and source it locally so I know that before I purchase it is LSD and high quality You get a real product from me as well as good stealth and quick shipping that you can count on When you buy from me you are keeping your money in our country economy and helping those that work to produce it as well BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK

On two occasions when loggin into TMG I got this One of your applications established a connection through Tor to using a protocol that may leak information about your destination My setup is as tight as can be and I never got that warning before on any site never years using Tor never saw that before Any advice please thank you.
Quote from Organix on March pmThey don't really have fa though many have requested it They have optional pgp login but you can't set it up so that no one can login without both password and pgp so its kind of weak For realz Never been there but that's weak.
use whonix so much better then tailstails is really a stripped down linux command prompt above which an ugly gui has been is super you just need to get the installation sorted and you re good to go explore the o.
I just found this service that seems pretty trustworthy It's called bitblender and it looks promising THIS IS NOT AN ENDORSEMENT I DON'T KNOW THE OWNERS OF THIS SITE AND I DO NOT VOUCH FOR THEM use at your own risk is a thread over at the SR forums where the owner of the site introduced the service The thread began as a review of another service bitlaunder that appears to be either really crummy or a scam I'm really digging this forums functionalit.
Before I found TMG Ive always used AlphaBay thats was after Agora went outta business.
Quote from sillywabbit on August pmfuck the centralized markets man trusted vendor boutique sites and email forum direct trades is the ONLYway to go with any kind of assurance that your coin or identity is not being compromised For all we know every market is run by LEO or their informants I was just coming in here to say this I have no problem sending money upfront to trust worthy vendors Hopefully direct transactions like that are both a security benefit to sellers and buyers I prefer forums like TMG to deal with vendors.

When I go to encrypt a message copy message click encrypt with clipboard the window opens up to select the key to use I check the box to select the key and nothing happensTried with many keys and get the same result I click ok and nothing happensI click cancel and nothing happensanyone have a clue.
Reposting this here as well I want the visability because it theres a lot of pumping going on What I'm saying is this I buy btc in cash In person moneygram cash in mail etc This goes to a wallet that is connected to me how It's not I could send my the btcs straight to any DNM and it doesn't matter who does any block chain analysis on this transactions The only way anyone would be compromised is a face to face transaction and the seller who have to obtain your identify Further let's say I do buy btc face to face using LBC You don't even have to use the website to escrow the transaction A lot of those traders only keep small amounts in LBC to so they have the ability to advertise It's like posting an advertisement Then you meet face to face and trade offline So if I wanted to get Monero I'd have to still source btc I'm buying bitcoins anonymously anyways and they are going to a wallet that doesn't have my name on it So please explain what the benefit Monero provides me All I see is the increased exposure to risk volatility and then some third party is going to skim more of my when I execute this trade from btc XMR because ya know everyone wants to get in my fucking wallet This isn't to say I won't or haven't acquired wink wink some Monero to cash in on any up swing I just keep it real Monero is trying to address a problem that I don't have Monero is far from anonymous Yea sure I get it blah blah no one can track it Bullshit Who is using Monero Everything about this currency is associated with illegal transactions and the desire for anonymity So if I chat up anyone in real life about Monero and they will quickly make assumptions If you are found sourcing Monero in any capacity guess what more assumptions can be made about you Bitcoins are used for legitimate purposes Legal businesses accept them You can strike up a conversation about bitcoins with many forward thinking individuals and no one is going to bat an eye I'm not trying to be rude friend Sometimes I like to cut to the chase because I find that others get caught in the fluff being thrown around in the world today I think I'll source some more btc in the near future I'm going to hit up on of the many traders out there who will happily take my cash for some coins and pay them a fair fee for providing me such a nice service Let me know when someone figures this out When and where this takes place How I contacted the seller What amount I traded Who the seller is what wallet I used where the coins I got are going Yea man I'll be here Be honest with yourself and those around you.
Because the thread was started in Augus.
hey all Just curious if Blockchain's shared send is safe enough to be considered a good air gap or if I should be using a more official tumbler like Bitcoinfog Thanks.
Hey guys Slowly getting my OPSEC together as I read more and more on the forums I couldn't find a clear answer to this though For very small scale first time transactions is it safe enough to acquire my Bitcoins on LocalBitCoin transfer through my real name and banking details have a high feedback individual lined up who has quite a low minimum transfer limit which is what I want Then with Tails Tor transferring from Localbitcoin wallet to my own wallet before mixing tumbling are these the same thing Is this acceptable Opsec There seem to be so many ways people acquire their Bitcoins on the board some of which seem quite elaborate if they are thoroughly mixed and final transfer done from a different wallet with Tails does it really matter how you got them Any help much appreciated.
Tails itself is a Linux system It will work with a machine that already has Windows installed because it ignores whatever Operating System is already installed At start up any and all information used by the computer comes from that removeable disk And on shutdown there's no trace of what the computer was used for To contribute a bit to the discussion After I read about how they caught Ross I've added a simple addition to my OPSEC I use a USB thumb drive with a split ring on it A lanyard goes around my wrist If someone grabs my laptop the drive is pulled out and any info is gone.
It happened again here it is in full Mon Jun Potentially Dangerous Connection One of your applications established a connection through Tor to using a protocol that may leak information about your destination Please ensure you configure your applications to use only SOCKS a or SOCKS with remote hostname resolution Whats up doc.
but seriously good luck guys.
I have run tails both off a USB and thru a virtualbox container without any issues off of my macbook pro which is a few years old.
Well this has happened several times in the past and Agora has then fixed the issue But they could be shutting down for good this time ya know Who knows but probably Agora's not going away just yet my guess Next time for both this reason and OPSEC make sure to go to your wallet page and generate a new deposit address If the page refreshes saying you successfully generated a new address but it's the same as before there are problems with deposits Hope that helps.
Quote from inanna on April amLelantos has had great uptime and I suggest them to everyone USSRmail was down half of the time so I switched over to lelantos Just make sure to encrypt everything and be careful about what you put for subject headers I have seen a lot of vendors mention Lelantos might have to set up an email there when the time comes I know an email isn't essential in using the DN but it couldn't hurt to have one setup the right way.
Opioids no doubt Benzos never get me high they just put me to sleep and make me stumble around in the morning after hangover I went through the wringer with alcohol too but nothing like opioids They are persistent sneaky motherfuckers Even after the physical withdrawal is over there's a persistent feeling that I can only describe as a hunger And nobody likes to be hungry right The only solution for me is total abstinence from them Some recent experiences with LSD have really helped widen the gap between opioids and me The wider the gap the better Zerg thanks for your honesty brother God I love this place.
Quote from anon on August amThis place is really cool I just made an account and have been browsing the boards I too was expecting a market but honestly this is way better There's already a ton of markets this is a COMMUNITY Exactly Welcome to the garden.
I'm going to try to stick to direct deals on TMG.
HelloWhat so you have your money in your wallet me and my friends wallets are competly empy i can clearly se how some one transfered my bitcoints from agora to another wallet on blockchain.
can find people near to you who'd be willing to exchange btc for cash Alternatively set up another wallet and use a tumbling service to get your btc from one wallet to the other.
On topic My suspicions gain support every day it seems Never used the subreddit in anyway and the idea of a clearnet community about darknet activities is ridiculous While it's unfortunate in a sense that some of our fellow humans with whom we shared an interest will be locked in cages for years this is survival of the fittest As the more reckless and less secure individuals fall away we are left with a core group of people whose practices are more fundamentally sound For this community and that principle I am grateful On grammar I understood the post perfectly Either in spite of or perhaps because of the use of a double negative Not insignificant places an emphasis on negating the point of view that such things are insignificant Simplifying the statement to just it's significant would be more of a self contained idea rather than an opposition to others' thoughts The idea that thereon is antiquated sees no use and is now improper is simply false Maybe you personally do not come across it often but I assure you it is still used You said it is the equivalent of like most reasonable people would think that two words being equivalent implies a shared meaning They do not share a meaning Nor can I think of an instance where they would be It's a more eloquent way of expressing on the aforementioned thing antecedent in this case on the subreddit An interesting thread on either topic love you guysThough if thereon is too archaic to use perhaps using aforementioned isn't any help.
Hey guys has anybody had any trouble with the FA login I've only been on for a coupe of weeks with FA worked fine unil today Anybody ese having this issue.
DHL is my new go to dnm I had a slight hick up with my st deposit but the admins resolved very quickly The ease of use security and the fact most vendors are currently offering free shipping should put this dnm on the top of their list They do have less vendors than the others but the ones vending are top notch and scams will be non existent Quality not quantity.
Started looking at it like my second home Best online community i had ever came across Love ya guys.
Quote from dockellis on August pmQuote from flourpower on August pmI thought so too didnt take too long to figure out it's more like Craigslist than eBay Still in my limited experience a better forum than the Reddit oneLike night and day This is a community of like minded seekers hoping to benefit one and other Reddit is well Reddit is Reddit Welcome Reddit is a honey pot the place where u start losing your first money if this is how u got to DNMs or the place where u get misguided in buying exactly what u don't want the place where shill and scamery takes off.
Closing this thread To discuss about how to use Monero please read and write on discuss about qualities of Monero please read and write on to centralize.
i doubt its an exit scam but i deposited last week and when they posted i redeposited in my block its been days now I am worried but I sent them a message and im hoping it works out i trust them but right now i am worried a little bit cheers beetle.
Closing this thread To discuss about how to use Monero please read and write on discuss about qualities of Monero please read and write on to centralize Hi As spoken on and on I would like you to realize there are easy ways to tumble your BTC and break the BTC link to your identity FIRST WAY On shapeshift com with your BTC from a wallet A buy Monero XMR altcoin and send the XMR to a new mymonero com online wallet account secure and safe don't worry nothing is saved it's like a paper wallet Wait hour and on shapeshift com buy BTC with XMR from your mymonero com wallet and send directly the BTC from shapeshift com to your vendor or to a BTC wallet B you own safe and perfect New Bitcoins not linked to you in any way SECOND WAY from your XMR wallet go to give a BTC receiver address vendor your wallet and an amount of BTC max BTC for now and send XMR to it will convert the XMR into fresh new anonym BTC and send them to the BTC receiver address Xmr to WORKS ON TOR THIRD WAY You can also buy XMR on Poloniex with your BTC and then convert them into BTC on shapeshift or xmr to the result is you are sending new fresh BTC not linked to your identity in any way to a BTC address of your choice Combining shapeshift com as entry for your BTC XMR and xmr to as exit for your XMR BTC is even more safe even if only shapeshift is enough for example Hope It can help you improve your security Don't hesitate to ask on to other people who are technically better than me maybe even the XMR team will directly answer you but I'm quite sure of what I write I'm NOT linked to Monero team in any way I only love privacy and after a lot of readings and researches I understood this altcoin is the rare and best one to really give you anonymity and protect your privacy it has been audited and has proved itself Cloakcoin in second choice but services are less developped for now.
I was scammed by BCDirect for two orders in May June Both were for oz mushrooms for They claim they were shipped but they have no proof and I have no love letter Both shipments never arrived in reading the feedback this happens a lot to BCDirect I tried to reach a agreement but I was told without a love letter they would do nothing How can I have a letter when it wasn't shipped and they offer reship only with letter ri god damn diculousAll we can do those that were scammed is to let people know and look out for each other I advise not to use not to trust.
Quote from Knuckles on May amDoes anyone here know if macbooks work ok with TOR I read before that some of them do not work well with TOR but can't find out which ones do or dont if anyone has any info let me know They all work Unless really obsolete Is this serious.
helloI need some help about getting BTC unkown and laundry it and send it to different adresses how do I start get the btc from example localbitcoins send it to helix bitblender then to another mixer and then to some ewallet example bitgo store it there then to another mixer and from there to the market or directly to a vendor Any guidence or help is helpfull im new to this.
I can vouch for BH inquired for a sample of ALD very quickly after he first posted it and received my sample within a week I have yet to try the product and plan to provide a review as promised I have just been busy He is legit.
it's a work in progress updated image should always be here.
I got Michelle Leonhart Nudez just send me BTC.
Yes too many altcoins but very few focused on real privacy and anonymity and even few that succeed to reach this goal safely Try CLOAK and XMR As I said I think DASH coin doesn't evolve good and I don't believe anymore in SDC coin for many reasons too loang to explain I follow it for years Even if you need BTC to buy XMR when you use XMR or convert again XMR or CLOAK to BTC somewhere esle the BTC link to your original identity is totally broken the trail is definitively lost for any people who wants to trace you and prove you are guilty.
Quote from goodfornothing on May pmSeems like a pretty bad time to be depositing coin to Agora even when they come online for hours and it seems issues have been solved it seems like a big tease everyone who can't wait to get back on and get shit done and hasn't been scared off yet is like Hope it stays up Oh What's that It's staying up seemingly Oh wait nevermind fuck Fuck fuck fuck At this point I think it would be ambitious to get too comfortable even if it goes consecutive days with uptime oh and I'm not mocking the OP I've fallen into the semi comfort of a little bit of responsive uptime a bit too easily too Howdy GFN thank you for the response It's weird not being able to trust the DNM but it's a giving Being blessed with DPR before was just soo easy to have lack of downtime quick deposits withdraws that when I go to make an order on any marketplace i just quickly jump the gun Which is faulty faulty on my end as I get left with in limbo however agora has fixed this and given me my BTC I was still worried sick for multiple days Like I can't lose that much money that's more than my car is worth I just need to be more understanding for the DNM but at the same time know that they could bail for numerous reasons at anytime.
Quote from bombheadie on March pmQuote from Gleeful on March pmJust wondering do you have a pic of the Orange Sunshine blotter art I like that many of the other analogs are on blotters bearing the name of the chemical but ALD stands out given its history dating back to the 's So just wondering what the blotter sheet looks like and what individual tabs look like And thanks for getting this mystical mythical substance out to our community CLEARNET is the blotter paper that I am laying it on I will NEVER sell a Research Chemical to ANY of you When I get my next batch of ALD it comes with a MSDS Material Data Saftey Sheet When IT coems I'll post it to the board just so you guys know it is EXACTLY what I am selling I WILL NEVER SELL RESEARCH CHEMICALS on this border or ANYWHERE for that matter ETA EVERY hits is a complete sunshine Great choice of paper Thanks for the pic.
I like these ideas Tough part is implementing them and breaking the monotonicity of open markets and the plague that is reddi.
As much as this should the setting by default if you've gotten this far in the darknet process you should be doing this instinctively At the very least knowing enough that this is almost always included in all BB style forums Maybe it's just me but editing forum settings security profile is usually the first thing I update for account created.
hello i was wondering if it is ok to track a package using the usps tracking system if i was using tails ad tor browser with javascript and global scripts turned off Thx.
A new install with full disk encryption ubuntu can work for this then fill the drive with trash or Start a live CD linux distro and wipe your hard drive using the wipe command or shredThen reinstall a fresh clean windows system or a fresh linux one with full disk encryption probably safer Another option would be to physically destroy the hard drive and use your computer only with tails You'd have to trust those who made tails but even if tails was trying to write stuff on your HDD you'd be safe from that.
Yup these instructions work great.
If you connect to tor through your ISP you'd better consider that you might be monitored and or on a list of suspicious individuals It might not be the case but chances are pretty high for that to be the case Open wireless network are another option to protect a bit yourself as a VPN might not be as trust worthy as you believe it is Good luck stay safe.
Quote from thatninja on August pmQuote from tm on August amI've seen more clearnet sites that sell trypamines than I have on DNMs You can find al ist of vendor shops on reddit All depends on where you live of course i live in good ol' 'murica and i'm just a little sketched out about ordering thru the clearnet especially not that it really matters i guess i'm getting other international packages with hella drugs in them anyway q you really shouldn't worry They are legal chems so nothing in theory should happen but at worst customs will take them call you a bad boy and send you a letter telling you to come claim your substances if you want the.

Quote from darknetdreamer on November pmQuote from sterlingsword on November amQuote from darknetdreamer on November amSound interesting Would love to write a full review once the sites up Sounds excellent It's making good progress I'll post again with my milestone estimations for delivery I'll be sure also to register you an account Due to the nature of this market wishing to be secure and being based on vendor only inviting I may have to ask around about you just to make sure you have indeed ordered and used product before If a vendor can vouge for you I'll provide you with a valid one time registration link upon release Thanks Looking forward to the market and a full write up My Blog is basically all about Darknet security so I think your site will fit in perfectly given the nature of it Awesome If that's the case and pending release I'll consider releasing source code too you as well so you can use that in addition to elevated account priviledges to accompany your review Currently source code is only going to be released to the vendor that is on top This is still being written But the basis of judgement will be based on How long the vendor has been around Rate of success vs rate of failure confidence factor overall rating across the darknetI'm still trying to decide all of the internal politics And due to the nature of this trusted environment I plan on developing said vendor will need to approve on this decision Much Lov.
Anyone else getting this Would really like to withdraw coin for my last three orders Anyway for those who ordered from me before I hit vacation mode if BlackBank doesn't come up please rest assured your orders are going out today have already gone out All pending orders for Middle Earth as well Unfortunately Middle Earth doesn't seem to have a vacation mode that vendors can turn on themselves instead they must wait for Gandalf Please do not order from me on Middle Earth until June if you read this and I'm not in vacation yet It's supposedly getting DDoS attacked right now and last I saw Gandalf had not waved his vacation wand for me yet I will be checking when the site gets back up and sending anything else ASAP but please don't order My processing time has been fairly quick up until this point but any orders placed today or later may take a little longer to get out and I'd really not receive any and hope that I'm in vacation mode next time I'm able to load the site I'll resume taking orders in June and LSD will be back on the menu.
I like Middle Earth The user interface is very friendly and intuitive The design is delicate with pleasant colors It seems that someone really made an effort making this website comfortable for vendors and buyers I think that should be appreciated.
Abraxas because it's populated with vendors DHL Has no vendors barely anything up Middle Earth has from what I've experienced some pretty jenky coding and nucleus doesn't seem to have very responsive support teams.
Quote from on May pmQuote from Knuckles on May pmI'm reading for some macbooks they have wifi problems but it looks like it can be solved by getting a usb wifi adapterWhere there's a will my man where there's a will Whats Will doing And why is he there.
vendors should look at this seem to really be legit and fully encourage multi sig and discourageFE I was able to quickly set up an account and add a public key The site looks very appealing.
hey all made my first purchase on abraxas and i also FE d only because i have known the vendor for years everything was fine only thing i didnt like was the deposits have to confirm times before your acc is credited with btc Cheers Dolmi.
hello scroatI had similar issues with the tails pgp applet or it not responsing at all the weird thing is that sometimes the issues happen and sometimes don't I downloaded pgp usb to my persistence drive and I am using that app now is very easy to use and you can import your keys directly from the tails PGP applet I know is not a fix but as a temporary solution it works for me best R.
hey all just wondering what market had the lead atm with the most amount of listing and users Cheers Dolmi.

Never track a pack through tor Go to starbucks or somewhere with free wifi and check it Cheers S.
I've had a ton of RCs land from Spain Poland UK Canada etc The only thing I had seized was a few hundred pellets I assume seized tracking just stopped in customs but I never got a letter or anything Regular letters with powder should go through just fine vast majority of the time It can be a bit unnerving dealing with unencrypted personal info but most of them take btc nowadays at least.
vanilla reload moneygram are they like washing btc or just like a ewallet But bank option is connected to your real name if cash isnt optional Random person buys btc through local with bank and send it to helix and from helix to another helix then to market would that work sorry for all these newbie question.
Thank you for your time and efforts Nonya I tried to import your public key It said Key import failed code Error text gig Total number processed I tried copying and pasting both your key and your sig and I tried copying and pasting just your key without your sig Neither method worked I've tried importing other peoples' keys from the thread where members post their keys Some of them import just fine but some don't I am using the exact same method every time so I don't don't know what's going on there I never have any problem importing venders keys from their vender pages on other markets I had a similar experience a long time ago I think it was on SR I could import someone's key if they posted it on the forum but I couldn't do it if it was on their forum profile Or maybe it was the other way around Can you try PMing me your key and maybe if I copy and paste it from there it will work I've tried pasting your PGP key link in the address bar It took me to start page com and said Sorry there are no web results for this search When I paste mine into the address bar it says unable to connect Mine no longer appears at the bottom of my posts because I just deleted it from my profile last night but I copied it before I deleted it in case I need it again NEXT DAY EDIT I tried your PGP Key link again Took a minute to connect but it worked this time and I was able to import your key So this seems consistent with what you were saying on one of your threads My PGP Key link still doesn't connect and I still don't remember how I acquired it in the first place and it would be nice to know how to create a new one with my updated email address but at least I can PM you now I didn't realize that your PGP Key link goes to the same thread where all these members post their keys I generated a new key and tried to send it to my email address It said Sending key failed Thanks for clearing up my confusion over the word Signature I understand the purpose of the sig I've found other info online about that but I can't find my sig I figured out how to generate a sig for a key that I generated yesterday and I exported the key to a folder like I normally do That's where I usually open a text file of my public key to give someone That text file still doesn't show a sig though Oh and I wasn't trying to change the email address in my key I was trying to change it in my TMG forum account settings My main interest right now is to be able to import your public key Then I'll try working with that message you created Then maybe I'll try to tackle some of these other problems NEXT DAY EDIT As I mentioned above I tried your PGP Key link again Took a minute to connect but it worked and I was able to import it this time When I get a chance I'll try working with your encryped message exercise and see what happens with that but at least I have your key imported I really appreciate your help You have been so nice.
not surprised either but what a shame I mean it's just the same agenda by our US gov and the same cycles of thinking And the jury I seriously wonder what kind of people get selected for these kind of cases I can almost guarantee they were middle of the road conservative 'mind yer p's and q's darlin 'super religious LE loving tools tools they are And we all know if the juror was your average hipster hacker musician type it would have beendifferent but then again maybe even then the jurors would fear their own reps wud sour if theylet Ulbricht off the hook It don't matter anyway judge has final say The whole thing is rigged Our whole gov is still run by a bunch of stuffy suits who can't imagine a genius like Ulbrichtbeing able to do what he did and allowing it to continue NO because we have a bunch ofoutdated and immoral laws that say 'If you do this life in prison'And ya know what it all boils down to POWEROur gov cannot allow certain power and money to be handled by one person That a person has the ability to change the world the way we interact in a way that goes against the grain And so Ulbricht might be looking at LIFE behind bars For what How did he HURT anyone What was IMMORAL about anything he did Aside from the 'calling hits' accusations It's so fucked And everytime I watch the news same shit same idiots in the media in office running the same lies games lost in their own HEAD ISSUES of what's wrong in the worldwhen really the only thing that is wrong is what's inside what happened to the heart the love it's all fucking money and who's in charge who can fuck who better who has the biggest cock I'm so tired of all this shit I sometimes just want off this planet I swear.
I stopped using tor browser and use a middlebox configuration instead so I am not aware of that error but a quick search shows port is used to make a connection in Netscape Also you can look at TCP SCTP UDP Hypertext Transfer Protocol over TLS SSL HTTPS I don't have the server set up with TLS SSL certificates as that would put the server at risk If others are getting this error please reply here.
Abraxas for sure its a WINNER Cheer.
This is completely normal when there many connections at once The IP address belongs to the local network interface that the server is using internally No leak here.

Okey thanks I see folks writing about that u should use adresses and mixers to make it most unknown Do you guys have any advice where I can get an email adress that is safe.
That's a question I've asked myself why aren't domestic labs producing these totally legal not regulated under analogue act chemicals Although I'm sure if they were they would get hammered down on pretty quick although Kratom has been around for a very long time and there's no sign of that slowing at all Who knows I mean there haven't been any reported deaths from MXE and usually that's when things kick into high gear when a kid or someone unfortunately does too much and it shows up on the news There must be a lot of regulations here in the US compared to India and China I suspect India will be the next supplier but I've heard their RC's are even less trustworthy than those from China but of course it up to use to always test and do our own methods of harm reduction.
TMG can be a market a cool place to hangout and meet cool people and its also a place you can call home Users and Vendors in TMG Can be your best friend or even family But it is not and i hope it will not be Reddit.

Alcohol unfortunately My genetic pool for whatever reason has a heavy propensity towards alcoholism It is the sole substance I continually find myself cycling through a routine of quit and return For whatever reason it is the only substance I find myself substantially more capable of day to day operation in every facet it enhances my effectivity in department of academic work it eases my social and over all anxiety and never seems to fail me as an outlet for stress relief Overall it does great for me but I consume it entirely too often and too often to EXCESS It is a crutch and a crutch I wish I so frequently didn't rest upon.
Much improved over the previous iteration It would be nice to see listings build I am thinking about vending concentrates on there i think i'll need a vendor name that isnt poobuttfart thoug.
Quote from Galindoi on July pmI can't respond as a buyer don't have any experience with depositing funds there But as a seller its all crickets over there Not a lot of activity for mushrooms I've found In light of that though the few transactions I've had went smooth customers finalized and I was able to transfer my funds Several hundred dollars out of the system into my own wallets easily and with no hassle So grain of salt GalindoiIs Agora where most of your sales occur.
i know holyghost has some on DHL and id love to try them but i dont have an invite any on ug listingson other markets or a dhl invite would be nice to.
ANOTHER UPDATE I am in the process as we speak laying the ALD onto blotter paper ug hit I am willing to pass out dose to people when everything is completed Today The reason that I am passing out hits is so that you can do it with a friend of yours or of course your Significant Other I personally believe ug of ALD is a pretty heavy dose for person Sorry to do this but this is just something I would feel more comfortable about To qualify for the blotter You must be a member in GOOD standings with TMG posts minimum I am going to take this post minimum off if you guys PROMISE to write a review on your experence with the substance The only reason I had the powt minimum was I believe there are people that are just here to take adantage of free substances ANYONE can apply now BUT the only thing that I REALLY REALLY want you to do is post your trip report on this page And you MUST post a trip report on this post for me If possible I would really enjoy it if both parties that dropped the ALD would post their trip reports I would love to know what LSD veterans this about this ALD that I am laying I would LOVE to pass out more but I did not get very much that's the reason that I'm only able to be able to offer this limited amount I want to get this beautiful chemical out around my hometown also MUCH LOVE TMG B.
It's possible you can use a gift card check out There is also but last I checked their option for getting a vanilla card with BTC was grayed out They could have other ways though I'd check it Then there is with which you can have the fiat proceeds from your coins sent to a Paypal account which you would have to have opened anonymously and linked to your drop address But it is VERY expensive the exchange rate I mean then PP charges you on top of that for receiving money.
Never had that issue before It should prompt you for the bridge address you're using When it's configured takes no time extra to connect Will PM you for specifics.

Quote from scroat on December pm think it's great was linked from the onions subI thought it was great too until they started serving ads through Torads What really got me and caused me to abandon my accounts there is the fact that an ad that I was being served related to an organization in my country of origin That is either A HUGE coincidence or IP address data is possibly being leaked indicating the country of origin Now mind you I've got adblock running and my hosts file is bulging with the addresses of most online advertisers redirected to the loopback address Despite this the ads are still showing up The long and the short of it is that I no longer trust this service YMMV Spitfir.
Quote from Knuckles on May pmI do miss the original Silk Road Seriously at this point it seems so nostalgic Ditto nothing feels the same.
Quote from on January am Low Randomized Fees When you deposit coins into your Bitcoin Blender account we will take a low randomized fee of between We make our fees low to keep coin mixing affordable and we randomize the fee to make analysis of our service less predictable In other words if our fee was a standard blockchain analysis would be made more trivial interested parties would need only look for suspected deposits and withdrawals tagged with a modifier Our randomized fee takes this tool away from those who would seek to tie your transactions to you That would still mean several thousands of transactions that would have to be analysed And most mixers have an input address and a new address to send the coins to so its not too much of a security risk there unless I am missing something key.
Quote from MtStHelen on March pmWhat about Safe bad Anyone know From my point of view Torbox's main weakness is its' character limitation on password length Spitfir.
Hosting it locally is probably the best way to go about it.
I will be resuming operations both on here and on abraxas now that everything seems to be still okay and agora's security seemingly was not comprimised Glad to hear everyone is alright We will have listings available this week Cheers S.
PGP you definately need to read up on PGP It is a way to encrypt your messages and emails You can look up pgp info on the clearnet and many people use it in business and the like It stand for Pretty Good Privacy Good places to start is Wiki will need a good PGP program and there are several different builds Some are better for different platforms On some platforms it may take a while to figure out the program On Mac for example using GnGTools will install a few programs that you don't actually see the programs in applications and will have to go into your system settings to turn on a few options to be able to use it There are plenty of tutorials all over the clearweb you just need to work the search engines I would recomend not actually trying to buy anything illegal from anyone until you take the time to learn about privacy and encryption In might take a couple weeks to get the tools under your belt but it can protect you a lot more Just remember you are never totally safe but you can do a lot of things to minimize being detected There are quite a few hacking sites and forums but some of them are going to require you to figure out a few other programs to get access to as well day for example has a hacking forum but you need to figure out Jabber to be able to register.
If we're saying fuck markets we still need to build an alternative that centralizes listings at least it encourages product diversity by allowing upstarts built in access to people seeking their product and a ready platform for promoting it In the meantime I'm looking at alphaba.

If anything this is more proof that HoS or whoever is a major target of law enforcement and that we really shouldn't be talking about this business on the clearnet anywhere than any notion that the whole sub is just a honeypot I think the arrogant sense that people on the sub have that their crimes aren't worthy of targeting from law enforcement these are people who live to make drug arrests I also think it's a bit alarmist to assert that it exists only for this purpose and that no worthwhile discussion takes place thereon And it's not insignificant seemingly to me that HoS didn't have any overt problems with reddit when the reviews were adulatory and the attitude changed when they started to turn critical.
Seems worth trying Thank you Jean Luc.
interesting Thread I haven't purchased from any market for a while Agora is always my main market but It has so many donwtimes atm it is difficult to use I think I will give Middle Earth an opportunity since some of my favourite vendors are there.
They still haven't made this the default setting Any reasoning behind that.
Had great experience trying whonix Pretty fast for what it does with an SSD and a recent CPU and I did find it really easy to install and use with no much need for the command line Qubes manager does the job quite well for of needed tasks Did you try the latest version of an older one Converting audio video would go with no trouble with a good CPU Another option is to have a Qubes install on a USB disk and another system for your multimedia needs Or an easy way to switch between two or more SSD with different systems As of fixing security bugs they rely on Xen itself for security that's why there are no root password in VMs and dom and it seems like they help with securing it Can't tell more as I'm not a daily user nor a security pro but with whonix integration and dom as an offline container with easy ways to add or even chain VPNs it seems to me way better than ubuntu virtualbox whonix If you decide to go for a gnu linux virtualbox whonix I would recommend to make strong use of grsec to try to have your system a little bit less vulnerable.
Quote from goodfornothing on April pmTMG is in a league of it's own and entirely different I meant commission taking escrow offering money handling markets of the risk your capital kind not this open honest trust based forum that asks nothing in return for letting people find each other and communicate freely Glad to see you here GFN I remember you from SR as I was one of your first customers Good Person We decided the best way to work a marketplace is not to run one at all As TMG was created by the avengers it would be a conflict of interest trying to be the middle men in a transaction So it's trust based and we have only had a few troubles with vendors And even most those troubles were taken care of by other members and or eventually resolved by the vendor that dropped the ball Even with escrow and multisig you need to place your trust in someone So we set up this forum for communication and allow you to gain trust in the vendor directly Roo.
i just cannot seem to wrap my head around bitcoinsi'm a bit confused on the whole matter i signed up for coinbase via tor with a sigaint email however buying and selling bitcoins is not available in my country yet so am i supposed to use google chrome or something i mean i'll probably just do it the noob way and buy coins with a card i can get from my local store that doesn't require any info but i feel like if i sign up for coinbase on chrome and use it to buy shite from middle earth on tor that's suspicious right and then there's wallets for storing coins correct and helix i don't know i just feel a bit confused and the guides don't really help me for some reason edit in a nutshell i'm aware that i shouldn't make an account on coinbase via chrome then suddenly use it on tor i'm just confused as to how i should take my usd money turn it into bitcoins and spend it on ME.
Quote from SnackTime on November pmLets not jump to conclusions hereDoes anyone have ANY real information relating to this Cheers STAlphaBay was getting attacked So far that's all I have seen No word from other markets as of yet.
Hi Gang THANK YOU plants n xnc and everyone else helping out here so far we've had excellent luck but i just can't have Fam spending money when there's a big question mark hanging over so many heads so bombheadie what's the deal if something happened and the other folks' packs left late just let us them know you've been here a while before vending might just be new vendor blues I was going to try and help the little guy instead of a Team but current events give me pause there's a deadline involved and i can't take a chance on having Fam losing money or waiting weeks or a month not that that hasn't happened with other previous vendors but well you know It's not like we're ordering offa Amazon Communication is paramount but i know it's MUCH harder stealthing MDMA instead of paper and time is running down so PLEASE let us know what happened to original ship dates in house problems leading to delays etc we are a very forgiving bunch as long as communication is decent and accurate and the drugs end up arriving and are L.
If someone is interested in an answer concerning that subject I had one on The Hub forum Here is the link to the topic.
Thanks for the reply I'll be sure to clean up and take a break from this until I feel more comfortable.
You can sort of look at it as a place that you can come to discuss products vendors and other markets or anything else really Hell a lot of vendors out there are on here daily It is a place where you can meet those vendors and their costumers and chat with them so that when you do decide to order you can order in confidence knowing that they have been vetted through the community This place really is magestic.
Quote from rec on July amAs of fixing security bugs they rely on Xen itself for security that's why there are no root password in VMs and dom and it seems like they help with securing it What worries me about this is that the Xen community developers as a whole are not centering their focus on security It's mostly about compatibility with VM software and speed Honestly I can't even get VirtualBox to run on my system for some reason TAILS is easy enough to run from a USB and faster that way anyway However it is about as fast as running from within Ubuntu Debian Some programs are as fast and complicated to use within Tails Like VeraCrypt Nearly all the security based distro's IE TAILS are based of Debian Ubuntu is based of Debian Really I don't see much difference between all the Linux distro's except for which tools they come with TAILS has a great set of tools But it also has plenty of unnecessary ones as well Ubuntu has also stood up against many other OS's in hacking competitions Though your point about visiting FixUbuntu com was a good one though I had already fixed that issue I think security is mainly up to the end user If you do the research about your OS keep it updated and use a distro with a large team of people actively fixing bugs security flaws and more importantly use an OS that is open sour ce I think you should be pretty safe Sure things can happen But unless you are the governments priority I don't see the need for the ultra insane security and slowness that comes with Qubes You must have a very good system to even consider trying to convert audio video with Qubes What this post is really about is making Ubuntu Other linux distro's as secure as possible via tools Without switching to another method.
Quote from chess on April pmi haven't logged on in a few months and i'm pretty noob at all of this anyway so i need your helpWelcome back Quote from chess on April pm there are three drugs i want to try well two the other one i've had before lol shrooms lsd and cannabis now i've heard lsd is the easiest to ship securely and i already know a vendor i want to buy from as for cannabis i'm not sure how safe that is it can get pretty smelly and i figure it's much easier to get caught with it in the mail but am i wrong is there actually a safe way to ship that shit and receive it what about shrooms This is the safest way to import weed or quantities of shrooms greater than an ounce if you're a one man operation I'm just shamelessly copy pasting this from another post I made in the Security forum fifteen minutes ago here One good benefit of using a P O box and use the USPS ones because there are news articles online of the private ones opening people's weed packages and having the cops wait for them the next time they come to pick up is that if you source a male wig I'm assuming you're a guy a silly hat and get yourself a new pair of sunglasses and normal clothes when you do pickups try to use a one and if you park down the street because the feds may be watching for your car in a controlled delivery too they will probably never even realize it's you if you're doing your pickup Also wear something long sleeved to cover up your tattoos if you have any Get a PO box large enough to fit your drug packages It's worth the money Do NOT fuck with a small sized PO box that forces you to get everything from the counter If you study CD stories on Reddit you see that this is how of the people using PO boxes get caught or would have got caught when they get a slip saying to go to the counter The other of the time the feds already knew what they looked like and were either waiting inside or outside A good disguise and parking your car down the street will go a long way This is really only if you're doing shit like importing MDMA from a foreign country though For domestic acid letters they're never going to intercept them but I'd still park down the street and use a disguise unless in theory your acid vendor re uses his same shipping from address and the feds profiled that and now they knew you had a drug delivery and were waiting for you If you are doing this method above extra brownie points if you walk in with a large envelope they're free in the USPS lobbies grab a stack There's even ones that have a piece of blank cardboard in the x brown envelope so it looks like there's some weight to it Go ahead and just write some bullshit to from info on it and don't put stamps on it pretending like you have something to mail Check your PO box with the back turned to the windows and preferably get your PO box at a lobby that has no cameras and has access and stuff your drug package inside your coat quickly without making sudden movements Close your coat up close the box go drop your letter off in the inside of the building but not the counter with all the cameras use a drop box in the lobby and leave If you do your pickups at am am you should be able to spot if there's any feds in the parking lot which you could probably get away with this right under their noses but if you really wanted to be cautious you could come back every night and grab it when they're gone or just wait days Also leave your cell phone at home if you need to be this cautious Your male wig can be sourced from paid in cash Amazon gift cards at Barnes and Noble or Speedway the gas station or other stores in your area Create a new Amazon account for buying your sketchy things like this and ship it to a friend's house so there's no digital trail of you ever buying it Also for your PO box ask for Signature Confirmation and Email Delivery There's another form you'll have to fill out This is the same form that gives you Street Addressing as well this is worth it also Street Addressing lets you address your PO box like this Donald Duck Main St Los Angeles CA Instead of Donald Duck Main St PO box Los Angeles CA The Street Addressed version looks more legitimate With Signature Confirmation you will sign an extra piece of paper and they will use the signature on that piece of paper to electronically fill out any pieces of mail that required Signature Confirmation Totally worth it because you never want to have to go to the counter Also there's vendors who only send registered mail they are very few but Signature Confirmation does not apply to these so get your shipping details before you buy your product For Email Delivery have a burner ProtonMail com email address they don't keep login logs and all email is encrypted on their server so they can't read it and decryption is done locally on your computer through JavaScript They're hosted in a nuclear bomb shelter feet below ground in Switzerland and it's open source specifically just for this box or a Dark Net email address set up before ahead of time Then when you get any packages that you didn't have tracking on letters won't count you will get an email notification Cool huh Also for buying LSD I recommend these same procedures and precautions as above just get a x PO box since sometimes you may get large x sized priority envelope sized letters from acid vendors and you just need the stuff to fit in your box Keep your acid drop and your weed shrooms drop as separate addresses Quote from chess on April pm starting soon i'll be using tor within tails under a new username pass email etc is this enough are there other ways to keep safe i'll be storing shit on a usb and all This Silk Road lieutenant got de anonymized by the FBI because he didn't use a VPN before Tor a VPN unless you're using a cash prepaid G hotspot or public wifi It's worth your life even if you're a small fish Quote from chess on April pm bitcoins are something i never got the hang of i will be using a prepaid card to buy bitcoins how do YOU go about this and what do you use i've read the guides but i'm still pretty confused on the steps that and it has been a while lol I saw this post is from April nd but if you're still around PM me your PGP key and I can securely share a few good ways of buying bitcoins with you Quote from chess on April pm lastly one of the markets i used to use and look at went down a while ago and hasn't come back up since so other than this site what mp do you use AlphaBay is a good starting point but if you've already found TMG then if you still need acid check out the LSD listings here in the vendor forum and the acid listings on DHL are good too or just don't even mess with this at all and just go straight to buying sheet ug gel tabs that are the BOMB from Not Ron Paul on Oasis x gel tabs for If the gel tabs are out of stock try his liquid drops at ug for total That's a sheet basically I hope this helps I saw this post was from April nd but I hope you log back in and see it still.
Quote from Gleeful on June pmThanks I really appreciate it Yw Mullvad post coming in seconds I swear it's the easiest VPN to ever set up on Ubuntu You just download it and run two commands to install it.
To discuss about qualities of Monero you can write here in this topic To discuss how to use Monero please go read and write on to centralize HiAs Bitcoin is really not anonymous for example see or I believe it s time to think to switch to decentralized altcoin s specifically designed to protect privacy and anonymity I would like to speak about Monero XMR and Cloakcoin CLOAK I m NOT linked in anyway to these coins or teams There is also DASH and Shadowcash SDC altcoins but the first is centralised on a few masternodes and now seems to focus on zerotime transactions rather than true privacy anonymity and it seems to be a civil war inside the dev team and supporters and about the second well I really don t believe in Shadowcash for various reasons that s all I DON T WANT to launch a debate here on what coin is better than another it s only my own opinion Cloackcoin has a small team of fanatic devs that seems never to give up event after a first year of catastrophic problems and many nightmares and a second year of very slow but constructive work They just released the good final product as promised for a long time You can exchange CLOAK on or buy directly on There is a GUI wallet Windows Linux easy to use and with all the basic needed functions you would need without any useless stuff They have a decentralized anonymous market in development but as I begin to know them it should not be ready before years But before that a new improved wallet should be released very soon Short video explanation about their anonymity system An interesting publication of still very good download of the complete blockchain to start quickly the wallet instead of slow first scroll down Block explorer believe Cloakcoin should not be ignored as a way to secure and anonymize your financial transactions I think the anonymity privacy protection of their system is quite good whatever nothing could be worse than Bitcoin after all stand alone or in association with VPN and TOR so give Cloakcoin his chance try it The forum and chat is quite active and they should answer all your questions Beside that there is the Monero altcoin Entirely new concept maths and cryptos While I think Cloakcoin is great trustable and easy I believe XMR is technically superior and even more bullet proof than CLOAK But for now Monero is a little bit less user friendly on first approach only a little The dev team is bigger as well as the project and universe globally and the devs are very active improving again and again Monero even if now it s already probably the top best anonymous coin Progress is slow because of the complexity of all the involved technics But XMR works well and is already fully useable Homepage for all OS command line party GUI wallet online wallet REALLY safe No risks to be hacked or loose your XMR But I m not going to speak about here GREAT official offline wallet generator save the page to your computer disconnect from internet open the file of page or refresh and an extensive guide for securely generating an offline cold paper wallet accept Monero payments you should have full support from community to integrate Monero payment gateway on your website Blockchain block explorer is a GREAT Monero service really underestimated works on TOR it allows you to send anonymous Monero to this website it converts them to bitcoins and after that sends the bitcoins to a BTC address you gave it s better than all the bitcoin tumblers the API used is fully given here The best exchange for Monero is and is really usefull too So I think CLOAK is directly easy intuitive and great for people to people transactions or small scale webshops and XMR is also very easy but needs maybe hours of readings and even more secure and the priority choice for big webshops Monero should be the best choice for integration as payment gateway in a darknet webshop all the doc you need is should be available and if not the devs are going to help you very well and fast be assured maybe don t mention them it s for a dark market Cloakcoin could also be integrated in webshop as automated payment gateway I think but I m less sure you ll get all the technical infos or answers very quick I REALLY believe that darknet markets should move away from Bitcoin and use Cloakcoin or Monero maybe survival of this second coin is more guaranteed for many years to come CLOAK is still smaller less spread and fragile but exists for years or at least propose to customer to pay by Cloakcoin or XMR beside BTC in addition as alternative their choice An education time will be needed to convert customers but they should quickly understand it s for the safety of everyone And you sellers too I hope I may have helped About Bitcoin privacy anonymity Monero XMR altcoin SAFE AND EASY WAYS TO TUMBLE BTC ways.
LuckyDuck's MDMA is some of the best I've come across It was clear overweight and positively MDMA Mandelin and Marquis The most beautiful mg experience I've had Definitely worth a shot Welcome to TMG.
Damn I should make posts real quick I've always wanted to try ALD Should've jumped on the TMG train earlier sigh.
Ulbricht guilty in Silk Road online drug trafficking trialJury convicts on seven counts doesn't believe Ulbricht was just the fall guy by Joe Mullin Feb pm UTCNEW YORK A jury on Wednesday convicted Ross Ulbricht on federal charges accusing him of being the mastermind behind the online drug bazaar Silk Road where hundreds of millions of dollars in illegal goods were traded before law enforcement shuttered the site in late The jury of twelve reached its guilty verdicts on all seven counts after deliberating less than four hours Ulbricht faces up to life in prison He'll be sentenced at a separate proceeding in a few months The seven charges include three drug counts distributing or aiding and abetting the distribution of narcotics distributing narcotics or aiding and abetting distribution over the Internet and conspiracy to violate narcotics laws He was also convicted on a fourth count of conspiracy to run a continuing criminal enterprise which involves supervising at least five other people in an organization in addition he was convicted on conspiracy charges for computer hacking distributing false identification and money laundering The verdict was handed up to US District Judge Katherine Forrest in a manila envelope She gave it to her court clerk who read it out The judge then polled each juror asking them to verbally concur in the verdict As the verdict was read Ulbricht's father Kirk Ulbricht held his head Midway through the reading Ulbricht turned to face his family and friends who filled about two rows of courtroom benches After it was read Ulbricht was taken out of the room by the same two federal marshals who led him in each day of the trial It's not the end Ulbricht's mother Lyn Ulbricht said to her son as he was escorted from the courtroom Several other relatives in front rows simply shouted out a quick goodbye In the back of the gallery a supporter shouted Ross is a hero The year old Ulbricht who the authorities said made millions of dollars in commissions put on a brief defense of just three character witnesses during the three week criminal trial Ulbricht's defense attorney Joshua Dratel told reporters gathered outside the courthouse that he plans to appeal Dratel said the judge presiding over the trial hampered his defense by excluding evidence and witnesses a position echoed by the defendant's mother The defense was shackled she told reporters gathered outside the courthouse after the verdict It's not fair Dratel didn't say much about the negotiations before the trial but he did say the government didn't make a meaningful offer that would have reduced Ulbricht's possible sentence The trial proceeded over days spread over three weeks During closing arguments Tuesday Dratel told jurors that the data authorities seized from Ulbricht's computer connecting him to the site could have been created by others The Internet is not what it seems he told the six woman six man panel Dratel has said his client who did not take the stand had created the site but was the fall guy for the site's real operators Prosecutors countered Dratel telling jurors there was a mountain of evidence that Ulbricht was the Dread Pirate Roberts Thousands of pages of chats with Silk Road admins and other management documents were recovered from his open laptop There's no dispute when the defendant was arrested he was logged in as Dread Pirate Roberts prosecutor Serrin Turner told jurors There were no little elves that put all of that evidence on the defendant's computer.
Down for me too Market and Vendor sites I don't think they have alternate links.
Good idea to link this here Hopefully someone will get some use out of it.
Quote from janesmith on May pmhow do you link your pgp key in your profile sig Looks like you got it.
what would you say about simply using a mobile PGP program and using text messages.
i have a program that works instantly its no key much much smaller but works without any load times Btw forgot to say that this is f'ing awesome root.
Not to sound unsympathetic but all this thread contains are excuses in one form or another Dear TMG family be careful and sorry for your loss es.
Quote from unit on May pmu I couldn't agree more I've already swore to myself I'm sticking to micro transactions from now on I'd rather have BTC on the line than what i had put myself into And exactly I've never felt comfortable with sharing that I even use the market with anybody but close close close friends When they would like help with using it or want me to over see a transaction for them I let them know I risk my money when I use these marketplaces so when you want to use them you're risking your money too Basically saying I'll do my best to make sure they get a clean transaction but if it goes to hell in a hand basket which I've seen happen very easily it's not up to me to fix or compensate anything for them unit I also use markets for mostly BTC deals its less of a worry and below a certain amount is IMO much less dangerous than a larger amount Some may say that it requires more orders to get the same amount but I'd rather get caught with a oz decriminalized amounts in some places of bud than a whole zip or QP Not that it matters if the feds get you but if you get pulled over with it then unless you live in the deep south just a ticket The same is true for RL I used to have this strategy when buying weed I'd go to my dealer and if I was getting a half or a zip I would never tell them first I'd check it out and if the weed was sub par I'd just get a dub or a slice There are exceptions like if I wanted some primo bud from a vendor like CultMadeline who only sells Oz's but their bud is fire and they are trusted Even then I'd rather direct deal One thing about direct deals though I would place a very basic order one item and maybe a small cheap second but you don't need to make it confusing or overly complicated Final note there are some things that make sense to buy in bulk the one thing I don't is with MDMA I don't have many friends who do it although getting rid of it is easy the reason I don't is that I know that for myself I will do higher doses and more often If I bought a whole g If I had friends who would buy it I could sell it very fast for a nice profit Most of my friends don't even know if the 'molly' they got of some uni student was real MDMA and are averse to pills never had good ones or think they are cut thanks to pop culture its crazy smart people too That is what is so liberating about DNMs you don't have to take what everyone else in your area or circle of friends does It cuts through ignorance like a machete love and light ACID.
We are very pleased with Oasis market so far It is still in the early stages of growing in terms of vendors and listings so the product selection is not rich yet but we have had great experience so far with all parts of using the store and especially the top notch support We initially decided to set up with Oasis exclusively because we felt in harmony with their donation supported model and we are very happy with our decision so far We hope that they are exactly what they appear to be because so far they appear to be awesome The store looks slow when you first check it out for now but it is in fact very busy if you are giving away acid for free.
Hacking Don't know Dood PGP MEssages you need to know this download PGP get your keys read up on it maybe another member has a link to a quick tutorial but you need to learn how to encrypt your messages especially when your sending your address for orders.
Hello I'd like to try some of your ald.
UPDATE The ALD Orage Sunshine will be ready for shipment TOMORROW.
An updated version would be.
My buddys and myself tried some of the ALD last night and we were completely blown away They are very good friends of mine and completely trust anything that I would ever give them but I DID NOT tell them that it was ALD hit was PLENTY for all of us but we just kept deciding to eat more throughout the night And unlike LSD ALD seems to Stack pretty well After our experence last night I will defientely be getting more ALD It is AMAZING I kept asking them to compare their opinions about it compared to different types of LSD that they have eaten The one kid was unable to tell a difference but said it was the best cleanest LSD they've eaten MY other buddy who is VERY experienced with LSD 'thought' there might be something different going on but sad it was phenomenal The only thing I found difference with ALD compared to LSD with LSD I'm usually up for hours and hours and MOST of the time I can't sleep no matter what I do But when this ALD as soon as the of us sat down to watch a movie and get settled in we just kept talking about the amazing CEV we were having then the next thing we knew it was hours later Not a single one of us remember falling asleep it kind of just 'Happened' lol If that makes any sense I was seeing other posts about there being yellow spotting on the backs on the tabs where the ALD people were thinking they were Hot Spots So after I laid the ALD on the paper I didn't notice any yellowing on the back of the paper However when we when to cut the paper up last night there were DEFIENTELY yellow spotting on the paper and they defientely were NOT Hot Spots' ALD in xtal form is yellowish so I really don't think no matter how saturated the solution is there will ALWAYS be Yellow Spotting on the paper Regardless I absolutely LOVED the chemical Some people may not though some people like that body load 'headfuck' I myself don't like either And like I've heard before it seems to be a more refined CLEANER trip than LSDWell there is a bunch on it's was to you guys out there looking to hear some good reviews Much love TMG B.
Ok Seems like there is no ETA.
Quote from MtStHelen on March pmWhat about Safe bad Anyone know Anyone correct me if I'm wrong here but from what I understand as long you do these things you should be okay even with a clearnet provider like yahoo or something as long as it allows access through Tor it should be fine as long as everything is properly encrypted NEVER log in to your email account over the clearnet Tor ONLY ENCRYPT ENCRYPT ENCRYPT AND ENCRYPT SOME MORE EVERYTHING Remember that subject lines and everything thats not inside the actual PGP message can easily be seen by a rd party nothing sensitive that could compromise your identity Make sure you have PGP set up I reccommend TAILS on a usb and also some obvious things like don't re use any psuedonyms for the email address that you've used before that could link to any other clearnet accounts on forums or anything that could be used to link you From my understanding as long as an email provider allows access over Tor and you ENCRYPT your shit up tight then you should be good to go Hope this helps a little peace Mrs B.
Honestly I don't bother with anything labeled over ug because I find they usually seem underdosed Now a lot of the vendors around now are pretty legit but it's just a rule I personally follow It doesn't matter so much whether I'm eating one piece of paper or three Besides I'm usually eating five or six.
i'm glad i could save someone i hope others read this and heed the warnin.
i saw a post a bit ago about how all the big sites have been getting ddosd pretty hard lately and then agora is getting the evolution 'refugees' too so i can believe that theyre not planning on going out of business any time soon oh also i was able to log in today its off and on.
so test kits would not be an approved item since it is not listed am i reading that correctly.
hi everybody i'm absolutely not new to the dnms but i'm completely new to the direct sale trade i guess i'm going to use electrum embedded in tails to proceed to the payments but i'm a little bit scared about the errors i could do i boot tails with usb flash but i didn't configure persistent volume and i'm not really fond of that option i clearly prefer to opt for a small sd card as my storage device so st question is it ok to use electrum even if i don't enable persistence at the launch of electrum tails advises me it is strongly recommended to only run electrum when its persistence feature is activated following step tails tells me electrum could not find an existing wallet what do you want to do create new wallet restore an existing wallet from its seed create a watching only version of an existing walletwhy it doesn't ask me to look for my wallet on another device was my idea to store it on a sd card a stupid idea is my only choice to restore my wallet from its seed when i have created my wallet i now want to send funds to my wallet the btc addresses i should use are the ones under receive tab main account receiving addresses got addresses there am i right concerning the saving of my wallet i just have to go under file then save copy save it on my device and keep a written copy of my wallet seed is it enough or should i also export my private keys to my storage device when my btc vendor has proceeded to the sending of the funds in my wallet and when i saved my wallet i can close it and shutdown tails before they show up in my wallet is that correct how much fee should i give to the btc network to proceed to my transactions for example what you guys are you giving many thanks for your answers cheer.
that's new lol i've never had a message like that appear on here and i've been here since around the forum first started that's super weird hopefully one of the admins sees this and has a response regarding it.
and the next biggest popular after agora.
thanks evil genius i'll chec.
deposits and withdrawls are very slow at agora atm cheers dolmi.
if anything i trust sigaint's serfices the most they've proven their with their email client for a long time.
similar post over on the hub site down currently so can't give you the direct thread link reports of o bridges hanging atheon or the other guys focused on security and there are many will be your best source of info.
glad it worked out.
the word categories is misspelled cartegories on your site the word precursors is misspelled precousors the steroids is misspelled steriods the word opioids is misspelled opiods just trying to help hard to look professional with bad spelling at least to the peeled back tweaker.
not to mention the bug that was found just a few hours ago i hope any ab users have been using pgp because a bunch of users dox has just been found via unencrypted pm's that were made available to the public due to the bug i would be shitting myself right now if had unencrypted pm's on ab stay safe people h.
if anything this is more proof that hos or whoever is a major target of law enforcement and that we really shouldn't be talking about this business on the clearnet anywhere than any notion that the whole sub is just a honeypot i think the arrogant sense that people on the sub have that their crimes aren't worthy of targeting from law enforcement these are people who live to make drug arrests i also think it's a bit alarmist to assert that it exists only for this purpose and that no worthwhile discussion takes place thereon and it's not insignificant seemingly to me that hos didn't have any overt problems with reddit when the reviews were adulatory and the attitude changed when they started to turn critical.
looks like it time to make sure that you layer up as a normal tor connection may not be enough get a vpn running linux on any anonymous provider that accepts bitcoins it doesn't have to have huge resources all it needs to be able to do is handle ssh server and i have seen mb vps systems run a tunnel without problems after you get your vps login information all you need to do is set up your client computer to push all traffic through your vps this was a huge pain in the ass before finding sshuttle pulling it from git all you need to do is cd to the directory and run sudo sshuttle dns vvr username ipofvps enter the password for the vps and it's running you can open firefox and go to ipchicken com to check if it's working now you can run tor without your isp snooping you can either run tor browser or make another layer of protection by using whonix or making a tor middlebox configuration safe and remember if they want you they will come and take you.
next best markets are the following no specific order they are about equal to one another.
meo pcp is one of my all time favorite rcs here's a little trick for you get a ml glass vial i use the vials etzplatinum sells his etiz liquid in once i kill a bottle lol and some everclear or equivalent high proof grain alcohol weigh up mg of the pcp and funnel it into the bottle pipe up ml alcohol with a ml oral syringe and pop that into the bottle with the pcp shake vigorously and gently heat the mixture with a lighter until it all falls into sol'n pair your bottle up with a ml oral syringe and there you have it with this preparation i normally take ml and follow up with ml in an hour or so and yeah the mxe scene is taking a huge hit right now i used to host frequent bulk hq mxe group buys and i had a superb consistent source that always had top of the line stuff and he just up and disappeared right before a buddy of mine was about to start his own buy sucks cuz he had some serious products at some serious prices that and all his c x's were pure best c b i've ever seen i'm actually a bit lost without him tbh.
could someone please send me a dhl invite.
thanks for the info it seems pretty sketchy glad everything worked out for you.
so let me get this straight i pay for using this market the vendor pays vendor adds to his product and the buyer ends up paying more in the end i like what i have trusted vendor great prices and no hassle but hey to each their own good luck.
just an fyi redphone and textsecure both fill this need and are free open source and audited grab an android burner for with these apps and you're good to go.
very nic.
agora has posted a message stating that they're moving their servers while they take down paus the website who knows if when they'll be back up would advise against doing any further business there in the mean time potentially in perpetuity.
i know it is hard to trust people on these forums given situation i for one woulld like to say to you bombheadie i am so very sorry that you had to go through all this i had someone die in my arms it never goes away completly i wish you the best durring this difficult time thank you for your generousity in the past i will look forward to seeing you here in the future peace be with you.
there are also prepaid debit cards that you can buy with cash that may be able to suit your need.
pgp you definately need to read up on pgp it is a way to encrypt your messages and emails you can look up pgp info on the clearnet and many people use it in business and the like it stand for pretty good privacy good places to start is wiki will need a good pgp program and there are several different builds some are better for different platforms on some platforms it may take a while to figure out the program on mac for example using gngtools will install a few programs that you don't actually see the programs in applications and will have to go into your system settings to turn on a few options to be able to use it there are plenty of tutorials all over the clearweb you just need to work the search engines i would recomend not actually trying to buy anything illegal from anyone until you take the time to learn about privacy and encryption in might take a couple weeks to get the tools under your belt but it can protect you a lot more just remember you are never totally safe but you can do a lot of things to minimize being detected there are quite a few hacking sites and forums but some of them are going to require you to figure out a few other programs to get access to as well day for example has a hacking forum but you need to figure out jabber to be able to register.
start a new account and contact them on that one tell them your username and that you forgot your password usually if you know what btc address you have withdrew with they will resest it good luck.
you'll want to make javascript enabled and browser urlbar filter javascript value false to turn off java.
thanks for the suggestion roo.
helloi need some help about getting btc unkown and laundry it and send it to different adresses how do i start get the btc from example localbitcoins send it to helix bitblender then to another mixer and then to some ewallet example bitgo store it there then to another mixer and from there to the market or directly to a vendor any guidence or help is helpfull im new to this.

dolmio on april ami dont see why buyers have to fear about this personal privacy should be everyone's concernthis is the reason our privacy gets shitted on right now in every way imaginabl.
obfs bridges in tailshas anyone had success getting obfs bridges to work in tails despite following the directions exactly as given and pasting the addresses exactly as provided tails simply will not connect to obfs bridges the progress bar stops at about and does not move from there no matter how long you wait scramblesuit bridges also do not work they won't even try to connect an error message pops up referring to whatever scramblesuit address was used all other bridges work flawlessly after doing some research i've found that trouble connecting to obfs is a widespread issue for some tails users i've yet to come across a solution users have been reporting this but for months but it never gets resolved i was wondering if any of you might have any insight that you can offer or if anyone has had success with obfs bridges in tails or if you've found a solution or workaround for the problem thank yo.
reddit is the complete opposite of lowkey and low visibility this is an important message and im sure most serious buyers vendors understand it.
well bit blender went smoothly took less than mins then i went to deposit to a blockchain wallet and it sent fine address was for sure correct and everything but now blockchain is giving me an error when i try to log on error web server is down my javascript is also temporarily allowed like you have to do to see the captcha so that's not it hope this is resolved soon i was just logged onto my wallet and then the second i sent them to that wallet from bit blender i went to make sure they went through then it gave me the error edit ok just found out blockchain is down therefore blender worked flawlessly in less than mins hope the issues at blockchain get sorted out soon though that's for sure peace mrs b.
dude don't make these kinds of claims and allegations unless you've done your research and can back your claims up with solid facts if you're going to be that paranoid don't use agora i'm taking a break from agora for personal reasons for a little while myself.
also as i said before in my country it's even easier to buy btc u go to a cash machine in a wall wearing whatever u like and u put the address where u want the btcoins pay with cash and voila no way someone can trace u this machines are in public places and if u are scared of cameras u can go by nightime wearing a mask why complicate things more when they work flawless this way ok i see it someone somewhere has something to win out of this cool.
nucleus or me.
sorry guys to make such a with xmr or cloak altcoins on this kind and fun psychedelic forum but why keep a btc steam machine that is proven to regulary explode and spread your privacy on a large scale when there are new robust xmr tesla cars specifically designed to avoid anonymity holes on every road tried to make the best image i could but it's really so in the present day the new modern tools exist they work and have been tested and validated and continue to be improved actively developped now vendors and customers only need to make effort to integrate them to the market system for the safety of everybody as opposite bitcoin only prove more and more every day that it directly leads to you in a way or other and there are more and more new tools every day to quickly and better trace btc use to the identity of users i apologize my english is very bad.
just an update we love avengers is now the biggest market with abraxas being down for the time being vendor buyer registration love avengers affiliate php aff i would highly recommend using dream though as they are the longest running and most reliable dnm to datedream registration link love avengers ai.
threatened my life the most alcohol definitely the fact that it's so potent potentially dangerous yet also readily available legally and cheap never ceases to amaze me and while i don't drink as hard as i used to i still can't quite get over catching a lsd's helped me to see through to the deeper reasons behind alcohol's role in our society think of how most 'adult' social functions parties revolve around drinking on some level so now i imbibe with a little more awareness of what i'm doing and why.
offering a bounty for details on cashing out btc and similar information please pgp pm me for questions we will discuss bounty then as well cheers rhet.
experimented with various benzos for about a year or two the most dangerous one was phenazepam ultra long half life i ended up blacking out for days during one session and stopped using them recreationally after that never experienced withdraws because i never took too much or took them on a daily basis but you can become dependent fast panic attacks upon quitting if you get used to your medication and seizures if you get physically dependent my doc and problem drug class dissociative with mxe moved on to ketamine and then on to pcp pce and their derivatives i was im'ing fully anesthetic doses of ketamine every night for about months strait at one point quit for a while and then when i relapsed i got right back into it i became tolerant to the sedative tranquilizing effects which is when ketamine mxe became a problem an anesthetic im dose of mg s mxe or mg im ketamine no longer caused ataxia sedation and i was effectively dissociating myself and blacking out but would then get up and start walking around working in a manic dream mode i started using pcp pce derivatives because they were much more potent x as potent as mxe and like x as potent as ketamine a non tolerant user would be fully anesthesized by like mg of meo pcp or ' oxo pce mg is a fully active and very strong dose at the peak of my use i was injecting mg of ' oxo pce x the recommended dose in a session once i started consuming such large amounts i became tolerant immune to the sedative effects and it started getting dangerous i would black out and be up and active while manic blacked out ever hear about those people that lift cars or take like bullets and keep beating up the police because they're high on pcp and can't feel pain or fear that's me i never got violent or hurt anyone but i was not aware and posed a great danger to myself and others at that point i was actually experiencing pain physical withdraws when i came off my dose and was redosing every single day multiple times a day to keep off baseline i even woke up one morning laying in bed like nothing had happened i remember taking a shot and getting ready to lie down for bed when i woke up i was covered in cuts bruises and scuffs it looked like i had been in a car accident or had fallen out of a tree or something i was beat the hell up furniture had been mangled destroyed by my body colliding with it furniture had been re arranged and there was a trail of blood drops on my carpet and blood stains on the walls where i had made contact i was in so much physical pain i could barely walk for the next couple days i kept injecting every day didn't really start weening my dose down and attempting to cut out my use until i was shown a min video of me blacked out on consecutive shots ever seen a video of yourself blacked out drunk at a house party this was worse heartbreaking my last dose was earlier today and i'm dancing around the idea of dosing right now i've made progress but its hard the reason i started using was to control my bipolar my mood swings had gotten so severe that i was jumping from suicide risk to full blown mania multiple times per day i became addicted to mxe because it helped me rationalize and understand my emotions and keep me from hitting the suicidal depressive lows it later became a substitute for suicide i was k holing m holing myself every day because ego death was better than actually killing myself this is why ketamine isn't on the list of approved substances here on tmg it is schedule because it is a needed surgical anesthetic it is a powerful psychedelic and great tool for exploring your mind please be careful and don't let it become a habit ketamine is a very strong but fleeting high.
there is a topic on the hub about this being a scam would check it out frequently before joining i would highly recommend you join use at dream instead.
knucklesfromsr on february pmthis trial should of been extremely highly publicized from everything that i read this makes it so that website owners can be held responsible for what their users do and yea the whole thing was rigged a mess apparently from what his family was saying they denied a lot of evidence from the defense from even being presented i wouldn't be surprised if the whole thing was rigged i think they're trying to make an example of ross and disuade from anyone following in his footsteps.
it's back up.

attacks that have landed significant dnm figures behind bars the above article has more details about how the feds did it and who they have arrested so far a former silk road lieutenant for starters also tor bridges are practically useless for hiding from the nsa because the nsa harvests the tor bridge addresses from the emails send to from the tor project the nsa knows you're using tor anyways if you're using a tor bridge tor bridges were designed for people in repressive third world countries not us citizens hiding from the nsa it also gets worse and this is information that every dnm user serious or small should know about but since the edward snowden leaks the nsa has talked about if not bragged that they have timing attacks for de anonymizing tor users what does this breach have to do with tails isn't it just a live version of linux is it because it's not designed to be used with a vpn and that vpns are the safest way to access tor i'm not disputing what you're saying i just don't understand it thanks basically yea you want to always use a vpn before tor and tails doesn't have built in vpn support so unless you're using a vpn router like how cosmic consciousness explained then if your tor connection ever gets de anonymized they would see your home ip or wherever you're connected from and that by itself has been enough to land some unlucky people in jail and prison like the silk road lieutenant from that article the nsa even brags about how it can de anonymize tor users so not using a vpn first is like going out and having sex with women a night without a condom and hoping you don't get an std after a year one of the worst ways you can be de anonymized is like this tor basically uses three hops to send your data to the final destination node the first node or the guard node node the middle node node the exit node so if you log in to reddit com through tor using the same username you buy with on the markets with your connection without a vpn would look like your home ip tor node tor node tor node redditbut if you got unlucky and the government runs all three of those tor nodes and your tor prioritizes the fastest tor nodes tor node would know your home ip but not the contents of your connection tor node would also know that it's sending data on to tor node tor node knows that it received a connection from tor node although it doesn't know what the contents are tor node also knows that its sending data to tor node tor node finally sends your data to reddit tor node can always see your data in plaintext for any website not just reddit unless that connection to the website used even if your web traffic to reddit is all sent over encrypted to the reddit server tor node knows that this is one of the reddit servers for instance because in the connection during the ssl tls handshake the reddit server openly says says before everything gets encrypted that this server belongs to reddit if reddit has been put under some type of government gag order to give all ip addresses login times to the feds the feds would know you logged in through tor but if the feds are doing de anonymization attacks right now if tor node was one of their own they could see this connection to reddit and tor node knows it received a connection from tor node and tor node knows it made a connection to tor node likewise if we roll this back one more time tor node knows that it received a connection from tor node and tor node knows that it made a connection to tor node at a very specific point in time down to the second then finally tor node knows this connection came from your home ip address this is how the feds can de anonymize you if they control your entire tor circuit your tor node but the nsa even brags that it can de anonymize people just based off when you made your tor connection combined with when the request came out of the tor exit node so it's possibly they don't even need to control your entire tor circuit for that connection just run one of the tor node 's and use their nsa mass surveillance visibility to know when a connection came out of one of the tor nodes plus they can combine this roughly with the size of the encrypted data being sent back to you to narrow down how large the page you viewed was which can help them pinpoint you even closer with this second method i think the second one is sloppier but the nsa was caught bragging from information in the edward snowden leaks that this method still works ubuntu is really easy to learn i highly recommend it as an alternative to tails if you've only ever relied on tails before mullvad the vpn provider even has a linux client for their vpn you basically just click a button and it connects they're probably the best commercial vpn provider in my book you can pay them in bitcoins the only personally identifiable information with them is a numeric account id they keep no logs and they have repeatedly told off governments when they asked for information about users and they know the people who run their sweden data center and they used their own hardware for the nodes there so the usa government can't just show up there with a gag order and take one of their vpn server's hard drives with their ssl private keys on it like they could possibly to vpn servers here in america regardless of what company runs the vpn server ubuntu has all the bells and whistles that tails has and there is an enormous amount of documentation available for you you can find the answer to just about any problem in ubuntu by search engine ing xyz ubuntu you can also give it a full disk encryption password during your ubuntu install thanks for the great explanation i use ubuntu already since i have essentially abandoned windows because it sucks so hard with ubuntu and the vpn set up does it make sense to run tor through the vpn as an extra layer if so what package does ubuntu have available to run tor thanks.
galindoi on july pmi can't respond as a buyer don't have any experience with depositing funds there but as a seller its all crickets over there not a lot of activity for mushrooms i've found in light of that though the few transactions i've had went smooth customers finalized and i was able to transfer my funds several hundred dollars out of the system into my own wallets easily and with no hassle so grain of salt galindoiis agora where most of your sales occur.
abraxas because it's populated with vendors dhl has no vendors barely anything up middle earth has from what i've experienced some pretty jenky coding and nucleus doesn't seem to have very responsive support teams.
greenbud on march pm well i don't have anything to say about grammar or syntax but i do have something to say about reddit r dnm first of all it doesn't matter what the vector of attack or particular vulnerability is the problem is that correlation of aggregates and uis unique identifiers can identify people just as much as posting pictures combined with site history or what have you all of this is irrelevant it is all information which can and will be aggregated and used against someone talking about purchases on clearnet and getting into specific details about how business is conducted along with dangerously innacurate or biased information are threats after much lurking and reading i believe that some of the moderators of r dnm after analysis are informants i do not have proof other than psychological traits from stylography and demeanor i have been on internet forums and chats since the days of gopher when cern had the only webpages people give away quite a bit when they talk and that is something that makes a clearnet site dangerous they have a corporate structure and have to abide by regulations and i do no trust conde naste reddits owners anymore than i trust wal mart or costco this is why i tell people to stay clear of rc vendors that take paypal or ccs on the clearnet they can be compelled to provide evidence against you on reedit lol they can track if you go to a b and c subreddit after browsing r dnm don't need money you go to r furry or r worldnews and then you browse r gratefuldead r lsd etc then you log in tommorow then the next day do the same thing there could be a ui even if you use tor i have been told that using javascript on tor alone cannot reveal your identity if your browser is set correctly but there are a number of settings in tbb which can be queried and further added to a ui of a user so while grammar might not be the issue there are issues and at least onion forums are not owned by corporate media won't encourage you to do risky shit someone on actually recommended that no one order mdma domestically in the us because canada is foolproof and cheaper because they want people to take risky orders the le want people to break the law and brag about it publicly i don't take sides in this shit but after evo i'm feeling negativity on a whole other level from r dnm and while we will still read your shilly reviews i have not and will never post or login to that section of the website or browse it outside of a totally new tor connection with scripts off and cache cleared i suggest others do the same don't post comment its a trap and not a good one like in r trapmusic or r traphouse or what have you thanks for reading out thanks for the awesome advice.

abraxas alphabay i like the layout of abraxas alot but alphabay is more likely to get my business now since agora is pulling the plug.
i'm gonna be upgrading my opsec to tails on usb and i'll most likley be using public wi fi since i don't have my own on whatever laptop comes my way obviously vpn and other things like that aren't an option so is there anything else i need.
can i trust that my btc will actually show up someone is selling sheets of ug acid for great reviews for it everywhere i look except for one person i want to buy it but i saw a few threads on forums about people's btc never arriving and others getting banned after depositing large amount.
hey guys if anyone know the tails os good enough to give a concise step by step guide on how to encrypt a message without posting a link to the tails website or reddit post i would be forever greatful thanks in advance.
it would be interesting to see how much these increase in a week from now.
where i live u can buy them straight at pay points type in your wallet address and insert cash and voil pretty simple ain't the same over there lbc has just the best prices and the biggest headaches.
hmm might have to check it out since agora registrations seem to be closed and i forgot my login credentials as for noscript i am using tails but the browser always seems to start up with scripts enabled so i have to disable them manually is there a way to have scripts disabled by default i could not find anything in the preferences edit found it in the tor button options security needs to be set to high.
love you man.
lollmfao rofl ok sorry op that was just too funny this guy what a fucking clown.
uncleal on february amquote from sillywabbit on february pmvery likely although from the rise of other markets the fact that evo and agora are still up and the further development of p p networks like bitmessage etci doubt they can do much to stop it deter yes but those who are top notch in their opsec and know how to make robust websites the only shot they have is to get in on the inside like they did agree the cats already out of the bag and le knows it and that's percisely the reason why le turns to scare tactics because they know they can't do anything about it legally at least but more and more bills keep being brought up that would allow le and the nsa to infringe on our rights even more and this also needs to be addressed and stopped yep like who knows how about just warrantless opening of people's mail how about cameras installed in peoples' homes bathrooms floors in your body i think these leo will either continue on or maybe their policies will become some extravagant and rediculous that they will see the absurdity in it all especially when it is obvious none of it is bettering society in fact it will all just lead to greater discontent more acts of violence and revolt look at alcohol prohibition they need to just stop but i see the next step will be some kind of usps control system maybe a change in our internet laws but whatever we are in the digital age hackers rule and it cant be stopped freedom fighters will find a way around anything one thing i've wondered lately is there a noticeble surge in mail and even so it's just more of the same thing but im sure their is profiling and thats why vendors gotta switch it up allot make packs look plain and unassuming i jst dunno how vendors can just drop s of packs a week and not be suspect oh and maybe blue boxes will get replaced by control centers that are monitored with scanners that have cameras too it could get that craz.
set up some bridges if you can done correctly they can hlep hiding your useage from isp dpis are stilla worry though for some tor document have some good info in it but i find it can get a little nerdy for me to decypher that's me thoug.
the hippie on july can be a real problem too little isn't enough and too much isn't enough glad i haven't done any in almost a year alcohol is my next one feel sort of proud not buying a six pack earlier with meth its never enough and the hangover is the worst my problem drugs is weed lolim kidding its not a drug and its not addictive but i think i'm addicted to the habit of smoking weed probably because i've been smoking every day to rolls for more than years and also the addiction can come because i mix tobacco with weed it might made me feel addicted to weed where it might be the nicotine that i crave i really don't know.
nice update of tails o.
is there any market place online right now i've tried a few and had no luck with any of them what's going on i'd be glad for some input cheers freddi.
that's a question i've asked myself why aren't domestic labs producing these totally legal not regulated under analogue act chemicals although i'm sure if they were they would get hammered down on pretty quick although kratom has been around for a very long time and there's no sign of that slowing at all who knows i mean there haven't been any reported deaths from mxe and usually that's when things kick into high gear when a kid or someone unfortunately does too much and it shows up on the news there must be a lot of regulations here in the us compared to india and china i suspect india will be the next supplier but i've heard their rc's are even less trustworthy than those from china but of course it up to use to always test and do our own methods of harm reduction.
everything was okay in the end just got a bit worried there for a moment.
ketaman on september amif you're really worried about security buy a laptop locally with cash and only use it for browsing dn however a tails usb is easy to use and offers basically equal security can anyone recommend a good burner laptop for darknetmarket shopping vending use mostly large shopping i plan to use tails on usb or dvd.
update by cloning via usb don't let it download update when i let the client download and update from to it did not complete only got to and failed so many times that i lost everything i don't want you to feel the pain of losing your persistent volume it is quite a task to rebuild relationships with vendors.
seems worth trying thank you jean luc.
doses lysergic on january amlol speak english its not insignificant it is not not significant when you use a double negative you obscure your meaning ianae the post by dxuutx undoubtedly contains florid prose perhaps excessively and i appreciate your plea for simple english on internet forums it is usually more effective to have style enhance an argument rather than have the argument be a frame for displaying one's style however the use of the double negative in it's not insignificant is valid here before going further let's first correct the misquote so that the phrase regains its original meaning taken out of context as above the phrase implies the possessive sense of its eg people admired its not insignificant beauty whereas the original was it's an abbreviation of the verb it is yes i know at worst this is a common mistake and at best acceptable textspeak and generally is too small to be worth picking up on but your opening point is that dxuutx should speak english therefore introducing a grammatical error into your first  dxuutx's post unfairly helps your claim as to the phrase itself the double negative is an example of a figure of speech called litotes or more generally meiosis where something is deliberately played down or understated in order to increase its importance litotes is common in many languages both ancient and modern in europe it has a fine pedigree being found in homer's iliad ovld's metamorphoses and the epic poem beowulf logically it may be true that it's not insignificant has the same meaning as it's significant but litotes remains an acceptable way of emphasising a statement even to fowler who would certainly be sympathetic towards your desire for greater clarity a dictionary of modern english usage hw fowler various editions just saying.
if canada gfn went direct i would never need to use a market ever again.
good stuff you should be very weary of cruising the darknet on what is essentially a homing device.
wow postage seems like a lot for a small package.
hidid someone send some founds to agora did it work well heard they had problem last weeks and would like to know if it's fixed as they claim or if it isn't thank.
awesome thank you for all the info i really hope vendors markets will start accepting cloakcoin and anonymous bitcoin here soon.
not back for me yet i really hope it comes back lots of good connects over there plus all the coin that i had.
what's up with that agora link is that a pishing link or did they just add a second url.
down for me too market and vendor sites i don't think they have alternate links.
sabbatical on july pmhonestly i don't bother with anything labeled over ug because i find they usually seem underdosed now a lot of the vendors around now are pretty legit but it's just a rule i personally follow it doesn't matter so much whether i'm eating one piece of paper or three besides i'm usually eating five or six well i dont follow that rule because the more lsd you take the more depth and spiritual awakening you find and if you can get that in one blotter instead of three well then you found yourself a bargai.
bumpcan anyone help me with this or at least point me in the right direction on who where i should ask this.
paulista on march amthumbs up for dream market recently i opened a dispute about an escrow order which after weeks wasn't shipped and got my btc back within a couple of hours second vote for dream they have been spot on and draw my kind of vendors to the market research chemicals no illegal shit being done here.
you're probably fine just washing your coins once make sure to use a different name and buy them in cash through localbitcoins you can use helix to send the coins directly to your market wallet i e agora or nucleus and then you will be able to make purchases.
no it is fine.
lmnt on july amso i just switched over from using tails i'm now using the latest desktop version of ubuntu with a vpn hardened tor browser armory keepassx gpa are there any other tools i could be using to increase my security or for cleaning up after using my tools particularly interested in tools to erase the traces in the ram or other traces of my usage thank you for your help good switch did you enable full disk encryption when you installed ubuntu.
agora is notorious for having delayed withdraw deposits grant it they always pull threw but it's been at an all time high lately not to mention there is a btc stress test going on until the morning.
it been down again all morning for me.
we are very pleased with oasis market so far it is still in the early stages of growing in terms of vendors and listings so the product selection is not rich yet but we have had great experience so far with all parts of using the store and especially the top notch support we initially decided to set up with oasis exclusively because we felt in harmony with their donation supported model and we are very happy with our decision so far we hope that they are exactly what they appear to be because so far they appear to be awesome the store looks slow when you first check it out for now but it is in fact very busy if you are giving away acid for free.
it's a work in progress updated image should always be here.
buy a pc laptop from craigslist your local recycler etc.
is higher than just about all the other markets nucleus is only i would not sell on a new market it has to prove itself first customers are not going to be happy being asked to pay an upcharge which will discourage sales whats this bit about selling ipads and iphones is it a joke it may turn out to be a great market perhaps later i will look into it but for now i'm satisfied with the markets i'm on.
that would be amazing but i personally think that tmg is more than that and who knows in the future there are more choices of safe substances.
knuckles on may pmi'm reading for some macbooks they have wifi problems but it looks like it can be solved by getting a usb wifi adapterwhere there's a will my man where there's a will.

sigaint shared that on the hub users who access tor hidden services websites that are only accessible inside the tor anonymity network is easier than de anonymizing users who use tor to access regular internet websites security researchers filipo valsorda and george tankersley showed friday at the hack in the box security conference in amsterdam why tor connections to hidden services are more vulnerable to traffic correlation attacks one of tor's primary goals is to provide anonymity for internet users this is achieved by routing their web traffic through a series of randomly chosen nodes or relays before passing it back onto the public internet the nodes that make up the tor network are run by volunteers and they can have specialized roles there are nodes called entry guards that serve as the first hops onto the network and there are also exit relays that pass the traffic back onto the internet internet servers that receive traffic from tor users won't see the real ip internet protocol addresses of those users what they'll see will be the ip addresses of randomly chosen tor exit nodes the tor hidden service protocol extends the anonymity protection to servers as well it makes it impossible for users to see the real ip address of a server that runs a tor hidden service like for example a website hidden services use addresses that end in onion a pseudo top level domain that doesn't exist on the internet and only resolves inside the tor network this anonymity protection for both servers and users makes hidden services attractive to political activists in countries where free speech is not well protected or where internet surveillance is common but also to criminals who use such websites to hide their activities from law enforcement the infamous online bazaar silk road where users sold drugs arms and other kinds of illegal goods and services operated as a tor hidden service the fbi eventually shut it down and arrested its owner but other similar marketplaces have taken its place the biggest threat to the tor network which exists by design is its vulnerability to traffic confirmation or correlation attacks this means that if an attacker gains control over many entry and exit relays they can perform statistical traffic analysis to determine which users visited which websites the tor developers are closely monitoring exit relays and removing bad ones from the network so it's relatively hard for someone to pull off such an attack in addition if an attacker wants to identify tor users visiting a specific internet website they'd have to gain control over a very large number of exit and entry nodes in order to increase their chance of success since the relays will be different for every connection that's not the case with tor hidden services and in fact attackers could quite easily and with percent reliability take control of all the rendezvous points between tor users and specific tor hidden services at least for a period of time tor hidden services rely on nodes with a special hsdir hidden service directory flag to advertise themselves on the tor network so they can be discovered by users every hidden service will select six hsdir nodes to serve as its rendezvous points on a given day this selection is done from a pool of around nodes based on a predictable date dependent formula with this formula both a tor client and a tor hidden service should select the same hsdirs on a particular day however the researchers found that they could use brute force techniques to generate the keys needed for their own nodes to take up those rendezvous positions for a specific day the researchers managed to place their own nodes as the hsdirs for onion facebook's official site on the tor network for the whole day on thursday they still held of the spots on friday brute forcing the key for each node took only minutes on a macbook pro and running the tor relays themselves cost us on amazon's ec service new nodes receive the hsdir flag automatically after being up for around five days and attackers could set up nodes to become the hsdirs for a particular hidden service for the next five days with around us the researchers estimated this technique will give attackers control over one end of the connection but in order to perform traffic correlation attacks the attacker would also need to have visibility into the entry point this can be achieved by someone who can monitor users' traffic before it enters the tor network for example a government monitoring its internet users through isps could use this attack to perform traffic analysis and determine who visited a dissident site hosted on tor a law enforcement agency could do the same with the help of isps to identify who is visiting an illegal website that runs as a tor hidden service the goal of the two researchers was to prove that hidden service users face a greater risk of targeted de anonymization than normal tor users because it's much easier to reliably control all hsdirs for a specific hidden service than to control all tor exit relays that might be used to access a website runa sandvik a security researcher and former tor developer who was at the conference agreed that it's technically easier to pull off such an attack than to monitor tor exit traffic but pointed out that the tor project is aware of the issue and has been working on a fix for some time there is a proposal for the next generation of hidden services that will address not only this problem but also other potential issues sandvik said in the meantime the tor developers have tools that can detect relays trying to attack users of tor hidden services she said a change in tor that will be implemented soon will make it harder for new nodes to become hsdirs by forcing them to obtain a stable flag first valsorda and tankersley said this will require nodes to be online for a longer period of time before they can become hsdirs so it will make the attack more expensive but not technically harder to pull off they said while users can't do much to defend themselves against this the operators of tor hidden services do have one option they could use the attack themselves so that their own nodes will become hsdirs for their own hidden services this won't prevent others from trying to take over the rendezvous positions because the attack is essentially a race condition however if this happens it will be very easy to detect that an attack is going on the researchers explained they released the brute force tool they created for the attack on github as well as a separate hsdir analysis tool that can potentially detect such attacks source link be careful if you decide to setup your own shop el presidente said on the hub  el presidentethis was first publicised by donncha o'cearbhaill in mid he described this technique and published some code since removed for calculating the relay key necessary to become an hsdir for a given hs at a given time looked at silkroadvb piz r amongst othersit's good to remind people but we're kind of suprised this made the news again we will chime in with our standard response which isrun your own guards or use guards you trust stay safe.
edit no longer qn issue resolved thanks i haven't been able to log into nucleus for a bit not sure what's going on or if there's any kind of technical fault this morning in gmt utc anyway but i keep trying to log in but i keep getting the same error message saying that i've got the captcha wrong and yeh it's definitely the right url can anyone else lig in to nucleus right now might just be a temporary fault t's pretty inconvenient so i'm interested to know where the problem lies to you all s.
i can't respond as a buyer don't have any experience with depositing funds there but as a seller its all crickets over there not a lot of activity for mushrooms i've found in light of that though the few transactions i've had went smooth customers finalized and i was able to transfer my funds several hundred dollars out of the system into my own wallets easily and with no hassle so grain of salt galindo.
considering that the tails team is constantly checking for bugs they are smarter than me i'd rather let competent people make the security suite.
i'm with inanna on this one lelantos is nice and i feel worth their cost they did however shut down temporarily to fight off heartbleed and i was worried for a moment they're back up and running now and doing great.
there not safe if they use java script cheers dolmi.
study buddy on july pmenjoy it tell me if you like it it already on its way to you got home late last night after a few drinks and decided to try of the asian xtal tabs all i have to say is i now have a new baseline for lsd tab strength i can't believe those were only rated at ug are you sure you didn't mix them up with the aalbion asian xtal ug you are advertising as coming soon the keyboard on my phone was melting under my fingertps the colors were all over the place and in the dark with my eyes closed green red spiderwebs fractals everywhere i also highly recommend watching the netflix series sense while tripping the music scenery combination is amazin i actually paused at a night time cityscape and while the show was pasued watched lights in buildings go on and and the traffic moved it was awesome thank you so much i had a great night.
enigmaticsmile on august amgambling is a crimedamn let that sink in for a bit and realize the cause we have here is truly fueled by an inner believe in rights and liberties rather than a sneaky way to accomplish something shady damn.
i think if they really did sift through every message and order on sr and were charging people who didn't encrypt their address there would be a mass amount of arrests.
i only found this place as i used to order from lucymcgee a lot she used to advertise her shop on here so i guess it is like a market in that respect i think essentially this is just a forum like the hub only more chilled out.
you like apples  on february am so let me get this straight i pay for using this market the vendor pays vendor adds to his product and the buyer ends up paying more in the end i like what i have trusted vendor great prices and no hassle but hey to each their own good luck how you like dem apples.
tmg is more like a hook up market you can converse with vendors or customers alike and strike up a relationship of sorts share info etc not a market in the traditional sense of the word.
it would no longer be a macbook but would be transformed into a beautiful linux distributio.
just posted it here but this seems to be good place too i sent btc to bitcoinmixer info yesterday and i still haven't received anything back i've sent a note to the site asking what's going on but they haven't answered yet has anyone any suggestions on what to do guess there isn't much i can do except warning everyone not to use the service until the matter is settled i'll update as soon as i get word from them hopefully should this really turn out to be a scam i'll open a separate thread to increase visibility please please let it be some kind of mistake.
rrsolved all good.
well this has happened several times in the past and agora has then fixed the issue but they could be shutting down for good this time ya know who knows but probably agora's not going away just yet my guess next time for both this reason and opsec make sure to go to your wallet page and generate a new deposit address if the page refreshes saying you successfully generated a new address but it's the same as before there are problems with deposits hope that helps.

zoxeebee on november amused or refurbished thinkpad x used or refurbished thinkpad t good advise by far the best you can get for that money a used refurbished thinkpad of the x or t series great quality hardware and very good supported by linux tails.
i just read through the part where vitaminlsd describes creating a amnesiac like enviorment using a vm the only problem with that is that assumes your ost system is not compromised that would mean your running a super clean no script offline and completely secure host system like openbsd itsfar more likely that your host system is already compromised i don't suggest this unles your running a very hardened setup like openbsd you could deploy a similar but tighter setup like whinox similar concept where one machine is exclusivcely a portal for the client.
organix on march pmthey don't really have fa though many have requested it they have optional pgp login but you can't set it up so that no one can login without both password and pgp so its kind of weak for realz never been there but that's weak.
agora is the bulk of my new customers but after an order or two most people are moving to direct deals i'm probably at agora and direct deals it has an ebb and flow to it galindo.
fatfreddie on december pm es okay thanks for the info it kind of spooked me out yesterday jf there is no such thing as we love avengers marketplace the word has just been put in there by the admins to stop someone from spamming this place the original reference was to d r e a m m a r k e t is this the phinshing site you speak off is this site legit.
agorra is the best.
ive heard nothing but great things from john i need to save up coin and jump on those microdots thats my dream.
bonobo on february pmquote from dardush on february amis it just me or does this market looks exactly like evo the evo code is an open source code many markets copy that code today check out real deal market it even looks exactly like evo i mean they didnt even bother to slightly modify the colors and layout well i'm getting creepy flashbacks heh.
hm i'm honestly not sure then have you made your own key already.
hosting it locally is probably the best way to go about it.
hello is there still a spot open for the ald sample i would very much like to experiance this substance i am sendinding you a pm.
where and how do i enter my pgp public key in my profile whats the best way i have looked but i cant work it out thanks in advance.
hi guyscan anyone please send me the link to the we love avengers marketplace i'm getting really confused i don't even know if it actually exists or whether it's a phishing scam site thanks very much.
bitcoinfog has been taking hours for deposits and withdrawals to show would recommend staying away for now what is the alternative.
rec on july amwhy not using qubes os comes with whonix easy to use possibility to chain vpns easily vm are read only so it would make it harder for an attacker to modify your system than using ubuntu well i took your advice and tried qubes os now before i go any further i am very technically capable and experienced qubes os in my opinion is horrible here's why it's way too slow data transfers between app vm's are th of what they are normally even installing app's via the konsole lags on a system with very good hardware tails is slow but qubes is times as slow as tails i have the minimum system requirements and the system is still not usable as a desktop replacement simple things like converting audio video would be impossible due to the speed of the os it is extremely difficult to install use it took me around hours to get the damned thing installed on a system that is tested confirmed working by the developers after installation it took hours upon hours of reading through the crappy documentation to learn how to get basic tasks done there is absolutely no way an average buyer vendor could figure out how to use this os they would need a tech specialist compatibility with most laptops pc's is poor very buggy even on a system fully tested by the developers the os was still incredible buggy using the standard fedora debian templates that it comes with i'm talking graphics displaying improperly freezing crashing etc i did figure out how to work around all the bugs but it was by no means a pleasant experience very small development team if people start using this i doubt they will be able to keep up with patching exploits as we know no system is un hackable and it is mostly dependent on the end user gui was not very well built of everything has to be done from a command line maybe it would be awesome for someone who is a huge fan of xen but for the average user be prepared to puke.
p nd s on may amquote from knuckles on may pmi do miss the original silk road seriously at this point it seems so nostalgic ditto nothing feels the same teardrop topic showing some love abraxaslike that setting up listings was a breezethe delayed messaging is also a nice featur.
on topic my suspicions gain support every day it seems never used the subreddit in anyway and the idea of a clearnet community about darknet activities is ridiculous while it's unfortunate in a sense that some of our fellow humans with whom we shared an interest will be locked in cages for years this is survival of the fittest as the more reckless and less secure individuals fall away we are left with a core group of people whose practices are more fundamentally sound for this community and that principle i am grateful on grammar i understood the post perfectly either in spite of or perhaps because of the use of a double negative not insignificant places an emphasis on negating the point of view that such things are insignificant simplifying the statement to just it's significant would be more of a self contained idea rather than an opposition to others' thoughts the idea that thereon is antiquated sees no use and is now improper is simply false maybe you personally do not come across it often but i assure you it is still used you said it is the equivalent of like most reasonable people would think that two words being equivalent implies a shared meaning they do not share a meaning nor can i think of an instance where they would be it's a more eloquent way of expressing on the aforementioned thing antecedent in this case on the subreddit an interesting thread on either topic love you guysthough if thereon is too archaic to use perhaps using aforementioned isn't any help.
at least op is polit.
darkheroesq awl onion is not responding todaycan anyone access via alternate links.
hey man you might want to check out this sight to read up on all of this it is clearnet clearnet warning.
attempt by whom it looks like some search replace has been played here what was the original word that has been replaced i don't quite remember is it just me who thinks that's strange.
uncleal on april pmwhat's up with that agora link is that a pishing link or did they just add a second url that's the former url that's no longer being used the new one is onionmore info here agora marketplace changes url due to heartbleed ssl bu.
this whole approach does not exactly cry i have my shit together.
here.
wish we love avengers would get the amount of users it deserves.
it seems they may have reached such a high user volume on their servers for now they must not allow new users maybe this way the site shouldn't overload completely too much while figuring out a safe way to expand their server capabilities then again who really knows the reasons but if they were purposely stealing deposits me thinks they would also be allowing new users.
thank you.
eden is your best choice.
started looking at it like my second home best online community i had ever came across love ya guys.
nordicshrooms on september amanyone have any experiences with dream been trying to set up there but i'm getting some weirdness with my account interested in hearing any experiences with the site just to update on this dream has really fast customer service so everything turned out ok we can now be found here as well ps we ship to brazil.
does this market exist still cheers dolmi.
love is all around us on may pmi do not miss logging into agora and seeing pornographic images used in many listings plastered all accross my screen that face when you've bought a account of evolution in the past and are not proud of it.
fatfreddie on december amis it official tmg policy not to mention the d word any more if so why am i missing something fundamental here the problem wasnt the market but the dude was spamming the forums we dont mind making a post in active markets as long as they are legit but dont make post i will release the words as long as they dont start it up again i dont like weeds in the garden pease e.
hopefully the dosages aren't absurd to ruin the experience of all three.
dmate on june pmwhen i try to decrpyt a message i get this error decryption failed secret key not available i'm using a key a created myself in tails then saved to a usb flash stick any ideas what's wrong this is likely because the key needed to decrypt is not loaded onto your system we often get this error when a customer has used a different key to encrypt their message often their own key mistakenly and we ask them instead to use our public key if you are using a key created yourself then all you have to do is load the private key that corresponds you can do this by locating the key right clicking and selecting open with import key and you should get a notfication to say it's been loaded be good sant.
i have taken a look at the apple market and it does appear to have some good features however before i hand over a bit coin to become a vendor here is my list of complaints if i want to search products by a country it appears that it does not function very well say i want to search all drugs available in canada the search feature will not do that many customers on the dark web prefer to shop domestically so they can avoid the hassle of having their purchase go through customs having a search feature which allowed the user to isolate all items or sellers domestically would be a standard feature as a must why is apple asking for a full bit coin deposit for vendors you are not the big apple and myself i do not trust such a new market asking for such a big deposit my feelings is that i do not like to gamble money that i could lose if apple goes rotten plus with so few vendors on site it would probably take months as a vendor to even probably have a sale to give an example when i became a vendor on alphabay i earned over my deposit in bitcoin within a week dream market i have yet to make a sale so they are a waste of time wtf why are your percentages so high for your commission why would i put much stock in trade on your site when alphabay is offering me is just a bit too far over the top my advice is until your site grows up and catches up to the big boys you would be better to lower your commission i suggest you start at about seeing as how presently your site is just a baby good luck.
is nuc back.
ahoy a as flight said your understanding of the process is spot on i was also able to decrypt your message with no problems well done now your next challenge is to post your public key in this thread and or send it to me so i can encrypt you a message calm seascaptain.
due to the recent news about ag i figured i would do a little bit of research to see where everyone is moving total listings drug listings vendor fee agora btc alphabay btc nucleus btc abraxas btc middle earth btc oxygen free dream btc dhl amazon btc silkkitien btc east india company btc mr nice guy btc outlaw btc dnm listing count as of all the sites have open registration except abraxas if you need an invite there is one in my signature.
there is not such thing as a we love avengers marketplaceis just a lame attempt to scam phish and or tarnish lsd avengers reputation nothing to see here keep walkin.
someone mentioned this one before and so i post here supposedly multi sig only which is promising.
i just placed an order the other day via that thread pgp e mail etc hoping to get it within a few days but cm's always been a stand up vendor just throw the address down somewhere and get their pub key.
luxaeterna on april pmwould it be safe enough to continue to use online back transfer so long as i wash them before sending them to vendor here i plan on doing tails pgp lbc electrum wash helix market vendor how does this sound thanking you this would be safe as long as if you're not buying k of bitcoins per month then you'd just better have a believable story what it's for or pay for and consult consult a bitcoin attorney if it's that serious have seen law firms on search engines before that specialize in bitcoin law also i would even recommend sending from helix back to a fresh address in a new bitcoin wallet we can call your tumbled stash like for gammagoblin's lsd to buy it when you go to checkout it locks in the bitcoin price but if you use helix sometimes it ends up sending a few dollars or cents less so you can either overpay in a situation like this or pay twice the better solution would be electrum wallet a helix electrum wallet b since then the exact amount will get sent to your vendor marketplace this also gives you a tumbled stash to play with instead of feeling like you're forced to send it all to the market immediately and have your extra coins sitting on there does this help.
seems like agora is down again since this morning.
as far as i remember when i looked some time ago exchanges btc xmr or shapeshift have very low fee instead of darknet btc tumbler and has fee.
i did try this i typed the text that i want to encrypt and saved the text file to the desktop then i found the file in the file in the desktop folder hilighted it and selected edit then selecting encrypt it then allows me to check the key of the recipient after i do that it creates another file that ends in pgp this seems like it should work just fine but when i open the file it looks like there is heiroglyphic symbols mixed in with normal letters about of each not sure what is going on still.
after i hilight the text and copy it i am clicking on the clipboard icon in the top right of the window and selecting sign encrypt clipboard with public keys and nothing happens any i dea what might be going on.
boneskoopa on february amhosting it locally is probably the best way to go about it agreed host locally enable js and ive used coinb in several times and the code is also verified on githu.
snacktime on august amagora seems to be down cheers stit's back up now thankfully sant.
on august pmwhat would you say about simply using a mobile pgp program and using text messages have you ever tried to decrypt or encrypt a message on an android device the last time i tried it took me minuets.
also have a look.
astraltraveler on june amokey thanks i see folks writing about that u should use adresses and mixers to make it most unknown do you guys have any advice where i can get an email adress that is safe.
this will be my last post in this thread and i am opting out of the sample or any future purchases bombheadie has been communicative with me before and after his computer issues but the entire experience was a little nerve racking as to why a domestic package would take days anyways bh has taken responsibility that he believes he did not send my package and has offered to make it up to me which is a very kind gesture all that being said i'm just going to move on myself and encourage the community to make their own decisions there can be new vendor blues and would expect some to give him a second chance and there will be others who say they don't want to risk anything ever the call is yours thanks to everyone else who has been posting publicly on this topic as it helped raise an issue to the community and glad the problems appears to be packs not ever being sent rather then interceptions or cds i do appreciate you bomeheadie taking responsibility for the not sent packs and surely expect you have learned some valuable lessons from all of this good luck to you in your future endeavors.
thank you.
astraltraveler on june amokey thanks i see folks writing about that u should use adresses and mixers to make it most unknown do you guys have any advice where i can get an email adress that is safe for the mixer you'll need several bitcoin addresses and no email address but when you need an email address sigaint seems to be a good choice gpg encrypt everything though i'd recommend using tails on a second hand laptop you buy for cheap locally and you remove hdd you can start using it on your own computer also it would be better than using only the tor browser bundle it comes with electrum that goes through tor create a new wallet and note your seed few random words somewhere secret where you'll be able to find again in the future on next boots you'll be able to get back to your wallet again using this seed in electrum you'll see there are addresses where you can receive founds give to of them each time you want to send money to the mixer of your choice if you use only one address be it your own tor wallet agora a seller it's pretty easy for anyone looking on the blockchain to see that there is btc in and btc minus fee if you use helix for example out from another address and even if you have plausible deniability you'd be better using more than one address to make your mixing stronger if you are to pay to remove your coins'taint then better do it right localbitcoins with cash cash in the mail or any thing that won't leave tracks back to you mixer tor wallet is quite good if you need more privacy you could send from mixer to mixer then to btc wallet but it's probably not needed if you're a small time buyer and you use tor to connect to the tumbler.
maybe we could throw vendors personal sites up there as well i've got one i know albion does and gamma sc.
which are the biggest and most popular of the markets at this time.
this sounds interesting no clue if such a site exists or not though keeping my fingers crossed.
knuckles on may amdoes anyone here know if macbooks work ok with tor i read before that some of them do not work well with tor but can't find out which ones do or dont if anyone has any info let me know they all work unless really obsolete is this serious.
bonobo on february pmlol it looks ugly sorry if i am straight forward herethe days of search bars sticking out of the ui are all over look at some of the newer markets the design is as important as the features besides what is your ups over say alphabay or dream or nucleus i'm not sure looks would be my first concern if i were to use a market do you recall agora i can't say that it was the loveliest ui in all the land but they left honorably and their operation was flawless although i did not create an account i did pop my head to see the login page doesn't seem all that ugly to me good luck with your endevour am.
not ron paul on march amquote from dimitreez on march pmi agree oasis is pretty awesome it is a nice looking site it is designed well can someone explain the donation thing though so there is absolutely no fees that they demand its just what you feel like donating if so that sure is different and very respectable but i sure do hope that people are donating so they have the drive to stay legit and grow in popularity yes they are completely donation supported they require a bond for new vendors but they waive this for vendors that can confirm they are already established on other markets and the bond is returned to new vendors after orders listings and sales are completely free oasis does not take a percentage or fee for listings or sales we are donating of our sales to the market and we plan to continue doing that from what we can asses they do not need our donations to support maintain and continue to develop the market they plan to continue with or without significant vendor donations and sound like they are set up to do so we get the impression they know what they are doing we think we are good at recognizing these things we feel safe on this ship wow they don't take a or fee and they return excess coin to buyer's wallets how do they even make money.
what are lizardlabs exactly.
thank you we have lots of funds tied in escrow right now an exit scam would devastate not only our business but a small chunk of our lives for awhilecheers s.
organix on april pmi haven't been able to login to nucleus all day i can't even get the start screen anyone else have a problem with it seems like it's been down all day bumme.
on may pmquote from knuckles on may pmi'm reading for some macbooks they have wifi problems but it looks like it can be solved by getting a usb wifi adapterwhere there's a will my man where there's a will whats will doing and why is he there.
ronpaulson on august pmi think the biggest barrier is just getting the capital to get them synthed a lot of labs have a kg minimum or more for custom synt.
does anyone here know if macbooks work ok with tails i read before that some of them do not work well with tails but can't find out which ones do or dont if anyone has any info let me know.
xncsux on march pm that's odd i wonder why i received my sample l lno idea maybe the pack was actually sent later than bh told me and it will show up in a day or so curious to see if bh can update the group since he made a quick appearance yesterday and can let everyone publicly know what is going on and if everything was truly sent or not.
decrypt a message copy the message to be decrypted into the clipboard left click on the clipboard icon on the menu bar and select decrypt verify clipboard enter the passphrase you used to protect your secret key and hit ok on the pinentry window a gnupg results window should pop up with the decrypted message if you don't get the menu entry decrypt verify clipboard when you left click on the clipboard something is wrong with the formatting of the message that you copied into the clipboard to be decrypted make sure that you are copying all of the message including the five dashes at the beginning and end of the message and the begin and end statements pgp is very picky about formatting errors.
wow so much thought went into this but working directly with vendors whom have proven themselves this system is hard to beat i send coin they send product simple i will never join an open market agai.
got it you're reselling sb's mdma good to know glad to see no other actives no problem in my opinion i saw rex's had like caffeine cut which is fine i just don't ever want to see any amphetamines etc i'm a class psychedelic lsd mushrooms dmt mescaline mdma cannabis type of guy and don't want anything else no alcohol no coke etc gotta decalcify that third eye more edit forgot to say thank you for the quick reply thank you.
strangeangels on may pmit might be that you're trying to connect to a specific server which isn't running at the time this i've tried different onion servers and none are connecting wanted to do some trading anyway to access my wallet without using electrum or do you know of a working server.
cupinxa on may pmanybody can sendme a convite or referral link to this market thanks here you go.
if this does exist then i'd love to be a part of it the dnms that i use barely have an novel tryptamines i really want to try them all i guess i've been pretty lucky just to experiment with the ones that have found me so far i think the biggest barrier is just getting the capital to get them synthed and with a medium sized group to contribute that shouldn't be a huge problem.
drbt on april pmi just spoke to a vendor i like to use he said its the site having trouble not an exit scam hopefully this puts minds at ease a littlei hope that's true nucleus seemed to be a very well run site and it would suck for everyone to lose their wallet escrow coin due to it never coming back.
i love apple it's great i have been using it and the vendor base is growin.
is the lsd test kit a time use or is it many uses also what is the price.
only shipping to continental usa to begin we are technically shipping a small amount of hazardous material as the test itself contains some liquid i personally hope we can one day ship world wide it will take some more finesse at that point as we want to be sure to sell these at the lowest cost possible without going in the negative with world wide shipping this becomes more complicated we are also going to limit item per customer per days we feared not doing this may open the possibility of vendors purchasing a majority of them and we also want to reach as many people as possible to make hopefully save someone from being put in a possible dangerous situation we will be putting them up once i have followed the moderators rules here we are running into many roadblocks with rules on other markets so bare with us for a few days we want to ensure we don't break and rules and can help as many people as possible all the while being a good member of the community on a personal matter this is something that is very important to us and something that is very important to me i have a huge sense of community and have also seen first hand what can happen when someone falls to the victim of greed for the time being these chemicals are not made in a clean pfizer lab they are often made in sheds barns sewers and god knows where by god knows who with god knows what materials all this with the intention to get rich by any means necessary if taking a few hours a week out of my week to help people experiencing their own conscious a little safer that is better than any drug i will ever experience stay safe guardia.
inanna on april amlelantos has had great uptime and i suggest them to everyone ussrmail was down half of the time so i switched over to lelantos just make sure to encrypt everything and be careful about what you put for subject headers i have seen a lot of vendors mention lelantos might have to set up an email there when the time comes i know an email isn't essential in using the dn but it couldn't hurt to have one setup the right way.
rictor do you want the postal police banging on your door asking for their cents do they still do that i've had them drop off a card and had to go down n pay to pick up the mail which would scare the shit out of me if it was a pack that was under postaged maybe rip off the section with the stamps and postage due info and just take it to a post office they might ask for your address to set things straight maybe they do keep track and will bother you with a request letter i'd consume the drugs in the house and go ask the mailman after they all wear off and the house is clean l.
ug that would most likely overpower all of the rest imo you should take in between ug and ug depending on how strong a shrooms dose you'll take with it vial of liquid shrooms how much would that be in terms of grams of dried shrooms the mdma doses seem ok although honestly a booster dose may be unnecessary.
gardener on june pmkeep in mind that tails comes with a firewall set up to allow only tor traffic you will have to set this up manually if you decide to maintain your own ubuntu system tails is amnesiac and can be run from a dvd that way you are sure that when you boot your system you start a clean system as long as your original tails iso is safe and trustworthy this type of behavior isn't desirable on ubuntu since you want to keep your packages updated as soon as there's security updates firefox patches for security updates for any clearnet web browsing you may do over your vpn etc and these firewall rules wouldn't allow ubuntu to check for security updates plus unless you configured your iptables firewall just right your vpn couldn't connect either if you are ultra paranoid you can actually replicate the amnesiac ness of tails like this you can basically install ubuntu in a vm update all packages tweak everything just the way you like it plus if you're going to run a double vpn get your certs or your mullvad client etc set up now harden firefox for any clearnet web browsing harden your tor browser for any clearnet web browsing but don't visit any sites on either of these yet then take a snapshot now a would be attacker has a near zero attack surface against your tor browser or firefox unless they had a zero day exploit for it with turning javascript off in tor browser this pretty much eliminates of their attack surface and if you have good web hygiene with noscript in firefox and also have flash disabled this also eliminates most of a would be attacker's attack surface now the best part is that you can revert to your snapshot every time you close your vm whenever there are any security updates for ubuntu firefox or tor browser install your updates without visiting any other websites while the update is installing then take a new vm snapshot after the update is done you now have what's basically an amnesiac system that reverts to a clean and secure state every time you start it bookmarks are a pain in the ass doing things this way but if you are crafty you can export your bookmarks to a vm folder share then when you start your vm again to your most recent snapshot you can import your bookmarks and snapshot it again it would be incredibly difficult for the feds to compromise your vm this way even with a zero day drive by download exploit against firefox on ubuntu or tor browser since you would just revert to a fresh start again the next time you started your vm  gardener on june pma vpn will hide the fact that you use tor from your isp don't expect any more protection if the cops want to get you they will get you wanna be sure you won't do the time don't do the crime i completely disagree that the cops can get you if you use a good vpn the mullvad servers in sweden are some of the most hardened commercial vpn servers in the world vpns not to use include are hidemyass that comes first to mind they collect logs and say this up front in their log policy and they gave the feds logs that got a lulzsec member arrested to use well lets just talk about mullvad for a minute mullvad is run by some of the most badass computer security professionals in the entire vpn industry back when the heartbleed vulnerability was publicly disclosed in april of one of the mullvad co founders was one of the first people to set up a test openvpn server successfully steal the ssl private keys from it also patched their vpn servers as soon as the openssl patches for heartbleed were out the are headquartered in sweden and are under no obligation to any gag orders or court orders to the united states government to reveal any information about their users in fact mullvad has actually gotten user information requests before and here is how they responded taken from  what steps are taken when a valid court order requires your company to identify an active user of your service has this ever happened  we get requests from governments from time to time they never get any information about our users we make sure not to store sensitive information that can be tied to publicly available information so that we have nothing to give out we believe it is not possible in swedish law to construct a court order that would compel us to actually give out information about our users not that we would anyway we started this service for political reasons and would rather discontinue it than having it work against its purpose not only do they not keep logs but it's probably not possible under swedish law for them to be court ordered to turn over information about users and they don't keep logs or any personally identifiable information anyways your account id is literally a numeric id and that's it there isn't even any place to give an email address when you sign up and what they mean by we would rather discontinue it than having it work against its purpose is that they'd rather pull a lavabit if they were ever going to be legally forced to decrypt traffic or turn over user information lavabit was edward snowden's personal email provider they were based in the usa and a usa court ordered them to turn over their ssl private keys so that the government could decrypt ssl tls traffic to the lavabit servers and the lavabit owner decided to shut down the entire service rather than comply the mullvad sweden servers would almost certainly be the most secure ones since they are in mullvad's home country and when the mullvad writer here is referring to servers they've assembled and configured themselves and that are in data centers with ambitious physical security this would almost certainly include the sweden one  do you have physical control over your vpn servers and network or are they outsourced and hosted by a third party if so which ones where are your servers located  we have a range of servers from on one end servers lovingly assembled and configured by us with ambitious physical security in data centers owned and operated by people we trust personally and whose ideology we like on the other end rented hardware in big data centers which to use depends on the threat model and performance requirements currently we have servers hosted by glesys internet services services and leaseweb in sweden the netherlands usa and germany they are very clear about their no logging policy and say this up front can also pay them in bitcoins they even accept cash in the mail and possibly one of the best parts why mullvad is x superior to any other vpn provider for linux is because mullvad has its own client for ubuntu debian that has a kill switch built in to it so with this kill switch if your vpn connection ever drops the mullvad client stops all network traffic for dnm ops you absolutely do not want your tor traffic leaking out if your vpn ever drops and the mullvad client prevents this information leakage from happening gleeful you'll still want your vpn besides just tor browser on ubuntu so to install mullvad find the linux download on the mullvad website under the downloads page at and install it with quotesudo dpkg i mullvad all deb then install the dependencies with quotesudo apt get f installnow you can run either mullvad from the command line or easier yet find the gui icon pin it to your ubuntu taskbar and you can run it in one click from there now just installing the client gives you a hour trial period to test it with if you want to play with it first.
wilderness on june amnice thanks friends loving agora atm as for any other market place i dont use any off them aprt from agora.
why is it called apple market why should i be interested in apple market over all the others.
we decided to do ug since that's how the tabs work out yes i will be reporting back in a month actually.
yes i'm keeping that.
well it would be best to customize the forum to set it off by default yeah but a quick simple workaround in the mean time would be to just run this query every so often to shut it off for everybody all at once update smf members set show online this could be done from a cron job to run every minutes a la someuser mysql u sqlusername ppassword dbname e 'update smf members set show online.

unit on may ami deposited into my agora account on around pm i sit here on may th at pm days after my deposit and nothing has shown in my agora account one would hope that with such a big deposit agora support might respond to messages however they have yet to respond to the messages i have sent with just questions regarding deposits they said withdraws are fixed however they are working on deposits i hope agora comes through on this and doesn't drop the ball depositting btc shouldn't be the scary thing about the dnm the mailing of drug should be however i sit here scared worried confused and very irritated at the very simple transaction of btc to my account i hope agora fixes this soon as well because if a normal order takes weeks after vendor sends out package i am looking at a solid month on one order this is sad and not what customers pay commission to see the one positive you can look at is they fixed withdrawls first while that may be frustrating towards your situation and i can see why with that much money but in terms of a market doing an exit scam it wouldn't make sense for them to let vendors withdraw their coins scidm.

begin pgp signed message hash sha in the pgp program you are using there should be an option under one of the tabs to back up keys use that option to save a text file of both your public and private keys as far as i know you cannot change the email address on a key you will have to generate a new one during the creation of that key the program should ask you if you would like to email a backup of you keys i recommend you do once you have the key file i suggest saving it in more than one place since im almost positive it was my thread you were working with ill try and explain this better some of what your confusion is i think is with the terminology the signature in my post refers to the text links at the bottom of this post see the links there are of them vendor page review page and pgp key if you cut and paste those links into your address bar it will take you to those individual pages where ive posted that info this is not to be confused with a pgp signature the pgp signature was generated with my pgp keys on creation it allows me to sign a message other users that have my pgp public key can use that to verify that the message was in fact created by the owner of the public key the message has not been changed or edited from the original content i will sign this message and include my public key from there you can copy and paste the whole message to your decryption clipboard and use the verify function to see that it was indeed me that created this post after you do that try this copy and paste the message to the clip board just as you did previously except this time pick a random word in here and delete it because the content was edited when you verify it you will receive a different message with a standard message if you receive that error message you can now confirm or suspect that either the post was not made by the person claiming to have written it or the original content of the message had been changed which is what happened when i edited my vendor op hopefull this helps some nonya begin pgp public key block sez bmgjthow aqltnjxpxnhq ka ha jl sswr ggcttgtsbqpkex sfi hb mjtnn rel m bvor l h h kv xd vpdeltg put gfr u pv xer ful hzrr jtw iuxwgbmt uaxy t itzvp j wrgcb xnq wq r thz z vtsfandwtiwkrw krjsm ustwj fdwmr qavjpj ddy jdmi m dmznabebaag i vbnlhidxob yuj c iqe bbmbcgahbqjti tnmh rg pvoxbpx jt jdthotr jmblibkhq btodj ryooclwbl xlsc tpbiysdffndc q vuvazvjmza enb werjh kfl pgykl txdl hab jhzr vft x v qarp ocd nbfeqzffj mwhcwenyuf gjg y svlrb pzvyju fb ub q cv rgkrvukk oerrym j m vcosyackolp cehrerrsw mdr pn u ja jaounemtyt kees jd ukud aq eu ujkaeiaklyk avmvirf l to o tdcsu avklzfc zyjfywz eig vkot cmjbe dmycoir cmiki nals o fiigy shed dxdfqrpq tvlqu bk ob tes triy jhqjulqx kd xn p xninfwlk zkgby fppkq n zyqe v mvoxbmwvwuby fgkleayt udr nj ybindxkllo v wmg udq yv xu buloy hsysrg rmo u pyke ucpwmi cj ic rrcapbo mfxng f mocc raq gvnte rlynrafvj jm lbh wqjgpubl d rrkfe tp rv n np ngsyixeprpvy yh i rrgntadg mz fblzkg epos zwuqjz bjvs untphjxjry ge pyhhpe ucmqt nfq z h e up sw w eq uhdd vec g yn janno y z ihjt ip rgcc zahzsyiahqj b dlle end pgp public key block begin pgp signature version gnupg v mingw v iajs b nih nhfkexp v ignc mfvs jevilwtql pz goeg fejxt t p vi toluk whfhtavcb iftztzhh nlozb x jpflxlemom b ixgi ttnejfepzbldo qwlacziynvpz beg vj mx yuqknqfwexqv wxg cs b mdrparkgd t un sgt bi zplytaqk dqyiq ic jiqbi jggxhptsi pt hvwxuogv uo ff m wqocrm kqjjvabzfk mphg end pgp signature.
cosmic consciousness on april amquote from throwaway account on april amwell evolution abraxas and middle earth were not run by carders as far as we know but they exit scammed ab is the biggest market right now and everyone who got phished is complaining maybe there are some real problems and bugs going on but i don't see any other market who constantly improve things in favor of their customers they improved their security and always adding features what i see is other markets constantly bashing ab to get bad reputation and i think they won't exit scam just because they're carders they need the community they created i'll correct you real quick evolution was known to be run by carders middle earth and abraxas we have no idea as to what sort of nefarious characters ran those both of which burned me a combined k buthey thats what you get as part of operating in the space it's in the nature of the elements yeah you're correct my mistake i haven't used it much though so i don't remember if they had carding section however my argument was that carders or not does not change much we don't know who we are dealing with either way.
ironically i just posted in the mdma section i was looking for a vendor of mdma for personal amounts g and i'd love to sample yours before buying please pm me details my key is on my signature you can check my recent commitments to samples with zicot and sirlucy and see i always make good on a full deep trip report in a timely manner thank you.
pretty sure agora is number one i'm sure every one of these sites is crawling with cops working very hard to find anything i'm sure the fbi geeks have the biggest case of blue balls and the women with a nasty yeast infection trying to find the server if they only knewits in the alamo.
hey guys if anyone know the tails os good enough to give a concise step by step guide on how to encrypt a message without posting a link to the tails website or reddit post i would be forever greatful thanks in advance.
when i try to decrpyt a message i get this error decryption failed secret key not available i'm using a key a created myself in tails then saved to a usb flash stick any ideas what's wrong.
i plan on checking it out where are most of the vendors shipping from do they have a decent selection.
dhl is great see you on the forums.
dardush on february amis it just me or does this market looks exactly like evo the evo code is an open source code many markets copy that code today check out real deal market it even looks exactly like evo i mean they didnt even bother to slightly modify the colors and layout.
guys hi i m a noob here yet plz does any body knows an active seller in brazil or some markets from brazil.
check out reddit in the dnm's thread there is a warning up now i use ab on occasion although everything is encrypted so i am not worried treat everyone asif they could be le and you will be fineedit in terms of an ab exit scam i feel like its inevitable what are the other possible conclusions to the ab story it wont last forever so do they scam or do they bow out gracefully and give all vendors and users their money i would hope to say option but they really dont seem like the kind of group to do that my tip always keep your coin in cold storage offline no matter what even if it takes mins to process each transaction take your coins with you when you leave.
im not sure on this so i don't expect any reward or anything but can't you just sell your btc through local bitcoins it's anonymous that way as you'd be getting cash for btc and also you can typically charge more per btc than any of the other exchanges if you live in a particularly small city i think you can also accept moneypak.
oh thanks for clearing that up thought i was going mad nice to see some of then old names from sr on here.
i was on aa hour or so ago with no problems this happens from time to time with them.
the following information is advice it comes from sources irl and my own thoughts use common sense when reading i am just relaying the information if it does not apply to you or you cannot do it well then skip it these are some general methods to hide your identity or at least your regional writing identifiers especially if english is not your primary language there is no reason not to do this if you are able terminology slang word choice and spelling vary tremendously around the globe and over short distances within english use universal terms if you can currency units of measurement and references to common objects or actions should be watched closely besides cultural references what is the area you make toilet in called depends on where you are greetings and farewells also tend to be regional drug slang it should be obvious is regional use what the community generally uses even if it sounds odd word check everything you can pick from british or american standard based on what program you use become friends with a thesaurus if you use a word commonly use a synonym instead read blogs or personal websites from english speaking countries take the speech of the native speakers and use it grammar and syntax give distinct patterns but usually require more writing samples to analyze punctuation usage of an exclamation point comma and emoticons should be watched do you write like this or maybe like this how about this one pay attention to these things your spacing sentence and paragraph pattern too do you write very long sentences that could be broken up into little sentences but instead tend to keep going on and on then finally end then a small one next that is a pattern even if you vary all your other identifiers most people miss this i would advise against writing in a completely different style every time you will make mistakes that will show you are giving false information and then that information will be ignored for recurring patterns these patterns left will be your native patterns it takes less writing samples to cross check than most think better to be consistent pick a style and stick with it establish and maintain false patterns that will be confused with true ones last do not fall into your false patterns irl or outside of tor any other general ideas.

vanilla reload moneygram are they like washing btc or just like a ewallet but bank option is connected to your real name if cash isnt optional random person buys btc through local with bank and send it to helix and from helix to another helix then to market would that work sorry for all these newbie question.

knuckles on august pmquote from sillywabbit on august pmfuck the centralized markets man trusted vendor boutique sites and email forum direct trades is the onlyway to go with any kind of assurance that your coin or identity is not being compromised for all we know every market is run by leo or their informants i was just coming in here to say this i have no problem sending money upfront to trust worthy vendors hopefully direct transactions like that are both a security benefit to sellers and buyers i prefer forums like tmg to deal with vendors i like it too but i also like dealing with active marketplaces where it's easier for buyer to find me that being said i'm on abraxas and link.
greetings majestic garden community acropolis market is having a fee free period th prior to bicycle day and the issue is lack of lsd vendors on our marketwe are reaching out to quality lsd vendors who wish to take part in this market event we are of course offering fee waived vendor accounts to established vendors join up with a referral and message admin to secure your shop front on acropolis market hope to see you there all the best acropolis market admin.
also inform people who you had sensitive conversations with about the leak and give them your new pubkey if you only leaked it on this forum maybe the admins can see howmany people opened the page it was on so you can assess how serious it is was.
just saw this god damnit can't say im not surprised.
op more than likely you sent coins to an incorrect address you gotta be on your toes and please stop spreading fud what you're saying is a completely ridiculous statement agora is tops right up there with bmr and backopy falco.
would this method be sufficient lbc wallet clearnet multibit wallet clearnet helix or bitblender dnm.

import a vendor's public key copy the vendor's public key into the clipboard left click on the clipboard icon on the top right tails menu bar and select manage keys maximize the new window that pops up on the passwords and keys windows select gnupg keys type ctrl v or do edit paste from the menu bar for that window a window should pop up with the vendor's pgp id click on import if you get a pop up with the following error could not display 'clipboard text'reason unrecognized or unsupported data there was a formatting problem with the key you copied into the clipboard make sure that you are copying all of the key including the five dashes at the beginning and end of the key and the begin and end statements pgp is very picky about formatting errors.
i used to go on r darknetmarkets for a month or two it was a opsec fuck up and i'll admit that i've since deleted my reddit account but i'm still not sure wether i can ever recover from that opsec blunder i used a fake persona and told many lies on there and never made a single order while i had a reddit account so maybe i discreditted myself to le as just some teenage kid telling lies to seem cool on the internet but i'm still not sure wether my opsec will ever recover from that my advice to everyone is stay away from there as for grammar come on guys this place is supposed to be different from the clearnet we're all supposed to spread love not be grammar nazi's and argue like the fools on reddit as long as the message intended to be sent is recived i really don't see the big deal.
thereon thereupon it doesn't matter beacuse those words have no meaning i didn't imply it meant like i wrote it is the equivalent of the use of the word like like you know if you were trying to make a clear arguement you failed which was my arguement in the beginning and is now.
interesting when i wrote the word that has been replaced i got the following error message the following error or errors occurred while posting this message you are using forbidden words please improve your language it is d r e a m m a r k e t check it out.
i deleted your post might be a good idea to create a new key and only post the public key next time.
the following gives an approximation of the general time line of lsd mushrooms mushroom tincture and mdma effects from oral ingestion hour a o ps pe s b lsd i i i i i i i i i i i i i a o ps pe s b mush i i i i i i i i i i i i i a o ps pe s b tinc i i i i i i i i i i i i i a o ps pe s b mdma i i i i i i i i i i i i ia administration of substanceo onsetps peak startpe peak ends stability of trip rollb baselinethe timing is usually set up so all substances reach the point s at the same time to maximize synergy and minimize extending the time from the initial a to the final b so lsd then mushrooms then mdma redosing mdma within hours at most with your dosage ug lsd should dominate over the mushroom tincture but the mdma dosage sounds good unless there is tolerance sounds like it will be a good time either way.
i was going to order mushrooms from them on alphabay and started running into all kinds of negative reviews i figure i would find the opposite since they require fe but now that i read this post i'm staying away from them thank you for spreading the word.
hi gang daytripper and others waiting did anything arrive yet wanting to order same next day shipout looks sounds great but we have a time limit if it actually takes two weeks there'll be a bunch of disappointed people somebody please tell me some good news l.
knuckles on october pmi'm still iffy on meo its decent less manic and more clear headed but mxe really gives that euphoria something meo lacks in i thought meo was supposed to last longer but it seems about the same length as mxe although one day on meo it gave me a shitload of energy but this chemical is so odd that everytime i've taken it its always been a bit different in what it does completely agree everytime i take it it's different and it doesn't have the sensational euphoria that mxe provides it's a shame i mean it's enjoyable but i don't know there just seems to be more confusion but i think that's because it's just that dose dependant tbh when i did mg precisely measured and mg an hour later i had a clear headed good euphoric experience in fact i got news during it that my grandma had passed away and it was just rather spiritual at that point other people had texted me at the same time as well all in a serendipitous fashion nothing relating to my grandma but people important to me never the less and it just was unreal all just a coincidence though and a bit off topic if i wanted to use volumetric dosing with meo pcp i think i would do mg diluted in vodka at at ratio so that each cc would hold mg and cc would provide me with precisely mg is that essentially what you where describing but with only mg at a time.
you could try right here on the majestic garden go check the vendor section i think we have a few people selling cannabis make sure you know pgp nothing is safe stuff can always get intercepted bad vendor lost mail etc all your other questions i can't help you with other markets to try nucleus earth.
i really appreciate it what would be a really good place for a new person like me to start buying stuff from here like im really into cannabis and i live in the extreme south coast so i am unsure if anything is safe to order on here or not hmm i also heard that you shoudn't order anything to be sent to your address why is that is this true where should i have my stuff sent to what is your most reliable place how many times have you made a transaction sorry for all the questions these are just things i really want to know.
please stay away from markets under ddos attacks or suffered such attacks there is a technique that forces a server to enter a insecure circuit a circuit made entirely from dickbleedable nodes by constantly ddosing it here is a good read from the tor dev forums warning clearnet.
es okay thanks for the info it kind of spooked me out yesterday jf there is no such thing as we love avengers marketplace the word has just been put in there by the admins to stop someone from spamming this place the original reference was to d r e a m m a r k e t.

well this suckscheers s.
currently waiting on btc for the past days now myself this is naturally worrying of course and i would not be worried at all if agora could just answer my support message which they haven't over the past days but i guess this is the name of the game and if you deposit money you cannot afford to lose into a dnm well that's exactly what you shouldn't do really just hope they get back to me soon even a little ''don't worry we'll sort it for you eventually in coming time'' would make me a happy man because i trust agora but i'd prefer a wee little bit of communication over a weeks period anyone else have an update on anything lepp.
hahahahaahahha i saw a picture of him good luck in jail or not getting hurt from anyone maybe this will be a lesson to the others however i do wonder if he has information saved from sheep in order to get a lesser sentence here's some info on the arrest notes about the translation the article is a bit confused mixing narratives together mixing official sheep market narrative meaning someone external stole it with tom s official narrative i had nothing to do with it it was on my server by acciddent and with police story he has the money we proved it it also doesn t really mention it was darknet marketplace with drugs it only mentions that it was an online marketplace and it says that tom was the hacker that stole the money but again it s a confused article in general so at times it doesn t make that much sense i think that s because the reporter didn t really follow the case that well and mixed stuff together anyway let s do this how the bitcoins were laundered millions from abroad a house written on granddad note this idiom written on somebody means in czech officially owned by officially done by as in officially granddad owned it police officers blocked house costing million czech crowns bought by czech programmer for suspicious bitcoins note all amounts are in czech crowns million is eur usd million is eur usd czech from hodonin city in czech rep area is being investigated for stealing money from online market from which million czech crowns disappeared czech criminals are increasingly using the virtual currency for saving their gains say ministry of finance dirty money house villa in lu ice a small town is according to police a proceed of crime it was supposedly used for laundering dirty money that s why police seized it last year in january a new bank account of years old eva barto ov had a payment that made air bank czech bank safety controls flash an idiom almost thousand crowns from a foreign company that exchanges virtual bitcoins into real money the young woman could not credibly explain to the bank officers the source of the money only additional investigation revealed that millions already went using this road and that behind it was a certain tom ji ikovsk that was connected by amateur internet investigators with stealing money from web marketplace sheep marketplace where people traded in large numbers with the bitcoin currecy the damage was described by the operators of the marketplace as more than million my note to the above as i said the article is confused according to hn short for the news name hospod sk noviny police officers seized his house near hodon n that he bought for bitcoins and that he wrote on his granddad the case is in a phase where we cannot comment told petra vedrov a police spokesman for south moravian district profesor signed grandson paidthe story can however be reconstructed from documents saved on cadaster note i don t know how is it in other countries in czech we have a cadaster with information about real estate ownership and it s perhaps suprisingly public and open according to the decree about seizing the house with a pool and garden in the town of lu ice the police officers wrote that the programmer ji ikovsk and his wife eva barto ov note the girl from earlier from laundering dirty money the million that was used to buy the house can be from the funds stolen from sheep marketplace your money our provisions all were stolen wrote the operators of the marketplace on their web not long before they had to close it two years ago they thought that someone found an error in the system and took bitcoins according to the exchange rate at the time around millions my note again they are confused and keep on writing that sheep was some legit online marketplace and tom is the hacker that stole money from it the officers of ministry of finance s financial analytical office that are detecting suspicious transactions mapped how the ji ikovsk s money travelled they first left from the abroad company bitstamp limited that is selling and buying bitcoins the millions then arrived with several transactions either on the account of ji ikovsk and barto ov or on the account of the real estate company and the lawyer that worked on the house sale part of the money went to the original owner of the house another part of the money went on her bank as one time payment of a mortgage the house is however in the cadaster written on jan goli a granddad of ji ikovsk that added no money to the transaction that it was just an effort to conceal the real owner is demonstrated by the police by the fact that ji ikovsk was the one that insured the house the real estate properties were fully paid by the finances acquired by the transactions of the virtual currency bitcoin say the detectives ji ikovsk according to bank data took thousand czech crowns in cash from bank again from bitcoin the mobile number that was used by ji ikovsk before is owned by somebody else hn tried to contact his wife through facebook but without a reply and his granddad goli was not available in his office on mendelev university on this university the yeat old professor works as a renowned expert on fruit production note the next two paragraphs are very confusingly ji ikovsk never talked publicly at the time of the sheep marketplace affair he made an announcement that he only allowed the so called webhosting meaning that for money he allowed place and service for other internet pages even a website that a fans of sheep marketplace made but he had nothing to do with the market when ji ikovsk found in the fall that the web is illegal he turned it off he did not expand on why it would be illegal but it could have something with drug selling that people today sometimes buy with bitcoins key question the money originbecause of the police silence we cannot tell how deep are the police officers in the case if they only investigate money laundering or if they want ji ikovsk for his role in stealing money from the marketplace they should because so called legalization of procceeds of crime can only be proven if the police officers clearly name the exact crime where the dirty money comes from in the past the detectives thought that they are on a trace of billion laundering in prague exchange they stopped the investigation of the owners they couldn t prove that the money were dirty not sure if they are talking about btc exchange probably not the money is too big for that and this paragraph is kinda irrelevant the worldwide trend of dirty money ending in bitcoin more and more is confirmed by the ministry of finance specialists we detected a growth of suspicious trades where the gains from criminal activity end up in virtual currency warned last year annual report of financial analytical office end full details about the sheep marketplace scam can be found here among some other details this was the owner of sheep that turned out to be the real person behind the market in dec during a media interview thomas denied being the person responsible for the sheep marketplace scam thomas was never arrested until know even though that his name details were well known and reported to the czech police soon after the scam.
ipgmail or opengp work.
sorry if this is a noob question but is it safe to access electrum org through tor i have coin poss linked to my identity that i want to tumble around but would like to avoid fog if possible just because it seems sketchy to me however if there is no other safe option i will use fog any way i could send them from a wallet currently linked to my id to another wallet created and only accessed through tor and repeat this times with throwaway wallets then to my vendor of choice hehe idk any advice is truly appreciated peace mrs b.
it seems that while everyone else has begun receiving deposits again mine has not turned up yet quite concerning it was sent from my middle earth wallet which reads confirmations does this suggest it was not withdrawn properly or is it more likely to be a deposit problem on agora can i check blockchain for the transaction.
well in my case it had nothing to do with agora deposits it was because me marketplace had locked my funds preventing withdrawl because i broke a rule by withdrawing my funds without making a purchase although they were very quick in releasing them once i'd explained the situation but it makes me wary of depositing btc there again.
lobster on november pmquote from darcm on november ameverything was okay in the end just got a bit worried there for a moment pso what happened you had to go pay postage at the post office is this a normal occurence and finally is it frowned upon when a vendor does this yeah i had to go receive the package at the post office no this is absolutely not normal and yes it is completely frowned upo.
attempt by whom it looks like some search replace has been played here what was the original word that has been replaced i don t quite remember is it just me who thinks that s strange.
i'm not exactly an expert but i would probably go with blockchain info if forced to use an online wallet it also has an onion address but i don't have it handy but i think it is worth the extra effort to get tails electrum set up if only to nullify the risk of your online wallet becoming compromised that can't really happen with offline storage and with the regeneration seeds you're still not sol if your disk becomes damaged without a backup like you would be if your online wallet decided to exit as far as mixing tumbling goes it's not really necessary as long as the coins were purchased without any connection to your identity there's arguably less risk when doing direct deals compared to sending to a known dnm address but i personally will continue to tumble because is worth it to me for the added peace of mind although there is always the possibility that the tumbling service could run with your coins probably not a cut and dry answer.
this is super coo.
another option is to use a service like purse io you trade your bitcoins to a person who uses their money to buy you something from amazon you get the privacy benefits plus a discount on items because people are willing to pay a premium for btc i've never tried it but it's something to look into.
pot is my favorite drug but i don't really consider it a drug lol still haven't smoked in almost a year due to bs legal issues.
play a little bit with the electrum btc wallet u find inside tail.
i don't think i've ever seen a market act like eic they seemed so legit to me site was clean functional and responsive then all of a sudden the admins went dark i can't for the life of me figure out why they are still live with the withdrawals and deposits not working it's a very situation indeed definitely do not put any btc into the site until everything is functional even if does become functional again i would proceed very cautiously.
woopieg on july pmwhat an amazing discussion after reading everyone's posts i thought i would mention something that may have been overlooked here's a disclaimer i'm sure everyone at mullvad are spot on in what they believe in when it comes to privacy and with what they're trying to accomplish at mullvad and i am in no way doubting that at all i'm only looking to disseminate information and perhaps my humble opinions sweden is one of the eyes and mullvad being a swedish company with their home servers located in sweden operates in the land of the eyes and i've always stayed away from all vpn providers that operate out of any of the eyes countries whether they have a strong association or a weak alliance with the american nsa countries that make up the eyes are not privacy friendly and i would only use vpn services and vpn servers located outside of the land of the eyes here's something about the eyes for those who might be interested wonder which is more risky using a company that resides in the lower tier of the eyes but has an excellent reputation ie mullvad using a less well known vpn in a country that isn't part of the eyes but may or may not log you and give you up if they are asked.
nice thanks friends.
i had no issues sending coin to agora or placing orders withdrawing my coins.
there are many reports of helix not releasing the coins wonder whats up there and sigaint has been having network issues lately.
all vpns and proxys will do is hide the fact from your service provider that you use tor if you aren't concerned about anyone finding out you use tor then you'll be fine.
for info dnm adopting monero xmr altcoin th august alphabay and oasis the biggest darknet markets are discussing xmr implementation august oasis confirms xmr implementation no longer debating about it august sigaint and monero tor node enables a tor user to easily transact in monero using a thin client while securely maintaining the keys to their wallet on their computer all while not even exiting tor the sigaint operators firmly believe that monero is the next logical step in darknet commerce it solves most of the privacy problems that plague cryptocurrency systems such as bitcoin sigaint monero tor node.
rasputin on june pmwell in my case it had nothing to do with agora deposits it was because me marketplace had locked my funds preventing withdrawl because i broke a rule by withdrawing my funds without making a purchase although they were very quick in releasing them once i'd explained the situation but it makes me wary of depositing btc there again really i have moved funds btc in and out of agora since they opend up no problems why is this the first time i have heard about this cheers dolmi.
we're all doomed i am a new vendor with like in escrow.
so i buy it from local with cash or someone else pays non cash for another one he sends it from local to helix and then from helix to market sure thats enough or helix to another helix what if cash its not optional give me some couple of a to c options thank.
to op and the kind soul who pm'd me.
i did a grams search and the only nz vendor i saw was thunderjew on nucleus.
paulista on august pmtalking about maya special edition from value lucid i have to say this those are claimed to be ug and i had a very good time with them i had a couple of times half of them another couple times just a quarter and once the entire before discovering tmg i always bought from him and being the first time that i bought blotters on the dnm with clearly declared dosage such dosage seemed totally realistic though i recently had the occasion to try some swiss bliss ug from mr pickles and seeing the effect of those let alone the ug black amber that's a totally different story i'm more and more convinced that the maya s e are underdosed still extremely good acid but most probably in the ug range had also blotter from v l and her acid is weak in my opinion heavily underdosed not maya but just smile and some alex grey none was as advertised and imo none was as clean as u can find through tmg i personally would go with her just for stealth which i found to be nice peac.

on may pmi hope this isn't a silly question but is there an alternate url for ag i know a few other markets have given out alternate addresses since initially going down this last time i've only been able to log onto ag once since then and am not sure if i overlooked it or what i don't think there is according to lenged there used to be a link that only vendors could access but there definitely isn't one now.
i'm going to be out for awhile i'll pm you when i return i can try using my current and new key to see what the problem is thank you so much because what he said didn't make absolute sense at all it's just text how can one send a virus that way.
on february pmthe friendly admins have enabled the feature that allows us to opt out of appearing online when we are to do this go to profile account settings then uncheck the option that shows people you are online everyone do this here's some food for thought on why quotethis is because of all those fbi probability attacks they monitor when you activate tor when you log into sites like say this site if it is ever compromised or safe mail which announces to everybody when you are online and then present this incourt and it's apparently solid evidence because plenty of people like jeremony hammond of lulzsec fame got convicted through simple meta data this guy appeared on irc at this time we monitoredhis wifi signal yes they can pinpoint your wifi signal if under surveillance and he was using tor exactly the same time that's all it takes looks like the topic where you get this  should be pretty interesting and full of information can you paste the link tks for the tip.
glad to hear it worked out for you thanks for upping your opsec enjoy your stay let the forum know if you have any other question.
i have been using oasis recently its a great market and admins are very friendly its the only market that doesn't charge vendors thats pretty amazing not to mention they have all features of competing markets the ui is pretty nice too.
so i just woke up to the mailman at my door saying that i owe for a package to be delivered that the postage was due and he would be back by later today to drop the package and collect the moneyanyone have any experience with this.
mac some mac need refind installed to boot tails from a usb stick any mac with bit efi may not succeed in booting tails usb stick created by tails installer you can check if a given mac is bit or bit efi on that list macbook pro does not boot with tails in uefi mode macbook pro nvidia geforce m one must add the nouveau noaccel boot parameters so that the display works properly macbook air a emc freezes when booting tails in uefi mode macbook pro early fails to boot from dvd since tails mac pro tower and macbook pro both from early and macbook pro late fail to boot from a usb stick created by tails installer also.
zoxeebee on november amquote from nordicwhite on november amthank you both very much love you both thinkpad it is which of the series would be more advised for darknetmarket use the x or t also do thinkpads run on some form of windows os or do they come with some form of linux os pre installed apologies if question is noob most come with windows preinstalled but you can just wipe the hard drive and install linux yourself thinkpads are renowned for good linux compatibility list of models x and t are good choices x small portable t solid business laptop or main difference is indeed the size as far as i know love the x grabbed one for under some weeks ago including a year warranty if you have some bucks left get a msata ssd and you'll own a great device.
goodfornothing on april pmtmg is in a league of it's own and entirely different i meant commission taking escrow offering money handling markets of the risk your capital kind not this open honest trust based forum that asks nothing in return for letting people find each other and communicate freely glad to see you here gfn i remember you from sr as i was one of your first customers good person we decided the best way to work a marketplace is not to run one at all as tmg was created by the avengers it would be a conflict of interest trying to be the middle men in a transaction so it's trust based and we have only had a few troubles with vendors and even most those troubles were taken care of by other members and or eventually resolved by the vendor that dropped the ball even with escrow and multisig you need to place your trust in someone so we set up this forum for communication and allow you to gain trust in the vendor directly roo.
bonobo on june amdont think rc and stuff are really welcome around here there is an entire subforum here dedicated to rcs golden era sold aco dmt for g which would be allowed here his other three products are not allowed here but he wouldn't have been the first vendor to vend here who sold products not allowed here on other markets.
this trial should of been extremely highly publicized from everything that i read this makes it so that website owners can be held responsible for what their users do and yea the whole thing was rigged a mess.
this is why i love this community so much we start with a warning about some kind of danger and end up disscussing gramma also a small warning if you have a drastic style of speach or writing you leave a huge trace behind you that's why i often write as if i have multiple personality disorder ranging from an old british gent to a warlord brute.
on multisig haha xd it seems a bit complicated to me as well though but i want to be free from sending coins on market excrow mind you i dont order often just once in a while but that tends to be a medium large sized orde.
you can sign with electrum.
i would be weary of switching it sounds like it isn't an agora specific problem for opsec i would refrain from any markets at the moment much love halfpin.

is their anyway to contact the admins i forgot my password cause i really dont use the market much.
love is all around us on april amthanks only a total fool uses a mobile phone even with pgp for anything the least bit questionable.
aflaomarket serverlux me or to learn more if this group really finishes bitwasp it would be great for the community.
i've agree about it being relatively benign i haven't had any negative side effects tbh only positive and now i've switched to trying meo pcp which is much more powerful even my dollar scale doesn't do well enough a job of weighing precisely mg and i've been told take mg then mg an hour later for the best trip i did successfully do it once and it was wonderful extremely close to mxe but not as social not as enlightening much more superficial which i didn't dig very much too many people are capitalizing on the mxe drought right now that i don't trust any of these vendors selling out of india on abraxas but maybe someone will and i'll be able to go off their reviews.
i spoke of no phishing site but spamming and i have no idea what the site you mention is.
i'd have to say my problem child drug is alcohol for a while i was getting damn near black out drunk several times a week i don't get aggressive or anything on alcohol but if i'm experiencing tons of anxiety sadness in my daily life when sober i find that carries on into my drunken state and i wind up getting pretty severely depressed i've always loved how confident anxiety free alcohol has had the power to make it and that's what's always drawn me to it i had quit drinking entirely for a while after a very beautiful and insightful lsd trip but some due to some negative circumstances in my life i have since relapsed but i am gradually decreasing the amount that i drink i don't believe in total abstinence from anything that i enjoy so i may always enjoy a few drinks in moderation here or there i've dabbled in making some home brew in the past and i'd love to do it again but it would be very easy for me to get carried away when i have that much alcohol at my disposal.
i like nucleus middle earth i saw some kid was on middle earth at this coffee shop on his laptop those eagles they do look pretty harmless i wouldn't have known i'm setting up on black bank soon ootp is on there and a few other vendors i use feeling good about everything not agora we should have markets ideally so something for eeveryone but i'm trying to stay close to home if you know what i mean good luck markets.
all i really need is the great people of the garden although i do really like the look and feel of dhl and plan on making a couple select orders there pretty soon to get things i can only get there.
sending a tracking number without pgp is the equivalent of sending your address without pgp basically as bad as it gets you should let the vendor know to never do that again to anyone big fuck up.

humblebumble on september pmright forehead slap i guess my assumption was that those sites would be ssl encrypted usps tracking is indeed ssl encrypted should be noted that determined law enforcement agencies only need to control a single certificate authority that browsers accept by default to successfully conduct a mitm attack on it would surprise me if they did i'd use tails with js off.
nucleus seems to be where all my domestic sellers ar.
we love avengers is a darknet market with the main focus on a trustless payment system which makes it impossible for the vendors or the site staff to run away with bitcoins of the buyers here are the main features that distinguish we love avengers market from other darknet markets multi signature escrow between vendors and we love avengersfunds can only be accessed by the vendor after the buyer finalizes a transaction and can never be accessed by the site staff theft from either party is impossible no bitcoin depositsevery order has its unique bitcoin address similar to bitpay's or coinbase's payment system buyers have minutes to pay the order and do not have to wait for deposits to arrive payments are submitted to the vendor after confirmation and the vendor is then given h to accept or decline the order which transfers the funds into our multi signature escrow system or back to a refund address which the buyer provided no finalize earlywe do not support fe or partial escrow releases and we don't have to the multisignature escrow makes it impossible for the site staff or vendors to steal any bitcoins other search engine i p support bitmessage notifications optional auto delivery for digital goods high server uptimewe love avengers market registration link love avengersmkt rr nfg onion affiliate if you use a referral link you get a commisson fee and no registration bond for every vendor for a limited time only market link love avengersmkt rr nfg onio.

im terribly sorry if this is not the right place to ask but when the agora website told me to click a certain link for an invite it ended up not working i was wondering if someone here could help me perhaps thanks a lot and sorry again if this isn't a good place to ask.
lizard labs does ship to the us and if anyone wishes for an invite i have one for you.
in all my years of psychedelic exploration i have never come across the opportunity to try ald although i've read about it pretty extensively i would be so grateful for the opportunity to try some and share this rare experience with a close friend of course i would write a full review and trip report if you would be so kind to give me a chance to try a sample much lov.
strange so when you type it out in the text editor select copy and go to sign encrypt on the clipboard it does nothing yeah no problem really wish i could help you out man but i have no idea what the issue might be.
hey all made my first purchase on abraxas and i also fe d only because i have known the vendor for years everything was fine only thing i didnt like was the deposits have to confirm times before your acc is credited with btc cheers dolmi.
gleeful on june pmthanks i really appreciate it yw mullvad post coming in seconds i swear it's the easiest vpn to ever set up on ubuntu you just download it and run two commands to install it.
organix on march pmthey don't really have fa though many have requested it they have optional pgp login but you can't set it up so that no one can login without both password and pgp so its kind of weak i have to enter both my password and then a decrypted code.

he was recently banned i bought g and at this point it's an unknown substance he won't reply to any messages or anything either i have bought a marquis and mandelin test that are on the way to help identify what this substance might be at first i was worried i had shitload of nbome i tested mg and felt nothing i went ahead and smoked mg and blasted off into a stimulating euphoric extremely visual and actually very enjoyable experience with perfectly clear headspace i didn't feel once like i was at risk of death my heart rate and pressure remained normal although i was already on about mg of etizolam taken about hours before doing all this which who knows may have saved my life if i had od'd i smoked mg first and felt no visuals but even slightly likely placebo but since it wasn't nbome i felt safe doing another mg and bam wam i was gone to the moon and i didn't even finish smoking it the letters on my monitor where like i had just smacked my monitor and it went into boggle mode what i mean is it look like someone turned my monitor into a word i had tracers similar to when i had taken c c my guesses are that it's a c of some kind if i could just find out what i had i'd be happy because i love c's but the danger of not knowing is ever present im going to mail a sample to ecstasydata org and pay to have to analysed for all i know it's a mix of drugs although color and consistency are all perfect i did a tinfoil burn test and it turned yellow then dark red burgundy and eventually black which is alot like what mda does when burned on tinfoil and it smelled like mda but shit we're talking bout burning random hcl salts and freebases here a tinfoil test is not foolproof thank you for reading edit wanted to add that i didn't know mxe wasn't allowed here when i originally posted this will follow rules from now on.
organix on march pmare you talking about dream or nuc on nucleus they do that but on dream the pgp is optional i have asked how to make it a pgp required login and never got a reply from adminoops you are right i was actually thinking of dhl dream is the one where you just enter username captcha then decrypt sorry about my confusion.
the simplest pgp software is gpg usb ime it can be saved on a usb encrypted if you like although it doesn't have to be the software will make you a public key which you will give out to anyone who wishes to send you an encrypted message likewise you'll use other's public keys to encrypt messages to them encrypting a message will return you a big string of gobbledygook which can then be decrypted only by the holder of a corresponding private key gpg usb has some simple instructions wih it it's literally a few clicks of a mouse easy stuff.
you don't want to trust them to tumble your coins if they get seized or if the feds get an image of the server you're screwed see what happened to sr they had a tumbler but the feds won the coins and the databases they probably can correlate everything not to say that you can trust tumblers that don't do anything else than that not to be run by le or not to keep logs of each and every transaction.
there is no bigger fuckup name and shame is usually the rule in this case either way that vendor needs to get the message real strongly that he is being a real asshole.
you're a little late to the party dhl is already trying to capitolize on that i think we can do it better with less infrastructure we have a multisig system implemented here now in theory and all of the trusted vendors are here why would we want to pay a market to mediate the transactions when we have the resources trustworthy vendors to mediate ourselves aflao crypto srr is finishing bitwasp i asked for the amended lighthouse code be worked in so they have auction i have given all of the resources for vendors to get a vps and load whonix with amp so you can run a storefront forum or blog if you want to do some work help wizardx get the collective moved to tor and then we will work on a different phase of dn drugs it will go from the chemist to pgp signing for the vendors so people can tell quality and purity we were selling on the backend of the pms on thehive so there's no reason not to update it all and make the chemists players in the scene agian so the information isn't hoarded by a few and purity of product suffers thats what happened with the helio split i banter about opsec continuously and to make these changes happen everyone needs to be on the same albeit safe and secure playing field.
ask the tails forum i'm sure you will receive a response much faster.
i don't trust anymarket now that evo exited like they did prob agora gets my vote but i'm always quick in and quick out.
i'm reading for some macbooks they have wifi problems but it looks like it can be solved by getting a usb wifi adapte.

to my knowledge the vendor wasn't selling here.
i use grams regularly for the vendor reviews and btc services i never use it to actually search for things negative from shady vendors tends to disappear on the markets it does not on grams i also use it to verify pgp keys when possible.
fuck the centralized markets man trusted vendor boutique sites and email forum direct trades is the onlyway to go with any kind of assurance that your coin or identity is not being compromised for all we know every market is run by leo or their informants.
bruce on august pmquote from anon on august amthis place is really cool i just made an account and have been browsing the boards i too was expecting a market but honestly this is way better there's already a ton of markets this is a community exactly welcome to the garden i appreciate the welcome any advice for starting to join conversations.
abraxas vendor bond btci won't use abraxas simply because i don't trust them to have their site configured correctly see vendor bond btci won't use nucleus because i've seen all kinds of vendors saying crazy shit about them their site obviously requires javascript to display correctly check out their site without javascript it looks broken as fuck any market that relies on javascript i will never trust dhl vendor bond btci'm hesitant to use dhl because i don't like the ui i saw some reddit threads with people saying their code is basically evolution's code so it could be the same people though i don't think dhl looks much like evolution did they have very few vendors i think i'm not exactly familiar with how their vendor approval process works but seeing their site made me think it is not like that of a normal market some parts of their site look broken without javascript seriously who allows javascript while using tor alphabay vendor bond alphabay works great has a lot of nice features it's not the prettiest and it's run by people who are obviously ok with theft which is not a good sign at all but it works very well and it is a large market mem vendor bond btcmiddle earth marketplace looks good to me i was put off at first by their theme but after seeing the site i realized that does not really matter they have a lot of categories which is cool silkittie vendor bond btcsilkittie is a very nice looking market very clean ui i like it but it is mostly eu resident members pretty small to check it out see vendor bond btc i dont' recall hansa market looks nice and more like evolution than dhl does small userbase see.

ulbricht guilty in silk road online drug trafficking trialjury convicts on seven counts doesn't believe ulbricht was just the fall guy by joe mullin feb pm utcnew york a jury on wednesday convicted ross ulbricht on federal charges accusing him of being the mastermind behind the online drug bazaar silk road where hundreds of millions of dollars in illegal goods were traded before law enforcement shuttered the site in late the jury of twelve reached its guilty verdicts on all seven counts after deliberating less than four hours ulbricht faces up to life in prison he'll be sentenced at a separate proceeding in a few months the seven charges include three drug counts distributing or aiding and abetting the distribution of narcotics distributing narcotics or aiding and abetting distribution over the internet and conspiracy to violate narcotics laws he was also convicted on a fourth count of conspiracy to run a continuing criminal enterprise which involves supervising at least five other people in an organization in addition he was convicted on conspiracy charges for computer hacking distributing false identification and money laundering the verdict was handed up to us district judge katherine forrest in a manila envelope she gave it to her court clerk who read it out the judge then polled each juror asking them to verbally concur in the verdict as the verdict was read ulbricht's father kirk ulbricht held his head midway through the reading ulbricht turned to face his family and friends who filled about two rows of courtroom benches after it was read ulbricht was taken out of the room by the same two federal marshals who led him in each day of the trial it's not the end ulbricht's mother lyn ulbricht said to her son as he was escorted from the courtroom several other relatives in front rows simply shouted out a quick goodbye in the back of the gallery a supporter shouted ross is a hero the year old ulbricht who the authorities said made millions of dollars in commissions put on a brief defense of just three character witnesses during the three week criminal trial ulbricht's defense attorney joshua dratel told reporters gathered outside the courthouse that he plans to appeal dratel said the judge presiding over the trial hampered his defense by excluding evidence and witnesses a position echoed by the defendant's mother the defense was shackled she told reporters gathered outside the courthouse after the verdict it's not fair dratel didn't say much about the negotiations before the trial but he did say the government didn't make a meaningful offer that would have reduced ulbricht's possible sentence the trial proceeded over days spread over three weeks during closing arguments tuesday dratel told jurors that the data authorities seized from ulbricht's computer connecting him to the site could have been created by others the internet is not what it seems he told the six woman six man panel dratel has said his client who did not take the stand had created the site but was the fall guy for the site's real operators prosecutors countered dratel telling jurors there was a mountain of evidence that ulbricht was the dread pirate roberts thousands of pages of chats with silk road admins and other management documents were recovered from his open laptop there's no dispute when the defendant was arrested he was logged in as dread pirate roberts prosecutor serrin turner told jurors there were no little elves that put all of that evidence on the defendant's computer.
happygal on april amnot to mention the bug that was found just a few hours ago i hope any ab users have been using pgp because a bunch of users dox has just been found via unencrypted pm's that were made available to the public due to the bug i would be shitting myself right now if had unencrypted pm's on ab stay safe people hgreally thats interesting news where about did you read this i'd like to see into it more imo honestly speaking i vend only on alpha bay now that dhl gave me the boot for reasons i have yet to find out and i have not had a single problem with my coins gone missing or a withdrawal not being pushed through i get a good amount of orders from alpha and i have yet to have them pull a fast one at least on me that is i'd also say that they have by far the most sophisticated bitcoin server i have ever come across in the years i've operated on dnms the partial fe digit pin speed and the fragmenting withdrawals is pretty impressive i don't think they will go anywhere just yet i feel like sure they have shitty support but so does dhl i had to pulls ome fucking teeth to get my coins back from dhl it was a pain in the ass they canceled all the orders i offer full escrow support on after they locked me out of my account thats pretty bad you gotta admit it in fact that sucked who would do that cancel all escrow order after i had marked them shipped while locking me out yeah dhl has done me over worst than alpha bay so far that just my btc inpu.
be careful with bitcoinfog there is some indication they might be selectively scamming and their support has been absent for over a year helix seems like the new gold standard.

interesting thread i haven't purchased from any market for a while agora is always my main market but it has so many donwtimes atm it is difficult to use i think i will give middle earth an opportunity since some of my favourite vendors are there.
ive been using oasis regularly now it works amazin.
that's why a setup that leaves as little forensic evidence as possible is needed tails on a dvd is an option to consider you keep your computer clean add your private key to en encrypted usb partition that you can wipe easily in case you feel like it without having to wipe your hdd good luck and consider that a truster vendor could get caught and keep vending being le this did happen with fake ids this could and probably did also happen with drugs you don't seem like an high profile target though have a clean house and sleep well.
nicotine used to smoke and it gets me every once in a while hate the drug otherwise no real problem drugs.
it's not a forum setting for starters but it's a simple change in the forum code i don't know why they haven't done it yet.
thanks for adding hansa death to centralized markets.
doses lysergic on january amsimilarly the use of double negatives just obscures your true meaning unlike some of your other examples the double negative is far from being an anacronism and is widely used today not just in english but also in chinese french spanish and other major languages of course it can also be misused however i'm talking about english english not american english australian english etc the double negative is used to add greater emphasis to the statement it doesn't alter the logical meaning but it changes the emotional meaning that is it conveys additional information on the writer's strength of feelings about what they have written so for me dxuutx was saying i consider this especially significant but in a low key way which didn't impose his view on the reader in speech it would be possible to lay extra stress on the word significance and thus give the option of avoiding the double negatiive in online prose emboldening or italicising significance could achieve a similar effect but personally i think these should not be used unless necessary because of the possibility of text being copied and pasted into other applications notepad html editors social networking sites other forums etc where the mark up language would not be recognised maybe dxuutx could or should have avoided the double negative but that would be a choice of style not grammar or syntax the english as it stood was correct a search for the phrase not insignificant including the quotes finds somewhere between and results depending on the search engine which indicates that the phrase is in everyday use perhaps it comes down to different forms of english eg what is common and acceptable in england may be or unacceptable in the usa and vice versa it's something of a stereotype that english english abounds with often tinged with irony if jack swigert had been english the phrase would probably have been houston we've had a slight mishap here rather than houston we've had a problem here  doses lysergic on january amhistorically this use of language served as a separation between economic and racial classes no argument to your general polnt very broadly speaking england has been bilingual since the norman invasion of there was the norman french latin spoken by the new aristocracy and clergy and there was the older germanic anglo saxon spoken by the peasants writers such as chaucer and shakespeare helped bridge the gap and the invention of the printing press must have played a part but it wasn't until the late c th that the english caste system finally began to thaw yet even with all the changes of the last years the differences in vocabulary grammar syntax and pronunciation between the top level of the establishment and the average worker are so distinct that it only takes a couple of seconds and half a sentence to know which is which.
i'm still iffy on meo its decent less manic and more clear headed but mxe really gives that euphoria something meo lacks in i thought meo was supposed to last longer but it seems about the same length as mxe although one day on meo it gave me a shitload of energy but this chemical is so odd that everytime i've taken it its always been a bit different in what it does.

also the point of wearing a male wig hat and basically an entire disguise that shouldn't make you stand out but instead make you unrecognizable as your normal self even while under camera is because if you study the cd's on reddit the of them where people got caught without going to the counter is because the feds were waiting for them on the inside and knew already exactly what they looked like and so they apprehended the person inside the lobby after they grabbed the package or the feds knew what the person looked like and also knew what car the person drove and they approached and arrested the person after they got into their car with the package don't let this happen to you.

hi altcoin means alternative coin yes it is a different electronic currency so cloakcoin for example is a different thing than bitcoin the concept and way of working are the same except for the anonymity technics but these coins are not compatible so no you can't transfert bitcoin to a cloakcoin or monero wallet to get cloakcoin or an alternative currency you can buy directly the altcoin for cloak for example and ask the shop to send the cloak to a receiving address given by the cloak wallet installed on your computer or you can exchange bitcoins into cloakcoins on a free bittrex account you create an account you send bitcoins to your online bittrex account and then you buy cloakcoins or any other altcoin listed on bittrex with your btc then you can leave your cloak on your cloak bittrex online wallet or ask bittrex to send the cloakcoins to your home computer desktop cloak wallet bittrex and other exchanges seems difficult to use because of many infos graphs and numbers on the screen but not it's really easy don't be afraid cloak is the official shortened name of cloakcoin as btc is for bitcoin or xmr for monero for information today cloak is at a historical very low price good time to buy cloak costs btc this past few months the cloak price was in average btc for cloak so you can buy now and resell later on bittrex even if you don't use your cloak for anything else it should be an easy way to make money because the price of a cloak is going to rise again it was mid march about monero xmr the price is now btc for xmr the average price last few months was btc and it was btc end march i hope i helped don't hesitate to ask newbie question on monero are some really bad guys but most are very nice people who are going to kindly help you ask kind and nicely.
spirit on march pmquote from not ron paul on march amquote from dimitreez on march pmi agree oasis is pretty awesome it is a nice looking site it is designed well can someone explain the donation thing though so there is absolutely no fees that they demand its just what you feel like donating if so that sure is different and very respectable but i sure do hope that people are donating so they have the drive to stay legit and grow in popularity yes they are completely donation supported they require a bond for new vendors but they waive this for vendors that can confirm they are already established on other markets and the bond is returned to new vendors after orders listings and sales are completely free oasis does not take a percentage or fee for listings or sales we are donating of our sales to the market and we plan to continue doing that from what we can asses they do not need our donations to support maintain and continue to develop the market they plan to continue with or without significant vendor donations and sound like they are set up to do so we get the impression they know what they are doing we think we are good at recognizing these things we feel safe on this ship wow they don't take a or fee and they return excess coin to buyer's wallets how do they even make money they are fully donation supported the withdrawal page has a donation button next to the withdrawal button as we stated we don't think they need donations to fund and support oasis as a project if they are what they appear to be they are just doing this for free creating a free donation supported market because they believe there should be one and they can afford to create it.
would anyone mind dropping a link to middle earth i'm looking for a sight that has more reliability than agora which is unfortunate because i really like agora.
good idea lets get on it.
dhl is my new go to dnm i had a slight hick up with my st deposit but the admins resolved very quickly the ease of use security and the fact most vendors are currently offering free shipping should put this dnm on the top of their list they do have less vendors than the others but the ones vending are top notch and scams will be non existent quality not quantity.
you can sort of look at it as a place that you can come to discuss products vendors and other markets or anything else really hell a lot of vendors out there are on here daily it is a place where you can meet those vendors and their costumers and chat with them so that when you do decide to order you can order in confidence knowing that they have been vetted through the community this place really is magestic.

bbkf on february pmthe upgraded kernel is the same flavor of linux used by redhat which works very closely with the us government does this mean that you're concerned about there being something unsafe in the software because the u s government works with redhat the beauty of open source software is that security experts can and do pore over the code to make sure that there are no security issues that means that nobody can easily insert malicious code into the program without it being detected.
sillywabbit on february pmvery likely although from the rise of other markets the fact that evo and agora are still up and the further development of p p networks like bitmessage etci doubt they can do much to stop it deter yes but those who are top notch in their opsec and know how to make robust websites the only shot they have is to get in on the inside like they did agree the cats already out of the bag and le knows it and that's percisely the reason why le turns to scare tactics because they know they can't do anything about it legally at least but more and more bills keep being brought up that would allow le and the nsa to infringe on our rights even more and this also needs to be addressed and stopped.
thanks.
i can see domestic weed vendors doing it from borrowed wifi using tails and generally having bullet proof opsec no one cares about weed anymore like they did the vendors aren't really giving anything away except raising their profile a bit i used a vendor that advertised there no problems for the buyer though its probably ok to browse it if you must from a secondary device but don't post especially pictures i think that might be what's going on since every reviewthey want pix maybe watermarks or extra strings in the jpeg headers or something its the people buying from abroad big amounts of mdma that the le want and it sounds like halfof the people are on amphetamine selling mdma which is fine but dangerous weed is only as much penalty as mdma per gram federally in us with added for import and even legal decrim most places not hating on the hustle it should be somewhat mystery and not admitting to where you are how far from source etc a good review just say on tmg it got here and it was good deal then describe your experience r dnm doesn't do that it makes it all about documenting the persons drug deal i feel bad bro but fuck that then there's the smack n crack n meth reviews the place is like the skid row of the markets i swear because anyone can write on it with a phone and maybe wifi even if it isn't networked stay safe folks.
agora is fine atm.
goodfornothing on april pmquote from uncleal on april pmhere tmg is in a league of it's own and entirely different i meant commission taking escrow offering money handling markets of the risk your capital kind not this open honest trust based forum that asks nothing in return for letting people find each other and communicate freely and there's no risk of take down this isn't really a marketplace it's just a network there's nothing ilegal about this forum.
i'm actively avoiding the markets the only advantage markets have is escrow buying from a vendor directly here is like having to fe on the markets but you avoid having to send money to the market where you are susceptible to being phished or having the admins either take your cash directly or in an exit scam every day people are claiming that their money is being stolen on ab i think it's easier here to establish trust with a vendor and not to have to worry about a market being shut down and having your btc lost and having your orders in limbo if a vendor starts scamming here it's evident pretty quickly and people will just stop sending them their money long live tmg.
delicfriend on august amquote from bruce on august pmquote from anon on august amthis place is really cool i just made an account and have been browsing the boards i too was expecting a market but honestly this is way better there's already a ton of markets this is a community exactly welcome to the garden i appreciate the welcome any advice for starting to join conversations read get the feel for the different forums and ask questions if you need help with something shoot me a pm if you have any questions about opsec pgp etc.
moreau on january amquote from doses lysergic on january amlol speak english its not insignificant it is not not significant when you use a double negative you obscure your meaning ianae the post by dxuutx undoubtedly contains florid prose perhaps excessively and i appreciate your plea for simple english on internet forums it is usually more effective to have style enhance an argument rather than have the argument be a frame for displaying one's style however the use of the double negative in it's not insignificant is valid here before going further let's first correct the misquote so that the phrase regains its original meaning taken out of context as above the phrase implies the possessive sense of its eg people admired its not insignificant beauty whereas the original was it's an abbreviation of the verb it is yes i know at worst this is a common mistake and at best acceptable textspeak and generally is too small to be worth picking up on but your opening point is that dxuutx should speak english therefore introducing a grammatical error into your first  dxuutx's post unfairly helps your claim as to the phrase itself the double negative is an example of a figure of speech called litotes or more generally meiosis where something is deliberately played down or understated in order to increase its importance litotes is common in many languages both ancient and modern in europe it has a fine pedigree being found in homer's iliad ovld's metamorphoses and the epic poem beowulf logically it may be true that it's not insignificant has the same meaning as it's significant but litotes remains an acceptable way of emphasising a statement even to fowler who would certainly be sympathetic towards your desire for greater clarity a dictionary of modern english usage hw fowler various editions just saying a response requires more thought on my part get back to ya.
thanks for the link yes i saw the section i've never placed an direct order before so its still kinda sinking it no more going to markets and waiting for deposits and gettin' scamme.

it seems that tails provides email services anyone would have a comment regarding this oops sorry i misinterpreted this post here will secure the email service i will use not provide an email service.
apple market is too basic for me i couldn't see any filters for searching the product listings don't have the names of the vendors there doesn't seem to be a feedback facility i checked out one of their star vendors the star rating is from their grams profile there was no information about when they were last online and no sales history if it's still around in three months time i'll maybe take another look to see if there have been any improvements.
schuldig on may pmit is pre installed with vidalia and a torified browser called 'iceweasel' it should automatically open up when connected to the internet if not use the 'iceweasel' browser menu shortcut to get onto the road iceweasel opened up automatically for me up to tails version but i've had to use the shortcut in the last two versions and.

what pope says is spot on and that program is very good pop.
thanks for this looks like that helix link isn't working or maybe they're down right now.
no other way besides you should be switching up your bridges every week or two.
i dont understand what you meant by it being ugly but it looks pretty good and modern the search bar is just fine our usp is an improved user experience.
coldcuts on july pmquote from bl cksm th on july amquote from the hippie on july can be a real problem too little isn't enough and too much isn't enough glad i haven't done any in almost a year alcohol is my next one feel sort of proud not buying a six pack earlier with meth its never enough and the hangover is the worst my problem drugs is weed lolim kidding its not a drug and its not addictive but i think i'm addicted to the habit of smoking weed probably because i've been smoking every day to rolls for more than years and also the addiction can come because i mix tobacco with weed it might made me feel addicted to weed where it might be the nicotine that i crave i really don't know same boat i thought that weed and tobacco are a different drug this mix was called dope once only thing is that i've been doing this for the last years of my life and as offending as it may sound i find weed to be a drug worst than a drug even does not leave a mark really fast but it stains and the thing that it burns out like gas and gets consumed the fastest of all drugs that i know makes it even worst although it's my source of living and even if i find it similar to some medicine from time to time it's still a drug to me and the only one that i had problems with quiting it's fuckin hard from my point of view because my brain was feed with this since early age and it crystallized with this form of food i will always crave for it no matter what so if u wanna live a life with no cravings try to do drugs after the age of because the brain it's formed enough at that point to overcome what the hand and mouth couple might throw in love u guys keep spreading light sassnaps had liters of ketamine down my veins and muscles when i was a kid and probably fuckin grams on the nose don't feel like i've lost that much and also never felt that this dirty cheap way of getting out of the daily routine can be approached as a psychedelic it's a dissociative drug all the way let it be dirt there is nothing to be praised about it peace its weird with bud like allot of my stoner friends smoke all day literally they get mellow and everything is just groovy for them but i dont think they get high like i do i smoke whenever the fuk i feel to just get a lift it dont have to be allot just a couple pulls and it always works i've never had tolerance to weed bc i pace it out and if i feel tolereance i take a break and i prefer to only smoke when i am already chilling and can lay down if i want to if i smoked while or before having to deal with bills neighbor disputes or some drama it wouldfuck my and i'd feel like a bumbling retard golden rule of taking drugs take drugs only when ya have time to enjoy them then your chance of bad trip is minima.

what's the best and most trustworthy btc mixer out there right now bitcoinfog.
i've got a slow transfer outside of any market i just read on r bitcoin that there is company in the eu conducting a stress test its got the whole system running slow the issue may not be agora.
problem solved me had locked my funds because i withdrew without making any purchases funny that the whole agora deposit problem happened almost simultaneously i was convinced that was the issue.
hacking don't know dood pgp messages you need to know this download pgp get your keys read up on it maybe another member has a link to a quick tutorial but you need to learn how to encrypt your messages especially when your sending your address for orders.
it seems safe in that it's a no taint mixer that works and won't run away with your coins be careful if you want to use it for a lot of coins though better make a few smaller transactions use to addresses where the coins will be sent to as this really improve it's security as the fee is fixed it would be really easy to get back to the original transaction if you use only one address random time adds something too the guy that runs grams seems to be a greedy person maybe he logs everything and would give away all the information he haves if asked by le there is no way to know use more than one mixer if you need some real anonymity but remember that both mixers could be run by le buying alt and selling for new btc can be a way make your btc anonymous too another mixer that seems good is bitblender always cross check url of those site and send a small payment first to try if it works well good luck.
could that be the default setting knowing the list of currently online users is of no use really.
what would you say about simply using a mobile pgp program and using text messages.

chess on april pmi haven't logged on in a few months and i'm pretty noob at all of this anyway so i need your helpwelcome back  chess on april pm there are three drugs i want to try well two the other one i've had before lol shrooms lsd and cannabis now i've heard lsd is the easiest to ship securely and i already know a vendor i want to buy from as for cannabis i'm not sure how safe that is it can get pretty smelly and i figure it's much easier to get caught with it in the mail but am i wrong is there actually a safe way to ship that shit and receive it what about shrooms this is the safest way to import weed or quantities of shrooms greater than an ounce if you're a one man operation i'm just shamelessly copy pasting this from another post i made in the security forum fifteen minutes ago here one good benefit of using a p o box and use the usps ones because there are news articles online of the private ones opening people's weed packages and having the cops wait for them the next time they come to pick up is that if you source a male wig i'm assuming you're a guy a silly hat and get yourself a new pair of sunglasses and normal clothes when you do pickups try to use a one and if you park down the street because the feds may be watching for your car in a controlled delivery too they will probably never even realize it's you if you're doing your pickup also wear something long sleeved to cover up your tattoos if you have any get a po box large enough to fit your drug packages it's worth the money do not fuck with a small sized po box that forces you to get everything from the counter if you study cd stories on reddit you see that this is how of the people using po boxes get caught or would have got caught when they get a slip saying to go to the counter the other of the time the feds already knew what they looked like and were either waiting inside or outside a good disguise and parking your car down the street will go a long way this is really only if you're doing shit like importing mdma from a foreign country though for domestic acid letters they're never going to intercept them but i'd still park down the street and use a disguise unless in theory your acid vendor re uses his same shipping from address and the feds profiled that and now they knew you had a drug delivery and were waiting for you if you are doing this method above extra brownie points if you walk in with a large envelope they're free in the usps lobbies grab a stack there's even ones that have a piece of blank cardboard in the x brown envelope so it looks like there's some weight to it go ahead and just write some bullshit to from info on it and don't put stamps on it pretending like you have something to mail check your po box with the back turned to the windows and preferably get your po box at a lobby that has no cameras and has access and stuff your drug package inside your coat quickly without making sudden movements close your coat up close the box go drop your letter off in the inside of the building but not the counter with all the cameras use a drop box in the lobby and leave if you do your pickups at am am you should be able to spot if there's any feds in the parking lot which you could probably get away with this right under their noses but if you really wanted to be cautious you could come back every night and grab it when they're gone or just wait days also leave your cell phone at home if you need to be this cautious your male wig can be sourced from paid in cash amazon gift cards at barnes and noble or speedway the gas station or other stores in your area create a new amazon account for buying your sketchy things like this and ship it to a friend's house so there's no digital trail of you ever buying it also for your po box ask for signature confirmation and email delivery there's another form you'll have to fill out this is the same form that gives you street addressing as well this is worth it also street addressing lets you address your po box like this donald duck main st los angeles ca instead of donald duck main st po box los angeles ca the street addressed version looks more legitimate with signature confirmation you will sign an extra piece of paper and they will use the signature on that piece of paper to electronically fill out any pieces of mail that required signature confirmation totally worth it because you never want to have to go to the counter also there's vendors who only send registered mail they are very few but signature confirmation does not apply to these so get your shipping details before you buy your product for email delivery have a burner protonmail com email address they don't keep login logs and all email is encrypted on their server so they can't read it and decryption is done locally on your computer through javascript they're hosted in a nuclear bomb shelter feet below ground in switzerland and it's open source specifically just for this box or a dark net email address set up before ahead of time then when you get any packages that you didn't have tracking on letters won't count you will get an email notification cool huh also for buying lsd i recommend these same procedures and precautions as above just get a x po box since sometimes you may get large x sized priority envelope sized letters from acid vendors and you just need the stuff to fit in your box keep your acid drop and your weed shrooms drop as separate addresses  chess on april pm starting soon i'll be using tor within tails under a new username pass email etc is this enough are there other ways to keep safe i'll be storing shit on a usb and all this silk road lieutenant got de anonymized by the fbi because he didn't use a vpn before tor a vpn unless you're using a cash prepaid g hotspot or public wifi it's worth your life even if you're a small fish  chess on april pm bitcoins are something i never got the hang of i will be using a prepaid card to buy bitcoins how do you go about this and what do you use i've read the guides but i'm still pretty confused on the steps that and it has been a while lol i saw this post is from april nd but if you're still around pm me your pgp key and i can securely share a few good ways of buying bitcoins with you  chess on april pm lastly one of the markets i used to use and look at went down a while ago and hasn't come back up since so other than this site what mp do you use alphabay is a good starting point but if you've already found tmg then if you still need acid check out the lsd listings here in the vendor forum and the acid listings on dhl are good too or just don't even mess with this at all and just go straight to buying sheet ug gel tabs that are the bomb from not ron paul on oasis x gel tabs for if the gel tabs are out of stock try his liquid drops at ug for total that's a sheet basically i hope this helps i saw this post was from april nd but i hope you log back in and see it still.
take a look at the new members thread here you need to get going bruc.
tails on a usb disk is pretty good the only problem is that as the system partition is writable an attacker could tamper your system when using a dvd on each reboot you know that you have a clean system as long as you used a clean image when burning the cd you then can have an encrypted partition to store your files on a usb disk or a microsd you'd then have to open it manually and work with text files or manually link folders you'd need during your cession you can always have a better opsec tails on a dvd for internet access and a second offline computer to encrypt and decrypt documents software isolation or physical isolation to protect your tor process tor over vpn over anonymous wifi live dvd software isolation on top of some physical isolation on a system that can't be tampered with possibilities are endless it's up to you to decide if it's worth it or not if you're a small time buyer don't worry tails is pretty good as it is if you have fun working your opsec up are a paranoid geek or a high profile target this might not be enough for you if not you'll probably fine on your vpn question it will be needed only if you feel the need to hide the fact that you are using tor to your isp that will do nothing more if you use an anonymous wifi connection you probably don't need it remember don't tell too much on your setup we don't need to know if you use a wireless connection or your own dsl router that might help an attacker find who you are and what are the weaknesses of your setup.
opioids no doubt benzos never get me high they just put me to sleep and make me stumble around in the morning after hangover i went through the wringer with alcohol too but nothing like opioids they are persistent sneaky motherfuckers even after the physical withdrawal is over there's a persistent feeling that i can only describe as a hunger and nobody likes to be hungry right the only solution for me is total abstinence from them some recent experiences with lsd have really helped widen the gap between opioids and me the wider the gap the better zerg thanks for your honesty brother god i love this place.
you need to enter your wifi password every time you start up tails unless you're using a persistent volume which remembers stuff like wifi passwords there should be a little network icon near the upper right corner of your screen which becomes a drop down menu when you click on it you should be able to just enter your password in there if you enter your wifi password correctly tor should be able to connect.
this is cool i have been looking forward to bicylce day for a while now.
are the withdrawals working for everyone now i had a small change back on the site but i've nicely forgotten about it since it went down would be nice if they returned it back with an interest.
i just want to say thank you for bringing to light how important a vpn is i've been using tails for quite some time at public spots and it's great to know that for only a year you can get a reputable quality vpn i have been running ubuntu for a while now but for some reason the mullvad client would not install until a did a fresh install of ubuntu i tried everything i swear there was some strange error saying it couldn't install python most likely due to some other application i had installed conflicting in one way or another so if your going to be like me and trust these guys and upgrade to ubuntu a vpn and get off tails might wanna start with a fresh wipe if you have issues what i really want to know is if there is a way to clear the system memory upon shutdown like tails does are the any other features we can copy over the one thing i'm really going to miss is that little gpgapplet with the clipboard that made encrypting decrypting with pgp so much faster.

bbkf on february pmthe change to a new kernel and reports of users having issues including dirtysouf not being able to verify the signing key has me stuck on tails what do you mean you can't verify the signing key do you mean you can't verify the iso with the detached pgp signature download the sig file and the iso again gpg verify tails i iso sig tails i isogpg signature made tue jan am utc using rsa key id a db gpg good signature from tails developers offline long term identity key gpg warning using untrusted key the tails developers publish their keys on the following page can also see this page on trusting verifying the tails developers pgp keys from bbkf on february pmis there an alternative that includes usb mounting persistence and memory wiping at shutdown anyone very knowledgeable feel safe using the upgrade the upgraded kernel is the same flavor of linux used by redhat which works very closely with the us government the kernel version is pretty much on a par with that as just about every up to date linux distro is using if there is a conspiracy linus is involved and just about every other distro developer as well linux amnesia debian ckt deb u i gnu linuxspitfir.
time will tell if this is scare tactics or not but i would assume that they are too busy to prosecute everyone whose address is available to them i don't see neither why buyers don't use pgp nor why many vendors still use keys they seem to have created years ago if you read a few threads for newcomers you can acquire all the knowledge you need.
just ordered from study buddy on me a couple hours ago js is not enabled could not have been smoother or quicker order is already marked as sent looking forward to trying out some of the asian xtal.
tails can be a pain with wifi on new machines i find works wonders on hunks of crap like old thinkpads bought for cash bricks are the way forward have you considered whonix vm instead.
make a new key encrypt send to me i am running an os that is a very rugged linux variant there is no way to catch a virus this way.
so i just switched over from using tails i'm now using the latest desktop version of ubuntu with a vpn hardened tor browser armory keepassx gpa are there any other tools i could be using to increase my security or for cleaning up after using my tools particularly interested in tools to erase the traces in the ram or other traces of my usage thank you for your help.
use those mg kiosks at cvs pharmacy locations if they are in your area put fictitious info save it for later though and pay cash good to go.
i personally don't care if people see i'm online as i'm here to help newbs and such some people want to appear as online there is enough traffic now that correlation is reallyonly a concern for people already under surveillance if you are chances are you shouldn't be ordering anything on the darknet if you are here for the conversation not the vendors i don't see why it shouldn't be an option it is a minor dent in your opsec hardly something that should be mandatory afaik the forum software automatically opts in so if you want to opt outfeel free to i'm not because i like getting pms in real time its your choice.
it doesn't break the transaction chain so it shouldn't be used on it's own but it's good in combo with different mixing methods.
fascinating not much you can do against it if a vendor stores your data you're fucked but this did happen in germany in many other countries i don't think you can do something if you have no other proof btc trail or drugs seizure did they also catch some of those who didn't encrypt their addresses just based on sr database.
bonobo on february pmquote from dardush on february amis it just me or does this market looks exactly like evo the evo code is an open source code many markets copy that code today check out real deal market it even looks exactly like evo i mean they didnt even bother to slightly modify the colors and layout well i'm getting creepy flashbacks heh.
on august amquote from undetermined on july pmagora still not possible to create a new accountdid you use a invitation link i tried different ones but maybe they were expired if anyone has a valid one do feel free to pm it to me eternal gratitude and such.
ok so i'm sure some of you are questioning the credibility of their message so what is the fear that the site is taken over by leo well since there is no way to prove or discern that what would make one decide to leave ag it would seem foolish to leave ag for some other market that possibly could also be run by leo on speculations alone their message seems legit like they really have the best interests in mind personally i believe if a website was being overtaken by leo there would be no announcements things would just appear to be run as normal being the devils' advocate i don't think i'd want to create disinterest rouse suspicion or otherwise affect the sentiments or trust of the user base i'd want to stealthily investigate and takeactions as needed meh i'm sure allot of these markets are sponsored by leo they are getting their drugs on the markets too but really the war on drugs is effectively over even if not in law there is just no way to stop people and transacting they might try to nab people who resell irl and will certainly succeed in many cases but that's not going to stop the continual flow.
rec on july amas of fixing security bugs they rely on xen itself for security that's why there are no root password in vms and dom and it seems like they help with securing it what worries me about this is that the xen community developers as a whole are not centering their focus on security it's mostly about compatibility with vm software and speed honestly i can't even get virtualbox to run on my system for some reason tails is easy enough to run from a usb and faster that way anyway however it is about as fast as running from within ubuntu debian some programs are as fast and complicated to use within tails like veracrypt nearly all the security based distro's ie tails are based of debian ubuntu is based of debian really i don't see much difference between all the linux distro's except for which tools they come with tails has a great set of tools but it also has plenty of unnecessary ones as well ubuntu has also stood up against many other os's in hacking competitions though your point about visiting fixubuntu com was a good one though i had already fixed that issue i think security is mainly up to the end user if you do the research about your os keep it updated and use a distro with a large team of people actively fixing bugs security flaws and more importantly use an os that is open sour ce i think you should be pretty safe sure things can happen but unless you are the governments priority i don't see the need for the ultra insane security and slowness that comes with qubes you must have a very good system to even consider trying to convert audio video with qubes what this post is really about is making ubuntu other linux distro's as secure as possible via tools without switching to another method.
just go buy an old thinkpad you can find them all over the place for bucks without hardrives boot into tails via your usb drive cheap simple effective.
a local street vendor friend of mine was worried about having open communications with his team and cut down on communication errors while trying to talk in code over cell phones i have studied the situation and am ready with a solution the system would have to use android and can be use in conjunction with or without cell service you will just need to be on wifi for a connection to the internet the solution will not work through tor connection lag so it would have to be a special set up with a dedicated server vps is ok to handle the communication streams a server closer to the outlet of the internet phone service provider would have the best results there is an app that will allow for end to end communication just like otr for xmpp jabber the encryption is protocol was made by the same inventor of pgp made me happy to read that one the application on the android phone would have he setting for the server and will be the dialer for it this will use the data connection on the phone and not the cellular phone service the app will encrypt the call fom one end to the other and the server will be set not to keep logs and to allow pass through communication that will enable the encryption to be done from one client to the other the starting price for a full package would be that would include year of the server required for the communications android smart phones using jellybean rootedquad core ghz gb ram gb romduel sim cards so you can jump between networks and dump prepaid sim cards easily frequency and networks gsm mhz wcdma mhz touch screen and tf card up to gb if you want need more storage i am also willing to do a server set ups and you can use your own rooted phones the server setup will include the price of the server for one year and would be around depending on the level of support you need if you are smart just need me to poke a few buttons the price is lower if you ask the same questions over and over again every time you add a phone the price will go up and don't forget you can use the im server over tor for text communication already using otr on some android clients.
ami on july am ug that would most likely overpower all of the rest imo you should take in between ug and ug depending on how strong a shrooms dose you'll take with it vial of liquid shrooms how much would that be in terms of grams of dried shrooms the mdma doses seem ok although honestly a booster dose may be unnecessary it was suppoosed to be indian rose one vial of shrooms vial g of dried shrooms and ks's mdma.
it means either there was a remaining balance left unpaid by the sender or he didn't pay for the postage at all maybe your sender dropped the package into a dropbox forgetting to put the postage stamp on it i've done that before but i realized immediately and had them send someone out to open the box so i could affix the stamp you should be fine they won't make you sign for it unless of course it required a signature anyway just for unpaid postage so there's nothing that could validate a search and seizure warrant if you're concerned at all though just make sure you clean house before he gets back.
boomshankar on july amgood day my brothers and sisters by any chance somebody have an agora market invite link i would be infinite thankful lots of love lol you must be hiding under one of those virtual rocks.
fantastic guide i was able to get tails set up in an hour last night with this.
update yes there are pgp generating key tool apps i got one called pgptools and it works its.
to create a persistent volume you must boot from cd dvd or usb after that even if you booted from a usb drive you have to create a new usb drive by using the tails installer and install by cloning this new usb drive will allow you to configure a persistent volume.
alberthoffman on march pminternal mixer what im intressted in acid from what country you send when you send your coins to agora they mix with other coins that other users deposited so it might look like people withdrew your coins on blockchain it's just agora mixing your coins i send from the united states.
she's not selling on any markets that i'm aware of but she has a thread here.
great idea i'm under the impression that if i have coins totally unlinked to me and i use a blockchain wallet only ever logging on through tor then i am quite safe to send the coins to the vendor but for people who may have trouble getting coins that are totally unlinked to them maybe some information about different tumbling options advantages disadvantages current status reputation etc would be helpful.

vividsky on december amupdate yes there are pgp generating key tool apps i got one called pgptools and it works its anyone using a cellphone even with a 'pgp' app is a fool cellphones are without a doubt the most insecure platforms currently in existence canadian cops can decrypt pgp blackberrys toosource monday motherboard reported that leading dutch forensics investigators say they are able to read encrypted messages sent on pgp blackberry phones custom devices which are advertised as more suited for secure communication than off the shelf models a myriad of other law enforcement agencies would not comment on whether they have this capability but court documents reviewed by motherboard show that the royal mounted canadian police rmcp can also decrypt messages from pgp blackberrys this encryption was previously thought to be undefeatable one court document in a drug trafficking case reads referring to the pgp encryption used to secure messages on a blackberry device the rcmp technological laboratory destroyed this illusion and extracted from this phone e mails address book entries and other information all of which had been protected in another case from centering around charges of kidnap and assault three out of four blackberrys seized by the rcmp were analysed by the technical assistance team in ottawa and the contents were decrypted and reports prepared the court documents don t make an explicit reference to what brand of custom blackberry the seized devices were if at all but the documents do state that law enforcement were able to decrypt emails that had been encrypted with pgp from the device transcripts of many messages sent during the crimes are included in one of the court documents in the kidnapping case the suspects allegedly exchanged messages while following the target we have his car in sight in a underground reads one kk if its good do it is the reply the dutch investigators ability to obtain encrypted data from pgp blackberrys was first noted in december last year when blog misdaadnieuws com or crime news published documents supposedly sourced from the netherlands forensics institute nfi the nfi is a body that assists law enforcement in evidence retrieval according to the documents published by crime news the capability is reliant on forensics software sold by private company cellebrite although it is not totally clear how exactly the device and message encryption is bypassed in the canadian drug trafficking case court documents say the seized blackberrys had three levels of security entry was protected by a password the device was protected by encryption generally and e mails processed by this particular device were protected by pgp the rcmp may have brute forced the password if it was weak enough deployed a forensics technique called chip off to rip data from the phone's flash memory or used another method regardless the rcmp manged to obtain a wealth of data from the phones it seized after the publication of monday's article annie delisle a media relations officer from the rcmp told motherboard in an email that the rcmp does not generally provide information on techniques or technologies used in criminal investigations when reached tuesday sergeant media relations officer harold pfleiderer said we continue to decline comment on investigative techniques.
i was able to log in this morning but then while sending a message it went down and has stayed down for a couple hours now the forum was down then up now its down again this does not look good and right after the untimely demise of nucleus its a real shame if its gone for good lets hope it comes back up.
you can trust a hobbit.
i'm not big on markets everything i could possibly need is right here but if you are looking for something that's not here i would suggest agora is the best option at.
be careful with clearnet redirect links could lead you straight to a phishing site.
export your public key left click on the clipboard icon on the top right menu bar and select manage keys make sure that gnupg keys is selected in the left pane of the new window left click on your pgp key to select it in the right pane of that window type ctrl c or do edit copy from the menu bar for that window your public key is now in the clipboard you can paste it out to a gedit window applications accessories gedit text editor to make sure that it looks good paste it out to the pgp text entry area in your profile on the market place.
smokey on june ami think if they really did sift through every message and order on sr and were charging people who didn't encrypt their address there would be a mass amount of arrests i think more than anything it's scare tactics reminds me of the days of mpaa riaa actively attempting to fine people for downloading movies music there is obviously no way they will prosecute everyone so they pick a few slam dunk cases to try to scare people into not doing these things but you're definitely right there are people still that don't encrypt addresses just seems crazy to me that you wouldn't take this simple precaution.
hello does anyone here know of a way to upload files to send someone now that anonfiles is not working anymore sorry if this is a noob question but given the nature of things i rather make it right cheers so.

cerver on february pmquote from oldisgold on february pmwhat's the best and most trustworthy btc mixer out there right now bitcoinfog i would say that bitcoinfog is the best blockchain info privides shared send and i believe it's also quite good if you're really paranoid you can chain them like you btc fog you shared send you but it's also more expensive i also think that bitcoinfog requires a minimum deposit of btc which isn't that much if you're placing a big order but should be kept in mind nonetheless.
had great experience trying whonix pretty fast for what it does with an ssd and a recent cpu and i did find it really easy to install and use with no much need for the command line qubes manager does the job quite well for of needed tasks did you try the latest version of an older one converting audio video would go with no trouble with a good cpu another option is to have a qubes install on a usb disk and another system for your multimedia needs or an easy way to switch between two or more ssd with different systems as of fixing security bugs they rely on xen itself for security that's why there are no root password in vms and dom and it seems like they help with securing it can't tell more as i'm not a daily user nor a security pro but with whonix integration and dom as an offline container with easy ways to add or even chain vpns it seems to me way better than ubuntu virtualbox whonix if you decide to go for a gnu linux virtualbox whonix i would recommend to make strong use of grsec to try to have your system a little bit less vulnerable.
bombheadie on march pmi've just been in a very good mood lately this is why i am doing this and positive karma for being in a good mood seriously thank you for going through all this trouble to make this near mythical substance available.
astraltraveler on june amnote your seed a few words needed to get your wallet back in case you loose your private key or run your system from a live dvd and don't backup your key you'll understand the first time you'll use electrum  astraltraveler on june ambuy a cheap laptop remove the harddrive get tails on a usb that would be better and safer than running tbb on your main system tails is a tor and privacy oriented live dvd usb with strong firewall rules to avoid reveling your ip address url read the doc check your download with their gpg key running from a dvd is great as if an attackers hacks into your system it's impossible to write any change to the disk and each time you reboot you are sure you use a clean system running from an usb disk is easy as the system updates automatically and you can enable persistence easily to save your bitcoin wallet gpg key bookmarks i'd recommend that as you are a newbie it's pretty good and you'll be able to get your opsec better in the future  astraltraveler on june ambuy storing in tor wallet do you mean by the market wallet quotei meant electrum a bitcoin wallet that comes with tails it's better to store your bitcoins on your own computer than on a market wallet as the market can disappear anytime with your money you just send to the market what you need for a purchase right before you purchase keeping money on an online wallet can be insecure markets come and go keep your btc in your own software wallet i'd advise you to read that thread long but worth it you come back with a better opsec you can create and use a new username on the garden in case your previous setup was not secure enough keep learning read as much as you can and please ask if you need any help learning proper opsec before doing any mistake is worth it.

pretzel on january pmto create a persistent volume you must boot from cd dvd or usb after that even if you booted from a usb drive you have to create a new usb drive by using the tails installer and install by cloning this new usb drive will allow you to configure a persistent volume yeah then that makes sense i was trying to create a persistent volume with the original usb drive thanks.
thanks for the thorough response bombheadie i'm curious to see if i can tell a difference my initial thought is no unless duration or something else is noticeably different i'm hoping it's more spiritual as you mention due to its cleanliness.

abraxas runs very well no issues so far with orders.
it's fairly tiring to keep seeing yet more markets opening that don't really provide anything new or really have an attractive or gane changing unique selling poin.
usps blocks tor exit nodes however you can use another end to end ssl encrypted usps proxy such as packagetrackr com i agree with snacktime though spoof your mac and check it at an internet cafe.
yes of course for me too until now i used btc for all my psychedelics drugs i began on evolution then here and it worked but i'm really not at peace of mind if the police would really trace my btc trail to my real identity and of course it's now only a theorical discussion xmr or cloak as no vendor accept them but if nobody speaks about it if no customers ask vendors about it no vendor would never start to try to use these better and safer altcoins i'm only trying to inform and open eyes and maybe with chance have a little positive impact on the way the market evolves and really the methods i gave here above are at least as good as any btc tumbler system helix to get clean btc not linked to your identity even if yes i understand we won't be able to pay vendors in xmr soon still btc xmr btc exchanges are already great tools and last but not least if you buy xmr at low price and sell them at higher price you can get or btc in return on btc invested i do it quite often but you need to follow the xmr or cloak markets exchanges everyday and also have a little bit of chance.
i believe they have dirty mods on ab.
is it official tmg policy not to mention the d word any more if so why am i missing something fundamental here.
these guys are doing a fantastic job spreading awareness about drug safety and having virtually every major vendor tested to date they are doing a fundraiser to raise more money for the tests the raffle is hosted by pelican tickets are for and and winners get to keep half the pot more details here tickets to the raffle here darkheroesq awl onion product hope it is not inappropriate posting it here i think dnma need more awareness and their quantitative tests are one of the main reasons i prefer dnm drugs rather than buying of the streets.
yajer bi on december amisn't majestic garden a store if so how do you access it sir or madam you are in the garden.
yeah i have made a key i am going to shut down and restart thanks for your help all the same.
we dropped commission to for vendors who join in february and the month of march we ruduced the users charge to we are using the for something special and when it is in place we will let users know.
linalool on july amthey still haven't made this the default setting any reasoning behind that drug.
this is completely normal when there many connections at once the ip address belongs to the local network interface that the server is using internally no leak here.
yeah i just tried to log into dhl to check if my order had shipped apparently that's down as well this is a message from the forum we are sorry something went wrong with the deployment i only noticed that right now since i need multiple signatures to change this system specific permission i took the market down for a few hours to avoid any data corruption we'll be back within hrs maximum i'll keep you updated sig.
clagget on june pmif you google pgp encryption site the first listing is igolder a gold trading site with pgp help then software wike etc my first question is if you use a clearnet site like that one that does the encrypt decrypt can all you type in become open to prying eyes i know that sounds naive but i really don't know no one should be caught dead using a site like igolder i wouldn't use it even in an emergency  clagget on june pmsecond how important is key size you should be using a bit rsa primary key with a bit encryption subkey i wouldn't use anything smaller  clagget on june pmand a bonus third question say i'm browsing my favorite vendors for fun and then go to search a word on google is mixing tor with clearnet a security problem i wouldn't do that either if you get distracted and use the clearnet browser for something that should be private spitfir.
short and simplified answer because it is not end to end encrypted when somebody catches your traffic everyone hosting an exit node can catch that le hosts some exit nodes for that purpose you are fucked you just gave away your address and time of arrival pm me if you want me to link you to some good safety stuff i would strongly advise you to do so.
i was under the impression that blackbank had folded and was unable to access their site when i tried a few weeks ago is it still going then could anyone provide me with a link if this is the case.

there is a way to get xmr anonymously with cash like localbitcoin bitsquare added monero but i did not read how it works but if you buy xmr with btc and you send your xmr from xmr wallet a to your xmr wallet b they are completely clean and private anonymous untraceable.
reasons for not using abraxas in that scenario when using albion's shop you only need to trust him whereas when using abraxas the admins could run away with your funds in escrow or even if you finalize early they could run away with the funds in albion's wallet before he has time to withdraw them and imo albion is trustworthy plus i think you don't need to create an account to use his shop a working pgp gpg identity is all you need if it works like gammagoblin's shop finally there are no fees if a trade is made directly with albion on his shop i think abraxas takes a commission on every transaction.
it would do well to become a market things look very comfortable here.
i call it apple because i feel that people will resonate with the brand and feel that they know it apple is one of the most valuable brands in the world people all over should know it moreau filters will be coming up in a few days stay tuned pastorseeu our strength as a market lies in our simplicity we want the market to be as intuitive as possible so that people can use it naturally.
thanks i really appreciate it.
abraxas i don't feel good about nucleus being a reseller i can't afford to have someone take off with my coin.
lets not jump to conclusions heredoes anyone have any real information relating to this cheers s.
there are too many marketplaces for everyone to keep up with there were also rumors that they were running a tor exit node on the same server as their service not too sure if i believe it but here are a few links after evolution many here have chosen to do direct trades with vendors they trust i think the only marketplace that i can say i have no love for is alphabay i don't like a site devoted to theft of ones identity i have had multiple family members put into an endless cycle and a hole of debt trying to recover from identity theft other friend with ruined credit that made it hard to find a job and imposable to get a good rate on home purchase because they were taken advantage of in the same manor.
darcm on november ameverything was okay in the end just got a bit worried there for a moment pso what happened you had to go pay postage at the post office is this a normal occurence and finally is it frowned upon when a vendor does this.
i am not sure if it is clever to use tor for your coinbase account i assume you want to buy bitcoin via a bank transfer in that case your real identity will be linked to your coinbase account anyway so no reason to use tor buy the coins using your clearnet browser then transfer them to a wallet not linkable to you you create and access this wallet only through tor and from there to the market vendor you want to buy from you can also configure tor browser to pick exit nodes from a specific country see good way to anonymously get bitcoin besides coinbase is localbitcoins com it allows you to buy bitcoins in person or via cash deposit or bank transfer directly from other people.
i would like to know about this vendor too so up.
luckyduck's mdma is some of the best i've come across it was clear overweight and positively mdma mandelin and marquis the most beautiful mg experience i've had definitely worth a shot welcome to tmg.
isn't majestic garden a store if so how do you access it.
someone with more knowledge can feel free to correct me but it is my understanding that using a vm is almost never as safe as just using tails from a usb the reason for this is that you have to trust that there are no backdoors in the vm most likely there wouldn't be but if your are running your virtual machine on windows you can never be sure as for your other question your isp can see that you are using tor but not what you do there think of it as a helicopter watching you enter the subway sure the helicopter knows that you're using the subway but it doesnt know where you are going to get off.
it's possible you can use a gift card check out there is also but last i checked their option for getting a vanilla card with btc was grayed out they could have other ways though i'd check it then there is with which you can have the fiat proceeds from your coins sent to a paypal account which you would have to have opened anonymously and linked to your drop address but it is very expensive the exchange rate i mean then pp charges you on top of that for receiving money.
nothing came today either i'm officially writing this off tomorrow if it doesn't land.
on september pmquote from on august pmif canada gfn went direct i would never need to use a market ever again who canada aka prices for mdma to the usa are outstanding if he went direct it would be lovely right now we have gamma for lsd at an amazing price canada for mdma soon trust will have mdma and hopefully that iconoclast guy works out because those are some aamzing prices on np.
astraltraveler on june amvanilla reload moneygram are they like washing btc or just like a ewallet but bank option is connected to your real name if cash isnt optional random person buys btc through local with bank and send it to helix and from helix to another helix then to market would that work sorry for all these newbie reload and moneygram are ways that you would send money to a person selling btc on local bitcoins the bank option isn't connected to your name since your depositing cash into the local bitcoin's sellers account you don't give your name at any point sc.
knucklesfromsr on february pmfrom everything that i read this makes it so that website owners can be held responsible for what their users do i don't agree with this i still don't think you'd get in trouble for making a platform like craigslist which can be used for illegal activity but ross knowingly set up a black market website actively recruited drug dealers and knowingly and directly profited from illegal transactions.
abraxis has been working fine for me.
technology for encryption is one solution but not cost effective if a phone was taken it can be used to pose as that person easily when unlocked the code should work for all local le except very well funded large cities if used correctly caution if higher le are suspected involved as they may have access to a cryptographer everyone eats daily develop a code based on talking about eating using date meal time location and types of food to encode have each category represent some piece of information never have a one to one correlation of terms but embed them potato may be the identifier but it would be embedded in saying you want a local meal which includes potatoes somehow better would be to use a class since items would be variable within the class fruit could be used by asking for any local dishes which contain fruit with other items the same thing can be done with each category just varying the terms with times you could use a range anything between minutes after the hour or every time with the third digit as means one thing be creative and test it first by talking it out to each other to put this in use a call is placed talk about nothing but discuss eating sometime during the start middle or end person a asks when you are free to eat person b says i m free for lunch on may at they have good there can then agree or offer another place to eat or what they had to communicate back person a and b know from those four bits of information four separate things if decoded this could be the real location and time number of units needed or have type of substance and one bit of useless information to distract you don t have to use all four but no reason not to vary the structure of the sentenceand conversation as well this method allows no physical trace since it can be easily memorized and causes decoding trouble unless told the code voice verification should be used not fast since you should be talking for a while to add similar sounding excess information does not work well if you need a lot of communication.
so recently i received a tracking code trough pm that wasn't encrypted with pgp i don't know how the postal system works with tracking but i assume the tracking code is coupled with the address the pack is sent to meaning that if the platform is compromised and le gets a hold of the tracking code they can determine the drop address anyone have any knowledge on this subject is sending tracking without pgp a major opsec flaw thanks for your insight.
personally i'll be using abraxas i've used it in the past as a backup and they've been extremely reliable not the most active but it's worth considering due to the fact it will be picking up activity wise when people go looking for alternatives what i have most vendors switch to so far is abraxas and or middle earth.
tmg can be a market a cool place to hangout and meet cool people and its also a place you can call home users and vendors in tmg can be your best friend or even family but it is not and i hope it will not be reddit.
hello scroati had similar issues with the tails pgp applet or it not responsing at all the weird thing is that sometimes the issues happen and sometimes don't i downloaded pgp usb to my persistence drive and i am using that app now is very easy to use and you can import your keys directly from the tails pgp applet i know is not a fix but as a temporary solution it works for me best r.
uncleal on february pmquote from knucklesfromsr on february pmthis trial should of been extremely highly publicized from everything that i read this makes it so that website owners can be held responsible for what their users do and yea the whole thing was rigged a mess apparently from what his family was saying they denied a lot of evidence from the defense from even being presented i wouldn't be surprised if the whole thing was rigged i think they're trying to make an example of ross and disuade from anyone following in his footsteps very likely although from the rise of other markets the fact that evo and agora are still up and the further development of p p networks like bitmessage etci doubt they can do much to stop it deter yes but those who are top notch in their opsec and know how to make robust websites the only shot they have is to get in on the inside like they did and ulbricht dropped his guard sadly they knew exactly how to lure him by having him goto a specific admin page see but he already was flagged months prior because of his 'email' flub the weakest link dxuutxthat is correct if ross had made the markets in a way that said 'do whatever you want here but i don't condone nor tolerate any illegal activity'and did not specifically have 'drug listings' they would of had nothing the vendors could have made their own special product listings perhaps using code words which were only known via clearnet channels or irc eg then ross could not be held liable if even if those posts listings were not taken down that is not necessarily condoning or allowing ross could have just defended by saying it was an oversight and i am sure even in the clearnet that there have been pm deals conducted over shroomery irc google groups etc again private engagement between forum usenet members is never in anyway something for which site admins could be held responsible so long as they assume plausible deniability.
reportedly the prosecution in the sr trial exempted every potential juror who had internet and at the end they had to take a yo it guy a yo woman and people over with no technological background p anyway one of the major reasons not to have charges lead to rediculous sentences is that when facing life in prison only an idiot would accept a life sentence in the us federal system as a plea what ross did was intentionally lose a trial that was unwinnable in hope that his defense will be able to get the verdict possibly thrown out or sentence reduced if you are already fucked might as well go to trial and get it out of the way good luck ross.
beetlejews on august ami havent gotten my btc yet either withdrew two days ago yall figure it will still come i hope i dont lose like i did on blackbanki recieved my btc after about days it sucks waiting but i think you will get it eventually hope it comes through for you much love halfpin.
slowmike on april pmlol nuke didn't sell anything to dhl nuke was run by bunch of incompetent peoples i was pretty sure at a point their mods were just copy pasting standard replies onto a dispute thread some gibberish i couldnt remember but two different mods posted the same generic response who sold what evolution probably sold their logo to nucleus wont be surprised if it were the same lot of mods who were left out and jobless from evo admin after kimble verto pulled their shit its downright stupid to trust a market thats been hacked yet people keep trusting market with escrow a vendor apparently lost over gees on an order its tough luck but gotta be smart ahead of the marketsnuke was launched before or around even before evo it switched many names nuke did at one point i believe they did tease the idea of using the sr name of course someone had at the least one brain cell left in there loli'm sure that's not how it went just saying some uncanny similarities don't get me wrong i shop at dhl all the time.
cool thread for id say coffee and cigs cigs more than anything bc they make me feel like absolute shit they are worst ever no high really and it fuks up my breathing sinuses everything i can smoke ganja all day and it actually helps my breathing i dont give a fuk what these idiot doctors say weed is not worse for lungs than cigs esp if you eat or vape it so yeah tobacco is a bad thing in my life sadly allot of my friends smoke and i often get allured by the pack designs or i am a real sucker for rollies like drum or bali shag or whatever but no more have to just move on and recognize that tobacco is a poison for my body coffee is second but i love it so much i just have to limit it makes me shit and piss too much and with my sleep good posts all opiates benzos meth def the worst but i do enjoy a klon or xanax to relax here and there just dont make it a habit.
yeah nothing happens weird indeed thanks anyhow.
on march pmso recently i received a tracking code trough pm that wasn't encrypted with pgp i don't know how the postal system works with tracking but i assume the tracking code is coupled with the address the pack is sent to meaning that if the platform is compromised and le gets a hold of the tracking code they can determine the drop address anyone have any knowledge on this subject is sending tracking without pgp a major opsec flaw thanks for your insight if it's a market like alphabay point out the mistake to the vendor then politely request that he delete the entire conversation then do the same once he has confirmed he deleted the thread that will permanently delete the entire thread at least on alphabay be sure to copy paste any relevant parts of the thread to someplace encrypted unless you don't need the thread contents ever again.
you should look at a modded version of aflao bitwasp it will save you a lot of time all you are doing by the vendor anonyminity is creating extra scripting to be hacked make sure you have it all locked down if not you will have to trust in people to refund its not just a payment code with a ledger created for an escrow account and then dropped in real addresses anonymous listings lead to a whole vacuum for scams are you logging the anonyminity to the vendor so when a scam occurs there is a way to locate the scammer.
i do believe that they will be back but it won't be for weeks.
luxaeterna on may pmwent with zalas approach except deposited cash in a bank via a machine so no face to face with bank person and no leaking of id to buyer only thing is banks cameras only problem there i can think of is if buyer is le and wants to know who i am they could use the time stamp on the recpiet i had to take a screnshot of and go to the cameras of that bank around that time however that's a lot of hassle and they would have to try id me by face only put up posters this pay points are similar to atms are machines but i haven't noticed any camera on them even though there might be hidden ones are terminals for self service anything u can think of opened and if paranoia is so big u can go using it with a mask no jok.
i understand that electrum is the best way to go but if someone ever needed an online wallet which one would be the one to use also should you use it on tor because i heard somewhere that btc over tor somehow deanonomizes you also do you need to use a mixer if you're sending it to a unique btc address you're given when doing a direct wallet to wallet transaction with a vendor i don't really like using mixers but i will if it's critical to opse.
cidkid on july pmhas anyone tried these blotters from john any feedback on the quality i can vouch for them took tabs of the ug bear's love last night and was blown away john claims they're overlaid by at least so i had approximately ug the visuals and introspection were crazy i highly recommend them especially at only bucks a tab.

you just made a thread in the best market you're already there here as far as psychedelics everything you could want is here and in my opinion psychedelics are the only 'drugs' worth pursuin.
alberthoffman on march pmhellowhat so you have your money in your wallet me and my friends wallets are competly empy i can clearly se how some one transfered my bitcoints from agora to another wallet on blockchain that's the internal mixer bud it's importnat to know how things work before making statuses that could cause hysteria scidm.
there have been a lot of posts on reddit about security issues the site itself looks nice and multi sig only is a plus i have a vendor account there just waiting for a little bit to put up listings scidm.
scroat on august pmit was actually a particular key that was causing the problem it still is but i figured out i can use any other key just not that one is the key expired pgp will not use expired keys to encrypt messages spitfir.
thanks for the heads up happy new year.
i have a program that works instantly its no key much much smaller but works without any load times btw forgot to say that this is f'ing awesome root.
wow good to know i'll make an account on alphabay right now and for any trying to get in abraxasreferal.
throwaway account on april amwell evolution abraxas and middle earth were not run by carders as far as we know but they exit scammed ab is the biggest market right now and everyone who got phished is complaining maybe there are some real problems and bugs going on but i don't see any other market who constantly improve things in favor of their customers they improved their security and always adding features what i see is other markets constantly bashing ab to get bad reputation and i think they won't exit scam just because they're carders they need the community they created i'll correct you real quick evolution was known to be run by carders middle earth and abraxas we have no idea as to what sort of nefarious characters ran those both of which burned me a combined k buthey thats what you get as part of operating in the space it's in the nature of the elements.
love is all around us on april pmwhat's the deal with agora was in the middle of a transaction and had the site stop responding according to the subreddit they are moving server locations apparently they do this a lot possibly for security reasons.
on august pmif canada gfn went direct i would never need to use a market ever again who.
on january pmi did try this i typed the text that i want to encrypt and saved the text file to the desktop then i found the file in the file in the desktop folder hilighted it and selected edit then selecting encrypt it then allows me to check the key of the recipient after i do that it creates another file that ends in pgp this seems like it should work just fine but when i open the file it looks like there is heiroglyphic symbols mixed in with normal letters about of each not sure what is going on still the reason that the file when you attempt to edit it looks like hieroglyphics is because the file is not ascii armoured files that are encrypted and not ascii armoured usually end in pgp here's how to do it so it'll work properly for you these instructions assume you've already generated your own pgp key and have saved both the public and private halves to external storage remember tails is amnesic meaning that if you don't backup your data keyrings they will not be there for you the next time you fire up tails to do this follow these steps click on places computer on the top menu a new window will pop up with a series of locations devices on the left and a list of folders on the right plug in your usb stick or micro sd card if recognized the device will appear in the list of devices in the left hand pane go to applications terminal a terminal session will then open up the prompt will look something like this amnesia amnesia issue the command cd media amnesia issue the command ls la you will see a folder directory with its' name in blue perhaps something like f e db where the f e db is the device identifier folder name issue the cd command to switch into that folder i e cd f e db issue the command to copy your secret keys to a single file gpg armour export secret keys o secret keys asc issue the command to copy your public keys to a single file gpg armour export o public keys ascyour pgp keys are now backed up onto external media so you will have them ready for use the next time you fire up tails now as far as encrypting messages goes click on the little clipboard icon in the top menu bar and select open text editor the last entry in the editor compose your text to be encrypted when you're done composing use control a to select all the text and control c to copy it to the clipboard click on the little clipboard icon again only this time select the second option sign encrypt clipboard with public keys a select rcipients box will pop up and you can put a check on the left most checkbox to select the recipients click on ok to encrypt the contents of the clipboard with the selected public keys when the contents of the clipboard are encrypted you will see a little padlock icon superimposed on the clipboard click on the clipboard icon again select open text editor and right click wiht your mouse and choose paste a copy of your ascii armored encrypted message will be seen there the message can be pasted anywhere else you need it to go to decrypt a message copy the encrypted message to the clipboard click on the clipboard icon chosing the first option decrypt verify clipboard a new dialog box will pop up asking for your passphrase type it in and click ok a new screen will then pop up showing you your decrypted text this text can be copied and pasted to wherever you need it to go hope this helps spitfir.
going through every page of this thread i think the summary is as follows receivedxncsux interest dibs but no package ever zipstyle never received reply from bhapostleofjor actual order and not sample rictor i know not everyone in the above list probably sent in a sample request or order formally but they postured in the forum as if they were so i included them.
koolcid on march ami was copy and pasting and when i went to past into pgp i must've misclicked or something and recopied the original text not looking i just clicked ctrl v and send so i'm just wondering if messages are stored on tmg servers even after the message is deleted and whether i should burn the address now thanks i'm still in disbelief that i did that playing devil's advocate so you have proper safety what if tmg is really a le honeypot someone could say that messages are deleted and you are fine but now your private shipping information is in le's hands you would be communicated that everything is ok but all tmg is designed for is tracking monitoring activity and also waiting for people to mess up and not pgp communications the choice is yours and i'm not saying i believe the above but servers have been compromised in the past elsewhere so one should be very prudent if you are buying low volumes or getting free samples probably no big deal even if le was involved but if you are buying sheets and sending addresses unencrypted i'd be a little nervous again i'm not saying i think the servers are compromised or that this is a honeypot but i think it's wise to always assume everything is and never reveal information without encryption and if you do consider it burned you will make the best risk reward decision for yourself though.
just confirming that all commissions have been disabled on acropolis market until the th of april thank you.

greenbud on february pm reportedly the prosecution in the sr trial exempted every potential juror who had internet and at the end they had to take a yo it guy a yo woman and people over with no technological background p anyway one of the major reasons not to have charges lead to rediculous sentences is that when facing life in prison only an idiot would accept a life sentence in the us federal system as a plea what ross did was intentionally lose a trial that was unwinnable in hope that his defense will be able to get the verdict possibly thrown out or sentence reduced if you are already fucked might as well go to trial and get it out of the way good luck ross my understanding of the way the system works is that each side defense and prosecution both have a certain number of challenges that can be used to eliminate jurors for any reason likely the prosecution used its challenges to eliminate anyone with any real technical background that is why one or two people who actually may have had a clue got on the jury as the prosecution likely ran out of challenges by that point spitfir.
summa iru on april amyou just made a thread in the best market you're already there here as far as psychedelics everything you could want is here and in my opinion psychedelics are the only 'drugs' worth pursuingwell put cannot agree more.
doses lysergic on january amit's v its got it lazy on my part language is a reflection of culture and culture changes over time to use outmoded language is improper in my opinion we don't use words such as thereupon anymore because they are superfluous figures of speech thereupon has no necessary meaning and really no meaning at all it is just word filler it's an old fashioned fancy equivalent of like the word i used was thereon which doesn't mean anything like like in this context it's just a more concise way of saying on the subreddit in question i don't think there's any basis for arguing that it's an archaic word or that nobody uses it anymore i see it often enough again i don't know why we're so hung up on language here i was trying to make a a serious argument clearly and logically you've seen two reasoned arguments for the rhetorical use of the double negative and have failed to address either only repeating your earlier assertion just as you failed to address the actual substance of my post in the first place either way on thoroughly derailing this discussion.
accessing darknet via iphone simply makes no sens.
i'm curious what everyone's problem drug is if you care to share not necessarily right now but in your life in general the substance that has been the hardest for you to kick that's turned your life upside down the most that's threatened your life to most i'm curious because i'd also like to know how you overcame it or what you do to resist or where you are at now i'd like to share and hear others experiences so that maybe we can get tips from each other to help us overcome our problem drug or new methods for resisting mine is opiates i am currently opiate free and have been for awhile but i had a mild to moderate addiction and it is the one drug i cannot even dabble in anymore because of the possibility that it might take over yet i still crave it regularly mescaline lsd and mushrooms are what helped me to kick the habit and keep it away also exercise and meditation and just keeping myself busy i love hiking and riding my bike i used to struggle with adderall had a script but that never really had a hold like opiates did i'm grateful to be passed them and hope strive to stay that way psychedelics really just helped me to see that there is a better life other than nodding off all the time and doing nothing with my time.
thanks thought as much.
the biggest most active market atm is abraxas you need a referral invite to join so you can use mine here if you need one link.
so far abraxas has been so smooth and there's a good amount of vendors setting up shop there alphabay has been fucking shit for the past couple of weeks don't know what's up there besides the influx of traffic from this week i am trying to verify some vendors on abraxas currently but they seem to not check messages often.
tried apple along with other markets besides alphabay and these markets just doesn't jive with me i'm usually found on dhl here and the avengers.
okey thanks i see folks writing about that u should use adresses and mixers to make it most unknown do you guys have any advice where i can get an email adress that is safe.
tails itself is a linux system it will work with a machine that already has windows installed because it ignores whatever operating system is already installed at start up any and all information used by the computer comes from that removeable disk and on shutdown there's no trace of what the computer was used for to contribute a bit to the discussion after i read about how they caught ross i've added a simple addition to my opsec i use a usb thumb drive with a split ring on it a lanyard goes around my wrist if someone grabs my laptop the drive is pulled out and any info is gone.
thanks for adding hansa.
sillywabbit on august pmfuck the centralized markets man trusted vendor boutique sites and email forum direct trades is the onlyway to go with any kind of assurance that your coin or identity is not being compromised for all we know every market is run by leo or their informants i was just coming in here to say this i have no problem sending money upfront to trust worthy vendors hopefully direct transactions like that are both a security benefit to sellers and buyers i prefer forums like tmg to deal with vendors.
i don't see what apple has over hansa or tmg.
i'm not buying it what are you offering that other markets don't i think right now oasis is the safest market in terms of buyer protection what can you offer that oasis doesn't.
what an amazing discussion after reading everyone's posts i thought i would mention something that may have been overlooked here's a disclaimer i'm sure everyone at mullvad are spot on in what they believe in when it comes to privacy and with what they're trying to accomplish at mullvad and i am in no way doubting that at all i'm only looking to disseminate information and perhaps my humble opinions sweden is one of the eyes and mullvad being a swedish company with their home servers located in sweden operates in the land of the eyes and i've always stayed away from all vpn providers that operate out of any of the eyes countries whether they have a strong association or a weak alliance with the american nsa countries that make up the eyes are not privacy friendly and i would only use vpn services and vpn servers located outside of the land of the eyes here's something about the eyes for those who might be interested.

it seems as if we all concur on some level i like it how middle earth and nucleus show active listings and they are quicker more reliable than agora which has tons of old listings that no one took down nucleus looks more like evo but i like it better blackbank is ok but i'm not sold on it yet with these three markets plus a dozen smaller ones we have the right scale and enough diversity so that no one market is dominant running these services depends on having good traffic but not crazy high traffic which giant sites have the problem is that dnms are really popular everyone is doing it acid lsd.
hello blue dream and root yes i saw that detail about is used to make a connection trouble is i never saw that warning before ever only on two occasions when logging into tmg the only reason i saw it was because i had vidalia running for those of you who dont monitor the behaviour of the connections how will you know if it is happening to you or not i checked everything on my side but found zilch bit worried now is there a way to directly contact admin without it appearing public when something like this happens can use pgp but time if somebody is up to something maybe its better that they dont know we know hehehe they know now not sure the best way to do it anyway thanks for the response feels good that people try to help each othe.
on may pmany advice on cleaning my computer now that i am using tails exclusively whereas before i was using windows does tor store any information about sites visited onto my computer or do i only need to worry about deleting pgp keys and such what's the best way to go about completely wiping these things anything else i should be worried about what are the risks associated with enabling scripts on blockchain or reddit i'm still learning about opsec but i will try and help if you are using tails exclusively on that machine i would recommend a dban nuke it deletes everything off of you computer just google dban download the file to a cd or usb and then you can wipe all contents of the computer while keeping tails safe on a usb tails is an amnesia systems when you exit tails your computer system is wiped of all knowledge of the tails session although i believe your isp may still be able to tell you were using tor not sure on this no need to delete pgp keys files or the like from your persistent folder tails is encrypted as long as your have a strong pass phrase for the system you are good to go as always forbid scripts globally see the s to the left of the url bar click it i am not sure on the reddit question just don't associate accounts and use a new identity to view pages like that if you are using the blockchain for your wallet i recommend you stop download and use the electrum wallet client there are many write ups on this if you have any other questions feel free to ask or pm me i do not know everything about opsec but i will help you if i can cheers rhet.
i stopped using tor browser and use a middlebox configuration instead so i am not aware of that error but a quick search shows port is used to make a connection in netscape also you can look at tcp sctp udp hypertext transfer protocol over tls ssl don't have the server set up with tls ssl certificates as that would put the server at risk if others are getting this error please reply here.
vitaminlsd on june amquote from ssod on june amcurrently i am connecting to the darknet via tails tor bridges i feel as this is not a very safe unless i am wrong anyone have any advice on additional security measures to protect my real ip i get bulk so safety is a big concern to me let me know if my lack of faith in bridges is invalid though tails is not secure for serious dnm activities and here's the first reason why usa feds have already conducted tor attacks that have landed significant dnm figures behind bars the above article has more details about how the feds did it and who they have arrested so far a former silk road lieutenant for starters also tor bridges are practically useless for hiding from the nsa because the nsa harvests the tor bridge addresses from the emails send to from the tor project the nsa knows you're using tor anyways if you're using a tor bridge tor bridges were designed for people in repressive third world countries not us citizens hiding from the nsa it also gets worse and this is information that every dnm user serious or small should know about but since the edward snowden leaks the nsa has talked about if not bragged that they have timing attacks for de anonymizing tor users at the nsa in the washington post revealed that the nsa had figured out various ways of unmasking and penetrating the anonymity of the tor network since according to a page research paper titled simply tor the agency has worked on several methods that if successful would allow the nsa to uncloak anonymous traffic on a wide scale effectively by watching communications as they enter and exit the tor system rather than trying to follow them inside one type of attack for example would identify users by minute differences in the clock times on their computers and it still gets worse tor prioritizes fast relays and so if you consider that plausibly speaking many and possibly most of the most high speed tor relays are run by western intelligence agencies and not just grassroots tor volunteers it makes timing attacks so much easier for them from the pando com article from above quotein tor co founder roger dingledine revealed that the tor network is configured to prioritize speed and route traffic through through the fastest servers nodes available as a result the vast bulk of tor traffic runs through several dozen of the fastest and most dependable servers on today's network clients choose one of the fastest exit relays around of the time and of their choices come from a pool of relays this information above has already been public since the edward snowden leaks so now everyone reading this has no excuse not to get off tails and learn ubuntu or your other favorite flavor of linux and start using a reputable vpn impeccable track record of standing up against government requests keeps no logs and you can pay them in bitcoins you can start on this now or end up like the silk road lieutenant who got arrested because his tor connection got de anonymized by the government to what was probably his home ip address and if you're a serious dnm user you don't do business hours a day online from a public wifi spot this is not an acceptable solution for power users bonus points if you use a pre paid g hotspot with your non tails flavor of linux a reputable vpn where your face was never on camera buying the hotspot think fake wig cell phone at home and paid in cash true story great advise i however use a preconfigured travel router can be found on amazon called gl inet and flashed it with dd wrt and open vpn i then uploaded several vpn config files onto the router itself and foced all traffic through the vpn add to that i only plug in i never use wifi so the travel router is connected to the wan port from ethernet over power extender and then wired through the lan port into my machine i run tail when on the go and whinox when home i also 'bridge' into the tor network on start up and never use persistant memory i feel it is more secure to have my content keys keymanager etc stored on a seperate encrypted usb thumb drive that i then upload my keys before i go live so im essentially between my machine and the vpn that is then relaying those packets through a bridged connection into the tor i highly suggest you use aws to spawn yourself a vpn i feel it is more secure to have your very own vpn config rather than use one that is shared by others.

hey all just curious if blockchain's shared send is safe enough to be considered a good air gap or if i should be using a more official tumbler like bitcoinfog thanks.
alphabaydream seems to be fairly popular as well valhalla i personally don't care for the layout.
herpiusderpius on august pmagora has posted a message stating that they're moving their servers while they take down paus the website who knows if when they'll be back up would advise against doing any further business there in the mean time potentially in perpetuity although this seems like a smart move on their part if they are to be believed we are still moving btc out but hopefully we can direct some of our customers here regards sant.
blackbank is gone fuck those guys took my vendor fee and closed the site.
knuckles on may pmi do miss the original silk road seriously at this point it seems so nostalgic ditto nothing feels the same.
hey guys slowly getting my opsec together as i read more and more on the forums i couldn't find a clear answer to this though for very small scale first time transactions is it safe enough to acquire my bitcoins on localbitcoin transfer through my real name and banking details have a high feedback individual lined up who has quite a low minimum transfer limit which is what i want then with tails tor transferring from localbitcoin wallet to my own wallet before mixing tumbling are these the same thing is this acceptable opsec there seem to be so many ways people acquire their bitcoins on the board some of which seem quite elaborate if they are thoroughly mixed and final transfer done from a different wallet with tails does it really matter how you got them any help much appreciated.
doses lysergic on january amquote from dxuutx on december pmif anything this is more proof that hos or whoever is a major target of law enforcement and that we really shouldn't be talking about this business on the clearnet anywhere than any notion that the whole sub is just a honeypot i think the arrogant sense that people on the sub have that their crimes aren't worthy of targeting from law enforcement these are people who live to make drug arrests i also think it's a bit alarmist to assert that it exists only for this purpose and that no worthwhile discussion takes place thereon and it's not insignificant seemingly to me that hos didn't have any overt problems with reddit when the reviews were adulatory and the attitude changed when they started to turn critical lol speak english its not insignificant it is not not significant when you use a double negative you obscure your meaning thereon this word has been used not since again not one knows what the fuck not insignificant' again that 'hos didn't' have a problem when the reviews were positive adulatory if you yern to be not unlike leo tolstoy well then i'll just not continue writing now thanks professor dl some of my friends try to say as many double negatives in one sentence i aint got no nothing or anything to say sometimes but i try anywho my post has nothing to do with hos and they are not the messenger the bottom line is no one should be posting anything about dnm on reddit period.
sorry i meant tails not tor lo.
ya if agora was planning an exit scam i don't think they would have warned people ahead of time to remove their coins cause they were going offline duhh.
yeah thought as much i already bought what i needed from a marketplace just wondered about this site because the prices are kinda low lower than the most though.
are you talking about dream or nuc on nucleus they do that but on dream the pgp is optional i have asked how to make it a pgp required login and never got a reply from admi.
alberthoffman on march pmare you working for agora defending them dude why the hell should i lie about swedish sek on my bitcoint wallet on agora that was stolen i read on other forums like reddit that it happened another guy to they stole hes money and they answered him on support that he had some keylogger virus that got into hes wallet thats bullshit my computer is secure as possible im working with it and computer in my eyes they are scammers and i wont deposit there anything morei'm a vendor trying to help you figure it out i logged in yesterday and withdraw a fairly large amount and it went into my wallet within minutes scidm.
on january am low randomized fees when you deposit coins into your bitcoin blender account we will take a low randomized fee of between we make our fees low to keep coin mixing affordable and we randomize the fee to make analysis of our service less predictable in other words if our fee was a standard blockchain analysis would be made more trivial interested parties would need only look for suspected deposits and withdrawals tagged with a modifier our randomized fee takes this tool away from those who would seek to tie your transactions to you that would still mean several thousands of transactions that would have to be analysed and most mixers have an input address and a new address to send the coins to so its not too much of a security risk there unless i am missing something key.
tortrip on april amquote from spitfire on december pmi thought it was great too until they started serving ads through torads what really got me and caused me to abandon my accounts there is the fact that an ad that i was being served related to an organization in my country of origin that is either a huge coincidence or ip address data is possibly being leaked indicating the country of origin i've also been using sigaint org but i've never seen any ads there perhaps that's because i'm browsing with javascript disabled and ad block enabled the service has so far been quite reliable i just found it freaky they now seem to have fixed whatever the problem was and i have resumed using the service once more spitfir.

i have run tails both off a usb and thru a virtualbox container without any issues off of my macbook pro which is a few years old.

hi gang thank you plants n xnc and everyone else helping out here so far we've had excellent luck but i just can't have fam spending money when there's a big question mark hanging over so many heads so bombheadie what's the deal if something happened and the other folks' packs left late just let us them know you've been here a while before vending might just be new vendor blues i was going to try and help the little guy instead of a team but current events give me pause there's a deadline involved and i can't take a chance on having fam losing money or waiting weeks or a month not that that hasn't happened with other previous vendors but well you know it's not like we're ordering offa amazon communication is paramount but i know it's much harder stealthing mdma instead of paper and time is running down so please let us know what happened to original ship dates in house problems leading to delays etc we are a very forgiving bunch as long as communication is decent and accurate and the drugs end up arriving and are l.

rasputin on july pmi was under the impression that blackbank had folded and was unable to access their site when i tried a few weeks ago is it still going then could anyone provide me with a link if this is the case i think its gone mate no more blackbank.
oasis is a really smooth easy experience on the customer side.
i can also vouch for oasis market i have only been open on oasis for a couple weeks now but its very user friendly for both buyers and vendors and so far i have no complaints everything has been smooth sailing lol much love family.
replied in the other thread as well to your question update your bridges check for new bridges at.
alcohol unfortunately my genetic pool for whatever reason has a heavy propensity towards alcoholism it is the sole substance i continually find myself cycling through a routine of quit and return for whatever reason it is the only substance i find myself substantially more capable of day to day operation in every facet it enhances my effectivity in department of academic work it eases my social and over all anxiety and never seems to fail me as an outlet for stress relief overall it does great for me but i consume it entirely too often and too often to excess it is a crutch and a crutch i wish i so frequently didn't rest upon.
this place is really cool i just made an account and have been browsing the boards i too was expecting a market but honestly this is way better there's already a ton of markets this is a community.
dimitreez on march pmi agree oasis is pretty awesome it is a nice looking site it is designed well can someone explain the donation thing though so there is absolutely no fees that they demand its just what you feel like donating if so that sure is different and very respectable but i sure do hope that people are donating so they have the drive to stay legit and grow in popularity yes they are completely donation supported they require a bond for new vendors but they waive this for vendors that can confirm they are already established on other markets and the bond is returned to new vendors after orders listings and sales are completely free oasis does not take a percentage or fee for listings or sales we are donating of our sales to the market and we plan to continue doing that from what we can assess they do not need our donations to support maintain and continue to develop the market they plan to continue with or without significant vendor donations and sound like they are set up to do so we get the impression they know what they are doing we think we are good at recognizing these things we feel safe on this ship.
abraxas is a solid market i don't think you'll be disappointed and by the way it usually picks up in business when markets as big as agora are down.
on april pmit's more like a dating is illegal but what happens between two consenting adults is drugs online is still illegal though correct however tmg is an informational research and educational platform where educated individuals can share life experience's.
it's a flea market.
halfpint on august ami would be weary of switching it sounds like it isn't an agora specific problem for opsec i would refrain from any markets at the moment much love what he said remember this is a vulnerability issue with tor not just agora thanks for slapping some sense into me it isn't just the markets it could apply to this forum as well i feel like if your encrypting your data and taking all the necessary precautions you'll be okay though.
hi guys i feel really stupid asking this but what is a working link to join the we love avengers marketplace i've been trying lots of invite links on here but they don't look like a normal onion url thanks.
have faith in agora they put up a message saying they were having issues dealing with all the new traffic from evo peeps they are most likely just upgrading their infrastructure like they said they would acid.
trufflelover on october pmafter testing marquis and sending it to labs it was discovered to be meo miptwow that's quite a stretch to call a tryptamine mxe glad you nor any of your associates were hurt with the recent bans over in china i have the unsettling feeling that we'll be seeing many more instances of this type of fraud in the near future supply demand greed and lack of scruples do not mix well i'd like to see a lot more interest in chemistry in the rc scene like how it was a few years ago before w t got arrested china may not be producing these things but why can't we they're legal aren't they what's stopping us.
helix is safe from my experience i have only used it once for less than a hundred us dollars for the advice earth.
have you imported the pgp key of the person you're trying to send an encrypted message to.
ulbricht is like hydra cut off one head and will grow.
like kushmaster says local bitcoins would be the easiest place to sell coins selling coins for ukash vouchers will often get more per coin than any other method if selling for ukash make sure you have the voucher code before releasing coins to buyer i sold a few coins this way without issue i'd put the ukash on to a poker account and would either withdraw the money myself in any of the ways the site allowed or i'd pass lose some to friends so they can cash out.
alcohol amphetamines and dissociatives are all basically poison to me at this point of course each built up over time at different points in my life i really don't have any answers on how to overcome addiction it's probably something i'll always struggle with sassnaps can definitely relate to coming around to broken furniture and a busted up body from dissos i abused the hell out of mxe for a long time without any issues life seemed totally peachy then suddenly it turned on me and all dissociatives now basically turn me into a blacked out zombie major change in brain chemistry there i would say pretty scary.
i'm starting to love tmg more and more i see vendors on markets and wanna ask them if they would just come to the loving tmg side of things it's the only garden that i know of that grows love happiness from lsd if that shit isn't majestical as fuck then sir i don't know what is deuces knuckle.
serendripity on june pmi've been using helix light and it seems good enough unless there's something better bitcloak is new and good  the owner the differences compared to other tumblers mixers like helix or payshield are many the amounts prediction javascript checks and pgp implementation are not present in others another big difference is speed no tumbler currently is this fast when sending clean coins like payshield it offers a pay someone feature for exact amounts payment.
astraltraveler on june amso i buy it from local with cash or someone else pays non cash for another one he sends it from local to helix and then from helix to market sure thats enough or helix to another helix what if cash its not optional give me some couple of a to c options thankslocal bitcoins has a variety of ways to buy coins the most anonymous would be meeting someone with cash or doing a cash deposit into a btc sellers account for a buyer you would be fine sending them from lbc to btc mixer to the markets sc.
i would strongly encourage you to use a different method of accessing the darknet especially if you plan on placing orders or encrypting your address.
yeah i have imported the key and everything.
i hope this isn't a silly question but is there an alternate url for ag i know a few other markets have given out alternate addresses since initially going down this last time i've only been able to log onto ag once since then and am not sure if i overlooked it or what.
best of luck guys did you drop the buyers fee in the end.
cidkid on july pmwell i dont follow that rule because the more lsd you take the more depth and spiritual awakening you find and if you can get that in one blotter instead of three well then you found yourself a bargainwhy would a vendor ever give you a better deal on stronger hits vendors just price in terms of dollars microgram for example john sells microgram hits for micrograms dollar and microgram hits for micrograms dollar you're only getting a better deal because you're buying more at once he sells microgram hits for or micrograms dollar i don't understand why people buy anything other than microgram hits.
although if you log into a public wifi your mac address would be recorded on that network so maybe the best case scenario would be to utilize the unprotected browser in tails.
never use this the posts above are correct if you are using a cellphone for darknet either you are a kid or are not opsec conscious enough and can land in serious trouble both financially and with the l.
doesn't sound all that world changing to me sounds like all the other markets with the word apple added on.
i hate seeing new markets having the evo design looks like a scam waiting to happe.
saw that no explanation as yet but agora had closed lips in downtime and it never did them any harm only strengthening their reputation think the yanks are still sleeping but i'm sure the reddit kids will get their popcorn out in the next hours.
bombheadie on march amjust an update all orders samples either were dropped off in the mail yesterday or today so expect your packs this week has anyone else received their packs besides xncsux or psymbionic.
ooh ooh i have relevant information so far as i am aware at the moment there are currently up markets not counting agora in addition to the ones you've listed outlaw market dream market drug market and abraxas ive got links to register for all of them on my blog which you can find the link for l l l ldown vthere.
vividsky on december amupdate yes there are pgp generating key tool apps i got one called pgptools and it works its anyone using a cellphone even with a 'pgp' app is a fool cellphones are without a doubt the most insecure platforms currently in existence canadian cops can decrypt pgp blackberrys toosource monday motherboard reported that leading dutch forensics investigators say they are able to read encrypted messages sent on pgp blackberry phones custom devices which are advertised as more suited for secure communication than off the shelf models a myriad of other law enforcement agencies would not comment on whether they have this capability but court documents reviewed by motherboard show that the royal mounted canadian police rmcp can also decrypt messages from pgp blackberrys this encryption was previously thought to be undefeatable one court document in a drug trafficking case reads referring to the pgp encryption used to secure messages on a blackberry device the rcmp technological laboratory destroyed this illusion and extracted from this phone e mails address book entries and other information all of which had been protected in another case from centering around charges of kidnap and assault three out of four blackberrys seized by the rcmp were analysed by the technical assistance team in ottawa and the contents were decrypted and reports prepared the court documents don t make an explicit reference to what brand of custom blackberry the seized devices were if at all but the documents do state that law enforcement were able to decrypt emails that had been encrypted with pgp from the device transcripts of many messages sent during the crimes are included in one of the court documents in the kidnapping case the suspects allegedly exchanged messages while following the target we have his car in sight in a underground reads one kk if its good do it is the reply the dutch investigators ability to obtain encrypted data from pgp blackberrys was first noted in december last year when blog misdaadnieuws com or crime news published documents supposedly sourced from the netherlands forensics institute nfi the nfi is a body that assists law enforcement in evidence retrieval according to the documents published by crime news the capability is reliant on forensics software sold by private company cellebrite although it is not totally clear how exactly the device and message encryption is bypassed in the canadian drug trafficking case court documents say the seized blackberrys had three levels of security entry was protected by a password the device was protected by encryption generally and e mails processed by this particular device were protected by pgp the rcmp may have brute forced the password if it was weak enough deployed a forensics technique called chip off to rip data from the phone's flash memory or used another method regardless the rcmp manged to obtain a wealth of data from the phones it seized after the publication of monday's article annie delisle a media relations officer from the rcmp told motherboard in an email that the rcmp does not generally provide information on techniques or technologies used in criminal investigations when reached tuesday sergeant media relations officer harold pfleiderer said we continue to decline comment on investigative techniques.
allahhuakbar on may amtime has come for us buyers to breakaway from centralized markets and put our trust in tmgwallet wallet with your favorite vendor is the way forward cheers to this.
i put the link to the blog on tor about the problem using ssl on a hidden service is stupid and unnecessary as tor makes it a connection by default the problem is from my understanding that openssl is used to generate the private key or how it hands the private key to the primary relay node but if you were using a server that had openssl pre or generated your key using openssl pre then you were unsafe for the hack to work the server would have had to directly connect to a node that was compromised an attacker the chances of that happening with the little time the bug was out meant that all of our servers were not identified but the locations were changed just to be safe and new url's were generated with proper openssl.
much improved over the previous iteration it would be nice to see listings build i am thinking about vending concentrates on there i think i'll need a vendor name that isnt poobuttfart thoug.
it's not even possible to log in atm because there is no captcha what's that all about.
liquifried on march amhi gang daytripper and others waiting did anything arrive yet wanting to order same next day shipout looks sounds great but we have a time limit if it actually takes two weeks there'll be a bunch of disappointed people somebody please tell me some good news lfno pack landing today i was instructed that my pack was dropped off on saturday and should be picked up last monday so now a full week has passed for shipping and nothing personally i'm close to writing this off as either a never sent b intercepted but perhaps i should give it the full days for us mail since i know bh is on the opposite coast and that is only fair but i've personally never had any mail that i've known about take days to get delivered when no storms weather incidents are occurring.
dont think rc and stuff are really welcome around here.
hey everyone i am trying to learn to navigate through tails i know that i must go to the 'applications' drop down at the top of the window select 'tails' then select 'configure persistent volume' but what to i do in order to keep my pgp keys and text files and anything else should i just select everything when i am configring the persistent volume any helpful input is greatly appreciated update i figured it out i'm not sure why it wasnt allowing me to create a persistent volume besides the following possibilities i was using another usb drive a lexar gb and maybe for some reason there is a bug in that type of drive i think there were more reasons but they have slipped my mind long day at school beer i'll update if i remember all the best.
it's v its got it lazy on my part language is a reflection of culture and culture changes over time to use outmoded language is improper in my opinion we don't use words such as thereupon anymore because they are superfluous figures of speech thereupon has no necessary meaning and really no meaning at all it is just word filler it's an old fashioned fancy equivalent of like a linguistic anacronism similarly the use of double negatives just obscures your true meaning and while they are english words they do no convey a clear meaning as the english language should historically this use of language served as a separation between economic and racial classes while i will admit there is still such a thing as class in modern society i am happy to say that language is not a barrier between them.
if you practise proper opsec then it should not even be a concern le or no le the question is what's the next biggest market sant.
terrantank on august pmwhy can't things just run smoothly i only got into these darknetmarkets about months ago and it's been nothing but chaos and bad news i guess that comes with the terroitory i'll be pressing on myself direct deals only though for now it's sort of always been chaos or bad news i means there are stints of good runs for weeks at a time sometimes but from the point sr went down one market after another goes.
yea i don't think the agora guys are going to scam exit but it will take them a couple weeks to move stuff around and get all their servers more secure it will be frustrating to have your coins in the ether for a while but my bet is agora will be back and all of your coins will still be there if you didn't manage to get them out in time before they shut down patience can be hard especially where coin is involved but don't freak out if you can help it.
anyone else not able to get on agora today was having troubles with the captcha earlier today but now the site wont load at all hope im not alone cheers s.
so im having some trouble im re establishing my buisness both on agora and tmg after i hit a rough patch i do not wish to discuss you may read about it in my other thread if you wish im starting out with a new email lelantos i've decided that slacking on email security is not going to cut it anymore i also was having trouble getting my dymo labelwriter to print through tails if someone can walk me through this that would be s.
sorry for confusing you dolmio it is middle earth who have this rule not agora my case was nothing to do with agora after all.
is abraxis a stable site to deposit withdrawl.
hey everyone update your pgp keys this was pointed out to me by another beautiful soul and realized they were right my key was old and leaked information like what operating system i had not a major issue but you may want to consider it some examples of old key headers showing operation system and versions version gnupg v gnu linux begin pgp public key block version gnupg v mingw begin pgp public key block version gnupg v mingw so take the few minutes to check you pgp and be safe update it and keep your old key in case someone needs to know you are who you are yes you can delete the header when you post but its still old this has been a public service message from the mist love ligh.
never track a pack through tor go to starbucks or somewhere with free wifi and check it cheers s.
very happy to read this oasis market seems to be hold all of the values that people look for in a market and i can't wait for it to continue to grow in popularity glad to hear your personal results.
mtsthelen on march pmwhat about safe bad anyone know from my point of view torbox's main weakness is its' character limitation on password length spitfir.
i have no idea about the volumetric dosing i still have yet to do any big doses of mxe meo ive found that low doses do what they have to do so i don't want to really get into the higher dosing i just want to take the minimum needed for it to make me happy one really great thing with meo is that it has eliminated certain pains in my body that make it incredibly hard to sleep or sometimes do stuff during the day just the other week i was looking for weed in order to sleep but now when i take meo it just makes everything go away and i'm able to actually fall asleep within an hour sorry to hear about your grandma truffle after it all wore off did it have any rebound effect making it any easier harder to deal with her death.
that was a piece of work and yes how did buyers not see that coming how long is a guy gonna move those numbersdon't blame nucleus it's the fucking piece of shit vendors that just keep it going there's scams on all marketsgolden rules if it looks too good to be true it probably is belive none of what you hear and half of what you see anything is.
on the streets i used an old android phone with no service and only messaged people using internet messaging services twitter kik ect and i wouldn't even talk business on it i'd just ask someone to meet up and we'll talk then.
where is the problem with bitcoiners getting traced never heard of one case.
saint nic on august amif you practise proper opsec then it should not even be a concern le or no le the question is what's the next biggest market santaho ho ho very true santa lots of love.
they always seem to come back and manually process btc transactions if need be or times it's happened now they must be making real good commission money.
i have had many successful transactions there the admins take a different approach towards problems but it all works well.
we have a lot tied up in escrow there at the moment as well but we are optimistic it doesn't feel like all the other exit scams before this sant.
i'm going to try to stick to direct deals on tmg.
is the address for blockchain info through tor i think you have to have java script enabled for most of the functions to work and use helix to wash coin.
anyone using bitblender or bitcoinfog lately just curious what is best edit i did a transaction through bitblender about btc worth cheap fees fast processing all super smooth.
idk agora is target by the fbi and other le a safe person i guess would stay off the markets entirely and see how things play out i just think it's kind of strange that none of the other markets are going down right now as well if its a tor problem then none of them are safe i saw someone post some link about some vulnerability that was found about a month ago this is definitely horrible news idk if we will ever see agora up and running again i haven't received my withdraw yet nor has the majority of people now the site is down for those brave enough to go to another market i would used each one of those before during agora downtime with success why can't things just run smoothly i only got into these darknetmarkets about months ago and it's been nothing but chaos and bad news i guess that comes with the terroitory i'll be pressing on myself direct deals only though for now.
pgp you definately need to read up on pgp it is a way to encrypt your messages and emails you can look up pgp info on the clearnet and many people use it in business and the like it stand for pretty good privacy good places to start is wiki will need a good pgp program and there are several different builds some are better for different platforms on some platforms it may take a while to figure out the program on mac for example using gngtools will install a few programs that you don't actually see the programs in applications and will have to go into your system settings to turn on a few options to be able to use it there are plenty of tutorials all over the clearweb you just need to work the search engines i would recomend not actually trying to buy anything illegal from anyone until you take the time to learn about privacy and encryption in might take a couple weeks to get the tools under your belt but it can protect you a lot more just remember you are never totally safe but you can do a lot of things to minimize being detected there are quite a few hacking sites and forums but some of them are going to require you to figure out a few other programs to get access to as well day for example has a hacking forum but you need to figure out jabber to be able to register.
root on may ami think the only marketplace that i can say i have no love for is alphabay i don't like a site devoted to theft of ones identity i have had multiple family members put into an endless cycle and a hole of debt trying to recover from identity theft other friend with ruined credit that made it hard to find a job and imposable to get a good rate on home purchase because they were taken advantage of in the same manor while i don't like the identity theft part either alphabay is actually the best darknet market currently for drugs they a large amount of listings and the site is almost always up with top notch ddos protection.
disable javascript and you'll be ok if you can't login with javascript disabled better forget about this site check for how to do it for the reason you could use tails or whonix if you don't already use a better way than those to connect to tor.
after testing marquis and sending it to labs it was discovered to be meo mip.
abraxas hands down russian based as well makes it a little more difficult for the dea to get involved no arms or forgeries ro russian gov't doesn't care as much as dea would highly recommend abraxas great support team as well here's a referral link for those interested.
galindoi on july pmagora is the bulk of my new customers but after an order or two most people are moving to direct deals i'm probably at agora and direct deals it has an ebb and flow to it galindoithanks for your response i look forward to doing business with you soon.
good it was a real pain to set it up manually.
alberthoffman on march pmare you working for agora defending them dude why the hell should i lie about swedish sek on my bitcoint wallet on agora that was stolen i read on other forums like reddit that it happened another guy to they stole hes money and they answered him on support that he had some keylogger virus that got into hes wallet thats bullshit my computer is secure as possible im working with it and computer in my eyes they are scammers and i wont deposit there anything morehow long ago did you send a message to support there and what did they say.
nuclues market seems my favorite.
have you ever heard of the textsecure texting app much better than regular messaging in terms of security but no cure all.
this tails update works as a charm best one so far make sure you backup that wallet seed somewhere safe other than your persistent drive cheers.
check if you are you using the latest tbb laters tails whonix if custom system are you sure your setup is good if you are unsure i'd advise to use tails from a dvdr on a second hand laptop with no hdd you can find that for cheap on craigslist you also could use whonix on a hard drive if your machine is powerful enough tails is great if you don't run it from a usb stick in that an attacker can't modify the system and each time you reboot you reboot clean as long as the original system you burn is not compromised you can use an encrypted usb stick to store your bookmarks in a text file your gpg key and everything that you could need whonix is great as it allow for better isolation if you safely store a copy of both images offline you will be able to start fresh from time to time to be sure you run a clean system.
it happened again here it is in full mon jun potentially dangerous connection one of your applications established a connection through tor to using a protocol that may leak information about your destination please ensure you configure your applications to use only socks a or socks with remote hostname resolution whats up doc.
dirtysouf on february pmtails devs have not renewed their pgp certificate they are well aware of this therefore you cannot verify the integrity of the tails iso try adding and certfying the tails key you'll see that it has expired despite showing a expire date in the only option for now is to use as many checksums as possible and downloading from multiple places i don't know where you're getting this from download the latest tails version from the pgp detached sig file from verify the iso file with the sig file gpg verify tails i iso sig tails i isogpg signature made fri feb pm utc using rsa key id a db gpg good signature from tails developers offline long term identity key gpg aka tails developers gpg warning using untrusted key spitfir.
i used it successfully even had to deal with admin and they were a pleasure to do business with some vendors have mentioned that they aren't logging in though so make sure that the vendor is active before you place an order.
thanks even more safe from usb without vm for the backdoor issuewhen used in windowstill not clear why many people use vm must be usefull maybe when using with linux good example the elicopter so like i thought only sees i browse tor and there are many reason people can use it not just for illegality if not wrong i read on the forum about tor exit nod are compromised really don't know much of iti immagine they can see tor ip or maybe they see all and decrypt everything you dogood day for everybod.
stay away i wouldn't even log onto the site it was left with nobody at the helm for several days before it went down then it pops back up with no explanation there is a strong possibility that it has been taken over by le with vendors and buyers of bulk being at the greatest risk.
astraltraveler on june amso i buy it from local with cash or someone else pays non cash for another one he sends it from local to helix and then from helix to market sure thats enough or helix to another helix what if cash its not optional give me some couple of a to c options has plenty of options to pay simply choose which one okpay vanilla reload moneygram etc helix to market wallet should be fine just make sure you do not attach your real name to your localbitcoins account.
sillywabbit on february amquote from uncleal on february amquote from sillywabbit on february pmvery likely although from the rise of other markets the fact that evo and agora are still up and the further development of p p networks like bitmessage etci doubt they can do much to stop it deter yes but those who are top notch in their opsec and know how to make robust websites the only shot they have is to get in on the inside like they did agree the cats already out of the bag and le knows it and that's percisely the reason why le turns to scare tactics because they know they can't do anything about it legally at least but more and more bills keep being brought up that would allow le and the nsa to infringe on our rights even more and this also needs to be addressed and stopped yep like who knows how about just warrantless opening of people's mail how about cameras installed in peoples' homes bathrooms floors in your body i think these leo will either continue on or maybe their policies will become some extravagant and rediculous that they will see the absurdity in it all especially when it is obvious none of it is bettering society in fact it will all just lead to greater discontent more acts of violence and revolt look at alcohol prohibition they need to just stop but i see the next step will be some kind of usps control system maybe a change in our internet laws but whatever we are in the digital age hackers rule and it cant be stopped freedom fighters will find a way around anything one thing i've wondered lately is there a noticeble surge in mail and even so it's just more of the same thing but im sure their is profiling and thats why vendors gotta switch it up allot make packs look plain and unassuming i jst dunno how vendors can just drop s of packs a week and not be suspect oh and maybe blue boxes will get replaced by control centers that are monitored with scanners that have cameras too it could get that crazymaybe a new decentrailized mail service is need.
lsd avengers spokesperson on january pmquote from doses lysergic on january amquote from dxuutx on december pmif anything this is more proof that hos or whoever is a major target of law enforcement and that we really shouldn't be talking about this business on the clearnet anywhere than any notion that the whole sub is just a honeypot i think the arrogant sense that people on the sub have that their crimes aren't worthy of targeting from law enforcement these are people who live to make drug arrests i also think it's a bit alarmist to assert that it exists only for this purpose and that no worthwhile discussion takes place thereon and it's not insignificant seemingly to me that hos didn't have any overt problems with reddit when the reviews were adulatory and the attitude changed when they started to turn critical lol speak english its not insignificant it is not not significant when you use a double negative you obscure your meaning thereon this word has been used not since again not one knows what the fuck not insignificant' again that 'hos didn't' have a problem when the reviews were positive adulatory if you yern to be not unlike leo tolstoy well then i'll just not continue writing now thanks professor dl some of my friends try to say as many double negatives in one sentence i aint got no nothing or anything to say sometimes but i try anywho my post has nothing to do with hos and they are not the messenger the bottom line is no one should be posting anything about dnm on reddit period my initial reaction is not opposed to your proposition the discussion of our present cloak and dagger endevours should be kept not on this superflous clearnet reddit.
i feel like this should be shared on other forums as well i see many vendors posting on reddit now and it kills me to know they could be setting themselves up for an investigation.
according to someone on here i'm sending out terrible messages when i encrypt them i sent one to ootd on here and a few others and i hope this hasn't been an issue i don't know what the fuck is going on right now and i'm flipping shit i just want to buy some drugs man not have more complications.
well evolution abraxas and middle earth were not run by carders as far as we know but they exit scammed ab is the biggest market right now and everyone who got phished is complaining maybe there are some real problems and bugs going on but i don't see any other market who constantly improve things in favor of their customers they improved their security and always adding features what i see is other markets constantly bashing ab to get bad reputation and i think they won't exit scam just because they're carders they need the community they created.
is tor that effective when it comes to wallets and anonymity to my understanding tor only disguises the activity you're doing but anyone who's eavesdropping at the exit node can get my ip pretty easily so if i use tor for my electrum wallet the electrum servers may not know where the coins came from but le can always know it by watching the exit nodes could it really be haha i guess i'm too paranoid  crepuscular on february pmbut for people who may have trouble getting coins that are totally unlinked to them maybe some information about different tumbling options advantages disadvantages current status reputation etc would be helpful btw i second this i think about new tumbling methods since btcfog at least according to what i read on reddit is latelz being sketchy as fuck.
is tails only for linux based systems.
my withdrawal pin is not working on ab i have not used it in months but it is correct has anyone had issues of their correct withdrawal pin on ab not working i do not have the mnemonic from account creation either so i cannot reset it.
on two occasions when loggin into tmg i got this one of your applications established a connection through tor to using a protocol that may leak information about your destination my setup is as tight as can be and i never got that warning before on any site never years using tor never saw that before any advice please thank you.
early june.
dolmio on july amquote from rasputin on june pmwhich are the biggest and most popular of the markets at this time agora is the biggest and best look no futher agora has it all cheers dolmio error cannot register at this time user limit reached please wait until the full release.
is it just me or does this market looks exactly like evo.
eden on august amwe have some ug doses laid with like ug of lsd tartrate these are some fire tabs and are laid with a special blend these are cool because you can get one hit and either share it with a couple friends or have the trip of a lifetime a lot of dots and blots back in the day were ug so some people like having the option for some old school hits ug what made you roll with that they sound exquisite.
why not using qubes os comes with whonix easy to use possibility to chain vpns easily vm are read only so it would make it harder for an attacker to modify your system than using ubuntu.
tmg doesn't use ssl it seems so they're unaffected not sure which if any darknet sites do use ssl but i imagine it'd be a huge hassle you could self sign but that would alarm so many people when their browsers start yelling at them about it and i imagine it'd be hard to get one signed for an onion domain from the various ca's out there.
well people could be worried about backdoors in their encryption software allowing commands to be executed in memory or scripts of some kind malware is so common through other vectors that people are over protective of their os' this is good but windows pcs will crash if you fart i used symantec pgp for a while until i found out it might be less secure i'm almost sure this was an error in generating your key.
i believe cosmic consciousness has some ug tabs on alphabay i haven't personally bought from him yet because of his higher prices but he seems legit.
you have everything you need right here.
it came back up within a couple hours.
sorry if it sounds stupid but what is pgp i really appreciate your help one more thing i was wondering where i can find like a site that talks about hacking or an underground hacking place or forum or something thanks again.
i have to make a transaction on ab but i'm wondering if i have to go though with it or notthe scam reports are making me uneasy.
unit on may pmu i couldn't agree more i've already swore to myself i'm sticking to micro transactions from now on i'd rather have btc on the line than what i had put myself into and exactly i've never felt comfortable with sharing that i even use the market with anybody but close close close friends when they would like help with using it or want me to over see a transaction for them i let them know i risk my money when i use these marketplaces so when you want to use them you're risking your money too basically saying i'll do my best to make sure they get a clean transaction but if it goes to hell in a hand basket which i've seen happen very easily it's not up to me to fix or compensate anything for them unit i also use markets for mostly btc deals its less of a worry and below a certain amount is imo much less dangerous than a larger amount some may say that it requires more orders to get the same amount but i'd rather get caught with a oz decriminalized amounts in some places of bud than a whole zip or qp not that it matters if the feds get you but if you get pulled over with it then unless you live in the deep south just a ticket the same is true for rl i used to have this strategy when buying weed i'd go to my dealer and if i was getting a half or a zip i would never tell them first i'd check it out and if the weed was sub par i'd just get a dub or a slice there are exceptions like if i wanted some primo bud from a vendor like cultmadeline who only sells oz's but their bud is fire and they are trusted even then i'd rather direct deal one thing about direct deals though i would place a very basic order one item and maybe a small cheap second but you don't need to make it confusing or overly complicated final note there are some things that make sense to buy in bulk the one thing i don't is with mdma i don't have many friends who do it although getting rid of it is easy the reason i don't is that i know that for myself i will do higher doses and more often if i bought a whole g if i had friends who would buy it i could sell it very fast for a nice profit most of my friends don't even know if the 'molly' they got of some uni student was real mdma and are averse to pills never had good ones or think they are cut thanks to pop culture its crazy smart people too that is what is so liberating about dnms you don't have to take what everyone else in your area or circle of friends does it cuts through ignorance like a machete love and light acid.
you know what they say about never trusting a carder.
hang on as i jump up on my soap box i always feel that it is important to provide some awareness about i know how good they can make one feel and i know that they provide much needed relief to a great number of people i am reasonable and respect their value to man and animal alike however like most things those benefits aren't free when it comes to benzos just be aware how quickly those tiny little fucking pills will snatch your life you will never hear me tell anyone what to do or not to do when it comes to any meds but be aware that these are some of the most powerful chemicals that you can ingest they will change your life if you consume them with any frequency and when you stop you will get the cunt punt of your life delivered in the form of seizures and a very unique detox if you get past the seizures the detox is one of the gnarliest emotional rollercoaster rides that one can take and it aint a short ride we are all different in the ways in which our bodies react to chemicals clearly but in my experience what i have described is universal i hope that i am wrong but please respect benzos and be safe as you can be safe and well.
what about safe bad anyone know.
just seeing this now after being here for quite a while thank you but this should really be default shouldn't it.
hey guys i am a vendor on other marketplaces and i figured i may as well try and expand my horizons a little bit i currently offer a bookie service that allows anyone to place bets just like they were in vegas on any sport even cricket for any dollar increment at any time payouts are given right away but we do sleep too so hours max is required at most btc betting using full escrow is actually much safer than dumping money into pokerstars or full tilt who have proven themselves to be shady as well either way i just figured id ask before i buy a vendor account because everyone loves this service dating back to sr please chime in and let me know what you think.
i apologize if i am out of place why are you running and not.

salviagoddess on july pmquote from doseheavy on july amtake the shroom juice first when you start to feel it and trip take the ug after another hours eat the mdma this way it all ends at the same time and you dont have a crash in the middle of the lsd trip you may want to get some dmt to vape at the end of the trip hours if you want them to end at the same time you would need to take the lsd first lsd can last hours where psilocybin lasts i agree that crashing on mdma while tripping on lsd is not pretty probably one of the worst experiences of my entire life i call it the candyflop the psilocybin is used to start the trip and releive the possibility of anxiety thats why when it is felt the lsd is eaten then later the mdma that way the whole trip ends at the same time to re lighten up the visuals dmt would be preferred it also has an interplay with the seratonin mechanism that allows for a much less hung over feeling.
ch m ra on june pmhey uncleal i would reccommend using a separate usb key cd dvd microsd for keys and other sensitive things that you need to have encrypted persistent volumes never sit well with me take this analogy i see all these cell phone cases that double as wallets holding credit card ids money etc if someone were to steal your cell phone they would now have access to your complete identity since tails is amnesic if you do not use the persistent volume you will be able to keep all your other files separate tails itself is not illegal one more thing an sd card is extremely easy to destroy chew microwave swallow the possibilites are endles if you have any other questions feel free to ask cthanks friend i'm not really good with this kinda stuff it took me forever to figure out how to install tails on usb i wish there was just one single package you can just install and all your opsec needs are taken care of i guess tails is the closest thing to that but it seems like there are a million other things when you go around the deep web and see what everyone else talks about.
i'm sure you are correct most of the mods are carders and thieves who don't need a second invitation to steal someone's coins.
bl cksm th on july amquote from the hippie on july can be a real problem too little isn't enough and too much isn't enough glad i haven't done any in almost a year alcohol is my next one feel sort of proud not buying a six pack earlier with meth its never enough and the hangover is the worst my problem drugs is weed lolim kidding its not a drug and its not addictive but i think i'm addicted to the habit of smoking weed probably because i've been smoking every day to rolls for more than years and also the addiction can come because i mix tobacco with weed it might made me feel addicted to weed where it might be the nicotine that i crave i really don't know same boat i thought that weed and tobacco are a different drug this mix was called dope once only thing is that i've been doing this for the last years of my life and as offending as it may sound i find weed to be a drug worst than a drug even does not leave a mark really fast but it stains and the thing that it burns out like gas and gets consumed the fastest of all drugs that i know makes it even worst although it's my source of living and even if i find it similar to some medicine from time to time it's still a drug to me and the only one that i had problems with quiting it's fuckin hard from my point of view because my brain was feed with this since early age and it crystallized with this form of food i will always crave for it no matter what so if u wanna live a life with no cravings try to do drugs after the age of because the brain it's formed enough at that point to overcome what the hand and mouth couple might throw in love u guys keep spreading light sassnaps had liters of ketamine down my veins and muscles when i was a kid and probably fuckin grams on the nose don't feel like i've lost that much and also never felt that this dirty cheap way of getting out of the daily routine can be approached as a psychedelic it's a dissociative drug all the way let it be dirt there is nothing to be praised about it peace.
i remember reading somewhere that sharedcoin on blockchain isn't as good as the proper tumbling services will try and remember and post the lin.
i have used pay shield a few times now with no problems its super easy to use i like it so far.
yes too many altcoins but very few focused on real privacy and anonymity and even few that succeed to reach this goal safely try cloak and xmr as i said i think dash coin doesn't evolve good and i don't believe anymore in sdc coin for many reasons too loang to explain i follow it for years even if you need btc to buy xmr when you use xmr or convert again xmr or cloak to btc somewhere esle the btc link to your original identity is totally broken the trail is definitively lost for any people who wants to trace you and prove you are guilty.
for information cloakcoin cloak is re branding into project one or one currency onec only a change of name nothing else change see to be confused with the one coin scam it's something else totally not sure this re branding with this new name is a good idea but their anonymous system doesn't change and is good wait and see.
for info.
ohdonpiano on november pmbecause the thread was started in augustand facepalm.
lol nuke didn't sell anything to dhl nuke was run by bunch of incompetent peoples i was pretty sure at a point their mods were just copy pasting standard replies onto a dispute thread some gibberish i couldnt remember but two different mods posted the same generic response who sold what evolution probably sold their logo to nucleus wont be surprised if it were the same lot of mods who were left out and jobless from evo admin after kimble verto pulled their shit its downright stupid to trust a market thats been hacked yet people keep trusting market with escrow a vendor apparently lost over gees on an order its tough luck but gotta be smart ahead of the market.
i have noticed that a great number of you appear to be using safe mail net as your email provider of choice i would strongly urge you to re consider on january forbes contributer runa a sandvik published an article entitled the email service the dark web is actually using you can read this article at i reached out to safe mail for comment amiram ofir safe mail s president and ceo responded in an email that the company and its employees certainly are not aware of any criminal activity adding that the company does follow court orders that are issued in israel by an israeli court any other law enforcement agency should contact the israeli authorities it s worth noting however that israel signed a mutual legal assistance treaty mlat with the u s in an mlat request was used to image the silk road web server according to the criminal complaint of sept ofir told me that communications between users and the web service are ssl protected and that information stored on the server is encrypted with user specific keys when asked if safe mail has received court orders issued by an israeli court on behalf of a non israeli law enforcement agency such as the fbi ofir replied with a short yes my followup email asking if safe mail has the ability to decrypt information without a user s key went unanswered you can bet your life that if safe mail's owners operators didn't know about any criminal activity before being contacted by forbes they sure as hell know about it now they may or may not have known about the huge number of people from silk road and other dnms using their service but the forbes article if nothing else will have forced them to take action lest they be considered complict if they do nothing to curb such activity it would not surprise me in the slightest to learn that emails are now scanned for certain keywords certain patterns of usage may now be flagged as well on agora there is one vendor who claims his safe mail account was disabled or shut down meaning he can no longer access it my tests have shown this account is still active meaning that messages sent to this account are likely being collected by the authorities for vendors especially please remember that even if you use pgp the header information is not encrypted or protected the authorities even if they cannot read your messages nevertheless know who wrote to you and when spitfir.
yea i just saw an article on deepdotweb earlier about this who incident i'm glad that justice is finally being served i never used sheep marketplace but it pains me that so many people lost money hopefully the heavy hand of justice will fall upon kimble and verto now.
does anyone know which of the current markets have the biggest userbase and the most listings.
yeah i got mine after day.
ok i quit being lazy for a second and just looked up how to default this off for all new members this just tested out successfully for a new user on a test forum edit the file sources register phparound line right above registration options are always default options add this regoptions 'extra register vars' 'show online' it already knew that was a potential possible registration option so maybe there's a simpler way to do it but it works so that would obviously cover all new user registrations but you would still want to run that query to disable it for all existing users just once update smf members set show online obviously use whatever your forum table prefix is if not smf i try to forget how horrible php is so hopefully someone actually runs with this and the minutes it took to check this out wasn't in vain.
i use that its annoymous and works great.
helix is safe from my experience i have only used it once for less than a hundred us dollars for the advice earth.
thanks guys well i know it's not just me because there is a thread on the agora forums about it everyone's getting it i'm just new to agora so got a bit worried.
what is the urlfor oasis market.
guardian on march amso test kits would not be an approved item since it is not listed am i reading that correctly i think i can safely say test kits would be ok well known test kits not something you make just to be clear.
method of anonymizing bitcoin has even been recommended by bitcoin core developer peter todd for more information on how monero protects your privacy you can visit monerinfo the role of monero in anonymizing your bitcoin will become more important as companies like elliptic and bitcluster use advanced blockchain analysis that will be able to pierce the veil of obscurity offered by traditional bitcoin mixers.
for me it was alcohol it had taken over my life so much that it had actually gotten me into trouble with the authority a mixture of depression hopelessness and a really high roughly ug dose of lsd is what got me out of that pit it's not really what i'd recommend to treat your alcoholism especially when your troubles with it is just a week fresh but let's just say that i had much much darker intentions when i carelessly took the lsd tabs in the end instead of seeing hopelessness in life and beauty in death i ended up seeing hope and beauty in life that was christmas night i have still had the occasional urges especially if i get stressed but i have not drank since that night sometimes what i'll do is pour myself a glass of up and pretend that it's southern comfort something that i used to like drinking.
my number market atm is abraxas iv loved it since the start i can see its only going to get bigger and bigger with more and more drugs for us cheers dolmi.
looked at it no links work no products shi.
did you find out which ios app is a pg.
when you find it let me know we are currently looking for any and all information regarding the arthur colton company out of detroit mi usa that made a power triturate machine these were said to be the best at making microdots.
moreau on march amapple market is too basic for me i couldn't see any filters for searching the product listings don't have the names of the vendors there doesn't seem to be a feedback facility i checked out one of their star vendors the star rating is from their grams profile there was no information about when they were last online and no sales history if it's still around in three months time i'll maybe take another look to see if there have been any improvements agreed its too simple plus needs a lot more vendor.
hi as spoken on and on i would like you to realize there are easy ways to tumble your btc and break the btc link to your identity first way on shapeshift com with your btc from a wallet a buy monero xmr altcoin and send the xmr to a new mymonero com online wallet account secure and safe don't worry nothing is saved it's like a paper wallet wait hour and on shapeshift com buy btc with xmr from your mymonero com wallet and send directly the btc from shapeshift com to your vendor or to a btc wallet b you own safe and perfect new bitcoins not linked to you in any way second way from your xmr wallet go to give a btc receiver address vendor your wallet and an amount of btc max btc for now and send xmr to it will convert the xmr into fresh new anonym btc and send them to the btc receiver address xmr to works on tor third way you can also buy xmr on poloniex with your btc and then convert them into btc on shapeshift or xmr to the result is you are sending new fresh btc not linked to your identity in any way to a btc address of your choice combining shapeshift com as entry for your btc xmr and xmr to as exit for your xmr btc is even more safe even if only shapeshift is enough for example hope it can help you improve your security don't hesitate to ask on to other people who are technically better than me maybe even the xmr team will directly answer you but i'm quite sure of what i write i'm not linked to monero team in any way i only love privacy and after a lot of readings and researches i understood this altcoin is the rare and best one to really give you anonymity and protect your privacy it has been audited and has proved itself cloakcoin in second choice but services are less developped for now.
just sent through bit blender i'll report back with the results let's hope this works seems like everything is going smoothly so far peace mrs b.
electrum already uses change addresses which makes it harder to be tracked back to your wallet nothing is safe.
ssod on june amcurrently i am connecting to the darknet via tails tor bridges i feel as this is not a very safe unless i am wrong anyone have any advice on additional security measures to protect my real ip i get bulk so safety is a big concern to me let me know if my lack of faith in bridges is invalid though tails is not secure for serious dnm activities and here's the first reason why usa feds have already conducted tor attacks that have landed significant dnm figures behind bars the above article has more details about how the feds did it and who they have arrested so far a former silk road lieutenant for starters also tor bridges are practically useless for hiding from the nsa because the nsa harvests the tor bridge addresses from the emails send to from the tor project the nsa knows you're using tor anyways if you're using a tor bridge tor bridges were designed for people in repressive third world countries not us citizens hiding from the nsa it also gets worse and this is information that every dnm user serious or small should know about but since the edward snowden leaks the nsa has talked about if not bragged that they have timing attacks for de anonymizing tor users at the nsa in the washington post revealed that the nsa had figured out various ways of unmasking and penetrating the anonymity of the tor network since according to a page research paper titled simply tor the agency has worked on several methods that if successful would allow the nsa to uncloak anonymous traffic on a wide scale effectively by watching communications as they enter and exit the tor system rather than trying to follow them inside one type of attack for example would identify users by minute differences in the clock times on their computers and it still gets worse tor prioritizes fast relays and so if you consider that plausibly speaking many and possibly most of the most high speed tor relays are run by western intelligence agencies and not just grassroots tor volunteers it makes timing attacks so much easier for them from the pando com article from above quotein tor co founder roger dingledine revealed that the tor network is configured to prioritize speed and route traffic through through the fastest servers nodes available as a result the vast bulk of tor traffic runs through several dozen of the fastest and most dependable servers on today's network clients choose one of the fastest exit relays around of the time and of their choices come from a pool of relays this information above has already been public since the edward snowden leaks so now everyone reading this has no excuse not to get off tails and learn ubuntu or your other favorite flavor of linux and start using a reputable vpn impeccable track record of standing up against government requests keeps no logs and you can pay them in bitcoins you can start on this now or end up like the silk road lieutenant who got arrested because his tor connection got de anonymized by the government to what was probably his home ip address and if you're a serious dnm user you don't do business hours a day online from a public wifi spot this is not an acceptable solution for power users bonus points if you use a pre paid g hotspot with your non tails flavor of linux a reputable vpn where your face was never on camera buying the hotspot think fake wig cell phone at home and paid in cash.
nice addition to the garden and those are all great psychedelics.
tails itself is a linux system it will work with a machine that already has windows installed because it ignores whatever operating system is already installed at start up any and all information used by the computer comes from that removeable disk and on shutdown there's no trace of what the computer was used for to contribute a bit to the discussion after i read about how they caught ross i've added a simple addition to my opsec i use a usb thumb drive with a split ring on it a lanyard goes around my wrist if someone grabs my laptop the drive is pulled out and any info is gone.
they don't really have fa though many have requested it they have optional pgp login but you can't set it up so that no one can login without both password and pgp so its kind of weak.
i tried it out when it was first created the taint analysis left much to be desired over traditional tumblers i use helix light from the grams website and have never had any issues.
if it was on the hidden wiki its pretty much guaranteed to be a phishing scam site what are you looking for i'm sure there's a vendor here that probably sells it.
regarding rotating your bridges entry points msh points to valuable resources if you don't want to enter bridges info on every startup you can put the bridges data in the torrc file for tor browser bundle check tor browser bundle directory browser torbrowser data tor torrc file in tails it should be in etc tor torrc iirc.
imo one of the safest ways is tor xmpp otr basically put xmpp handles the chatting tor handles the anonymity otr handles the privacy encryption.
gleeful on june pmquote from vitaminlsd on june amtails is not secure for serious dnm activities and here's the first reason why usa feds have already conducted tor attacks that have landed significant dnm figures behind bars the above article has more details about how the feds did it and who they have arrested so far a former silk road lieutenant for starters also tor bridges are practically useless for hiding from the nsa because the nsa harvests the tor bridge addresses from the emails send to from the tor project the nsa knows you're using tor anyways if you're using a tor bridge tor bridges were designed for people in repressive third world countries not us citizens hiding from the nsa it also gets worse and this is information that every dnm user serious or small should know about but since the edward snowden leaks the nsa has talked about if not bragged that they have timing attacks for de anonymizing tor users what does this breach have to do with tails isn't it just a live version of linux is it because it's not designed to be used with a vpn and that vpns are the safest way to access tor i'm not disputing what you're saying i just don't understand it thanks basically yea you want to always use a vpn before tor and tails doesn't have built in vpn support so unless you're using a vpn router like how cosmic consciousness explained then if your tor connection ever gets de anonymized they would see your home ip or wherever you're connected from and that by itself has been enough to land some unlucky people in jail and prison like the silk road lieutenant from that article the nsa even brags about how it can de anonymize tor users so not using a vpn first is like going out and having sex with women a night without a condom and hoping you don't get an std after a year one of the worst ways you can be de anonymized is like this tor basically uses three hops to send your data to the final destination node the first node or the guard node node the middle node node the exit node so if you log in to reddit com through tor using the same username you buy with on the markets with your connection without a vpn would look like your home ip tor node tor node tor node redditbut if you got unlucky and the government runs all three of those tor nodes and your tor prioritizes the fastest tor nodes tor node would know your home ip but not the contents of your connection tor node would also know that it's sending data on to tor node tor node knows that it received a connection from tor node although it doesn't know what the contents are tor node also knows that its sending data to tor node tor node finally sends your data to reddit tor node can always see your data in plaintext for any website not just reddit unless that connection to the website used even if your web traffic to reddit is all sent over encrypted to the reddit server tor node knows that this is one of the reddit servers for instance because in the connection during the ssl tls handshake the reddit server openly says says before everything gets encrypted that this server belongs to reddit if reddit has been put under some type of government gag order to give all ip addresses login times to the feds the feds would know you logged in through tor but if the feds are doing de anonymization attacks right now if tor node was one of their own they could see this connection to reddit and tor node knows it received a connection from tor node and tor node knows it made a connection to tor node likewise if we roll this back one more time tor node knows that it received a connection from tor node and tor node knows that it made a connection to tor node at a very specific point in time down to the second then finally tor node knows this connection came from your home ip address this is how the feds can de anonymize you if they control your entire tor circuit your tor node but the nsa even brags that it can de anonymize people just based off when you made your tor connection combined with when the request came out of the tor exit node so it's possibly they don't even need to control your entire tor circuit for that connection just run one of the tor node 's and use their nsa mass surveillance visibility to know when a connection came out of one of the tor nodes plus they can combine this roughly with the size of the encrypted data being sent back to you to narrow down how large the page you viewed was which can help them pinpoint you even closer with this second method i think the second one is sloppier but the nsa was caught bragging from information in the edward snowden leaks that this method still works ubuntu is really easy to learn i highly recommend it as an alternative to tails if you've only ever relied on tails before mullvad the vpn provider even has a linux client for their vpn you basically just click a button and it connects they're probably the best commercial vpn provider in my book you can pay them in bitcoins the only personally identifiable information with them is a numeric account id they keep no logs and they have repeatedly told off governments when they asked for information about users and they know the people who run their sweden data center and they used their own hardware for the nodes there so the usa government can't just show up there with a gag order and take one of their vpn server's hard drives with their ssl private keys on it like they could possibly to vpn servers here in america regardless of what company runs the vpn server ubuntu has all the bells and whistles that tails has and there is an enormous amount of documentation available for you you can find the answer to just about any problem in ubuntu by search engine ing xyz ubuntu you can also give it a full disk encryption password during your ubuntu install.
i just spoke to a vendor i like to use he said its the site having trouble not an exit scam hopefully this puts minds at ease a littl.
rec on july amproblem i see is that as not many people use it there isn't much you can do with those and you can't blend in with thousand users as it is possible with btc hi that's a good point but about monero for example there is enough people already using monero and the daily volume of trafic is high enough transactions previous week and the monero system is designed to be private without vpn or tor an isp can see you are connected to monero network and could maybe see monero trafic transactions but can never tell to who you send xmr or from who you receive them and the transferred coins are automatically mixed by the system they can not be traced unlike btc the blockchain is opaque and crypted only you your wallet with a private key of an outgoing transaction can log in the xmr blockchain to decrypt and trace only this one transaction of you today on poloniex monero is the second coin after ethereum in volume of btc there are less people using cloakcoin network now and the daily volume of cloak is low traded on bittrex but it's the same monero is also a perfect way to tumble or anonymize the btc you bought with a link to your real indentity see my post or.
hias bitcoin is really not anonymous for example see or i believe it s time to think to switch to decentralized altcoin s specifically designed to protect privacy and anonymity i would like to speak about monero xmr and cloakcoin cloak i m not linked in anyway to these coins or teams there is also dash and shadowcash sdc altcoins but the first is centralised on a few masternodes and now seems to focus on zerotime transactions rather than true privacy anonymity and it seems to be a civil war inside the dev team and supporters and about the second well i really don t believe in shadowcash for various reasons that s all i don t want to launch a debate here on what coin is better than another it s only my own opinion cloackcoin has a small team of fanatic devs that seems never to give up event after a first year of catastrophic problems and many nightmares and a second year of very slow but constructive work they just released the good final product as promised for a long time you can exchange cloak on or buy directly on there is a gui wallet windows linux easy to use and with all the basic needed functions you would need without any useless stuff they have a decentralized anonymous market in development but as i begin to know them it should not be ready before years but before that a new improved wallet should be released very soon short video explanation about their anonymity system an interesting publication of still very good download of the complete blockchain to start quickly the wallet instead of slow first scroll down block explorer believe cloakcoin should not be ignored as a way to secure and anonymize your financial transactions i think the anonymity privacy protection of their system is quite good whatever nothing could be worse than bitcoin after all stand alone or in association with vpn and tor so give cloakcoin his chance try it the forum and chat is quite active and they should answer all your questions beside that there is the monero altcoin entirely new concept maths and cryptos while i think cloakcoin is great trustable and easy i believe xmr is technically superior and even more bullet proof than cloak but for now monero is a little bit less user friendly on first approach only a little the dev team is bigger as well as the project and universe globally and the devs are very active improving again and again monero even if now it s already probably the top best anonymous coin progress is slow because of the complexity of all the involved technics but xmr works well and is already fully useable homepage for all os command line party gui wallet online wallet really safe no risks to be hacked or loose your xmr but i m not going to speak about here great official offline wallet generator save the page to your computer disconnect from internet open the file of page or refresh and an extensive guide for securely generating an offline cold paper wallet accept monero payments you should have full support from community to integrate monero payment gateway on your website blockchain block explorer is a great monero service really underestimated works on tor it allows you to send anonymous monero to this website it converts them to bitcoins and after that sends the bitcoins to a btc address you gave it s better than all the bitcoin tumblers the api used is fully given here the best exchange for monero is and is really usefull too so i think cloak is directly easy intuitive and great for people to people transactions or small scale webshops and xmr is also very easy but needs maybe hours of readings and even more secure and the priority choice for big webshops monero should be the best choice for integration as payment gateway in a darknet webshop all the doc you need is should be available and if not the devs are going to help you very well and fast be assured maybe don t mention them it s for a dark market cloakcoin could also be integrated in webshop as automated payment gateway i think but i m less sure you ll get all the technical infos or answers very quick i really believe that darknet markets should move away from bitcoin and use cloakcoin or monero maybe survival of this second coin is more guaranteed for many years to come cloak is still smaller less spread and fragile but exists for years or at least propose to customer to pay by cloakcoin or xmr beside btc in addition as alternative their choice an education time will be needed to convert customers but they should quickly understand it s for the safety of everyone and you sellers too i hope i may have helped about bitcoin privacy anonymity monero xmr altcoin safe and easy ways to tumble btc ways.
warningi got a massage from a very trusted vendor and they asked me not to say who it was for thier security this is a warning part from his massage do not use reddit please spread everywhere that reddit darknet markets is just a honeypot all arrests or whatever it was the only thing in common was having posting there scripts as ever are still not safe in fact the tor project themselves should be notifed about that reddit registration page and figure it out i guess i dont have tell anyone here that but its good to remind you dont use the same name on the dn for any clearnet sites and dont buy drugs there just asking for troublebe safelsdaacid.
if u figure this out maybe u let us all know we are all confused that's why we come here on the other hand reading never hurt anybody ohm.
i guess finding us here proves we already saw how we can handle this cryptocurency issue for me btc rules and offers enough privacy and anonymity good of u to think educate us on this will consider this when all will align thanks.
using the veracrypt backend makes it encrypted whonix is better than tails imho.
why would you use tails you can make a more secure setup on your own use a larger usb stick like gb.
doseheavy on december amwhy would you use tails you can make a more secure setup on your own use a larger usb stick like gb for the info can you explain how this is more secure than tails always on the lookout for ways to be more secure.
bonobo on january amon multisig haha xd it seems a bit complicated to me as well though but i want to be free from sending coins on market excrow mind you i dont order often just once in a while but that tends to be a medium large sized orderwhy not just order direct then.
bombheadie it looks like you are logged in now any update you can provide to the group can you confirm all packs were sent as expected.
mtsthelen on march pmwhat about safe bad anyone know anyone correct me if i'm wrong here but from what i understand as long you do these things you should be okay even with a clearnet provider like yahoo or something as long as it allows access through tor it should be fine as long as everything is properly encrypted never log in to your email account over the clearnet tor only encrypt encrypt encrypt and encrypt some more everything remember that subject lines and everything thats not inside the actual pgp message can easily be seen by a rd party nothing sensitive that could compromise your identity make sure you have pgp set up i reccommend tails on a usb and also some obvious things like don't re use any psuedonyms for the email address that you've used before that could link to any other clearnet accounts on forums or anything that could be used to link you from my understanding as long as an email provider allows access over tor and you encrypt your shit up tight then you should be good to go hope this helps a little peace mrs b.
gardener on june pmmaybe some vpn providers can be trusted but it's hard to tell before there is an actual problem their claims are mostly marketing in my opinion the market is competitive who would be stupid enough to admit logging and who would go to jail to protect a month user i mean mullvad already has a history of denying government requests and the usa doesn't have any jurisdiction to jail a swedish vpn provider and for contrast a lot of vpn providers do admit up front to logging like hidemyass mullvad's co founder was the first person that we publicly know of to successfully exploit the heartbleed vulnerability against openvpn this is one thing they have standing out for them above all other vpn providers why they're worthy of your business they take cash in the mail too that's how you know they're serious about protecting their users' privacy  gardener on june pmi don't know swedish law their claims can be true but they could be greedy entrepreneurs logging as much as they can to be on the safe side or even a honeypot sadly we have no way to tell i sincerely believe mullvad isn't logging anything when a vpn provider throws somebody under the bus like hidemyass did with that lulzsec member everybody hears about it there has not been one story ever of mullvad giving up any information about even a single user likewise with hidemyass this was their excuse for their actions  our vpn service and vpn services in general are not designed to be used to commit illegal activity it is very naive to think that by paying a subscription fee to a vpn service you are free to break the law without any consequences since mullvad is a vpn provider and based in sweden they're not even legally obligated to keep logs under the eu data retention directive because in sweden this doesn't apply to vpn providers ianal but they can't even be legally forced to keep logs on users and i've seen no indication that they are their entire reputation and business depends on it if a lavabit style situation ever happened mullvad has already stated they would rather discontinue their business if they were somehow forced to give up information on any user  gardener on june pmmullvad software seems to only create firewall rules to block anything that's not going through vpn network interface setting up iptables to do this would work as good if you can figure out how to do this in iptables yourself please share this since this would be a big benefit to the community this iptables configuration is on my bucket list to get working not for mullvad's sake but for the sake of other vpns i use but i haven't started working on these iptables rules yet  gardener on june pmrestoring an image is nice but if the host is compromised your image can be compromised too a skilled attacker could escape the vm a dvd can't be compromised by a distant attacker the bios could be but it's harder and probably not worth it to catch a small time buyer if the host is ever compromised your entire box including your vms are compromised too then so don't let your host get compromised with a tails setup your main threat model is not a compromised dvd but a zero day exploit against tor browser on tails you have no extra layers of security compared to doing everything in vms if a zero day exploit compromises your tor browser on tails your entire os including your pgp private keys your pgp private key passwords your decrypted keepass entries after you unlock your keepass all of this is theoretically accessible to the attacker now and if the government is doing some sneaky shit going after tails users to get after say serious people in the drug trade then these above things would be the keys to the castle that the feds would target on a tails system with this vm setup i described all you would pretty much ever do with your host os at that point is install ubuntu security updates and that's it and you should do it over a vpn that has cover traffic over it too so the government can't profile you that you run ubuntu on one or more systems from your house or what packages you keep updated the ubuntu packages you install from apt are signed too so if your initial ubuntu iso you installed was a legitimate one the signed packages you're downloading from ubuntu should be legitimate as well for an attacker to compromise your host os through the vm you're basically talking about a zero day exploit against either tor browser or firefox if you use noscript correctly plus a privilege escalation exploit against your virtual machine software to get the bad guy to root this is basically just not going to happen but running everything in a vm like this gives you another huge layer of security because they'd need the privilege escalation exploit and then also the vm breakout exploit and if they didn't know you do everything from vms then the chances of an attacker having this type of vm breakout exploit against a patched ubuntu vm and up to date virtual machine software is practically non existent we're talking about possibly hundreds of hours of exploit development work if there's even a vm breakout exploit that is possible when the vm is a patched ubuntu install hell you can even run tails in a vm as your main way of using tor browser and a vpn from your host os now you've solved the tor de anonymization problem and you have insulated yourself against zero day exploits from the government but i don't even recommend running tails as your main vm os for tor browsing and here's a few reasons why when i tried using the built in tor browser feature to update tor browser in tails at least in a tails vm i had i don't know if this is different in tails the newest now tor browser complained that it does not have the system permissions required to install it this can be remedied by installing the newest tor browser manually but this is kind of defeating the purpose of why you'd want to use tails in the first place so basically the next time there's a tor browser update that has any security patches in it your tor browser on tails has known in it and i don't think anybody bothers in tails to check if their tor browser is up to date every time they boot up tails whereas with tor browser on ubuntu there's a simple on click button to upgrade the entire tor browser install and tor browser at least on ubuntu checks every time on startup if there's a new tor browser version also tails only runs normal tor browser and not tor browser hardened the latter of which has been hardened more against exploits qubes os praised by edward snowden and other esteemed computer security professional is actually built around the concept of everything being done in vms but using qubes proficiently is out of reach for most dnm users but basically if you don't use vms but still use a vpn on your host os or an alternative like a prepaid cash only g hotspot or the vpn router setup cosmic consciousness described you have protected yourself against the tor de anonymization problem that was the original issue in this thread then even without vms if you have good internet hygiene and don't run untrusted downloads and don't allow javascript from all websites when clearnet browsing using noscript with firefox you're a pretty damn difficult target at this point just linux with a good host vpn and good opsec hygiene would be good enough for most dnm users who need to be concerned about getting de anonymized but if you want to take things a step further and decide to do everything in vms and you do it right you've now made compromising your host os and your most valuable data pgp private keys and passwords in keepass near impossible  gardener on june pmphysical isolation is said to be better than software isolation more complicated and costly to set up but should be solid even more so if each system lives in ram and starts from a read only media physical isolation is a good idea it's just that tails isn't good enough in my book what if you are targeted with a zero day exploit against your tor browser in tails you could have been using tor browser from a hardened vm but now instead your entire tails os and this could include all your keystrokes your pgp private keys your keepass entries after you've decrypted them all of this could be compromised tails just can't provide vms  gardener on june pmfor most users tails or tbb on linux with a strong firewall is probably enough don't you think so if the government knowing their dnm username the day they de anonymize a tor connection of theirs and find that it's coming from their home ip address isn't a concern to them then tails is good enough but if you're making repeat purchases or posting on darkweb forums with that same username or posting about things that would get you arrested then a vpn is absolutely a necessity unless you want to leave yourself open to ending up like that silk road lieutenant bonus points if you do everything serious from vms but for now just having a vpn would keep you from getting de anonymized to your home ip unless you're using a prepaid g hotspot and have good internet hygiene like using this g hotspot for only dnm activities and don't ever log in to your facebook from it or you're using a vpn router setup like what cosmic consciousness described  gardener on june pmif you want to be extra safe use an air gaped machine to encrypt your stuff and keep your private key at worse if your tor box is compromised there won't be keys or unencrypted messages on it this is super paranoid in a good way i think if you need this level of security go for it but this wouldn't protect you from having your tor connection de anonymized to your home ip still the thing is that if your tor connection ever gets de anonymized to your home ip address and they do decide to raid you or do physical surveillance on you and then raid you or the places you do business at you wouldn't be expecting any of this to be coming the feds would tear through every single flash drive hard drive and unencrypted piece of data that you own to try and pin this on you that you actually are username xyz online plus if you have any drugs in your house or they physically follow you to say your trap house this would almost certainly spell doom for you it is better just to use a vpn to begin with and sleep much more soundly at night because you use a reputable vpn provider with a server in a good country mullvad is month when you pay them in bitcoins there's no reason not to be using them unless getting de anonymized isn't a concern and it should be for all of us who make serious repeat purchases from the same username  gardener on june pmtails is nice because you don't need to read a lot of documentation to get started it works out of the box and it is supposed to be secure if you trust those who created the iso if you wanted to fight against anonymity and be willing to add a back door somewhere wouldn't a distribution aiming at providing anonymity be on top of the list i trust tails they're in it for the right reasons but you just can't run vms in it and it's not vpn friendly.
mist on april pmhey everyone update your pgp keys this was pointed out to me by another beautiful soul and realized they were right my key was old and leaked information like what operating system i had not a major issue but you may want to consider it some examples of old key headers showing operation system and versions version gnupg v gnu linux begin pgp public key block version gnupg v mingw begin pgp public key block version gnupg v mingw so take the few minutes to check you pgp and be safe update it and keep your old key in case someone needs to know you are who you are yes you can delete the header when you post but its still old this has been a public service message from the mist love lighton linux you can save yourself from manually deleting the version line or forgetting to delete it with the gpg option no emit versionlike so gpg no emit version armor export yourke.
i gave up and asked for my vendor bond back i got an account on dream instead.
just needed to understand what was happening no guess work here the advice about tails from a dvd running on a non hard disc system i take on board also glad to see the event is normal in some cases thanks for the feedback.
or would you be more interested in a small onetime fee to learn how to easily do it yourself.
accidentally posted my private key while trying to figure everything out with pgp and i cannot edit my post did i just fuck my security up horribly.
i'll take one for lsd and one for amphs if you got them on hand.
vitaminlsd on june amtails is not secure for serious dnm activities and here's the first reason why usa feds have already conducted tor attacks that have landed significant dnm figures behind bars the above article has more details about how the feds did it and who they have arrested so far a former silk road lieutenant for starters also tor bridges are practically useless for hiding from the nsa because the nsa harvests the tor bridge addresses from the emails send to from the tor project the nsa knows you're using tor anyways if you're using a tor bridge tor bridges were designed for people in repressive third world countries not us citizens hiding from the nsa it also gets worse and this is information that every dnm user serious or small should know about but since the edward snowden leaks the nsa has talked about if not bragged that they have timing attacks for de anonymizing tor users what does this breach have to do with tails isn't it just a live version of linux is it because it's not designed to be used with a vpn and that vpns are the safest way to access tor i'm not disputing what you're saying i just don't understand it thanks.
it's working now i just tried it.
if it's around for good now i have the unpleasent duty of eating my fedora.

i want to go to the most active market now that agora is going inactive can anyone help.
if we're saying fuck markets we still need to build an alternative that centralizes listings at least it encourages product diversity by allowing upstarts built in access to people seeking their product and a ready platform for promoting it in the meantime i'm looking at alphaba.
nice post snacktime will stay on agora and tmg exclusively until further noticecheers s.
i am pleased to announce a brand new darknet market called acas like other darknet markets before us our focus is on selling controlled substances we can confidently say that the only thing common between acas and other darknet markets is that we are all on tor and we are all focused on facilitating the sale of selling controlled substances with acas we hope to have created a darknet market with a superior user experience to other darknet markets acas aims to be extremely user friendly and we will listen to our vendors and users to implement features they suggest to us so that they can have a darknet market built to meet the requirements of it's users referrals you can only join acas market by invite every user has a special referral invite link you can find this link on the right hand side of the settings page vendor friendly acas is vendor friendly and we will reward vendors who invite the most people with their referral url any vendor with any specific request or complaint can always contact us and we will do our utmost best to make sure that vendor gets what he wants commissions acas will offers our vendors commission until january st after that the commissions will be so vendors can always offer the best prices for their products to darknet users on acas two factor authentication acas offers two factor authentication using pgp to enhance the security and privacy of our users accounts all you have to do is upload a pgp key to acas on the settings page speed acas currently loads very fast we will make it remain that way and as we grow we know it will get slower so acas will always make significant investments to boost hardware capacity and network bandwidth so that you can spend less time waiting for page loads and more time browsing acas and placing orders customer support acas is a great marketplace easy to use with awesome customer support acas will respond promptly to user messages and try to resolve issues quickly and if there is any problem we will get back to you asap we have a dedicated support team that is solely committed to customer support encryption everything on acas is encrypted so much that even if a server was seized it would be impossible to retrieve any data every body using acas is safe including users vendors and it's operators with acas your data is in competent hands security acas is impenetrable to xss attacks sql injections and most attacks geared at taking down a darknet market we can boast that with our current implementation you will never lose any coins to a security breach product listings over the next few weeks acas will be working very hard to attract some well known vendors to our market we will do all we can to get the best vendors with the best prices to acas so watch out for our new vendors mobile for those who prefer to use mobile devices our market has a mobile version that will display properly on small screens and can be used on android with orbot though for increased security it's always preferable to use a computer running free open source software like tails all vendors we invited are all welcome to join acas market our sub reddit pgp onion url invite url acas managemen.
gleeful on june pmthanks for the great explanation i use ubuntu already since i have essentially abandoned windows because it sucks so hard with ubuntu and the vpn set up does it make sense to run tor through the vpn as an extra layer if so what package does ubuntu have available to run tor thanks yes absolutely you want to run tor through your vpn at all times for your vpn on linux i recommend mullvad and just to keep things neater in this thread for anyone reading it later i'm typing up my next post after this why mullvad is badass for dnm ops and how to install it on ubuntu what you want to install to get tor browser working on ubuntu is the tor browser file from the tor project website if your computer has gb of ram i recommend the tor browser hardened version only available for linux and it's hardened against certain types of exploits but it's a memory hog and uses about times as much memory as normal tor browser on linux but if you have the hardware for it the hardened version is totally worth it you can download tor browser hardened from this page on the tor project website it's under its own section called hardened tor browser you can't miss it be sure to download the signature file too and verify the signature if you've never done it before here's the command but first you'll need the tor browser developers pgp public key if you haven't downloaded it already instructions how to get it are on the webpage here on ubuntu the command would just be quotegpg keyserver x hkp pool sks keyservers net recv keys x e c e you can verify that this key says tor browser developers and that you didn't typo it by running this command if you like quotegpg fingerprint x e c e this will output something like quotepub r expires key fingerprint ef e d da ea a ba de e c e uid tor browser developers signing key sub r f c expires sub r d e expires then this is the signature verify command assuming you are in the directory where you saved both of these files quotegpg verify tor browser linux a hardened all tar asc tor browser linux a hardened all tar should say something like quotegpg good signature from tor browser developers signing key if it verified successfully then to run tor browser hardened it's honestly just as easy as extracting the tar file if you are in the same directory as the tor browser hardened tar file it goes like this quotetar xvjf tor browser linux a hardened all tar will have made a folder called tor browser now change directories there and run the start tor browser desktop file like this  tor browser desktopit should respond with exactly this quotelaunching ' browser start tor browser detach' then you are good to go there are also a few very specific config changes and setting changes and so on that should be made in tor browser to harden it even more maybe i could write a tor browser hardening post for linux to share here on tmg this week and if your dnm computer doesn't have the hardware for tor browser hardened you can just use the same commands as above just replace the tor browser hardened filenames with the normal tor browser filenames for the download you get from that same page as above on the tor project website gleeful if you run into any problems feel free to pm me or better yet just post it in the thread here so if anyone else has the same issue we can fix it together i'll check in here a few times a day this week in case you have any issues you run into.
i have used helix a handful of times and never had any problems at all however after just checking their link a few minutes ago i saw that it is indeed down i'm not sure how long it has been or will be but from my previous experience with them they always got the job done adn within a reasonable timeframe.
reposting this here as well i want the visability because it theres a lot of pumping going on what i'm saying is this i buy btc in cash in person moneygram cash in mail etc this goes to a wallet that is connected to me how it's not i could send my the btcs straight to any dnm and it doesn't matter who does any block chain analysis on this transactions the only way anyone would be compromised is a face to face transaction and the seller who have to obtain your identify further let's say i do buy btc face to face using lbc you don't even have to use the website to escrow the transaction a lot of those traders only keep small amounts in lbc to so they have the ability to advertise it's like posting an advertisement then you meet face to face and trade offline so if i wanted to get monero i'd have to still source btc i'm buying bitcoins anonymously anyways and they are going to a wallet that doesn't have my name on it so please explain what the benefit monero provides me all i see is the increased exposure to risk volatility and then some third party is going to skim more of my when i execute this trade from btc xmr because ya know everyone wants to get in my fucking wallet this isn't to say i won't or haven't acquired wink wink some monero to cash in on any up swing i just keep it real monero is trying to address a problem that i don't have monero is far from anonymous yea sure i get it blah blah no one can track it bullshit who is using monero everything about this currency is associated with illegal transactions and the desire for anonymity so if i chat up anyone in real life about monero and they will quickly make assumptions if you are found sourcing monero in any capacity guess what more assumptions can be made about you bitcoins are used for legitimate purposes legal businesses accept them you can strike up a conversation about bitcoins with many forward thinking individuals and no one is going to bat an eye i'm not trying to be rude friend sometimes i like to cut to the chase because i find that others get caught in the fluff being thrown around in the world today i think i'll source some more btc in the near future i'm going to hit up on of the many traders out there who will happily take my cash for some coins and pay them a fair fee for providing me such a nice service let me know when someone figures this out when and where this takes place how i contacted the seller what amount i traded who the seller is what wallet i used where the coins i got are going yea man i'll be here be honest with yourself and those around you.
i think nucleus is the best market around and it has gained my trust nucleus is also very secure with all the security features including fa etc longevity and importantly it is dos ddos proof with rotating url links dhl isn't as well stocked and i find it's ui to be far too overly complicated and gimmicky the primary nucleus url is nucleuspf izq o onio.
i doubt its an exit scam but i deposited last week and when they posted i redeposited in my block its been days now i am worried but i sent them a message and im hoping it works out i trust them but right now i am worried a little bit cheers beetle.

bombheadie on march pmquote from gleeful on march pmjust wondering do you have a pic of the orange sunshine blotter art i like that many of the other analogs are on blotters bearing the name of the chemical but ald stands out given its history dating back to the 's so just wondering what the blotter sheet looks like and what individual tabs look like and thanks for getting this mystical mythical substance out to our community clearnet is the blotter paper that i am laying it on i will never sell a research chemical to any of you when i get my next batch of ald it comes with a msds material data saftey sheet when it coems i'll post it to the board just so you guys know it is exactly what i am selling i will never sell research chemicals on this border or anywhere for that matter eta every hits is a complete sunshine great choice of paper thanks for the pic.
just on a sidenote value lucid has or had some ug maya blotters it feels a tiny bit underdosed but the crystal is totally worth the rather high price also while you're at it grab some of the hoffmans kois all quality blotter xtal imoquotewell i dont follow that rule because the more lsd you take the more depth and spiritual awakening you findi highly doubt that amount of lsd taken directly correlates to depth and spiritual awakening what might be the perfect dose for one to find spiritual enlightenment might be over or underwhelming for another my experience with value lucid is already some time ago but i haven't heard much negative since then.
thanks so big market only agora right now the problem it's it don't works anymore now except agora only little market right thanks for your answe.
dardush on january pmyou have everything you need right here me to it dardush we have a disputes section here if something goes wrong we try to only keep reputable vendors on our nice little home here on the blackwebz.
thanks for all the guidence and help here some few questions what do you mean about note your seed buy a cheap laptop remove the harddrive get tails on a usb sorry i dont know what tails it but i will look it up buy storing in tor wallet do you mean by the market wallet again sorry for the newbie question.
i will be resuming operations both on here and on abraxas now that everything seems to be still okay and agora's security seemingly was not comprimised glad to hear everyone is alright we will have listings available this week cheers s.
ehh dont bother agora is shutting down dood dont make an account or deposit money.
title says it all i kept expecting a thread like this to pop up change password and carry on or will there be a change of url.
are you working for agora defending them dude why the hell should i lie about swedish sek on my bitcoint wallet on agora that was stolen i read on other forums like reddit that it happened another guy to they stole hes money and they answered him on support that he had some keylogger virus that got into hes wallet thats bullshit my computer is secure as possible im working with it and computer in my eyes they are scammers and i wont deposit there anything mor.
veracrypt full disk encryption is also a good way forward the encrypted file system is not very secure though.
running tails on a virtual box is also a secure way some expert vpn folks should start renting out sandbox rdp's with tails for some coins.
damn free ross i guess he was to the dnms today as what zeppelin hendrix was to rock.
not surprised either but what a shame i mean it's just the same agenda by our us gov and the same cycles of thinking and the jury i seriously wonder what kind of people get selected for these kind of cases i can almost guarantee they were middle of the road conservative 'mind yer p's and q's darlin 'super religious le loving tools tools they are and we all know if the juror was your average hipster hacker musician type it would have beendifferent but then again maybe even then the jurors would fear their own reps wud sour if theylet ulbricht off the hook it don't matter anyway judge has final say the whole thing is rigged our whole gov is still run by a bunch of stuffy suits who can't imagine a genius like ulbrichtbeing able to do what he did and allowing it to continue no because we have a bunch ofoutdated and immoral laws that say 'if you do this life in prison'and ya know what it all boils down to powerour gov cannot allow certain power and money to be handled by one person that a person has the ability to change the world the way we interact in a way that goes against the grain and so ulbricht might be looking at life behind bars for what how did he hurt anyone what was immoral about anything he did aside from the 'calling hits' accusations it's so fucked and everytime i watch the news same shit same idiots in the media in office running the same lies games lost in their own head issues of what's wrong in the worldwhen really the only thing that is wrong is what's inside what happened to the heart the love it's all fucking money and who's in charge who can fuck who better who has the biggest cock i'm so tired of all this shit i sometimes just want off this planet i swear.
assume you create a blockchain wallet that you access only through tor with no email connected to your real name or ip email address would be through an overseas service how secure is it to transfer btc straight from thatwallet to a vendor for a purchase or should i use a coin tumbling service regardless.
i'm sorry i have not heard of or used helix before as long as you don't send the coins directly from paxful to your markets wallet you'll be okay no much to worry about at all unless your moving lbs of marijuana and grams of xtal a week just place a small dollar order for btc see if you can get that into your desired wallet that way you get the hang of it before making a bigger order.
i do miss the original silk road seriously at this point it seems so nostalgic.
doseheavy on july amtake the shroom juice first when you start to feel it and trip take the ug after another hours eat the mdma this way it all ends at the same time and you dont have a crash in the middle of the lsd trip you may want to get some dmt to vape at the end of the trip hours if you want them to end at the same time you would need to take the lsd first lsd can last hours where psilocybin lasts i agree that crashing on mdma while tripping on lsd is not pretty probably one of the worst experiences of my entire life i call it the candyflop.
if you can't pay the drop cash or in btc then you need to cultivate another drop with fake information could be renting a house they don't need to know your name or anything about you just what you give them or you can find someone in a pinch but has a sofa could be someone you meet in a bar and you are passing through town there are an infinite number of ways to craft your story but that's all about the drop first you have to disconnect your clear net fingerprint from your identity this all would be great advice for someone looking to take security seriously but really you can just do btc gyft etc consumer site if you just don't want it on your cc bill.
having the same issue im so close.
all coins have made it safely into my anon blockchain wallet and are now ready to send to a vendor of my choice yay c b for me anyways bit blender is very quick and looks very legit i mean obviously use this service with caution and at your own risk as previously stated but really it helped reduce a lot of stress for me that normally goes along with cleaning btcs i know that i will be using bit blender again thanks for the advice peace mrs b.
very interesting take on a dnm market nice.
there is away to use electrum in tails without persistence it does however require an external usb or sd disk where to store your wallet and the electrum app we will not use the tails pre installed electrum version we will be using the downloaded one i ll explain below how to start it btw i am not saying this is the correct way to do things i personally will use tails persistence but since you asked here is a way to do it in your external data disk create a secret password protected partition using tails disk utility this will be only visible from tails and it will be like a persistent drive for your data here is where you store your wallet and electrum app in electrum site downloads get installation from python sources and download linux version once unzipped you ll have a folder save this in your secret disk all you need to do is access this folder from your terminal in terminal command line type cd and drag the folder from your desktop to terminal it should look something like cd amnesia externaldisk electrum this opens the folder in terminal and once you are inside the folder command line shows something like amnesia exernaldisk electrum once you are in the folder run electrum type electrum electrum app should open the you create a wallet and save this wallet in your secret disc file looks something like mywallet dat by default each time electrum starts will load the last wallet used make sure to create a backup copy of your wallet in another secret disk just in case hope that helps sorry for the short technical explanations on linux terminal but i am not expert just an average user.
yep oasis is definitely my favorite market to use i just wish more vendors were active there.
thank you for all the info problem i see is that as not many people use it there isn't much you can do with those and you can't blend in with thousand users as it is possible with btc.
paranonymous on february amall i really need is the great people of the garden although i do really like the look and feel of dhl and plan on making a couple select orders there pretty soon to get things i can only get there guess it depends what you need but yeah i'm perfectly happy with the vendors here as well and no risk of exit scams either.
i'm extremely confused can you buy bitcoins and then transfer them into your cloakcoin wallet or is altcoin a totally different currency.
luckyduck are you active here or should we be reaching out to you in other places.
monero seems real nice the problem is you need btc to get monero if it takes off exchanges will pop up there are so many altcoins.
why is this even an option at all no real reason to have this on just an extra pattern to be analyzed stalking your fellow tmgers is never appropriate if you are refreshing your page waiting for your vendor to sign in so they can reply to your pm then maybe you don't have the patience to fully appreciate these great chemicals.
also never use that password agai.
take the shroom juice first when you start to feel it and trip take the ug after another hours eat the mdma this way it all ends at the same time and you dont have a crash in the middle of the lsd trip you may want to get some dmt to vape at the end of the trip hours.
this place is so much better than any market i've ever been a part of.
cotlakqueque on april pmwhere do i find the market all i can see are the message boards lol keep looking brah.
i got everything i asked for she's always been a pleasure to work with.
so first house says this and now you i've never used that subreddit but i see it as nothing but a bad thing honeypot or not it brings people who should not be part of this here thing into it it's nothing but a bad thing.
i haven't made any transactions on middle earth yet but hot damn it's a pleasure to navigate fast and silky smooth and nice to look at the fact that they have a shopping cart feature is a huge plus imo i'd imagine that's as convenient for vendors as it is buyers blackbank feels clunky to me pages seem to take longer than they should to load the text is hard to read always having to zoom in which causes everything to be crammed in and of course no shopping cart like agora purchasing multiple listings from a vendor is more complicated and time consuming than it needs to be on a more positive note i do appreciate their deposit withdrawal speed btw i'm glad to see you're still around gfn.
dxuutx on december pmif anything this is more proof that hos or whoever is a major target of law enforcement and that we really shouldn't be talking about this business on the clearnet anywhere than any notion that the whole sub is just a honeypot i think the arrogant sense that people on the sub have that their crimes aren't worthy of targeting from law enforcement these are people who live to make drug arrests i also think it's a bit alarmist to assert that it exists only for this purpose and that no worthwhile discussion takes place thereon and it's not insignificant seemingly to me that hos didn't have any overt problems with reddit when the reviews were adulatory and the attitude changed when they started to turn critical lol speak english its not insignificant it is not not significant when you use a double negative you obscure your meaning thereon this word has been used not since again not one knows what the fuck not insignificant' again that 'hos didn't' have a problem when the reviews were positive adulatory if you yern to be not unlike leo tolstoy well then i'll just not continue writing now.
can be a real problem too little isn't enough and too much isn't enough glad i haven't done any in almost a year alcohol is my next one feel sort of proud not buying a six pack earlier.

i am now testing multisig at tor bazaar beta note that this separate site from tor bazaar alpha and only beta has multisig for now.
cosmic consciousness on june amquote from vitaminlsd on june amquote from ssod on june amcurrently i am connecting to the darknet via tails tor bridges i feel as this is not a very safe unless i am wrong anyone have any advice on additional security measures to protect my real ip i get bulk so safety is a big concern to me let me know if my lack of faith in bridges is invalid though tails is not secure for serious dnm activities and here's the first reason why usa feds have already conducted tor attacks that have landed significant dnm figures behind bars the above article has more details about how the feds did it and who they have arrested so far a former silk road lieutenant for starters also tor bridges are practically useless for hiding from the nsa because the nsa harvests the tor bridge addresses from the emails send to from the tor project the nsa knows you're using tor anyways if you're using a tor bridge tor bridges were designed for people in repressive third world countries not us citizens hiding from the nsa it also gets worse and this is information that every dnm user serious or small should know about but since the edward snowden leaks the nsa has talked about if not bragged that they have timing attacks for de anonymizing tor users at the nsa in the washington post revealed that the nsa had figured out various ways of unmasking and penetrating the anonymity of the tor network since according to a page research paper titled simply tor the agency has worked on several methods that if successful would allow the nsa to uncloak anonymous traffic on a wide scale effectively by watching communications as they enter and exit the tor system rather than trying to follow them inside one type of attack for example would identify users by minute differences in the clock times on their computers and it still gets worse tor prioritizes fast relays and so if you consider that plausibly speaking many and possibly most of the most high speed tor relays are run by western intelligence agencies and not just grassroots tor volunteers it makes timing attacks so much easier for them from the pando com article from above quotein tor co founder roger dingledine revealed that the tor network is configured to prioritize speed and route traffic through through the fastest servers nodes available as a result the vast bulk of tor traffic runs through several dozen of the fastest and most dependable servers on today's network clients choose one of the fastest exit relays around of the time and of their choices come from a pool of relays this information above has already been public since the edward snowden leaks so now everyone reading this has no excuse not to get off tails and learn ubuntu or your other favorite flavor of linux and start using a reputable vpn impeccable track record of standing up against government requests keeps no logs and you can pay them in bitcoins you can start on this now or end up like the silk road lieutenant who got arrested because his tor connection got de anonymized by the government to what was probably his home ip address and if you're a serious dnm user you don't do business hours a day online from a public wifi spot this is not an acceptable solution for power users bonus points if you use a pre paid g hotspot with your non tails flavor of linux a reputable vpn where your face was never on camera buying the hotspot think fake wig cell phone at home and paid in cash true story great advise i however use a preconfigured travel router can be found on amazon called gl inet and flashed it with dd wrt and open vpn i then uploaded several vpn config files onto the router itself and foced all traffic through the vpn add to that i only plug in i never use wifi so the travel router is connected to the wan port from ethernet over power extender and then wired through the lan port into my machine i run tail when on the go and whinox when home i also 'bridge' into the tor network on start up and never use persistant memory i feel it is more secure to have my content keys keymanager etc stored on a seperate encrypted usb thumb drive that i then upload my keys before i go live so im essentially between my machine and the vpn that is then relaying those packets through a bridged connection into the tor i highly suggest you use aws to spawn yourself a vpn i feel it is more secure to have your very own vpn config rather than use one that is shared by others that's cool that you're using a vpn router that is definitely another good option besides the g hotspot i just threw out the g hotspot tip since it would be easier for most non tech folk to get working when you use your own aws vpn server though are you ever concerned that if you logged in to a clearnet website or did anything that the feds would know that login was or just that web browsing traffic was you are you ever concerned that you're the only vpn connection going to that server since the nsa could see you're the only connection going to your server on tcp or whatever port you configured it to listen on if your original network connection is coming from a g hotspot or something other than your home ip address you wouldn't be in bad of shape compared to if you were connecting from your home ip but you basically get no cover traffic by using your own vpn server plus you need to pay for it anonymously but you seem crafty and there's a few ways to do anonymous payments like that to the credit of commercial vpn providers and not all of them but there is at least one company i know of that takes their security very seriously and in some of the countries where they run a vpn server they own their own hardware including in the most secure country where they have servers and in their most secure country too they personally know the people who operate the data center they also have a track record of not accommodating government information requests nor in the other countries but say with their usa nodes they would have no control if the feds showed up with a gag order and took their vpn server's second hard drive that had the server's ssl private keys on it but at least on their certain overseas nodes this will basically never happen since they know the people who run the datacenter and they own their own hardware there.
i'm going to start a new market which will be a clone of alphabay but i'll change the name slightly to 'alfalfabay' which should bring in a whole new wholefood fanbase and lets face it most of us drug addled braindead peadophile terrorists love a few freshly sprouted seeds once in a while wish me luck with my new venture.
it's great to see new people learn and discover the wonders of the darknet one quick note though you shouldn't be torrenting anything through tor not only is it bad opsec but it slows the whole network down see for more in response to your original question yes using a tails usb should be fine from home.
an updated version would be.
lovelyface on april pmhi guys im pretty new to this and have spent some time trying to work out tails and im thinking i should get a vpn but then i read this gave me a headacheshould i get a vpn on tails i wouldn't if i were you even in tails when discussion of vpns has come up it would appear that only pptp is being considered for support pptp is no longer considered safe as far as i am determine see the following site for details clearnet spitfir.
i'm a bit worried about a deposit i made to agora which hasn't shown up in my wallet yet normally my agora deposits appear within mins of sending them this one was sent about hours ago should i be worried.
not had a single problem with helix just register for an account though the heliz light doesnt sound safe for larger amount.
nordicwhite on november amcan anyone recommend a good burner laptop for darknetmarket shopping vending use mostly large shopping i plan to use tails on usb or dvd asus c inch chromebook arm tails not available for arm yetused or refurbished thinkpad x used or refurbished thinkpad t all three should be under and support free and open source firmware bios through thinkpads can be easily repaired with cheap replacement parts as they are popular enterprise laptops it's easy to find refurbished ones in good condition.
scroat on december pm think it's great was linked from the onions subi thought it was great too until they started serving ads through torads what really got me and caused me to abandon my accounts there is the fact that an ad that i was being served related to an organization in my country of origin that is either a huge coincidence or ip address data is possibly being leaked indicating the country of origin now mind you i've got adblock running and my hosts file is bulging with the addresses of most online advertisers redirected to the loopback address despite this the ads are still showing up the long and the short of it is that i no longer trust this service ymmv spitfir.
more specifically i want to buy something that i do not want to be related to my identity i will have it shipped to a safe drop but they only accept credit cards non dn related what is the best way to go about procuring this some way to go from btc anon bank drop credit cardwith a socks any help would be appreciated thank yo.
at the moment its nucleus shame about the forum being down for the last week seems a bit sketch.
undetermined on july pmagora still not possible to create a new accountdid you use a invitation link.
thanks bh.
i see no one at all talking about abraxas i like it good uptime.
when it is down the alternative urls have worked the end bit is my invite code.
there is no exact way to answer this question except that your concerns are valid it's very possible for a vendor to be le it's also possible than inexperienced vendors keep more detailed records of your private info than they should this being said it's also possible that experienced vendors are making mistakes they should be avoiding you should probably assume your identity is compromised and wipe everything change addresses change pgp change username sticking with vendors others have reported success isn't but it's definitely a worthwhile precaution in this environment.
blackbank id say yeah however i prefer agora over any other platform cheers dolmi.
sad i know the tmg isn't perfect well sort of but if a vendor goes rouge we typically know before major scam can be pull off the gardeners here work the fields and we enjoy the fruits of their labor as it should be thanks for news helps to remind us why we are here.
alphabay may be one of the biggest markets right now but that still doesn't take away the fact that it's ran by a bunch of carders in fact no market should be trusted either way they just might be implemending a tumbler service just to try and get as much coins moving through their market as possible so that they can pull a fast one on over us i'm not pointing fingers or anything just saying just my btc have a nice day.
you can also loose btc on the way but it sounds better than using a mixer as we don't know how they work and if they keep log aren't there two many fees on the way i guess each exchange takes some little fees isn't it if the rate is going up it's all good but if it's stable did you calculate how much your system would cost to mix btc.
i believe it did have a rebound effect in that way i remember when she laid on her death bed she had just had a stroke and she was staring off into space into what seemed like an abyss she was a little responsive if i said something she would grunt i felt like she was still making thoughts out but something else was going on in her mind i looked at her and i gently kissed her on the forehead and asked her what do you see do you see something beautiful is it the most beautiful thing you've ever seen in your life she made a slight sound nothing legible i said it's ok if you can't tell me just blink twice if what you see is the most beautiful thing you've ever seen and she blinked twice right then and there i knew i was communicating with her during a long experience with death she had a stroke and died days later and was in that state the whole time but when that moment happened i knew she was seeing something unlike anything before like she was experiencing nothing but bliss and beauty things only humans can truly appreciate i always ask if you where the universe this great big endless expansive universe what would you want more than anything and the answer to me has always been someone to appreciate my existence i had this realization when i realized that without a conscious entity living in the universe it would be as if the universe didn't exist we are here for a reason and that is to admire and appreciate the beauty the universe has and to live and love and manifest beauty in every way we can however we can even in the face of adversity because if we don't we may as well consider ourselves asleep.
true china had has much easier access to reagents and precursors than we westerners do plus the way their society works they don't demonize people for doing work so long as it isn't breaking any export laws but if we were to have a massive number small scale production labs synthesizing semi bulk quantities of chemicals as opposed to multiple kilos one such lab could work completely under the radar while managing to fill a decent amount of the demand without having to order quantities of reagents that would be deemed suspicious in terms of the dea watch list it would also be harder to take down many scattered small labs than it would a few strategic factories in short it's not likely it will happen but it is certainly feasible back on topic though yeah it's a shame that mxe is on the decline ime it's fairly benign as far as safety is concerned sucks that it has come to people passing off chems of an obscure choice as i think your india guess will prove to be on point though i hope that our favorite chinese lab technicians decide to make the move out there themselves to resume their business as they're already experienced as well as trusted for the most part like you said though it's up to us to make sure that no one from us and further down the chain get hurt.
absolutely these are factory nik reagent tests they will be sold at cost if there is enough interest i will follow your vendor thread directions stay safe.
only the mrs niceguy worked for me anyway thank you for the infos i would also like to add a few crypto market is down for days now because it is being uploaded for v cryptomktgxdn zd onionacas market there's better but you can probably like it have a look lpwiqq bjenhkucm oniontochka free market tochka evlj sxdv onioncheers.
anyone else not able to get on agora right now cheers s.
agora seems to be down cheers s.
honestly i don't bother with anything labeled over ug because i find they usually seem underdosed now a lot of the vendors around now are pretty legit but it's just a rule i personally follow it doesn't matter so much whether i'm eating one piece of paper or three besides i'm usually eating five or six.
no love for markets lol we've outgrown the.
i'm asking this because of the post i saw about having no javascript but i'm still a bit skeptical i've never used a market before so i'm wondering if this is good or bad could anyone provide any information thanks.
please post your invite links here to darknet markets that require them abraxas invite referral link invite referral link invite referral link temporarily offline until further notice dream invite referral link the longest running darknet market to date hansa invite link commisson fee and no registration bond for every vendor with use of a invite link only for a short time.
helloi was wondering if there is a way to safely chat over tor environment p p encryption anonimity i read some threads about it some recommend torchat other say is not safe anyone has an idea for this it would actually be cool to be able to chat with a vendor when you are working on an order some vendor take days to reply messages and things can get longer than expected i dont know if this is against opsec or what please any of the tech gurus out there throw some light on the matter.
i agree oasis is pretty awesome it is a nice looking site it is designed well can someone explain the donation thing though so there is absolutely no fees that they demand its just what you feel like donating if so that sure is different and very respectable but i sure do hope that people are donating so they have the drive to stay legit and grow in popularity.
salviagoddess on july pmi agree that crashing on mdma while tripping on lsd is not pretty probably one of the worst experiences of my entire life i call it the candyflop that's probably one of these rare cases where a mdma redose would have been beneficial.
there is a way to get xmr anonymously with cash like localbitcoin bitsquare added monero but i did not read how it works but if you buy xmr with btc and you send your xmr from xmr wallet a to your xmr wallet b they are completely clean and private anonymous untraceable.
is this information still current.
agora is backup and running.
koolcid on may ami don't see what apple has over hansa or tmg you know i've always felt the same way about apple for years i've been tellin' people that android is far more superior why spend that kind of money on apple products oh wait is this something different.
i found a btc atm in my area that was camera free and didnt even require a cell phone for verification i simply scanned a qr code for my wallet or any vendor you want to send to then inserted cash and in seconds the transaction was complete and showing in my wallet this seems like an even better option than local is bear in mind the first atm i found had a camera and did require a cell phone for up to a deposit and id for anything more the second one however required nothing and i deposited at one time the fee was pretty painful as their btc rate was around when bitstamp showed around but complete anonymity for bucks per bitcoin seemed ok to me if you trust the vendor or the shop you can send direct without needing to mix without ever putting your name to those coins this excited me greatly hope it helps someone else out there with their opsec.
ah i've been out of the garden for awhile how is everyone doing i wanted to know about a jedi flip me and my friend are going to conduct for an upcoming party of mine here's the amounts we planned on doing ug of lucy vial of liquid shrooms g of mdma with a g boost maybe if we find an adequate source that is any precautions for the flip we need to know about we're really excited but not stupid about the flip and wanted to make sure everything was okay yes we've done them before and have been fine now just altogether how do we dose this edit if this is incorrect should we redo the dosages.
hey summa haven't seen you in awhile how have you been i also have a few of these godself ug managed to order before evo's exit scam but yet to try them i'm pretty sure i saw another vendor offering them could be from germany anyway going to give them a try next weekend and will update my thread cheers.
this is why i would never trust a dnm with something important that would affect my real life like irl dealers who borrow money for their supply and then a dnm goes down and it's all fuck i'm dead i owe money to some bad people or heroin addicts on some where's my deposit and going through withdrawal like this is technology guys ever use it if so you know it breaks when you need it most don't put in more money than you can afford to lose and don't rely on it for important things.
nucleus seems to be where all my domestic sellers ar.
hey all made my first purchase on abraxas and i also fe d only because i have known the vendor for years everything was fineonly thing i didnt like was the deposits have to confirm times before your acc is credited with btc cheers dolmi.
agora is the bulk of my new customers but after an order or two most people are moving to direct deals i'm probably at agora and direct deals it has an ebb and flow to it galindo.
well there is no accounting for stupid but anything that will get people's attention and cut their and the vendor's risk of meeting the men in blue would be good.
rasputin on june pmwhich are the biggest and most popular of the markets at this time agora is the biggest and best look no futher agora has it all cheers dolmi.
chess on november pmquote from pinto on november ami have a paxful account and a wallet that i have downloaded i buy bitcoins with cash deposits at bofa you dont even need an account at bofa you just need cash and tell the teller you need to make a cash deposit to an account fill out the slip with information provided to you by the seller on paxful and there you go btc within minutes after you deposit i looked into it should i use tor with this website i might use an american express gift card something disposable from the dollar store you don't have to use tor with it just dont use that as your main wallet have a wallet that you downloaded or a wallet like blockchain that you can send the btc to right after you receive them you can pay with cards it just gets kind of expensive when you do that.

pinto on november pmhmm good question i'm not sure about the safety between the two i use an online wallet blockchain that might be a good post if this doesn't get much attention make sure you google or use the search function and see if a topic has already been posted about the difference in safety and reliability in a downloaded vs online wallet thanks and best of luck feel free to ask anymore questions you have i'm more than happy to help out i'll probably just use blockchain as well then i don't want to risk downloading anything so paxful with chrome transfer it over to your wallet on tails and tor what if i wanted to use helix how would i do that and is it worth it also just in case i don't figure this out how exactly would i transfer stuff to my wallet or through helix and then to my wallet.

hi i think that valhalla silkittie are scamming vendors and maybe buyers too as i wrote in other post i suspended the sales on valhalla silkittie because i can't withdraw my money i sent message to the support but i didn't receive any replies when i try to withdraw the system says the minimum amount to withdraw is btc of course i try to withdraw more money i fear that there is an exit scam i hope to be wrong of course luckily there are the other markets where you can find me nucleus and alphabay and of course here on the legendarythe majestic garden that it is always the best and safest place.
knucklesfromsr on february pmfrom everything that i read this makes it so that website owners can be held responsible for what their users do i don't agree with this i still don't think you'd get in trouble for making a platform like craigslist which can be used for illegal activity but ross knowingly set up a black market website actively recruited drug dealers and knowingly and directly profited from illegal transactions.

actions of ab in the last week alone deposits failed to show in the account balance must be the customers mistake what else resolved a dispute in favor of the vendor after customer posted pics showing the vendor threatening to dox him accounts blocked accounts with fa with an invalid pgp phrase message accounts phished because the user didnt take safety precautions vendor accounts locked because there were good coins coming in and can't let vendor getaway with the monies can they disputes unanswered because its easy money once ya lock the vendor and the buyer out its all 'ours'fuck ab.
i would stay away from russia based on recent announcements to ban tor do a search released in february quoting myselfquote from banana jack on april pmi think any country with enough political capital to be able to pull off withstanding pressures from the western economies would only do so if it benefitted them usually the countries able to do this wouldn t tolerate exposing their people to the things found on such a server or would run it themselves as an economic or cultural attack russia does not like tor just because of anonymity but because it is an usa government developed program too any countries that feel it could lead to a national privacy intrusion will not help readily unless it is in their political interests btc payments work with individuals and not large governments if you could limit traffic to their country they might support in defience.
for now it is up to the user for the inbox but the outbox is pruned after sending each message so no message history in the sent box unless you choose to save a copy there is the option to manually prune messages older than a certain number of days under my messages actions prune messagesbruc.
i've used grams the problem i see with it though is that it only indexes a few sites one of my personal motivations with bb was to get listed on grams however due to all the dos' ing chaos going on none of my info ever got established there i suspect that is the case for a lot of small time vendors amvd as stated hasn't been updated in ages so unless a vendor has been around a very long time it doesnt help too many people i suspect i think that a database that allows self registration as a vendor with a fee for some kind of verification may be a good idea i also see that there could be a lot of problems with identity as well my cents.
i reviewed the javascript code and it doesn't look too nefarious looks like a token of some sort is being created an stored also it looks like one can disable js at the login prompt fwiw still a bit dicey especially for vendors.
someone with more knowledge can feel free to correct me but it is my understanding that using a vm is almost never as safe as just using tails from a usb the reason for this is that you have to trust that there are no backdoors in the vm most likely there wouldn't be but if your are running your virtual machine on windows you can never be sure as for your other question your isp can see that you are using tor but not what you do there think of it as a helicopter watching you enter the subway sure the helicopter knows that you're using the subway but it doesnt know where you are going to get off.
best not to use an online wallet ie blockchain info but rather a desktop one like electrum for everyday tasks can t beat armory for cold storage.
the problem has nothing to do with pgp safe mail doesn t provide pop access to free accounts you have to pay for the account to get pop access that s why you can t login with thunderbird.
i'm looking for some cannabis and i heard alphabay is a good place to look i know this place is prominent in psychedelics but if anyone could help me i'd much appreciate it.
mr viking on april pmppgp is also a good portable cross platform solution its in java so it even runs on osx its very basic and simple good solution for buyers one in their right mind should be caught dead using that piece of crap software for starters it generates dangerously insecure keys by default including bit encryption sub keys hobbyists were breaking keys that small years ago on spare equipment they had lying around i wouldn t be caught dead using that piece of junk software.
you can anonymize recipients by putting throw keyid in your gpg conf unfortunately some pgp clients are crappy and won t test all the private keys in their key chain so they will fail to decrypt anonymized pgp messages.
at this point i don't think it is looking good but you never know my sympathies for anyone affected by this it always hurts to los.
i have to make a transaction on ab but i m wondering if i have to go though with it or notthe scam reports are making me uneasy.
import a vendor's public key copy the vendor's public key into the clipboard left click on the clipboard icon on the top right tails menu bar and select manage keys maximize the new window that pops up on the passwords and keys windows select gnupg keys type ctrl v or do edit paste from the menu bar for that window a window should pop up with the vendor's pgp id click on import if you get a pop up with the following error could not display 'clipboard text'reason unrecognized or unsupported data there was a formatting problem with the key you copied into the clipboard make sure that you are copying all of the key including the five dashes at the beginning and end of the key and the begin and end statements pgp is very picky about formatting errors.
does anyone on earth actually know how multisig on v a l h a l l a works it supposedly supports it but i can't see any option in the settings for placing my public key enabling it or anything whatsoever in the support area there is vague explanation of how to create a keypair for multisig payment continuing with the statement you will then find your public key and your private key at the bottom of the page copy both keys into a text file for each new order you will have to create a new keypair what next o.
i've got a slow transfer outside of any market i just read on r bitcoin that there is company in the eu conducting a stress test its got the whole system running slow the issue may not be agora.
seems like alphabay nucleus and abraxas are the best alternate markets right now i do like the look of haven but only time will tell if they are reliable or not on a side note agora is working well right now maybe they got their problems worked out.
i believe they are down and trying to fix some bugs that occured during a recent upgrad.

another update i've been talking to be buddy for the past few day about my shipping methods he told me how i'm doing it now it 'pretty good and that no one would ever give it a second look however i want my packs to be the best of the best so i've been talking to my buddy who used to ship marijuana and mushrooms from coast to coast for years non darkmarket and he has been giving me some very good tips lately so every though my stealth right now is very good i will keep updating it as i move along further which means that i will eventually be able to send more mdma and i love constructive criticism so any help that you guys would like to throw my way i will enjoy all of it much love tmg bhp s the ald is just about out of stock for now i am loaded up on mdma and next week hopefully i will also be offering needlepoint i will never sell anything on this board if i wouldn't do it myself of give it to me fiancee and my family soon as i see some reviews coming in about the ald is when i will be grabbing more or it i know you guys will like it but i just want to be sure before i order more of it also please let me know if anyone is interested in p lsd or al lad or any of the other tryptimines that i have i have listed in my original post much love hetty crew b.

i m sorry i have not heard of or used helix before as long as you don t send the coins directly from paxful to your markets wallet you ll be okay no much to worry about at all unless your moving lbs of marijuana and grams of xtal a week just place a small dollar order for btc see if you can get that into your desired wallet that way you get the hang of it before making a bigger order.
i think any country with enough political capital to be able to pull off withstanding pressures from the western economies would only do so if it benefitted them usually the countries able to do this wouldn t tolerate exposing their people to the things found on such a server or would run it themselves as an economic or cultural attack if it was a private citizen or business in one of these countries they would face great risk if somehow you were able to contact a government and convince them to allow your project i could see that potentially bringing conspiracy espionage and or treason charges if caught i would be careful any country you set this up in will most likely be the government to protect you if something happens you might find yourself living somewhere not friendly could try an area of instability if the infrastructure was still intact would not be a permanent location and could easily be physically knocked out both could be desired if you are willing to move regularly or use other servers too the increase in traffic would be very noticeable limiting time it could be run there are quite a few small countries which may not have the resources to monitor or traditionally aren t monitored but are still sound in places oceania and se asia has many small isolated island countries that might do again traffic would spike compared to normal for those regions not sure if a mobile platform would work perhaps a barge or transport ship on long voyages would be weather dependent and not sure max data that can be relayed this way highly likely it would be well below average dn server rates limiting traffic and feasibility could stagger users by giving designated log in periods to increase your capacity.
i'm going to try to stick to direct deals on tmg.
we love avengers's going through a major phishing outbreak lots of folks have been losing their btc stolen just beware or avoid till the security issues are resolved s.
time has come for us buyers to breakaway from centralized markets and put our trust in tmgwallet wallet with your favorite vendor is the way forward.
alphabaymarket on november pmwe are pleased to announce that alphabay market now supports multisig transactions this was requested a long time ago by the community so we decided to step up our game a bit and go for this option we are now the only marketplace on the deepweb having all of the following security measures source deepdotweb s marketplace list multisig transactions fa withdrawal pin vendor bond forced vendor pgpfor the less tech inclined here s how a multisig transaction works both the buyer and the seller must have set their public multisig key in their profile the buyer deposits of the item value in his alphabay wallet to cover market fees the buyer purchases the item then a multisig bitcoin address is generated using the buyer s key seller s key and a market generated public key both parties can use this publicly viewable information to verify the authenticity of the address the buyer sends money to this address and the seller ships the goods if the buyer is happy he finalizes and the seller received the market private key in case of dispute or refund the buyer receives the private key whoever got the private key will use it along with his own private key to claim the coins to make it simple buy the product and you get a btc address to send the coins to seller gets the private key when you finalize you get the key if you dispute and win this is a fool proof method to avoid exit scams you never give your private keys to anyone we don t provide help in cashing out the multisig address you have private keys out of so you are supposed to know the rest if you lose your private key it s too bad enjoy signup good look i have a renewed faith in alphabay now.
i can't figure out the pgp or gpg stuff at all i've set up an email account on vfemail net which lets me set up a pgp key and email people using the encryption but how to i send an encripted message on a vendors site who is asking for a gpg secured message or for that matter decode one that i got from that vendor in their message box on their site i'm losing my mind here trying to figure this out can someone direct me to a plain english tutorial on how to set this up so i can communicate with vendors please.

great summa i also would love to see your report btw found that german vendor.

thank you we have lots of funds tied in escrow right now an exit scam would devastate not only our business but a small chunk of our lives for awhilecheers s.
hias bitcoin is really not anonymous for example see or i believe it s time to think to switch to decentralized altcoin s specifically designed to protect privacy and anonymity i would like to speak about monero xmr and cloakcoin cloak i m not linked in anyway to these coins or teams there is also dash and shadowcash sdc altcoins but the first is centralised on a few masternodes and now seems to focus on zerotime transactions rather than true privacy anonymity and it seems to be a civil war inside the dev team and supporters and about the second well i really don t believe in shadowcash for various reasons that s all i don t want to launch a debate here on what coin is better than another it s only my own opinion cloackcoin has a small team of fanatic devs that seems never to give up event after a first year of catastrophic problems and many nightmares and a second year of very slow but constructive work they just released the good final product as promised for a long time you can exchange cloak on or buy directly on there is a gui wallet windows linux easy to use and with all the basic needed functions you would need without any useless stuff they have a decentralized anonymous market in development but as i begin to know them it should not be ready before years but before that a new improved wallet should be released very soon short video explanation about their anonymity system an interesting publication of still very good download of the complete blockchain to start quickly the wallet instead of slow first scroll down block explorer believe cloakcoin should not be ignored as a way to secure and anonymize your financial transactions i think the anonymity privacy protection of their system is quite good whatever nothing could be worse than bitcoin after all stand alone or in association with vpn and tor so give cloakcoin his chance try it the forum and chat is quite active and they should answer all your questions beside that there is the monero altcoin entirely new concept maths and cryptos while i think cloakcoin is great trustable and easy i believe xmr is technically superior and even more bullet proof than cloak but for now monero is a little bit less user friendly on first approach only a little the dev team is bigger as well as the project and universe globally and the devs are very active improving again and again monero even if now it s already probably the top best anonymous coin progress is slow because of the complexity of all the involved technics but xmr works well and is already fully useable homepage for all os command line party gui wallet online wallet really safe no risks to be hacked or loose your xmr but i m not going to speak about here great official offline wallet generator save the page to your computer disconnect from internet open the file of page or refresh and an extensive guide for securely generating an offline cold paper wallet accept monero payments you should have full support from community to integrate monero payment gateway on your website blockchain block explorer is a great monero service really underestimated works on tor it allows you to send anonymous monero to this website it converts them to bitcoins and after that sends the bitcoins to a btc address you gave it s better than all the bitcoin tumblers the api used is fully given here the best exchange for monero is and is really usefull too so i think cloak is directly easy intuitive and great for people to people transactions or small scale webshops and xmr is also very easy but needs maybe hours of readings and even more secure and the priority choice for big webshops monero should be the best choice for integration as payment gateway in a darknet webshop all the doc you need is should be available and if not the devs are going to help you very well and fast be assured maybe don t mention them it s for a dark market cloakcoin could also be integrated in webshop as automated payment gateway i think but i m less sure you ll get all the technical infos or answers very quick i really believe that darknet markets should move away from bitcoin and use cloakcoin or monero maybe survival of this second coin is more guaranteed for many years to come cloak is still smaller less spread and fragile but exists for years or at least propose to customer to pay by cloakcoin or xmr beside btc in addition as alternative their choice an education time will be needed to convert customers but they should quickly understand it s for the safety of everyone and you sellers too i hope i may have helped about bitcoin privacy anonymity monero xmr altcoin safe and easy ways to tumble btc ways.

thank you for posting kgreat info for all user.
quotewhat's the advantages of buying direct off a vendors site verses buying direct off a vendor through email well nothing too much i think a vendor operated site or market share the same negative consequences of possibly storing and not protecting your information as well as it should however after doing some email deals i must say that the process of ordering direct can be more cumbersome time consuming where it is more streamlined in a market type setting with a cart checkout function.
i trust agora slightly they have always pulled through in the dark times they could have already ran of with million and millions of btc if they wanted to but they obviosly dont want to or they would have by now they can be trusted i say.
i do miss the original silk road seriously at this point it seems so nostalgic.
this trial should of been extremely highly publicized from everything that i read this makes it so that website owners can be held responsible for what their users do and yea the whole thing was rigged a mess.

i like nucleus middle earth i saw some kid was on middle earth at this coffee shop on his laptopthose eagles they do look pretty harmless i wouldn t have knowni m setting up on black bank soon ootp is on there and a few other vendors i use feeling good about everything not agora we should have markets ideallyso something for eeveryone but i m trying to stay close to home if you know what i mean good luck market.
the active vendors forum is generally kept up to date have a look around a bit there to find someone who meets your need.
we have a lot tied up in escrow there at the moment as well but we are optimistic it doesn t feel like all the other exit scams before this sant.
never had that issue before it should prompt you for the bridge address you're using when it's configured takes no time extra to connect will pm you for specifics.
shot you a pm back thanks fragbit.
found this don't know if it would help at all since i don't really understand much of thisi think if it was revealed that the gov't surveillance that deep people would be outraged but then again what the fuck are we supposed to do it's the motherfucking government i'm way too lazy to start or even participate in a revolution unless it comes to the point where we're actually fighting the gov't and i'm sure many people are but then again many people aren't and are fighting right now like greenwald and edward snowden and their followers the country was founded on revolution and the founding fathers built it so the people can revolt against the oppressors if only the annoying social justice warriors people could take a look at the whole picture and get mad about some shit that matters then we'd have some hope that's one of the reasons the nd amendment was enstated too so we could have guns in case the gov't started acting shady but like i said i'm way to lazy for all that p why do people have to be dicks and make me all paranoid hopefully everyone will chill out soon and laugh about it afterward.

logikboom on march pmhi guys i seem to have misplaced my pgp public key how on earth do i get it back or where can i ask to show it again please someone assist what software are you using if you re using tails and you forgot to backup your keyrings then you re likely outta luck pm me if need be and i ll do my best to help you spitfir.
the train offers me wifi but i cannot stream videos do you think i can use tor when i'm on the train.
you can trust a hobbi.
have you imported the pgp key of the person you're trying to send an encrypted message to.
it's a scam it's a mirror of sr it will happily take your bitcoin but does not allow you to withdraw anything and when you try to place an order it doesn't actually place it and just loops you back to the main page.
i believe they have dirty mods on ab.
yes yes thank you much my broth.
boomshankar on july amgood day my brothers and sisters by any chance somebody have an agora market invite link i would be infinite thankful lots of love lo.
brevity on june pmquote from on may pmquote from glointhedark on may amfirst time buyer here looking to pointed in the right direction for a user friendly marketplace for lsd tried a few and seem to be going around in circles any help much appreciated regardsthere are a few reliable and user friendly marketplaces here are two you can register at quite simply dream market darknet heroes league dhl is also a promising new market that has started up could also look under the lsd andactive vendors sections of this forum to check out some of the trustworthy lsd vendors that are out there and who may have direct contact details or links to their own marketplace profiles or even their own online shops which some of the bigger vendors have happy hunting ssdhl is invite only from what i'm told the invite must come from a vendor disappointing to say the least many of the vendors here including us also vend on dhl our advice is to make a direct trade with such a vendor and after a successful trade politely ask them for a referral be goodsant.
hi i just came here from the active market list in reddit only to find its just the forum i have an agora account so im not new to this but thought this was a market but have now created a bb acoun.
i would be weary of switching it sounds like it isn't an agora specific problem for opsec i would refrain from any markets at the moment much love halfpin.
people have been saying this since they opened don't trust carders sorry for your los.
thumbs up for dream market recently i opened a dispute about an escrow order which after weeks wasn't shipped and got my btc back within a couple of hours.
yup these instructions work great.
i'm unfamiliar with this method would you mind going into deeper detail unsure what i would ask for or if i have to have some sort of account with a bank on the listing.
i am pleased to announce a brand new darknet market called acas like other darknet markets before us our focus is on selling controlled substances we can confidently say that the only thing common between acas and other darknet markets is that we are all on tor and we are all focused on facilitating the sale of selling controlled substances with acas we hope to have created a darknet market with a superior user experience to other darknet markets acas aims to be extremely user friendly and we will listen to our vendors and users to implement features they suggest to us so that they can have a darknet market built to meet the requirements of it's users referrals you can only join acas market by invite every user has a special referral invite link you can find this link on the right hand side of the settings page vendor friendly acas is vendor friendly and we will reward vendors who invite the most people with their referral url any vendor with any specific request or complaint can always contact us and we will do our utmost best to make sure that vendor gets what he wants commissions acas will offers our vendors commission until january st after that the commissions will be so vendors can always offer the best prices for their products to darknet users on acas two factor authentication acas offers two factor authentication using pgp to enhance the security and privacy of our users accounts all you have to do is upload a pgp key to acas on the settings page speed acas currently loads very fast we will make it remain that way and as we grow we know it will get slower so acas will always make significant investments to boost hardware capacity and network bandwidth so that you can spend less time waiting for page loads and more time browsing acas and placing orders customer support acas is a great marketplace easy to use with awesome customer support acas will respond promptly to user messages and try to resolve issues quickly and if there is any problem we will get back to you asap we have a dedicated support team that is solely committed to customer support encryption everything on acas is encrypted so much that even if a server was seized it would be impossible to retrieve any data every body using acas is safe including users vendors and it's operators with acas your data is in competent hands security acas is impenetrable to xss attacks sql injections and most attacks geared at taking down a darknet market we can boast that with our current implementation you will never lose any coins to a security breach product listings over the next few weeks acas will be working very hard to attract some well known vendors to our market we will do all we can to get the best vendors with the best prices to acas so watch out for our new vendors mobile for those who prefer to use mobile devices our market has a mobile version that will display properly on small screens and can be used on android with orbot though for increased security it's always preferable to use a computer running free open source software like tails all vendors we invited are all welcome to join acas market our sub reddit pgp onion url invite url acas managemen.
some people there's no talking to they have no sense of security or opsec at all and then usually do end up arrested and we see them plastered on the news oh we will catch these darknet users their time is up and crap like that i thoroughly agree we should have something of the sort do have this thread.
uncleal on october pm thanks for scaring me wabbit you are very welcome happy halloween pthe thing is if this bios infector is somehow being propogated through networks installed in software bundles that are common ms office itunes etc or even embedded in crypto programs or already put into the bios chips themselves by the hardware vendors then there is nothing you can do that means all your keystrokes all your passwords credit card info your most secret of secrets the things you'dnever ever tell anyone basically anything and everything you do on your computer will be clandestinely collected and sent to fusion databases for analysis this does not mean that you specifically are being targeted what it means is that at any given point if you are to become of interest to them then a probe would be as easy as flipping a switch in your bios that starts the keylog and upload store process this would all happen at any time with no system slow down no pop ups nothing the only thing that would happen is swat or fbi suddenly kicking in your door confiscating your hardware and detaining you until they find the evidence they want so they can make you into the evil criminal they had already set out to make you as.
sillywabbit on february pmvery likely although from the rise of other markets the fact that evo and agora are still up and the further development of p p networks like bitmessage etci doubt they can do much to stop it deter yes but those who are top notch in their opsec and know how to make robust websites the only shot they have is to get in on the inside like they did agree the cats already out of the bag and le knows it and that's percisely the reason why le turns to scare tactics because they know they can't do anything about it legally at least but more and more bills keep being brought up that would allow le and the nsa to infringe on our rights even more and this also needs to be addressed and stopped.
people have been saying this since they opened don't trust carders sorry for your los.
to add on to tt s post one can also purchase through local bitcoins with cash via online methods look for listings that offer cash deposit at certain bank branches these require you to go to the bank branch of choice and fill out an out of state deposit slip you fill this form out and give the cash to the teller and they deposit it into the account of the btc seller your btc s are then released to you you don t even have to be a member of the bank bank of america has always been very fast and hassle free also with this method you usually aren t charged a ridiculous price for your cryptocurrency just remember to tumble your coins to an intermediate wallet before using them to purchase from a vendor blockchain info accessed through tor allows for the quick creation of a wallet that can be used to tumble the coins.
they still haven t made this the default setting any reasoning behind that.
yes yes thank you much my broth.
hello guyswho has lost theyre money from agora me and my friends wallets are empt.
i can't wait to see that the community thinks about the ald if the reviews are good i will be purchasing alot more at a much more reasonable price considering the prices of it dropped majorly after i ordered my stuff i'm mic'ing the hits ug right now but if the demand is higher i can also mic then at higher doses for you guys i could just buy the sheets that this site has offered with the ald already laid on it but since it is orange sunshine i will just buy the xtal myself and lay it on the paper that is it supposed to be laid on the orange sunshine blotter any questions or concerns please don't hesitate to contact me much love bhps for all the others wondering the other sample that was thrown in the pack is the mdma that i have been moving for the better part of years it is very potent and the sample i sent you it enough for people atleast unless of course you have a very high tolerance.
just wondering do you have a pic of the orange sunshine blotter art i like that many of the other analogs are on blotters bearing the name of the chemical but ald stands out given its history dating back to the 's so just wondering what the blotter sheet looks like and what individual tabs look like and thanks for getting this mystical mythical substance out to our community.
root on may pmi knew this would be happening over and over again if it's not greedy admins then it would be some other letter agency i think the next one to step out on us will be iddle arth the hobbits social network seems to be down for too long now and there were numerous complaints about people not being able to withdraw their funds also at the beginning of the month there was a hacker bragging that they were able to get their ip address and cause page crashing by insertion code in a post agorah seems to be pretty knocked out right now with their almost down time i think the admins do not want to steal the funds but they don't seem that interested in fixing the problem or allowing a separate url for vendors to work their orders and customers to withdraw their funds you could also say they are relaxed about it agora it took a little while but it has been fine for the last few dayssurprising how quickly black bank seems to have exited.
im moving to dream all the good guys are there already invite for dreammarket love avengers ai stay safeft.
i love you thank yo.
i've been thinking about grabbing some al ladand p lsdthere is a pretty big demand around my area for it so i am going to be grabbing it for local people but if you guys are interested in it on here i will have no problem offering it to this community also just let know me.
the problem has nothing to do with pgp safe mail doesn't provide pop access to free accounts you have to pay for the account to get pop access that's why you can't login with thunderbird.
alphabay s going through a major phishing outbreak lots of folks have been losing their btc stolen just beware or avoid till the security issues are resolved s.
dont they have prepaid mg cards you can use that i guess.
ohdonpiano on november pmbecause the thread was started in augustand facepalm.
that molly is absolute fire thanks bombheadie will be reviewing the ald coming up l l.
good stuff you should be very weary of cruising the darknet on what is essentially a homing device.
enigmaticsmile on february pmtry to keep your desktop or laptop clean you can download tor and gpg to an external hd or usb can gpg software be kept on an external drive that isn't an os like tails i learned that as it needs access to services it has to be kept on the machine this is why i encrypt my gpg software as well as my computer and never save any keys but i'm always on the lookout for apps i can keep on a thumb drive i'm going to read up on truecrypt.

of hidden marketplaces tor i p the list is updated fairly regularly as new markets are added or old markets are taken down understanding bitcoinwhat is bitcoin the wikipedia page is here btc is a decentralized digital currency it isn't anchored to gold or any other asset meaning its value when exchanged for fiat currencies can fluctuate quite wildly whenever you make a bitcoin transaction it is recorded on a public ledger called the block chain this means anybody can see any transaction made see the tough part the part that makes bitcoin the currency of choice for anonymous purchases is linking transactions to people to reduce the chances of transaction being traced back to yourself you can 'tumble' your bitcoins tumbling your bitcoins is a way of swapping your original btc for other people's btc in order to sever your block chain trail this makes it more difficult for people to link your purchases to you it is important to tumble your coins through either a tor hidden service or using a wallet routed through tor choosing a vendorthe following links list various vendors on the darknet el presidente's vendor directory gram's infodesk vendors directory you buy from a vendor do your research and make sure you read reviews and discussions on dnm forums the hub has a vendor area you can look at to gather this kind of information you should also learn what it means to finalize early fe markets offering only this type of payment will not get you your money back if the vendor does not send your product understand the risks and only fe with a vendor you trust if you are unsure you should find a market offering an escrow service if you have a dispute with a vendor it helps to be polite and try to work towards a resolution that is fair to the both of you before raising a

hi all i want to know your opinion about market for you what is the best i speak about drug market i saw that agora don't work anymore evolution is dead so now how is the best i am on blackbank alphabay nucleus and abraxas do you think is it a good market or not and about middle earth is it done too or what if you know good market give me link please thanks for your future answeri wish the best at every peoples on majestic garden see you.
great links guys however i still suggest we put it at the top i know that some people are just too lazy to even look around the forums as seen from some of the threads i read so thats why i am hoping that having something at the top of the page will help guide peoples eyes to it especially if its something named like commandmants or some other name that will stick out it's easy to beat up on these people at times but i still want to help out where i can hopefully they see those links and read up i know some people can be lazy and its easy to get upset at them but i still hope we can be better than that we have lost enough people to the drug war so i'd really love to see that number go down even if it just helps or people.
we need the basics of how tmg works and what is needed before you even order on tmg some of the stuff you guys have been sending me is downright scary to your security and i'm hoping that the message i sent to staff is well recieved and hopefully implemented i think a link on the top of the website with a listing of the basic stuff with links to tutorials is a must some of you need a bit of extra help and hopefully easy to find links will get you there along with a link at the top of the page so its not as hard to miss seriously some of your are taking huge risks with your safety and it worries me that your going to land yourself in jail and i know the ones that need this the most aren't in this forum looking at this thread so thats why i'm hoping a link at the top of the page will help out the community more knowledge that is out there the safer we all are.
i am starting a service to clean bitcoin as well as exchanging dogecoin litecoin nubits peercoin dashcoin blackcoin reddcoin and feathercoin i would be charging of the transaction plus for the mining fees of the needed transactions.
maybe for smaller newer vendors this would be a great way to make orders but for big vendors i really don t see it happening too time consumin.
yeah agora's been in limbo for a while now i would advise you not to deposit or accept any money there until it's been stable for a while great market when it's more stable but this has been a bad time.
i made a public complaint about their pin system failing and minutes later my account is gone with all my money in itcan someone please see what my profile on ab says.
welcome albert glad to see you around these part.
on february pmquote from testerino on february pmquote from on february pmanyone got an invite for this little one you if no one sent u thus far really i haven t received a pm i actually sent you an email by mistake the first time clicked on the wrong icon.
i really don't know why more vendors arent coming around to tmg and promoting that instead sure i can see the downside of it taking longer to build clientel but fuck after each exit scam and how much money they lose per scam i'm sure it has to build up to a shit ton of money lost more trusted vendors need to make their way here i've tried on my end at least i got galindoi to make his way here let's add to that lis.
jesusofrave on november amgreat work dh from our end our first thought is that's alot of extra work per order for example we have been doing direct orders since sr went down and have never left a customer out of pocket the only way it would be viable for us to implement some type of system such as the above would be to drastically reduce our customer base ie increase min order to mg or g we can see a benefit to the wider community of a system such as this but the time needed to implement this we imagine will be prohibitive imagine doing this for orders a day even even would soak up alot of time just some thoughts we would be very happy for someone to tell us we're wrong we had a late night so clarity may be lacking i agree with jesus seems like quite some work for all the established well trusted vendors although this is really good and many kudos for introducing it very awesome doseheavy this is perfect for all the new vendors arriving with heavy promises but have no reputation.
hi guys im pretty new to this and have spent some time trying to work out tails and im thinking i should get a vpn but then i read this gave me a headacheshould i get a vpn on tails.
if it's around for good now i have the unpleasent duty of eating my fedora.
there are two main trusted tumblers and a third which was just released that i will post here along with some information about each i will also post an extra free method that you can use on top of tumbling first bitblender this service has been around for quite some time and is one of the trusted tumblers bitblender works with a shared coin system one huge wallet sending many small payments while the others seem more sophisticated many wallets bigger than your deposit that will send amounts to the addresses you gave in both cases it should work as far as blockchain analysis goes thanks wilderness bitblender also has a high volume bonus program where if you send btc within days your fee goes down by they also have a referral program where once combined deposits from a user and his her referred users reaches btc in days the referring user will be credited of all deposits fee randomized bitblender my ref link ref helix by grams grams started in april of as a simple search engine for products on the markets after a few months they started helix and have since created many useful services such as torads infodesk and gramsflow helix has a regular version which requires a grams account and a light version which does not the full version of helix has more fine tuned controls like delays and sending the clean coins in more than one transaction in the light version you send your coins to the address it gives you and as soon as it gets confirmations it sends the cleaned coins in one transaction to your specified address in the light version it can take up to hours but most transactions are completed within minutes fee minimum withdrawal amount btcmaximum withdrawal amount btchelix account cost not needed for helix light btchelix pay shield by sigaint sigaint has been one of the trusted darknet email service providers for about a year now and has just announced their new tumbler on june i have not had a chance to try it yet but it claims to complete the tumble in minutes what's unique about pay shield is that it has a pay someone with mixed coins feature from their website pay someone with mixed coins is primarily used to pay someone else with maximum privacy simply input the payees' bitcoin address and the amount they expect and pay shield will generate a mix for you and calculate how much you need to send to make the mix work out to that amount fee randomized pay shield on to the free method this is not recommended as a stand alone method there are many websites that store a large amount of bitcoins stores casinos exchanges etc i personally use casino websites send in your btc play a few rounds penny slots or you'll regret it and send it to your final destination you can also send to your preferred website of choice first before sending it to your tumbler with exchanges it's best to find one where you can send your btc and convert to ltc or another currency then back to btc please beware of phishing links i highly recommend using dnstats com or we love avengers to confirm you are always using the correct address these sites have been providing darknet market info for years and can be trusted i have verified all these links but please feel free to do so yourself.
its true though can t trust cardersab has made me very insecure about bunch of stuff the admin over there is dip shit wont be surprised he was part of the carders crew from evo and the tor carding forums or whatever lairs and cheats there seem like a bunch of familiar faces over in the moderation crew who are just watching the whole thing unfold and not doing jackshi.
thanks guys the stealth is nothing special but it will blend in with piece of mail that are sent out daily.
