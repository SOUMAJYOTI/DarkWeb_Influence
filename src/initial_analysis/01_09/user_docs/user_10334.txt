on how and which computers you use on a daily and for which purposes sometimes i log in on random computers of friends for example in some less security elegant things using a password i can keep in my head that may not be as secure as a random digits code but i have access to it on every machine i use without the need of connecting to or opening my safe with all the really important passwords if this computer is compromise somehow the damage would be small there are dozens of other scenarios where this can backfire imagine if somebody is not at home but needs quick access to some password he decides to connect via teamviewer to his homecomputer and opens his wallets through their software i agree that these risks can mostly be avoided if the user is technically firm but for a large percentage of users there would still be huge risks sure if you stay in a nice isolated special linux what not environment the pw manager is probably safe but tell that to windows users with an average of malwares and unknown processes running in the background . depends password manager have the risk that if your computer from which you access the pw manager is compromise with a simple keylogger the attacker will get every single password which is rascally the worst thing that can happen . yeah i agree a password manager has obvious upsides but it still is a vulnerability to have

different password for every site what exactly it takes to make safe password the f a q on cryptsetup site has good info passphrase length is not really the right measure passphrase entropy is for example a random lowercase letter a z gives you bit of entropy one element of a z gives you bits of entropy an element of a za z gives you bits and a za z gives you bits on the other hand a random english word only gives you bits of entropy per character using sentences that make sense gives lower entry series of random words gives higher entropy do not use sentences that can be tied to you or found on your computer this type of attack is done routine today that said it does not matter too much what scheme you use but it does matter how much entropy your passphrase contains because an attacker has to try on average bits of entropy in passphrase different passphrases to guess correctly historically estimations tended to use comparing time estimates but more modern approaches try to estimate cost of guessing a passphrase as an example i will try to get an estimate from the numbers in more references can be found a the end of this document note that these are estimates from the defender side so assuming something is easier than it actually is is fine an attacker may still have vastly higher cost than estimated here lurks uses sha for hashing per default the claim in the reference is billion tries second for sha we will leave aside the check whether a try actually decrypts a key slot now the machine has gpus which i will estimate at an overlay lifetime cost of us eur each and an useful lifetime of years this is on the low side disregarding downtime the machine can then break n passphrases for eur us k that is one bit passphrase hashed once with sha for eur us k note that as this can be parallelized it can be done faster than years with several of these machines for plain dm crypt no hash iteration this is it this gives with sha plain do crypt default is ripe

escrow we would have lost more no doubt despite that we really had some other features in place for the most important vendors that prevented more swissshop for example had a lot of orders in the hour timeframe where the site was hacked and didnt lose any of them we had his btcs doublechecked hardcoded by another function and the site would have shut down if they were changed we had farmer s mpk hardcoded too but the hacker still managed to steal an order from him i posted a short explanation on how the hacker did it and how i could have prevented it in this thread in the cr forum . begin pip

guy seems to know what hes doing and he doesnt pretend that he knows everything the hackers got away with not the they usually get away with there were security features in place to prevent further losses there comes a point where there is only so much you can do unless of course there was only to steal . i dunno when a market gets hacked and the admins shrug their shoulders i usually deem it a

you guys are still here and standing in times where fagots like evo admins jump ship and set us back like were in again with solid decentralisation a la openbazaar still not in action were happy to see more and more vendors setting up individual shops and taking away the high serverload and the millions of commission from big markets for this reason we planned to launch onionshop earlier this year the idea was to sell one time licences which include the full source code for an independent darknetshop and a guide on how to set it up we ended up with completely different projects though so we decided to rather bury os for now i dont want to release the source code neither since we are going to use it elsewhere but heres the installation tutorial on how to set up a hidden server since i spent some time writing it in sure it comes in handy to one or another who wants to set one up it was written for the onionshop setup so maybe you dont need everything for example the whole gnupg part for pip support we dont explain on how to set up a shop in this pdf its just a guide on how to get a hidden service running in general with the current situation of markets i assume more people than usual are current playing around with hidden services and setting them up so they may catch up one or another advice from this doc cant emphasize enough that there is obviously a lot that can be done to further improve the set up and that it takes more knowhow than a page pdf to run a server safely peace edit added some mirrors and plaintextpdf without screenshots . howdy didnt get much time to
