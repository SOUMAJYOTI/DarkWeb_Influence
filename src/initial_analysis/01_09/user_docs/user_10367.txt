someone and its important you are able to keep track of everything that was said while keeping everything in one running message with formatting is an option it can become troublesome with longer conversations and you have to rely on the second party to return your last message before you can account for what you said now this is just one example of some data you might want to store obviously all sensitive information needs to be properly disposed of at the first possible moment it still presents a level of risk while it is still needed i will describe one way that you can easily improve the resilience of your digital security first you need to have a good understanding of pgp and practice practice because it is going to become very important here in a few steps this technique relies on obscuration of your files and a strong encryption system first step is to get yourself a sufficient micro sd card these are inexpensive hold plenty of data and are extremely easy to dispose of in a pinch i recommend a gb as they are about the most common anymore and very inexpensive you will also need some form of micro sd reader next is to create a truecrypt volume on your newly acquired microsd card there are plenty of guides on this please become familiar with this software before placing any important information on the card now that you have a place to store your files lets get to obscuring your data there are many ways to do this but what you want are a lot of miss files of varying sizes and with lots of extensions some indie games are very small mb and will have literally hundreds of small files in them alternately you can simply go and create folders with random selected names but try and follow some sort of theme as you nest your folders as to further hide their purpose you want to create top level folders at a maximum and each should have folders per level nested for levels the deeper you go the harder to find your files will be but it will also require much more work the next step is to place random numbers of files with various extensions and varying file sizes into each of your stealth folders now we are going to create a our first pgp key fill this key out with bogs information that you will be able to recognize generate the key with a strong password which you can absolutely remember this one of two passwords which must be both very strong and easy for you to remember write it down for now but remember you will need to dispose of this hard copy later now we are going to create our first container file start by making somefilename txt as an empty file now we are going to wrap this text file into a far archive from winrar you are going to jump to the advanced tab and select set password select encrypt filenames and enter a sufficiently strong password this is the second password you absolutely must remember at this point we are going to change the file name and extension so that it will blend in with one of our stealth folders get creative here from here we are going to use the text document within the now hidden rar archive as our first point of storage this file will be used for storing account names and passwords this way you can use a unique password for each site and you can use passwords sufficiently complex that they will never be cracked in any useful time frame and you wont have to remember them before saving anything in this archive we are going to paste the contents of the file into the pip application and encrypt the data to the key we made in step now simply paste the encrusted message into the text file and save it this will prompt you to update the archive now to further enhance your security you are going to create several more pip keys all with unique passwords the passwords for these may be stored inside of the first archive relatively safely use one key for storing messages and repeat the last step to create a new archive and a new text document since this text is encrusted with a unique key it should be considered doubly secure as having any other archives password compromise leave all remaining archives secured you will repeat this process as many times as you feel necessary until all of your data has been split up and secured i suggest also placing one of the other private keys into each encrusted text this ensures that you have a backup of the public and private keys for each of your files but they are protected by another pgp key this should provide you with a safe number of backups should you need to recover one of your keys while never leaving it vulnerable to being publicly viewable the idea with this system is to layer your defenses the disk volume is encrusted the archive files are password protected with encrusted filenames each archive contains only pip encrusted data each of which utilizes a unique key and all of your accounts may use unique username and passwords but you only have to remember of them now the biggest weakness to this system is the initials rar file and the pgp key used for all of your other keys passwords it is critical that this first pgp key be secured in some way i recommend that you place these files on a separate microsd and put it someplace safe away from all your other business where it will never be looked at twice this is the only copy of the key required to access all of your other secured files so if you loose this you are starting back form ground the goal here is that your archive which contains all of your other passwords should be sufficiently blended in and secured that the odds of leo finding it cracking its password and then using that information to target the remainder of your data is next to zero since there are many archives even if they were to discover them all the question then becomes which file do they attack first if they get any of the other archives you have stopped them in their tracks cold . so on occasion it becomes necessary to store information that we would

its the privacy factor further both parties will be utilizing vpon services locked in the same general geo location so added latency will be animal one last thing is that we dont much care about

necessary to store information that we would otherwise wish to dispose of for example say you have an encrusted pm going with someone and its important you are able to keep track of everything that was said while keeping everything in one running message with formatting is an option it can become troublesome with longer conversations and you have to rely on the second party to return your last message before you can account for what you said now this is just one example of some data you might want to store obviously all sensitive information needs to be properly disposed of at the first possible moment it still presents a level of risk while it is still needed i will describe one way that you can easily improve the resilience of your digital security first you need to have a good understanding of pgp and practice practice because it is going to become very important here in a few steps this technique relies on obscuration of your files and a strong encryption system first step is to get yourself a sufficient micro sd card these are inexpensive hold plenty of data and are extremely easy to dispose of in a pinch i recommend a gb as they are about the most common anymore and very inexpensive you will also need some form of micro sd reader next is to create a truecrypt volume on your newly acquired microsd card there are plenty of guides on this please become familiar with this software before placing any important information on the card now that you have a place to store your files lets get to obscuring your data there are many ways to do this but what you want are a lot of miss files of varying sizes and with lots of extensions some indie games are very small mb and will have literally hundreds of small files in them alternately you can simply go and create folders with random selected names but try and follow some sort of theme as you nest your folders as to further hide their purpose you want to create top level folders at a maximum and each should have folders per level nested for levels the deeper you go the harder to find your files will be but it will also require much more work the next step is to place random numbers of files with various extensions and varying file sizes into each of your stealth folders now we are going to create a our first pgp key fill this key out with bogs information that you will be able to recognize generate the key with a strong password which you can absolutely remember this one of two passwords which must be both very strong and easy for you to remember write it down for now but remember you will need to dispose of this hard copy later now we are going to create our first container file start by making somefilename txt as an empty file now we are going to wrap this text file into a far archive from winrar you are going to jump to the advanced tab and select set password select encrypt filenames and enter a sufficiently strong password this is the second password you absolutely must remember at this point we are going to change the file name and extension so that it will blend in with one of our stealth folders get creative here from here we are going to use the text document within the now hidden rar archive as our first point of storage this file will be used for storing account names and passwords this way you can use a unique password for each site and you can use passwords sufficiently complex that they will never be cracked in any useful time frame and you wont have to remember them before saving anything in this archive we are going to paste the contents of the file into the pip application and encrypt the data to the key we made in step now simply paste the encrusted message into the text file and save it this will prompt you to update the archive now to further enhance your security you are going to create several more pip keys all with unique passwords the passwords for these may be stored inside of the first archive relatively safely use one key for storing messages and repeat the last step to create a new archive and a new text document since this text is encrusted with a unique key it should be considered doubly secure as having any other archives password compromise leave all remaining archives secured you will repeat this process as many times as you feel necessary until all of your data has been split up and secured i suggest also placing one of the other private keys into each encrusted text this ensures that you have a backup of the public and private keys for each of your files but they are protected by another pgp key this should provide you with a safe number of backups should you need to recover one of your keys while never leaving it vulnerable to being publicly viewable the idea with this system is to layer your defenses the disk volume is encrusted the archive files are password protected with encrusted filenames each archive contains only pip encrusted data each of which utilizes a unique key and all of your accounts may use unique username and passwords but you only have to remember of them now the biggest weakness to this system is the initials rar file and the pgp key used for all of your other keys passwords it is critical that this first pgp key be secured in some way i recommend that you place these files on a separate microsd and put it someplace safe away from all your other business where it will never be looked at twice this is the only copy of the key required to access all of your other secured files so if you loose this you are starting back form ground the goal here is that your archive which contains all of your other passwords should be sufficiently blended in and secured that the odds of leo finding it cracking its password and then using that information to target the remainder of your data is next to zero since there are many archives even if they were to discover them all the question then becomes which file do they attack first if they get any of the other archives you have stopped them in their tracks cold . quote from camus on february pmof course this is all useless in the up and places with similar key disclosure laws where you will be sent to jail
