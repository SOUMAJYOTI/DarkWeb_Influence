so i wanted to start this series off kind of introducing myself and going over a couple of thoughts first off i am a security junkie ive worked both sides of the fence and like to think i know my shit that being said security like psychology has many different theories and schools of thought since jolly rogers threads while very information need the curls fixed and include some topics that i personally would remove i want to start a new dated series where noobs can come read i look forward to everybodys discussion so that we can all be better informed in sure you will learn something from me and i know ill learn something from you my role in the darknet has always been a lurker i bought stuff once or twice years ago and i was one of those small time done care type right now i just hang out on the forums until after the holidays can scrape the cash for vendor bond etc etc so to start it off there is one thing you need to always keep in mind feds are here there is no doubt about it and they will try to identify you therefore you must learn and perfect one thing operation security aka opsec opsec is key it is human nature to want to connect to others but the smallest bit of information that might not mean anything to you may mean the world to your adversary for example if somebody asks you the weather its sunny always comments about a lot of snow or rain can easily reduce the size of area to investigate some people believe in providing disinformation which can be useful in some scenarios however on the darknet we all want to look alike similar to the reason gangbangers all dress alike white tee jeans etc when the shit goes down and their description comes across the radio the suspect looks like the bystanders if you take away one thing from this post opsec second get off windows windows is such a huge target for malware also there are reasons to believe microsoft and the asa work very closely together get on a linux based system whether it is tails or a custom build of arch linux shameless plug which i will be offering in the near future look for a post in the near future on how to set up a fail closed if tor breaks nothing works no accidental ip leakage read salu tor pray third be vigilant and always use your head when pentesting it seems to me that the days of code execution on some internet facing hardware are going the way of the dinosaur the easiest way to compromise someone is social engineering so point is done click shit always be wary of curls being posted even if the uri looks legit they may have some xss vulnerability that will inject some javascript which better be disabled and compromise you short story time i am on a pentest breaking into a school send an e mail to all of the staff saying we were contracted by the school to test password security go to our site enter your password receive a score received a few clicks it admit caught it and sent a school wide e mail out saying it was swam and disregard etc etc i thought that route was burnt wrong the next day i had more clicks curiosity killed the cat i dont want to turn this into a wall of text i just wanted to introduce myself and give a couple basin tips that go a long way in the future i will be covering more technical stuff and it will be more detailed rather than a general post like this i will be covering things like proxies pgp encryption opsec in more detail if you have any requests on a specific topic let them here or pm me i look forward to talking with everyone and learning from one another stay safe . so i wanted to

like to hear your reasonings for using this distro it has twitched to systemd which uses binary config and log files it also uses pre compiled binaries by default and it seems to be prohibitively difficult to set up a pax rbac and deblobbed kernel i like arch because of its kiss philosophy it is as bare bones as it gets without getting into having to compile everything like gentoo lfs if compiling is your thing you can use the austere easily rather than pacman regarding systemd i really done know enough about it yet to speak on it from a protect your privacy standpoint i think i can apply my thoughts on compiling software from source vs compiled binaries to the system thing though the benefit of compiling versus using binaries is that a binary could be backdoored without your knowledge if you have to worry about binaries being backdoored by an adversary then youre probably already sucked because you have a very determined attacker i dont know many people who even go as far as to verify checksums let alone verify the source isnt backdoored prior to compiling finally im not doubting you i subscribed from the arch mailing list long ago i havent heard any issues with grsec

handful of others are offering alternatives to systemd i agree systemd scares me i done want to get too trefoil hat either but it is weird how everybody that denounced system shuttleworth at canonicals debian to name two suddenly fell in line and switched over to it so quickly when it is so anti unfix philosophy of do one thing and do it well i dont have an answer i did see some ways to

compiling theyre probably going to give up regarding key management is this what youre looking for systemd to be honest i didnt really know all that much about it except people were all fired up about it and pottering was getting death threats etc i did some reading since i read your post and you got me and i am really nervous about systemd i fear it is going to be one of those things that we cant do anything about without making things extremely difficult as of right now it looks like gentoo and bsd and a small handful of others are offering alternatives to systemd i agree systemd scares me i done want to get too trefoil hat either but it is weird how everybody that denounced system shuttleworth at canonicals debian to name two suddenly fell in line and switched over to it so quickly when it is so anti unfix philosophy of do one thing and do it well i dont have an answer i did see some ways to get away from it but i think as it becomes more intreated it will be more difficult to get away from i dont have an answer at the moment . quote from ni on december amquote from plunderinpete on december pmi like arch because of its kiss philosophy it is as bare bones as it gets without getting into having to compile everything like gentoo lfs if compiling is your thing you can use the austere easily rather than macian fair enough i am arguing from a gentle point of view quote from plunderinpete on december pmregarding systemd i really done know enough about it yet to speak on it from a protect your privacy standpoint i think i can apply my thoughts on compiling software from source vs compiled binaries to the system thing though the benefit of compiling versus using binaries is that a binary could be backdoored without your knowledge if you have to worry about binaries being backdoored by an adversary then youre probably already sucked because you have a very determined attacker i dont know many people who even go as far as to verify checksums let alone verify the source isnt backdoored prior to compiling i would argue that this is an argumentum ad populum just because most people do not verify checksums does not mean it isnt an important aspect of computer security also i think it would be safe to assume that most users of ciphernet technologies like tor are facing a powerful and determined adversary by virtue of using said ciphernets especially those

proxy and some other things already configured whonix is another design based operating system that takes on a security by isolation philosophy whonix consists of two parts whonix gateway and phoenix workstation rascally you work in your workstation and all the traffic is pushed through the gateway which is in turn pushing through tor the idea is by isolation malware infections do not have the same impact as they would have in a non isolated os qubesos torvm takes the same philosophy of security by isolation however it isolates each application into its own vm one of those vms is similar to the whonix gateway where all data is pushed through and torifies traffic the big advantage to qubesos is that if firefox were to be explained then the malware should not be able to break out of that firefox container a custom built osso this is my personal preference i use fully encrusted arch linux on a us and a transparent proxy to push everything through tor i dont really have a reason for this except for being partial to arch linux i just love arch over a design based os and it is personal preference i also do more with my machine than just browse onionland so it is more convenient to just run my pray script start the proxy verify im in onionland and move forward so which one do you choose well what are you worried about protecting yourself from if youre worried about local forensics and being raised by the abi hard drive images etc id go with tails os it is amnesic by design and is probably your best bet i have also had my eyes opened to liberte linux but have not had much time to check it out if youre concerned about being explained by some vulnerability go with qubesoss torvm its security by isolation design will provide the best security as mentioned before if the browser vm is popped it will be pretty difficult to exploit and hop to another vm and break out of that browser vm if youre worried about isp snooping and leaking protocol level information go w whonix its workstation gateway setup coupled with boot time randomization and secure network time synchronization will provide protection from is snooping personally i prefer the tailsos route pushing everything through tor and blending in with the crowd is in my opinion the best way to stay hidden among the rest of the crowd think in the hood on the corner there a group of people wearing white shirts and jeans a crime is committed and the cops put over the radio that the suspect is wearing a white t shirt and jeans the cops arrive on scene and there are people that all look the same which one is the suspect that is the major advantage to tails and to tor as a whole the more people that look alike the harder it is to isolate an individual users traffic for those interested in there own custom os here are my iptables rules and elegant torrc configs go more in depth check out here . quotea custom built osso this is my personal preference i use fully encrusted arch linux on a us and a

having never used a linus system previously wasnt too big a fan of it i just wasnt that pretty and i didnt understand security like i now do so i set about configuring the ultimate hardened debian based system i spent hours and hours working on it learning linux essentially from scratch i got a list of the most commonly recorded user agent data and wrote a script that would randomly select the user agent data to pass when executing wget and curl i got blessed with clock skew and started making inroads into creating a stratum ntp server using a raspberry pi and gps module then i thought hey what if instead of having perfect time i throw in some clock skew on purpose wrote all these scripts to randomize mac address at level of under not after login and check that my ip wasnt leaking by checking my ip at random times using an ip echo api i taught myself everything i could about how tor works i wrote and re wrote my iptables i sat for hours packet sniffing to confirm that i wasnt getting any ip or dns leaks on the matter of dns leaks what if i had my own dns caching serve so as to reduce dns lookups the list goes on my point as clever as give convinced myself that i am i am not a security expert i will never be a security expert why try to re invent the wheel when there is a team of eggheads who are sitting around working on this very issue about which theyre experts

quoteever seen that simpsons episode where homer develops a car call the homer what whonix feels like a miss mash of ideas from someone afflicted with add psychostimulant abuse who has sat down and thought about things for too long and burned a hole in his head from thinking about every permutation of every scenario and just driven himself crazy dont get me wrong i think the dude is fucking gamesome and if i wasnt using tails id certainly be used whonix but you read his detailed blueprint of whonix and you will get the impression that this man is a little unhinged whether in a good way or a bad way im not entirely clear . quotethese last two are disabled because theyre the wrong choice for lotsapplications in particular isolating by port is a bad idea forseparating protocols
