that was very cool read i can tell you we make no money for ourselves any money we get is sent to admin to keep the forum open we also are buying tabs incognito check shipping stealth and testing we also work on educational stuff and help vendors as long as we have been doing this starting with sr than s many of us and many of you got tired of the bs all we ever asked for was give us good acid at a fair price the vendors who are here i think feel the same way where else can you chat with a vendor and get the sence they are here to spread the love anyway old members know this new members need to experience it the garden is open to all a place designed to put you at peace love and light es . yezzir i certainly spend more time here than in my real life garden a lot of my day is spent working with my computer and this place has become a virtual home away from home after being bitten a few times out of the garden i don t see myself going anywhere else all of the knowledge and experience shared with a lack of egomania is truly an amazing sight thank you all for what you provide the community everyone here makes this thing happen whether you are avenger endor admit member or even guest you are apart of the garden s ecosystem without you the idea of tug both online and irl would be different keep on keepin on . i was very happy to resolve a longstanding order on sr a little while back which meant my daily ritual of checking messages along with tug forum became more amplified and i am very happy now that i don t go to any other markets unless i feel a little nosey i quickly become reminded of why this place is right for me as soon as the intrusion images and dialogue of other markets becomes visible tmg is like a gently lit smoking room and i hope to treat it as such moving forward i wanted to make a note about how tmg has affected my life especially for people who are new here and wondering if its for real and especially if you aren t aware of the great work the avengers have put in to testing chemicals and standardising reviews of vendors to encourage high quality of service like so many others across the darknet i am sensitive and struggling with my mental health and with the society that i have found myself in which denounces the spiritual experience and yet does not hold much value for the scientific method either i knew there was something very significant for me when i first joined sr and began searching through what felt right about different chemicals and what felt wrong eventually the thing that hurt me the most was paranoia about ordering and more specifically the energy that comes with products when you order them my first orders here were like a dream because i had almost no paranoia and the orders just smoothly happened but the difference i would like to think is that there is consistency here there is nothing to collapse nothing to steal nothing to prove except perhaps professionalism of conduct people are here genuinely to talk about psychedelics good or bad and talk about their experiences without the heaviness that comes with paranoia and addiction people pull out their experiences when others are in times of need which unfortunately is the most that can be done when anonymity is still a part of it i ve learned a lot and i am returning slowly back to a baseline my experiences with sr were mindblowing and scarf and sr was just downright unpleasant but tmg is indeed a cluster of trees where people find themselves starting to relax this isn t an advertisement or anything i mean these guys probably aren t really making any money at all but its a call to those people who are like me who need a break but still have stuff to discover with psychedelics tmg is genuinely a part of my daily life it makes me happy it makes me sad it makes me laugh it helps me through and it wastes my time where i could be doing something more productive stay safe . that was very cool read i can tell you
