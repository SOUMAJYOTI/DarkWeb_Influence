while ago but was never successful there are very limited search results available when trying to achieve this and honestly i have no idea why tails dont include torchat native i seem to recall concluding that torchat could not be loaded into memory and had to be physically installed perhaps by copying the torchat program files into the tails iso before burning it to dvd or onto the usb you have installed it to that said i have very limited understanding of this type of technology . i installed it from the torchat deb and then ran apt get plate to resolve the dependencies no luck then i
