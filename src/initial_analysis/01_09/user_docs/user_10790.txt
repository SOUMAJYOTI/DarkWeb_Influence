end it with this message is valid from feb th until feb th and the information in it should not be considered valid after that date then you avoid that situation because youre absolutely right i can just copy paste that somewhere else and i can now really get you in trouble the only problem with the timestamp is you could lie in order to prove the timestamp you could say the hash of bitcoin block number some recent block is the hash so you could prove it was written after the date but in order to lock it in a window of time proving both before and after times you need to do something like hash the whole pgp signed message and embed that in the blockchain or something and that way you have proof it was written before it was embedded and because the message itself contains a block hash thats proof that it was after a certain date so you have reflectively proved a timeframe in fact i think thats probably what those time stamp services like proof of existence do by doing that you can prove you wrote a message and you can prove exactly when you wrote it and you can write in an expiration date inside it as well . true i sometimes sign i dont know why maybe just habit making a mental note
