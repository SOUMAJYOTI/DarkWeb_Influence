is there any interest in a security and anonymity journal club we could pick one academy research paper each week everyone reads it one person writes a summary of the paper to get the discussion started then everyone weighs in with their opinions questions corrections etc theres a large corpus of literature at but we shouldnt limit the journal club to that list since theres so much research on computer and network security in fact we dont have to stick strictly to academy papers we could discuss talks given at defcon ccc black hat etc maybe do papers and talk each month to spice things up the journal club would allow us to learn more about security and anonymity and the discussions it fosters would make a nice corpus of information for people who are too timid to participate really wed want people to participate so if youre interested let me know here are my suggestions for papers to discuss tor the second generation onion router by dingledine mathewson and syverson an obvious and relatively easy onewhy im not an entropist by syverson i just read this paper on anonymity theory and its really interestingsome papers on mix networks to understand how they differ from onion routingprivate information retrieval by chor goldreich kushilevitz and sudan any of the recent big attack papers users get routed trawling for tor hidden services practical attacks against the i p network etc seminal cryptography papers although these will probably be over most peoples heads your suggestions are welcome . is there any interest in a security and anonymity journal club we could

participants but it would be an excuse to spend more time reading and rereading whitepapers that ive trimmed or forgotten about or never understood properly in the first place . there rent many people here yet maybe i should create a thread in the surf security forum and link people to here . i think thats a great idea to do a journal club on a paper that will actually help somebody in the community to develop an anonymity tool that last paper is pretty short too only pages so a good way to get our feet wet so we have on board maybe or more . there rent many people here yet maybe i
