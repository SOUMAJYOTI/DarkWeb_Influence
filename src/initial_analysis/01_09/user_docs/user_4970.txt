thinking about your post since i first saw it abidan and i really think it does warrant a good answer ill post as to why i think its essential to tumlbe coins i feel that proper opsec should always involve operating under the assumption that le is already trying to build a case on you while its true that its not very likely that the specific way anyone got caught is from blockchain analysis its very hard to say that want part of their case against you although weve seen a fair amount of dnm busts by now we really have seen very few go to an actual trial that means we havent seen discovery
