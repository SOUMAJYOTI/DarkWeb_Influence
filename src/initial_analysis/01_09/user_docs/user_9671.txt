style tracking of both digital book purchases and reading progress as a means of identifying those in the book club which seemed a bit much to me i agree that there should be a set pace of course so were all on the same page i was disagreeing with the idea that reading said book electronically at the designated pace could be a red flag to le . i think thats a fair warning and personally give never used kindle and dont plan to start but i agree that its probably overlay paranoid to worry about le tracking kindle usage in that way at any rate id also be interested i havent sat down and read
