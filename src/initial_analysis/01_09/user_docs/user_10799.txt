any help that the private community can provide to itself the less and less we must depend on commercial solutions either for profit or thou government with the enormous brain power that s housed even by the small group that have created protonmail all i can do is beg for help in one specific area mobile if you can provide protonmail to the mobile phone and tablet community the leap forward for those platforms and their privacy may be immeasurable it will be so high there are millions of devices that are screaming for a privacy solution and even though almost every information gathering organization is arguing firmly against a solution they are flatly lying to whomever has asked the question my data and my conversations and my chatter are mine no one elses please please please from a lowly user help we are slaves to the use of our mobile devices they have the very real chance of truly turning us into real slaves very quickly thanks ron reply johann may at am not completely related to the aspect of security that you re covering but will you be implementing dkim and an associated dmarc policy for your domain it would be nice to know that messages supposed coming from protonmail ch really are what they claim to be and minimise the likelihood of comms being reached simply by a phishing email having a user reply to a non protonmail ch email beliving it was sent from there requesting mail servers reject spoiled mail outright via a full dmarc reject would go a long way to mitigating this reply admin may at am nahor recently dated their dmarc policy to do this there s been lots of controversy about this so we plan to wait and see reply highlander may at am i second this dnssec should also be used reply edward snowden may at am i can t in good conscience allow the u s government to destroy privacy internet freedom and basin liberties for people around the world with this massive surveillance machine they re secretly building i boldly stepped forward to expose the national security agency s vast spying on our phone records and online communications i don t see why you ve problem with me reply jim beam may at am don t sweat it mr snowdon there s more than half the people on the planet or at least here in america who think what you did was a damn good thing were i in your shoes working where you were and with the way i see things i too would have done the same you re a hero to many so you keep your chin up bud reply petter may at pm not recommended edward snowdon if you are edward snowden or the next edward snowden we would not recommend that you use protonmail why not reply admin may at pm there are more difficult to use but more secure solutions out there which are more appropriate for snowdon s use case reply me may at pm so you admit you have at least a secret weakness that s a frank consent so why not going further what are in you opinion more secure solutions out there reply admin may at pm yes the weaknesses are outlined in the threat model above safest solution is to stay off the web entirely reply sand novak may at pm i guess right now bitmessage would be the most secure not real time messaging system but it s definitely not for the masses yet reply shawn may at am then what are the more difficult to use but more secure solutions that you are referring to reply admin may at am pip done outside of the browser is more secure but difficult to use reply name may at pm so you guys don t have access to the plaintexts at least in theory but do have access to all the so called metadata reply admin may at pm right now we have access to some metadata see our privacy policy for details but the version of protonmail will incorporate some enhancements that allow us to have little to no metadata reply highlander may at am point can easily be mitigate by adding factor auth reply admin may at am yes and no it depends on what the target is if they want to know your message content the keylogger will still get it if they want to get into your account then fa might work in any case our plan is to add factor authentication reply jim beam may at am wasn t rsa and aes broken a year or two ago reply admin may at am the consensus is that with longer key lengths rsa and aes are still secure . the protonmail threat modelmay admin knowledge base security in this article we will describe both the threats protonmail is designed to guard against and also the threats protonmail is not designed to counter from a high level our premise is that a service like the now defunct lavabit does add value despite some inherent weaknesses we designed protonmail around many of the same principles but with some significant improvements at the very core email as a secure communication medium is fundamentally flowed the smtp protocol was first introduced in the s well before many of the threats of the modern internet were even environed much less understood however despite its age and flaws smtp is not going away daytime soon and email will continue to play a major role in our lives for truly secure communications one can not really recommend email but for most of us there is no other option our second philosophy is that security needs to be made easy enough to be unable the most secure system is simply not useful if it is so complicated nobody is willing to use it as protonmail developers we will be the first to tell you that there are certainly more secure ways we could have built a service like protonmail the reason we built protonmail the way we did is not because we weren t aware of these other methods but because we would have had to sacrifice too much usability there will always be a trade off between security and usability anybody that tells you otherwise is lying and just because a system is not secure does not mean you should not use it the key is understanding the limitations of your security and for the record there is no such a thing as a secure system at protonmail our goal is to guard against mass surveillance and we feel the best way to do that is to give encryption to everybody the only way to do that is to make encryption easy to use this is why protonmail works out of any modern web browser and why we went to great lengths to make the cryptography completely invisible to the user however this approach does come with certain shortcomings compromise user this is the most common type of compromise even if you use the world s most secure electric communication system advanced encryption does you no good if there is a keylogger on your computer recording all of your keystrokes protonmail does not and can not guard against a compromise of a user s machine man in the middle mitm attacks this is a very rare attack where an adversary will sit between the user and the protonmail servers and tamper with the data being related between the user and the server however because protonmail messages are encrusted before they leave the user s browser an attacker can not get message data by simply listening in on the communications the attacker would have to actually send the user s browser a modified version of the protonmail website which may secretly pass the mailbox password back to the attacker this is a far more difficult attack that can typical only be executed by a strong adversary like a government and is generally a target attack it can not easily be used on a large scale to perform mass surveillance fortunately there are several ways to protect against a mite attack protonmail employs sal to ensure our encryption codes are properly delivered to user s browsers and not tempered with en route generally speaking a successful mitm attack requires breaking sal typical by using a forged ssl certificate there are browser plugins in existence today which can be used to detect forged certificates and greatly reduce the risk of a mite attack we recommend certificate patrol or perspectives although the second one may need more time to mature authorized backdoor another attack vector would be if an attacker somehow gained access to protonmail s servers in switzerland without us noticing such an attacker could conceivably change the protonmail software to send bad encryption code to user s browsers that would somehow allow the attacker to get unencrypted data protonmail has implements numerous safeguards against this on the serve level we have routines that constantly scan for code changes and will detect them the attacker would have to gain control of the server instantly change the behavior of the code scanners and then modify the software all without anybody at protonmail noticing the odds of this being successfully executed is indeed quite low our risk analysis indicates that protonmail offers good but not perfect protection for the vast majority of users there are however some risks for users facing a strong adversary such as a government focusing all its resources on a very specific target in such a case we don t think crypto would be of much benefit as this kid comic would apply below are some examples of recommended and not recommended use cases for protonmail not recommended edward snowdon if you are edward snowden or the next edward snowden we would not recommend that you use protonmail and in case mr snowden was foolish enough to try we have already blocked the surname snowdon protonmail ch recommended client attorney privilege if you are an attorney working with a client and you fear a court might subpoena your private communications with your client protonmail offers a great deal of protection protonmail will not release any data unless provided with an enforceable swiss court order to get such an order the case must first work its way through the swiss courts where stricter privacy laws might result in a different finding even if an adversary went through the expensive and time consuming procedure of obtaining such an order protonmail s zero access cryptography means we would only be able to release encrusted data since we do not hold the encryption keys furthermore under swiss law protonmail can never be compelled to build in any sort of backdoor access to obtain the encryption keys from the user private citizen with privacy concerns protonmail is also perfect for an individual or corporation that does not want the government to have access to all of their emails at any time and does not like google or microsoft constantly scanning and archiving all conversations with protonmail the barrier of entry for mass surveillance is high enough that mass surveillance simply is not practical this is an example where good privacy can act as a meaningful substitute to perfect privacy we would like to conclude with a few thoughts about privacy and surveillance in general some people make the assertion that if you are not a criminal there is no need for privacy to those critics we simply ask does that mean that only criminals have curtains over their windows on a more serious note there are also critics who assert that by building protonmail we are providing a powerful tool for criminals to evade the authorities there is no denying that protonmail provides a high level of security and privacy for criminals but one has to remember that the world does not consist of just criminals these are also dissidents and democracy activists living under authoritarian regimes where freedom of speech is not respected then there are the rest of us law abiding private citizens who simply want control over our online data we can either chose to live in a world where everybody is under surveillance or a world where everybody criminals included have privacy we feel that the right to privacy is a fundamental human right and we are willing to fight and work towards protecting that right . the protonmail threat modelmay admin knowledge base security in this article we will describe both the threats protonmail is designed to guard against and also the threats
