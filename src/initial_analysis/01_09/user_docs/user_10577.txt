so i wanted to see if anybody else out there does the same and maybe we can share tips like what to look out for and what kind of news stories inflate the prices and what kind deflate them etc etc you get the picturein when bitcoin was first invented it was worth about a dollar us now it is about us i could of easily purchased bitcoin and made so much money now i would of made dollars for only investing dollars even in the present day the market price of bitcoin fluctuates some days ill have cents more than the previous day ltc us i suspect in the next years litecoin will be worth almost as much as btc is today so best buy litecoin in bulk it could make you millions good god man no provided the price of ltc increases by a large factor you could make a lot of money for a low investment even if etc isnt worth as much in the future as you had hoped you can get your money back could you not or it could bottom out and you lose most of your money its a crap shoot thats all im saying .
