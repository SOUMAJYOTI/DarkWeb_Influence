. . . in the current bitwasp software when a user builds up an order they hit proceed with order and then are taken to a page where they see the breakdown of the fees shipping total order price and they enter their address right here the buyer will enter a public key the vendor will be able to enter multiply public keys in advance otherwise they be asked to enter one when they choose finalize early or escrow once the vendor selects this and has provided a public key the admins public key will automatically be generated probably from an mpk really and the multisig address and the details sent to everyone the address the amount that needs to be sent the redeemscript so they can verify it encodes all the correct details regardless of whether the payment is finale early or escrow then the site will poll the blockchain for payments to that address once the full amount is paid then the order is marked as paid and all users messaged a link to a page that shows the generated transaction paying the vendor the full amount minus the sites fee a raw transaction spending all the transactions sent to the multisg address and sending to the vendor in one output and to the sites fees address in another everyone will be shown the transaction paying the vendor if the buyer raises a dispute then the users will start to discuss the order and the admin will generate a new transaction paying the appropriate amount to both parties but if its all successful then one of the users will sign the transaction and paste the partially signed transaction on the site then the other user will sign the transaction broadcast it where it will be identified by bitwasp when it makes it into the blockchain so to break it down the vendor and buyer both have to supply public keys either in advance or when their action is needed like entering an address or selecting crow fe they need to add the multisig address to their client if using bitcoinqt using one command and then sign using another they can verify the redeemscript or transaction hex so that the details are correct using their client or else using coinb in entering keys mutually is awkward and it would be great if we could accept electric mpks on registration all the public keys are generated automatically very cool but then this would mean i would have to upgrade to bip afterwards because electrum is upgrading to this wallet structure in version so for now i suggest we only allow the admin to enter mpks and have the users enter public keys mutually or in advance they can generate them in their browser using coinb in multisig ill be suggesting people download an office copy of this site because it means once funds are sent to the multisig address the two users can add the signature to transactions in the browser without having to use their client its really simple or brainwallet org and then using them in their client or coinb in anyway anyway having users supplying them in the browser is probably the best thing until bip is supported in most clients bitcoin qt and electrum are definitely going to use bip so excellent but thats another milestone long after multisig goes in heres where i need feedback im thinking about asking for an electrum mpk to receive fees on what do you think about this the admins key should also be generated from an electrum mpk there is no reason the key needs to be stored on the site has anyone ever looked at multisignature transactions in electrum where the wallet only has one key i think there is a way to display transactions fit for electrum to sign but documentation of the code is scarce right now as weve seen bitcoin qt and bitcoind are fine for multisignature transactions but i feel electrum would be way better if anyone has any information on how electric works with multisig please send them my way how do sites that implement true multisignature escrow do it how does this sound does the process sound like something end users would be easily trained to do i think it becomes pretty straightforward as you can see using multisig bitwasp co there are only actions the users need to do one less step when we automate key generation thats the price they pay for absolute security for their bitcoin no more heists all transactions occur in the blockchain and are only considered valid when in the blockchain it means no more live wallet so the possibility for the negative balance hack is removed and the trust in the site becomes animal if the site is run by an attacker they simply cant run off with the money even if there is unexpected downtime or the admin goes awl buyer and vendor have their public keys so can try negotiate on another channel to at least sort out their funds themselves feedback on this is critical to bitwasps success so please fire away any input is appreciated thanks guys i will tip very good replies with some bitcoins till . in the current bitwasp software when a user builds up an order they hit proceed

like showing the raw signed tx before deciding on where the btc is going to go this is an information leak at the very least the address the vendor uses will have to be burnt and a sloppy vendor reusing addresses or using the same address to get funds from every tx is going to expose a lot and this is at very little risk to the person doing the attack all they would have to do is cancel the order before the vendor fufills it and they would lose a trivial amount to transaction fees i think its better to wait until its been decided on where the funds go before generating the raw tx to be signed also buyers tend to be awful at signing payments i think from a buyer view they dont need to ever see a tx unless they need to get a refund of some sort also a cautious person might always want their tx to be broadcast as some predetermined time say utc or something in order to allow to time information leaks because of this i think its better for the site to sign the tx and then have the

should have the private keys available because i think the normal signatures should be site whoever is getting the btc buyer vendor should be for unusual situations this means that youd have to store

the concept of using deposit addresses to store the keys additional electrum stores its transactions internally in a piedro format its not really going to be useful as it stands for tracking things in
