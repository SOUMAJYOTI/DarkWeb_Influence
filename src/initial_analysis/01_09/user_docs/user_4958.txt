unsure if you did it right so here is my offer if anyone has just set up a pgp key and wants to send someone an encrusted pm to try it out feel free to contact me if you have any questions regarding pgp or encryption in general ask away and i will do my best to answer if i cant help then hopefully some of the better educated members than me will be able to here is my public key begin pip public

you are indeed the man because you did everything correctly and i can agree that the moon is indeed very blue in the garden tonight if you pop yourself a tab from one of our excellent vendors and sit down over there by the trans dimensions water feature you can watch it change every colour you can think of and more if you post your key i will send you something to test your decryption there is a pip key thread in the general discussion board where you can post your key and vendors will be able to find it to be honest though i tend to send my key along with any encrusted messages as a belt and braces backup welcome to the garden my friend its a beautiful place is thanks for the support im just passing on a favor someone did for me as i hope anyone i help here will do . o captain my captain thanks for taking the time to reply and help out a friend in need ive been playing around with gpg a fair bit now and actually feel quite confident with the basin process however there seems to be one major stumbling block the format of the messages ive contracted two different vendors and each time theyve sent me encrypted messages i have been unable to open them i finally figured out why via someone much smarter than i that the format was incorrect when i copy and paste from mg to textedit something goes wrong and the gpg system can not read open them my online friend was able to reformat it into the correct way and hey presto it worked am i the only one that has come across such an obstacle is there an easier smoother way around it any thoughts info advice would be greatly appreciated as i dont want to involve a rd party each time i want to open up a message . quote from dwujk on may amthanks a lot for your help and your welcome captain and no james isnt my real name also does anyone know if my public pgp key is too short your key is bits most people would deem bits advisable how much of an effect does it have on your security in practical terms is unknown and highly circumstantial check key size page on wikipedia . busted out my er trojan are you listening . before i go on my little rant id like to reiterate the convenience and most important security of running storing actually everything you do on tor and these markets on an external drive us flash drive etc give had such a hard time with pgp for mac a couple years ago i used portablepgp but when i recently got back in to using it i have errors coming from the terminal saying that my java jce files arent signed correctly or something to that effect people have recommended online java based pgp services to me for their ease of use but that seems very very secure to me give heard mixed opinions to answer the two people above me every pgp program give ever used requires you to format your encrusted message to plain text unless of course the program does it on its own which is easy to do in any basin text editing program as to the question regarding key strength characters is perfect but less is adequate imo for anyone who uses these markets for personal use and is not a vendor characters is a typical key strength but in theory is times weaker than a character key all this is coming from someone who has a hard time with pgp myself it is much easier on windows and actually the creator or pgp encryption has stated something to the effect of he wont personally use macs because they dont work well with pgp i have both operating systems that i have to switch between because also from what give learned observed mac is just less secure when using tor in general if anyone knows of a simple and safe mac friendly encryption software or understand my problem with the java jce give literally tried everything id love some input the same goes for those online pgp encrypt decrypt services which i wont name here . thanks a lot for your help and your welcome captain and no james isnt my real name also does anyone know if my public pgp key is too short . m ya and space to the rescue thanks for chipping in both of you have a cheeky so it would seem size matters but it depends how you use it . quote from captaininvisible on may pmm ya and space to the rescue thanks for chipping in both of you have a cheeky so it would seem size matters but it depends how you use it as m ya said this is all highly circumstantial in my opinion and from my experience that means if you are just a person who is seeking materials for personal use any properly created pgp key is acceptable if you are the type of buyer i described really man all that matters is that you use pip encryption of any complexity with your address and other highly sensitive info in simpler terms just having a pip key makes you immeasurably more secure than someone who provides their name and address un encrypted peace . ahoy a as flight said your understanding of the process is spot on i was also able to decrypt your message with no problems well done now your next challenge is to post your public key in this thread and or send it to me so i can encrypt you a message calm seas captain . testing my pgp am i understanding pgp correctly that i send you a message which is encrusted using your public key then you decrypt that using your private key then to send me a message back you encrypt it using my public key and i decrypt it using my private key when i am encrypting a
