different public wifis each time i connect to tor ill still be using tails mac spoofer vpn tor and a socks pray mac spoofing vpon tor on a cracked network doesnt seem like a horrible idea seedofchaos all seriousness what are some downsides to this configuration oh god where do i begin mac spoofing is very difficult to do in a way that isnt instantly unrecognizable as such and that draws more suspicion as to why someone is spoofing a mac badly meaning you could very well fuck yourself just by doing that if youre not sure what youre doing vpns are a very very bad idea to use on cracked networks unless you have throwaway accounts for ones which arent subject to that new cisa bill also where in the chain are you using the vpn in this scenario raw connection vpn tor if your vpn account is refused and logs are ever handed over you are sucked because it will show each network you were accessing thus giving them a very good radius of your location this is only the beginning of potential troubles there ever access that vpn from home or on an modified cellphone hope not im thinking you guys are of a different sort than i am these days so i mean yeah youd likely be fine honestly but what im saying are very real possible outcomes should the day come when someone gives a ship enough about putting you away im going to sum up a general principle here badly with a rhetorical question many of you may not understand but thats okay because im supposed to be working now and should probably go do so sometimes its better to do less and blend in with a blurred crowd rather than disappear entirely because if youre not there then where are you and what are you up to im working on a bunch of detailed guides on shit like this that will be finished sometime soon so that why im somewhat vague in replies on these topics right now its unnecessary duplication of effort but in all honesty i like providing people with information so i do still do it on occasion note that all security advice of a general nature is at best a template and should never be used verbatim without particular consideration of your own situation threat level and just because certain things can happen doesnt make them very likely to but in the end in becomes a tradeoff of how much of a risk are you okay with allowing its different for each person . if youre going to use random public wifis to do your business then you should assume that all of these networks collect logs and take special care to analyze your movement ffs done trust your phone either they dont even need to do work

same reasons professional burglars dont rob their own neighborhoods if youre talking about roaming around your city connecting to new wifis each time and at different times of the day then thats pretty safe if you plan on using the same networks all the time then thats less safe as its pretty easy for le to unmask you by watching these places and correlating that with your forum chat activity if youre not using tails always spoof your mac address before even probing for wireless networks never allow your machine to boot up and automatically connect to services you use like dropbox or email only plug your encrusted persistent storage in when you need to get something from it and always unmount it when not in use le knew everything about ross but chose to pwn him when he was in public because lets face it its a lot harder to stop someone from hitting the killswitch when they can see you arrive on cctv than when they think theyre a ghost just because theyre in an unfamiliar location
