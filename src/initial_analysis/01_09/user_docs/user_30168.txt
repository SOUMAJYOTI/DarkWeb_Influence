the community here is great even if i get cursed out and shunned i wont take it too hard give been through worse lol . well since you seem to be linus navvy heres one for you i forgot how to clear the old boot stuff to make space for the new boot stuff when its time to upgrade did that make sense like its a command to find which ones are still stalled in germinal but in getting old and my memory isnt so good in some areas i write this stuff down then forget which notebook its in smh . quote from knights dreams on june pmthe only reason i immediately went straight back to it wasbecause i didnt officially gout but it still doesnt make sense because it connected to the site from a different circuit it shouldnt have known it was the same user right you closed that initials circuit mate when ya closed that tab hello its not the circuit that remembers your info its the website all of these sites are not much diff than a learned site were just a onion and more secure with the multiply connections sort of in lament terms there make sense now . quote from visitorsearch on june pmquote from knights dreams on june pmwell since you seem to be linus navvy heres one for you i forgot how

my memory isnt so good in some areas i write this stuff down then forget which notebook its in smhthe only thing usually that updates without removing the old version would be the kernel in case of any design derivative like ubuntu and such sudo apt get autoremove purgegood call visitor man for you i would have advised him a clean reinstall and to have simply re partitioned his hard drive in the grub installer i think this works better . if youre on linux you can examine your log file and parse for failure to establish ip hops by going to the command terminal ctrl alt t and damn you if you use windows in linus ubuntu or design and i believe tails you can type less var log tor log and you can read the file to see if your tor circuit is cleanly connected the output should read like this jun notice tor git ae bd opening new log file jun notice interrupt exiting cleanly jun notice tor git ae bd opening log file jun warn opens version from headers does not match the version were running with if you get weird crashes that might be why compiled with f opens g running with f openssl g fips mar j notice tor v git a bd running on linux with libevent stable openssl g fips and zlib notice tor cant help you if you use it wrong learn how to be safe at notice read configuration file us share tor tor service defaults torre notice read configuration file etc tor torrc notice opening socks listener on xxx xx notice opening control listener on var run tor control notice parsing group ipv file us share tor geoip notice parsing group ipv file us share tor geoip notice bootstrapped starting notice bootstrapped connecting to directory serverx warn problem bootstrapping stuck at connecting to the tor network network is unreachable route count recommendation warn host cxxxxxxxxxxxxxc ef at x x xx xx xx notice bootstrapped finishing handshake with first hop notice bootstrapped establishing a tor circuit notice tor has successfully opened a circuit looks like client functionality is working notice bootstrapped done notice our ip address has changed rotating keys i close everything and reboot my tor session frequently to keep my ip recycling generally every minutes or so and even mutually disconnect from my isp this is sound advice as i can offer zaphod may have more to add . ok so i accidentally close a tab i open new tab and go to a sites main page so its not like when you browse backward or forward and it says resending information i didnt have to log in it went straight into my account tor circuit wasnt the same how . lets use dreammarket as an example if you were to close your dream tab and reopened it within lets say two minutes then you would be auto logged in again with a riff circuit now if you x out of that dream tab then forget to go back for a few minutes youl have to log in again like you expected eh not rocket science buddy . quote from knights dreams on june pmok i see lol i have to re read everything tech like ten times and cross reference before it starts to make sense to me wasnt that long ago i was using real floppy disks lolits ok were here to help if we come off a bit too strong or what we say seems a bit overwhelming just step back for a moment we dont bite much . the only reason i immediately went straight back to it wasbecause i didnt officially gout but it still doesnt make sense because it connected to the site from a different circuit it shouldnt have known it was the same user right . so forgive me for being such a noob but the exit nodes can get access to everything done online while someone is browing using tor . just that the jebusite saves your info for a limited amount of time dont do that again close the tabs and then get a new identity before you open up that url again do what ya want im just sayin better safe then being sorry . ok i see lol i have to re read everything tech like ten times and cross reference before it starts to make sense to me wasnt that long ago i was using real floppy disks lol . quote

thats why its important to use when using tor a mitm is possible but it protects you a bit many people setup exit nodes only to sniff traffic . quote from visitorsearch on june pmsudo apt get autoremove purgeyes thats part of it thanks theres more detail in my notes hopefully ill find soon but thats got me on the right track thanks .
