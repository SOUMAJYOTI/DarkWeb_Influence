is anyone finding that it is impossible to use sites like coinbase and localbitcoins because of cloudflare everything i try to do on these sites is blocked with a cloudflare captcha that doesnt work it asks for a captcha but no captcha is visible making it impossible for me to do any bitcoin transactions at all it only happens while using tor and im thinking this is an intentional way of preventing us from doing anything illegal any thoughts or solutions . is anyone finding that it is impossible to use sites like coinbase and localbitcoins because of cloudflare everything i try to do

anything illegal theyre just dumb fucks who cant get their captchas working until a while ago it was not possible to pass it with javascript disabled the non is version of the captcha was nearly impossible to solve and when you did it said fuck you and you had to start over again took me a while to realize you need to activate js if you want to have a chance to pass it but for a while now i think since tor upgraded to this shiny new version of firefox i also have it very often that you dont get any catch shown at all no matter of scripting fuck you cloudfarei hope one of the morons in their dev team reads this or one of my countless hate emails i wrote them . yep hate them too i dont think they want to prevent you from doing anything illegal theyre just dumb fucks who cant get

sites like blockchain info etc require javascript in order to function so you just have to use it personally i think the rule to never use javascript with tor is a bit over the top id say its a definite when accessing a darknet site but when accessing clearnet sites like lbc its no big thing imo remember that the freedomhosting hack only worked with an outraged version of tor that used a very old version of firefox and only worked on windows so always keep tor up to date and never use ms windows for anything and you should be day enabling javascript to access lbc and other bitcoin
