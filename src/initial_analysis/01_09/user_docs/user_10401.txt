sufficient funding he was going to shut the project down werner has literally been making peanuts for years not only he but his family have been paying the price werner could easily get a job paying several times what he is making with the gpg project luckily enough money was raised for him to hire an assistant and remain on the project werner is just like the rest of us he isnt getting any younger hes almost and he will have to start thinking about retirement and how hes going to save for retirement the dilemma is that most netizens want stuff for free and done want to pay for it but

september amquote from ice bank mice elf on september amwhat method did you use for file deletion from within the partition regular delete i did not use a wiping program but when editing files like txt or doc you dont even have the option to securely wipe the old contents the method i used was to mount the truecrypt partition as usual and then run testdisk on the mounted partition give always adopted a two pronged approach to data deletion first i encrypt the files in place with a random string after which i wipe those files this works the same on mounted truecrypt volumes as it does on regular drives to encrypt the files i use ccrypt which can be obtained from the ccrypt home page are available for just about every computer platform going to encrypt files wiht a random string just use the b brave option this disables the need for confirming the password thus you can type random on the keyboard for a few seconds to secure encrypt a file with a passphrase that you dont know and therefore can not be forced to reveal for example if i want to securely destroy a bunch of text files in a folder i would use the following command ccrypt b e txtyou will then be prompted for a passphrase type random on the keyboard for a few seconds and then hit enter the original files will be named as before with the exception that they will have added the cpt file extent these random encrusted files can then be wiped as you normally would i use the following wipe command wipe rcf cpt q q p this command wipes the files with a random generated key using one pass after which the file is re named with a random string some times simple yet effective zaphod . quote from ice bank mice elf on september amwhat method did you use for file deletion from within the partition regular delete

a bunch of text files in a folder i would use the following command ccrypt b e txtyou will then be prompted for a passphrase type random on the keyboard for a few seconds and then hit enter the original files will be named as before with the exception that they will have added the cpt file extent these random encrusted files can then be wiped as you normally would i use the following wipe command wipe rcf cpt q q p this command wipes the files with a random generated key using one pass after which the file is re named with a random string some times simple yet effective zaphod . what method did you use for file deletion from within the partition . quote from ice bank mice elf on september amwhat method did you use for file deletion from within the partition regular delete i did not use a wiping program but when editing files like txt or doc you dont even have the option to securely wipe the old contents the method i used was to mount the truecrypt partition as usual and then run testdisk on the mounted partition . quote from p nd s on september amquote from ice bank mice elf on september amwhat method did you use for file deletion from within the partition regular delete i did not use a wiping program but when editing files like txt or doc you dont even have the option to securely wipe the old contents the method i used was to mount the truecrypt partition as usual and then run testdisk on the mounted partition give always adopted a two pronged approach to data deletion first i encrypt the files in place with a random string after which i wipe those files this works the same on mounted truecrypt volumes as it does on regular drives to encrypt the files i use ccrypt which can be obtained from the ccrypt home page are available for just about every computer platform going to encrypt files wiht a random string just use the b brave option this disables the need for confirming the password thus you can type random on the keyboard for a few seconds to secure encrypt a file with a passphrase that you dont know and therefore can not be forced to reveal for example if i want to securely destroy a bunch of text files in a folder i would use the following

this standard option is to highlight text using your mouse anywhere in the gui this places the text you selected into the primary clipboard which can be accesse by middle clicking clicking the ball on the mouse or using shift insert the clipboard functionality works just like windows where you highlight the word you want to copy and use control c to copy it to that clipboard some applications are stupid and fail to respect this paradigm thus i recommend always using primary highlight the text you want to copy and middle click to paste and if it fails revert to clipboard select text press control c to copy control v to paste keep in mind control c in a germinal sends a signal interrupt to a running process if you dont know what that means youl quickly figure it out run sleep and then hit control c a few seconds later . thanks i tried following the tails instructions as reproduce above before i made this post and struggled i should probably persevere with it some more if i cant get that to work ill take a look at ophe suggestion cheers guys . if you decide that keepassx isnt your thing in linux there are generally two clipboards learned freedesktop org clipboard specification b
