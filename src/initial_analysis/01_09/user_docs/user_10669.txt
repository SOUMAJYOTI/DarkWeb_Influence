much btc do you have on agora guyver the only good thing is that it really doesn look like le they would have infiltrated the site quietly and then take it out in one scoop not playing games with the withdrawals and robbing more people although i am sure there are many people in le who feel this would be appropriate i still believe they cant do shit taking down sr with undercover agents or seizing whole vps hosters just shows how pathetic they are trying to pile up as much fud as possible perhaps agra thought it got too hot and called it a day i personally wouldn be surprised if they end it

withdrawal i am losing hope although the message wasnt signed i do believe it was from the agora admin however i believe something is wrong internally hacked maybe or someone on the inside i dont know
