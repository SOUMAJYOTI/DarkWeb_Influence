i see many vendors leaving silk road many regular users as well people complaining of mod abuse poor support etc i would like to assemble a list of problems and their potential solutions and present it to the staff who i feel may be unaware of the growing dissatisfaction with the marketplace and forms please post something about the site staff that you do not like and if you wish what could be done to fix it be specific and not a jackass theres been a lot of bitching and whining about various facets of the site here is a chance to constructive discuss them and perhaps resolve them as in sure with most internet forums the discussion will be purely calm and reasonable without any rude accusations or non sequitors ready go . the big problem silk road has right now is trust remember when whitedreams threatened to doxx complaining customers on his vendor page if they didnt release the escrow for the product he never sent that page stayed up for days maybe weeks so did maninthemiddles vendor page where he bragged about k in easy money ripping off junkies with his fe scams and then theres this how do they restore that trust honestly at this point id say close the damn marketplace down and done re open until the worst vermin has been removed and the long promised af resolution centre is implements because a trusted escrow is vital to any anonymous darknet marketplace and sr has at present no working escrow and is fast burning away any goodwill and trust the brand has developed . my account showing etc despite there being actually in there since christmas it occasionally corrects itself but is now seemingly stuck simple really if i dont have any money i cant spend it and cant risk depositing any more no sales no money for vendor or sr comission lost user as much as i love sr . yep its all about trust im trying to hold on to the thought that they are just overwhelmed with shit going on and that they will get it right but right now the market is open there is a shitload of scammers all over the market destroying the confidence of buyers vendors wont do business through escrow because there is no auto finalization customers arent feing for vendors because of the scammers its amazing vendors and customers why not close down the market until important bugs features are fixed i keep telling myself this is not a scam i refuse to believe it is but everytime someone talks about the support resolution centre big bugs not being fixed we get an answer about all the small bugs that have been fix done get me wrong in really thankful for all the work that has been put into this but i can not imagine that the staff does not understand that invincible bugfixes are not going to calm down the current ongoing panic theres alot of money at play and theres alot of money coming in for sr from all fees like i said in trying to stay confident about sr and its staff but giving no insight in what is going on while taking so much money from order fees vendor fees they would be better off closing it for a few days fixing the bugs features and then open up again people would probably understand that much more then the current situation cheers . my account
