to the decryption process requires accessing the private key for this reason you must provide the password you created when generating the keypair during the process a prompt will appear fill in the

germinal command prompt although more time consuming and tedious i consider it advantageous over a graphical user interface using a gui such as kleopatra for windows enables the user to see keys and click to interact with them however it imposes restrictions such as forcing the user to enter an email address using a terminal also ensures you know exactly what is happening to the keypair and have full control theres positives and negatives to using both this guide was brought to you by deaddefcon thanks for reading . thats a very nice step by step guide even though using gpg in tails is very

in end pgp public key block importing someone elses public key to encrypt a message for someone youre going to need to import their public key like generating a keypair you only need to do this once for this tutorial i will be importing the public key provided on agoras help and into page you are more than welcome to import the public key displayed earlier the first step is to copy the public key to a text file once that is done enter the following command code select gpg import pubkey asc where pubkey asc is the file where you saved the public key you want to import heres the output you should receive code select gpg key expunged public key agora one importedgpg total number professed gog imported rsa and thats it you can now write messages using the key imported encrypting a message once you have imported someone elses public key you can encrypt a message for this tutorial i will use the text hello world and place it into file mymessage txt now that we have a file with a message in it enter the following command code select gpg armor output encmessage as uncropt mymessage txtwhere mymessage txt is the name of the file you are encrypting throughout this tutorial there has been use of other parameters before encrypting the message lets take a minute and examine the parameters set forth notice that we use uncropt and then the file name to specify the file to encrypt but there are a few other parameters not fully described armor tells the program to use ascii armor this makes gnupg encrypt the data in the file so it can be copied and passed via text characters output enables the user to specify a name and location of the output file where encmessage asc is the desired name of the output file so once that command is put the user will be prompted to enter a recipient as seen earlier the user id for agora was agra one so that is what i entered alternatively the users email can also be entered after that i simply hit enter to confirm no other recipients this is what the console looked like code select you did not specify a user id you may use r current recipients enter the user in end with an empty line agora onegpg expounded there is no assurance this key belongs to the named userpub expunged expounded agra one primary key fingerprint expunged sucked fingerprint expunged it is not certain that the key belongs to the person namedin the user id if you really know what you are doing you may answer the next question with yes use this key anyway y n ycurrent recipients expunged expounded agra one enter the user in end with an empty line i just added this key from agora so i am well aware that it is the actual user id therefore i can trust it and input y and preceded on needing no other recipients i simply hit enter and let the program compile an encrusted message upon completion the file encmessage asc was generated when opened with a text editor the pip message was shown this is the message which i would send to the recipient in this case it would be the agra staff decrypting a message so at this stage you can now generate your own keys and send messages to others using their keys the only thing left is to decrypt a message when a user messages you this is the text hello world when encrusted using the whatevernameyouwant public key code select begin pip message version gnupg v hqima o mniihv aq wlfkdmbf a vuw eonbwvs

relatively painless and simple process first i saved the message to a text file titled myencmessage asc once there i entered the following command code select gpg decrypt myencmessage anywhere myencmessage asc is the name of the file with the message in it this command will have it output the message into the console if you want it to be placed into a file instead use the following command code select gpg output mydecmessage txt decrypt myencmessage anywhere mydecmessage txt is the name of the file to export the message to the decryption process requires accessing the private key for this reason you must provide the password you created when generating the keypair during the process a prompt will appear fill in the password and it will decrypt here is the output of the command with no output file specific code select you need a passphrase to unlock the secret key foruser whatevernameyouwant bit asa key id created main key id gpg encrusted with bit asa key id created whatevernameyouwant hello world notice how a recipient is never specific this is because the ciphertext can be linked to a key automatically if the user has a message and the appropriate key to decipher it gnupg will find it on its own kudos here are a few extra useful commands that the gnu privacy guard provides code select gog list keysthis command lists all public keys stored on the machine code select gog list secret keysthis command will do the same but with private keys if you want to change a key to a trusted one enter the following command code select gpg edit key whatevernameyouwantthe following will then appear code select gpg gnupg copyright c free software foundation inc this is free software you are free to change and redistribute it there is no warranty to the extent permitted by law secret key is available pub r expunged created expires usage s trust ultimate validity ultimatesub r expunged created expires usage e ultimate whatevernameyouwantgpg trusti enter the command trust which takes me to the prompt asking to set the trust level code select pub r expunged created expires usage s trust marginally validity marginallysub r expunged created expires usage e ultimate whatevernameyouwantplease decide how far you trust this user to correctly verify other users keys by looking at passports checking fingerprints from different sources etc i dont know or wont say i do not trust i trust marginally i trust fully i trust ultimately m back to the main menuyour decision i created the key so theres no reason other than to trust it to its fullest extent therefore i selected code select do you really want to set this key to ultimate trust y n ypub r expunged created expires usage s trust ultimate validity ultimatesub r expunged created expires usage e ultimate whatevernameyouwantand thats that wrapping up this tutorial taught the fundamental usage of using assymetric encryption via a germinal command prompt although more time consuming and tedious i consider it advantageous over a graphical user interface using a gui such as kleopatra for windows enables the user to see keys and click to interact with them however it imposes restrictions such as forcing the user to enter an email address using a terminal also ensures you know exactly what is happening to the keypair and have full control theres positives and negatives to using both this guide was brought to you by deaddefcon thanks for reading . hey i cant import message it says no such file or directory i have that file on desktop . quote from
