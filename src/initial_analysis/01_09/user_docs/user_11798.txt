link created by north korea with the help of russians and chinese the server is hasted in pyongyang rascally it claims to be a state sponsored dnm that follows a similar layout to other markets not too much is current known about this market with many claiming it to be a simple april fools joke but a few have said otherwise leaving me on the fence right now if its legit this market can have huge potential as they would have nothing to fear from le seizing their servers however some who have gotten an early look at the site deride it for selling hardcore illegal items like rhino horns rare animals human organs and possibly slave laborers obviously if let these items are not for the average dim user is the site legit i dont know i cant answer that question its too early to say its legit but theres also no evidence that its necessarily a fake either im current sitting on the fence on this one if it turns out to be serious i may go in and take a look and do business if its a joke its a damn good one right now the hardest part about the site is registering as the invite code is in borean the site current supports both the korean and english languages it runs fast and seems well optimized however i always knew russian and chinese coders were good at what they did if they truly had a hand in this my advice see if you can login and check it out for yourself i current dont have a real opinion on this site yet as its too new although just remember by buying on this site you may be inadvertently supporting the north borean regime which may bother a few dnm users however i will continue to keep an eye on this market and see how it develops as i am seriously interested in this if let it would be the very first state sponsored dnm a historic milestone a shame it had to be north korea to be the first to step up to the plate ironic though that the worlds least free government would make such a move and condone such a thing i do not condone or discourage the market but like i said its unlike anything else give ever seen on the dnms and its worth a look if its for real you may expect some serious improvements in quality goods as many vendors will be chinese or russians with serious connections i wouldn order from them though until we hear more about them and the reviews start pouring in they say they let foreign vendors operate on the site but only after the site approves on a case to case basis check it out and form your own opinion while i may have a bit of an issue with north boreas government i understand realpolitik as well its unique in every way i dont know if its real though so be careful and use common sense this could be a scam or joke so its not yet proved if its worth sinking money into but i will definitely keep an eye on them . lol
