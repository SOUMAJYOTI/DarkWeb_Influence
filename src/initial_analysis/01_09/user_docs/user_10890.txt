tor bazaar good one . i heard the market place offers it i also understand you can run i p over tor using privily it would be good if a technical team could look into this and confirm its stability . i would like to know some opinion on the method outlined here it appears you can run i p inside tor which surely would give a higher level security browsing with i p privily and torintroductionthere is a severe problem in the world today people in the world do not respect the right of people to have anonymous and private internet transactions quite numerous are the infractions of the us executive branch and its lap dogs however it isnt just big brother who wishes the details of your transactions little brother incorporate america is in on the act whether it is companies trying to spam you with offers based off your browsing habits or your is trying to what you are browsing both brothers big and little forget a persons transactions are their business until they wish to disclose the act of the transactions removing anonymity or the contents there in removing privacy fortunately there are open source methods out there to help solve the problem of maintaining the anonymity of the transactions i p and tor note neither of these network solutions solve the problem of maintaining the privacy of the transaction both networks help to anonymize connections through a mix network a mix network encrypts messages which it sends through a random series of proxies before it reaches its final destination each proxy peels off a layer of encryption until all the encryption is removed this solves the problem anonymity as no node with the exception of the entry and the exit node knows the source and the destination another problemthe problem with i p and tor is one can not access the resources of one network from the other without a specific outproxy for example if one has occurred their web browser to accecss the i p network one can not access resources ending the a onion uri tor resources if one uses firefox one can use a proxy switching plugin such as switchproxy or torbutton however this solution only works for one browser and requires the user to actively switch to the

the admin account is delete and no way to contact them shame it looked good but the team seems too small and market premature i done think we will join market owners need to take note releasing premature market only damages it in the long run stop trying to race it out there hi thanks for raising your issues and bringing forth your apprehensions and i hope with this post i can address them give said this before and ill say it again first our sub forum here at the hub is was not intended to be a support forum as much as i try to stay dated with posts here to remedy any issues brought to our notice we have our own official support forum where any bugs are to be reported and and the ones reported thus far have been fixed asa and i recommend you to use it to stay unto to date with the latest i do not have an army of staff and do all the work myself despite that and as reported by other users here such issues have been fixed the soonest possible and often the fix solution has been an action that has been required from the users end to rectify something they hadnt done correctly in the first place its a new site and a number of things work differently from what you as a buyer vendor would have been used to in a different market as for the issue you reported to me via pm to me was not being able to decrypt your received messages i sent you another follow up pm to track what where the issue was but since you havent been on the support forum you likely haven read how this can has been addressed i would recommend the following log in to your account disable tfa click account tab edit re unload pub key logout login back again you will not be prompted for tfa as its disabled re enable tea send yourself a test message you should receive it encrusted and you should be able to decrypt it else happy to send you test messages again as your login pin and pms order encryption and profile p are all connected with your pgg key and sometime while uploading them its not correctly formatted this is has been reported twice you included from over a thousand accounts also all other administration accounts have now been disabled for security reasons including mine and therefore you see my previous account disabled on the system but am peaceable by the same handle and happy to send you test messages for when youre done with the steps above also ple note for a month we gave away free vendor registrations and zero commisions on orders there was not a penny the market made but now since were charging for both vendor registration and orders we will be devoting much of that fund in pimping up security and having more hands at the deck to assist me and you guys round the clock hope it helps cheers . thank you so much jules i knew the customer gives a lot of love but i did not know vendors too we are always here for people because it makes us happy in what we do and we know it is the best way for success i have said before things will get worse before getting better and i am feeling so positive about the future sw . there are a few bugs but nothing albert cant help you with you could pm him on our forums and he could definitely sort you out . quote from

run stop trying to race it out there i am a new seller on the dnm i dont have the experience most have i have my listings or tied to list on almost a dozen sites most have been problematical most have no one to contact with issues so far tea albert and blackbank mdparity are the main ones where i can get issues resolved almost instantly torescrow was also a good one this counts for a lot support is slow or non existent on other sites at least for me so i would certainly give these a go as in future there will always be something that comes up to be resolved . quote from sunwu on february ami dont doubt they are honest good guys this is why i had looked to them but with bugs like this it worries me there are others and we only look to be at the most secure market so we dont have to go through this again everytime a market fail we lose s and sometimes s thousands of this is not something i wish to repeat time and time again well ill be honest with you im not the coder of the market i am just a simple forum mod albert is the one who coded the market if you have any questions about bugs you can ask him on our forums the bugs we have had so far have been corrected within an hour of albert being aware of them albert is current working on mufti sir transactions i dont know a whole lot about it but i believe it protects the users coins against hacking or sezures this is not complimented yet but it is the priority at the moment and will be complimented soon we already have cold storage of coins and all withdraws are professed mutually which prevents theft via hacking the market has a whole lot of security features i would also like to note that albert has been hosting onion sites for vendors for a few years and has expirience keeping servers secure hes not a newbie on the scene if you would like to learn more about tea please come to the forums when albert has a minute of free time in sure he would be more than happy to address any of your concerns . i know what you mean i have said this before and ill say it again for all here the hub to read sunwu you have been an inspiration to me as a vendor since i st saw youre contest threads on sr forum the gratitude that buyers abroad expressed for your services actually brought a tear to my eyes specially when it was genuine people talking about genuine problems they face irl you being there for them and being the gamesome vendor that you are really made me re consider what it is were all doing on earth and in the dark net the universe will not let le ever catch you for you service the universe in far

thanks for raising your issues and bringing forth your apprehensions and i hope with this post i can address them give said this before and ill say it again first our sub forum here at the hub is was not intended to be a support forum as much as i try to stay dated with posts here to remedy any issues brought to our notice we have our own official support forum where any bugs are to be reported and and the ones reported thus far have been fixed asa and i recommend you to use it to stay unto to date with the latest i do not have an army of staff and do all the work myself despite that and as reported by other users here such issues have been fixed the soonest possible and often the fix solution has been an action that has been required from the users end to rectify something they hadnt done correctly in the first place its a new site and a number of things work differently from what you as a buyer vendor would have been used to in a different market as for the issue you reported to me via pm to me was not being able to decrypt your received messages i sent you another follow up pm to track what where the issue was but since you havent been on the support forum you likely haven read how this can has been addressed i would recommend the following log in to your account disable tfa click account tab edit re unload pub key logout login back again you will not be prompted for tfa as its disabled re enable tea send yourself a test message you should receive it encrusted and you should be able to decrypt it else happy to send you test messages again as your login pin and pms order encryption and profile p are all connected with your pgg key and sometime while uploading them its not correctly formatted this is has been reported twice you included from over a thousand accounts also all other administration accounts have now been disabled for security reasons including mine and therefore you see my previous account disabled on the system but am peaceable by the same handle and happy to send you test messages for when youre done with the steps above also ple note for a month we gave away free vendor registrations and zero commisions on orders there was not a penny the market made but now since were charging for both vendor registration and orders we will be devoting much of that fund in pimping up security and having more hands at the deck to assist me and you guys round the clock hope it helps cheers . thank you so much jules i knew the customer gives a lot of love but i did not know vendors too we are always here for people because it makes us happy in what we do and we know it is the best way for success i have said before things will get worse before getting better and i am feeling so positive about the future sw . there are a few bugs but nothing albert cant help you with you could pm him on our forums and he could definitely sort you out . i know what you mean i have said this before and ill say it again for all here the hub to read sunwu you have been an inspiration to me as a vendor since i st saw youre contest threads on sr forum the gratitude that buyers abroad expressed for your services actually brought a tear to my eyes specially when it was genuine people talking about genuine problems they face irl you being there for them and being the gamesome vendor that you are really made me re consider what it is were all doing on earth and in the dark net the universe will not let le ever catch you for you service the universe in far greater ways than le and their evil manipulative war tactics respect . quote from sunwu on

the market i am just a simple forum mod albert is the one who coded the market if you have any questions about bugs you can ask him on our forums the bugs we have had so far have been corrected within an hour of albert being aware of them albert is current working on mufti sir transactions i dont know a whole lot about it but i believe it protects the users coins against hacking or sezures this is not complimented yet but it is the priority at the moment and will be complimented soon we already have cold storage of coins and all withdraws are professed mutually which prevents theft via hacking the market has a whole lot of security features i would also like to note that albert has been hosting onion sites for vendors for a few years and has expirience keeping servers secure hes not a newbie on the scene if you would like to learn more about tea please come to the forums when albert has a minute of free time in sure he would be more than happy to address any of your concerns .
