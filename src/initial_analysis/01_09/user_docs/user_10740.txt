if this is as effective as you say then this service will be an invaluable commodity for darknet users anyone tried it out done be shy . introducing grams helixurl or is the definition darknet bitcoin cleaner grams helix doesnt just clean your bitcoins it gives you brand new ones which have never been to the darknet before the helix system is more than a bitcoin tumbler it is privacy and security wrapped in one how is it different the coins are not just mixed but traded out for new ones before mixing i cant go into specifics for security reasons but i can assure you the helix system will sever the blockchain taint and by giving you new coins which have not been through grams or the darknet i have been using this systems for all the bitcoins that have come in to grams since the beginning after seeing shared coin go down i figured i should make it public how to use it is intreated in to grams accounts just load your grams account like usual and you will be able to helix withdraw from your balance numbers fee is maximum withdrawal is etc maximum withdrawal is etc for now time hoursthere is a etc entry fee to create a grams account which is applied towards your balance so if you dont have a grass account and are creating one to use helix you can load your account after your entry fee clears confirmations or when sending the entry fee send more than btc and it will all be applied to your grams balance timeyou can set a delay and it is recommended once the delay is over the helix process will take less than hours if there is enough reserve built up you will be paid from the already cleaned coins and the process will be much faster securityhelix has its own server not connected to grams the several bitcoin clients it uses are on a completely separate server from helix and grams even if grams was under attack or compromise it would not affect the helix system privacy all logs are delete after days but you can deleted the logs off the server mutually after the helix withdraw is complete once all transactions have been sent for a helix withdraw you will receive an encrusted message on grams with the transactions hashes as a receipt of payment the message will auto delete after it has been read the bitcoin clients are also twitched out regularly paper insured grams is built upon trust and brings that trust to helix every night half of all the profits made for that day will be deposited into a btc address which is a paper address i have the only copy of the private key and it has never seen the internet grams will keep depositing in to it until it reaches an amount equal to or greater than the average daily volume of helix this is to insure your money in the highly unlikely case the severs got hacked or compromise grams could use this reserve to pay back anyone who had their money stolen or lost after a week or so of build up i will post the public address so all users to verify that money is getting deposited every night and no withdraws are made this step is truly unnecessary since grams is very security conscious but it is a step i am willing to take to earn the trust of all of you let me know what you guys think . sounds interesting but really intrigue to know how it works realise you say you cant say is it immense to blockchain analysis that it even has been wandered also if you are swapping them for clean coins why launder them again the swap sounds like the harder part how can you ensure the coins haven come from a market if its something like btc drk btc they have probably been via dark markets anyway anyhow wish you luck and hope it works need some more competition in this space and hopefully lower fees . the idea sounds amazing i havent used it yet but may in the future i am tempted . sounds interesting but really

grams is not a market and doesnt track transactions from markets you can post reviews on grams but that doesn mean your baught somehting from that vender depending on how you word it grams never has and never will track searches i couldnt if i wanted to i dont have the server capacities or funds to buy the servers which would be needed bitcoin tumbling doesn mean anything unless le could somehow track the recieve address so only if grams got seized and the market a user buys from got seized by the same authorities at the same time would you have to worry about bitcoin tracking on top of that all logs are delete after days for all transactions helix included or you can delete them mutually after the transaction is complete message are all encrusted and are delete after days so yes grams does have a lot of info coming in but we do not collect anything we dont have to function if a user is really worried they can create a pip key just for using grams which would rid them of any threats unless they them self got arrested and gave out their own pgp key and grams got seized . im a bit tired so i didnt read the entire op sorry but in gon na go ahead and assume you are mining these coins

you would get using any of the markets especially if you only rely on them to tumble mix coins but if your data sets are ever compromise or your organization then there is likely to be a goldmine for
