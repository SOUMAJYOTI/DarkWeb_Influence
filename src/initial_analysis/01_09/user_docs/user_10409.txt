friend of yours . i completely agree and expected this to be the way they close up shop all the downtime gave me a sense theyd do it sooner rather than later but i didnt think theyd exit scam this is the perfect time to shutter it i have not been privy to conspiracy theories so i dont know what youre referring to but ending a business while profits are still good but risk is looming larger is a smart move . quote from herbanlegends on august pmquote from the other walter on august pmsounds plausible my first reaction when i read they were pausing operation was how can a market go on pause i mean youre either in business or youre not you cant just go on pause and come back and expect users to still trust you or even feel like using your market agora has been down for days before but pause seems to indicate more than just a few days i disagree with this if agra allows us with withdraw all of our funds and exits gracefully then returns later i most certainly would trust and continue using them a lot of people really want to believe these are just regular businesses and it is as simple as youre in business or youre not but that ignores all the additional risks involved in running

interested to see how important and fast the migration of traffic back to their market would be how long do you think the pause may be weeks months . first off this is not an agra slam they do what they want with all the power they have over the users and have not cut and run and that is all we can really ask of them this is a clarification on whats happened and is happening because all these theories are running too rampant i dont know why we refuse to look at things logically from a realistic and intelligent standpoint pretty much everything guessed about agora has been wrong since it was created why is everyone so wrong for three main reasons the godlike way agora is looked at and any other site until they disappear the conspiracy theories nature of this system that causes even the least paranoid person to look over their shoulder and that most people using agra arent business owners or are unable to look at it from the owners eyes the simple truth to see it think of agra not as a dark site but as an online retailer like any other when sr went down like any other darknet situation when the big one falls something has to take its place when a new king is crowned like amazon after bay many times its for arbitrary or simple lucky reasons for agora it may be it was listed on hidden wiki and other darknet sites as first alphabetically in a time when darknet sites and tor were hitting newstands and about to blow up but it definitely wasnt due to internet or tech savvy most if not all of these sites are created by people who are learning as they go or using closed sites ugly patchwork that wouldnt fly on normal sites but doesn hurt here it has always appeared to be manned by a barebones crew but ill toss that and the sites build aside to shorten this agora goes down because of the barebones nature and the coding site issues thats it there could be attacks and are but nowhere near what has been cooked up by some of us in these forums they have decided to do whatever they have in a way that does the customers as right as possible whether they come back or not is up to them but its not tor this or hidden services that the site needs oversailed if they want to keep doing it because every time it went down they lost more and more customers and sellers dont have to tell you so if they want to keep going they had to do this to create a secure setup to handle the size and traffic the site grew to that they probably didnt think was even possible if they are out and done then this is the only reason to give to satisfy everyone and is made easier as in sure part of the plan when they decided to stop selling weapons weeks and weeks before this i hope we can stop scaring each other if u think its not safe to buy or sell then done and as long as the

pmquote from herbanlegends on august pmquote from the other walter on august pmsounds plausible my first reaction when i read they were pausing operation was how can a market go on pause i mean youre either in business or youre not you cant just go on pause and come back and expect users to still trust you or even feel like using your market agora has been down for days before but pause seems to indicate more than just a few days i disagree with this if agra allows us with withdraw all of our funds and exits gracefully then returns later i most certainly would trust and continue using them a

pool of all the markets we have to mention that agora was advertised by bitcoinfog on their start up page they wrote that they have no coins in this operation but they know one some of the coders and think they are trustworthy bitcoinfog is one of the long lasting tumbling services so imho they have to have a very good opsec and if ag was oded that way the security shall be higher than the opsec from some other markets and the time proves that they have working sec in place am i the only one who believed trusted in this bitcoinfog advertisement and see a difference to sites ran by carders year old geeks or scammers by nature pathfinder . having trouble too i can see my transaction has conformations on the bc but on tails tor electrum the trx still shows as verified i have tried many dif networks and they all say they are since and are green but transaction still shows as unconformed on electrum so as the bc says it has been confirmed many times i check on agora and its not there so is agra having the same problem with tor wallet software or whats going on p s even my clearnet wallet to tor wallet trx shows as fine on the clearnet wallet but unverified on tor wallet so that trxs that i know are confirmed many times that show as unconformed on tails tor wallet . but in wondering why electrum is playing up in not sure if the tails electrum uses tor but i assume it does but it looks to me more like a bitcoin tor bc problem rather than agora specifically because my tails wallet still shows unconformed but i know they are confirmed its understandable if its a agora problem but if its a more general problem with coin over tor if it is over tor then i might be a little worried . sorry to hear that other than the site itself being slow as hell the last few days we havent had any issues withdrawing coins when the site actually loads that is if it hasnt shown after a day or so send a message to support . hi mary can you please send me your public key either here or via pm so i can pass on a little message to you from an old friend of yours . quote from theresident on august amquotethis is an example of poor security and should be stopped immediately never send coins from your own personal clearnet wallet to the wallet you use to make purchases from any dm or alike and vice versa they should be kept completely separate and never be used to send coins either way that just creates a link between the two which is something you want to avoid like the plague only open your wallet used for dm purchases over tor and only use your btc wallet on the clearnet for purchases on there never on a do please done mix the two together because its a risk you dont have to take i buy coin to a clearnet wallet which i never open on tails then send to my tails wallet which i never open on clearnet then on to the dnms yea there is a be trail but it give me plausible denyability as i say i brought the coin but then sent them to swim and as i never open my tail wallet on the clearnet i dont see the link apart from the bc but they cant prove i did not send them to some else who then sent them on to a dnm i would tumble them in between but thats just such a pain and im only a weekend lightweight quote i dont see the link apart from the bc but they cant prove i did not send them to some else who then sent them on to a dnm believe whatever you want mate blockchain analysis is certainly an option especially when youve made the mistake of sending and receiving coins between addresses from your clearnet wallet to addresses from your electric wallet no one is suggesting that a small time buyer could or would be target by le however the whole process of buying drugs on line is based on minimizing all your risks and taking the necessary precautions towards any unexpected or unpredictable events which might one day come to fruition think ahead and ask yourself about not only protecting your anonymity privacy today but what can i do to ensure it stays protected for as long as it can possibly be one simple example is to use a asa bit pip key pair instead of one thats only bits or smaller keys that are bits will last for many years to come approx to or there abouts but a key which is double the size to bits will last much longer again once a mistake is made here on the darknet its there forever unfortunately theres no going back whether or not it could be used to one day come back and bite you in the ass remains to be seen but at the very least it could be used as a piece in a jigs puzzle of which youre now a part of who the fuck knows what may lie ahead for any one of us here or what tools techniques are being developed to aid le in detecting arresting cymber criminals and ultimately reducing cyber crime at the rate of speed technology is progressing these days anything is possible if you have the resources at your disposal things are nothing like they used to be and its only going to get tougher so we all have to move with the times and step it up a little imo blockchain analysis is a very detailed and findeth look at the transaction history of a particular target and shouldnt be taken lightly it will only improve as time goes on . great now its not fucking loading i hate markets . sorry to hear that other than the site itself being slow as hell the last few days we havent had any issues withdrawing coins when the site actually loads that is if it hasnt shown after a day or so send a message to support . theyll be back or as give always been saying abraxas is agra ver p . i completely agree and expected this to be the way they close up shop all the downtime gave me a sense theyd do it sooner rather than later but i didnt think theyd exit scam this is the perfect time to shutter it i have not been privy to conspiracy theories so i dont know what youre referring to but ending a business while profits are still good but risk is looming larger is a smart move . this is right on the money anticipated prosperity is a bittersweet reality and one in which the grind to keep things moving drains you of whats required i e time effort for repairs and developments that would relieve you of those aspects of the grind that drain you most as a quick example from my own experience i had no idea i would ship out k worth of ids in that first month i began vending on sr i had help at the time and it was a disaster when the help and i unexpectedly parted ways i held things together but it wasnt easy at all i ended up issuing a lot of refunds many from a scam that the old partner had tried to pull on our sr account identity about k out of pocket and that meant i was more remnant on the money couldnt throttle sales for a bit give always been able to see the aspects of my production workflow that could easily be automatic for an absolutely massive benefit of long term relief but the grind has been intense give got a breather this week and will actually take their break as an opportunity for my own in their case its about refactoring their system to ensure maximum security and you cant blame them for taking this breather if there was suspicious activity not to mention they probably are wealthy enough to take a break well deserved considering the consistency of service offered over the past years theres nothing sketchy going on that i can see at least not from the agora admins themselves . sounds plausible my first reaction when i read they were pausing operation was how can a market go on pause i mean youre either in business or youre not you cant just go on pause and come back and expect users to still trust you or even feel like using your market agora has been down for days before but pause seems to indicate more than just a few days then i read the announcement and the reason stated by agora is the only one that could justify such a decision im left with two questions though is the threat real no one has yet mentioned any article or declaration of the people at the tor project sustaining azores claim and if that claim isnt sustained by evidence why would agora state it it sure makes their decision to go on pause very understandable but at the same time it casts doubts over the safety of this whole community since they didnt exit scam i am prone to believe they do care about the community or is there something i dont see there . quote from the jigsaw puzzle on august pmthis is an example of poor security and should be stopped immediately never send coins from your own personal clearnet wallet to the wallet you use to make purchases from any dm or alike and vice versa they should be kept completely separate and never be used to send coins either way that just creates a link between the two which is something you want to avoid like the plague only open your wallet used for dm purchases over tor and only use your btc wallet on the clearnet for purchases on there never on a do please done mix the two together because its a risk you dont have to take i buy coin to a clearnet wallet which i never open on tails then send to my tails wallet which i never open on clearnet then on to the dnms yea there is a be trail but it

not send them to some else who then sent them on to a dnm i think your thinking i send from my clearnet wallet directly to the dnm this is not the case i can not find a way to buy coin anon so they have to start out on a clearnet wallet i would tumble them in between but thats just such a pain and im only a weekend lightweight and i read advice that said tumbling was really only needed for

to look at things logically from a realistic and intelligent standpoint pretty much everything guessed about agora has been wrong since it was created why is everyone so wrong for three main reasons the godlike way agora is looked at and any other site until they disappear the conspiracy theories nature of this system that causes even the least paranoid person to look over their shoulder and that most people using agra arent business owners or are unable to look at it from the owners eyes the simple truth to see it think of agra not as a dark site but as an online retailer like any other when sr went down like any other darknet situation when the big one falls something has to take its place when a new king is crowned like amazon after bay many times its for arbitrary or simple lucky reasons for agora it may be it was listed on hidden wiki and other darknet sites as first alphabetically in a time when darknet sites and tor were hitting newstands and about to blow up but it definitely wasnt due to internet or tech savvy most if not all of these sites are created by people who are learning as they go or using closed sites ugly patchwork that wouldnt fly on normal sites but doesn hurt here it has always appeared to be manned by a barebones crew but ill toss that and the sites build aside to shorten this agora goes down because of the barebones nature and the coding site issues thats it there could be attacks and are but nowhere near what has been cooked up by some of us in these forums they have decided to do whatever they have in a way that does the customers as right as possible whether they come back or not is up to them but its not tor this or hidden services that the site needs oversailed if they want to keep doing it because every time it went down they lost more and more customers and sellers dont have to tell you so if they want to keep going they had to do this to create a secure setup to handle the size and traffic the site grew to that they probably didnt think was even possible if they are out and done then this is the only reason to give to satisfy everyone and is made easier as in sure part of the plan when they decided to stop selling weapons weeks and weeks before this i hope we can stop scaring each other if u think its not safe to buy or sell then done and as long as the next site is run by people as loyal to their customers as agora or agora itself set properly without the downtime then we are all winners why is everyone so wrong for three main reasons the godlike way agora is looked at and any other site until they disappear nothing wrong with this godlike status they have always gone off line for security reasons are now one of the longest running markets and it is a great site sr had god like status as it was the market that started most the markets and why we are mostly all here blackreloaded shit i forgot the name lol anyway backopy shut up shop and didnt scam other sites are given god like status by newbies who dont understand any market can go at any time . but in wondering why electrum is playing up in not sure if the tails electrum uses tor but i assume it does but it looks to me more like a bitcoin tor bc problem rather than agora specifically because my tails wallet still shows unconformed but i know they are confirmed its understandable if its a agora problem but if its a more general problem with coin over tor if it is over tor then i might be a little worried . having trouble too i can see my transaction has conformations on the bc but on tails tor electrum the trx still shows as verified i have tried many dif networks and they all say they are since and are green but transaction still shows as unconformed on electrum so as the bc says it has been confirmed many times i check on agora and its not there so is agra having the same problem with tor wallet software or whats going on p s even my clearnet wallet to tor wallet trx shows as fine on the clearnet wallet but unverified on tor wallet so that trxs that i know are confirmed many times that show as unconformed on tails tor wallet . anyone else having issues on agora i deposited some money into my wallet on

operation but they know one some of the coders and think they are trustworthy bitcoinfog is one of the long lasting tumbling services so imho they have to have a very good opsec and if ag was oded

far and the admit staff have shown integrity and class rarely seen in market admins by following the precedent set by bmrs admin backopy instead of orchestrating a massive exit scam like many people had expected to happen one day the going speculation of what will happen next combined with the higher levels of paranoia associated with drug use always equates to an explosion of ill informed f u d flooding the community its just the way things seem to work in this anonymous darknet enviroment we all love does my head in reading some the tripe that gets thrown about but im still here posting trying to contribute something like you said its just the way things seem to work in this environment . its a globe issue affecting a lot of people judging by what is being posted on reddit . first off this is not an agra slam they do what they want with all the power they have over the users and have not cut and run and that is all we can really ask of them this is a clarification on whats happened and is happening because all these theories are running too rampant i dont know why we refuse to look at things logically from a realistic and intelligent standpoint pretty much everything guessed about agora has been wrong since it was created why is everyone so wrong for three main reasons the godlike way agora is looked at and any other site until they disappear the conspiracy theories nature of this system that causes even the least paranoid person to look over their shoulder and that most people using agra arent business owners or are unable to look at it from the owners eyes the simple truth to see it think of agra not as a dark site but as an online retailer like any other when sr went down like any other darknet situation when the big one falls something has to take its place when a new king is crowned like amazon after bay many times its for arbitrary or simple lucky reasons for agora it may be it was listed on hidden wiki and other darknet sites as first alphabetically in a time when darknet sites and tor were hitting newstands and about to blow up but it definitely wasnt due to internet or tech savvy most if not all of these sites are created by people who are learning as they go or using closed sites ugly patchwork that wouldnt fly on normal sites but doesn hurt here it has always appeared to be manned by a barebones crew but ill toss that and the sites build aside to shorten this agora goes down because of the barebones nature and the coding site issues thats it there could be attacks and are but nowhere near what has been cooked up by some of us in these forums they have decided to do whatever they have in a way that does the customers as right as possible whether they come back or not is up to them but its not tor this or hidden services that the site needs oversailed if they want to keep doing it because every time it went down they lost more and more customers and sellers dont have to tell you so if they want to keep going they had to do this to create a secure setup to handle the size and traffic the site grew to that they probably didnt think was even possible if they are out and done then this is the only reason to give to satisfy everyone and is made easier as in sure part of the plan when they decided to stop selling weapons weeks and weeks before this i hope we can stop scaring each other if u think its not safe to buy or sell then done and as long as the next site is run by people as loyal to their customers as agora or agora itself set properly without the downtime then we are all winners . quote from

not you cant just go on pause and come back and expect users to still trust you or even feel like using your market agora has been down for days before but pause seems to indicate more than just a few days i disagree with this if agra allows us with withdraw all of our funds and exits gracefully then returns later i most certainly would trust and continue using them a lot of people really want to believe these are just regular businesses and it is as simple as youre in business or youre not but that ignores all the additional risks involved in running a hidden service i will never fault people for putting safety above conventional business wisdom good point im not faulting people here i know i would go back to agora if when it comes back also id be interested to see how important and fast the migration of traffic back to their market would be how long do you think the pause may be weeks months the weird thing is there was a message about giving back our vendor bonds which i wasnt expecting so that indicates to me they be gone for awhile it would seem strange to give us all our bonds back if there only going to be gone for a couple of weeks . quote from the other walter on

playing up in not sure if the tails electrum uses tor but i assume it does but it looks to me more like a bitcoin tor bc problem rather than agora specifically because my tails wallet still shows unconformed but i know they are confirmed its understandable if its a agora problem but if its a more general problem with coin over tor if it is over tor then i might be a little worried quote im not sure if the tails electrum uses tor but i assume it does but it looks to me more like a bitcoin tor bc problem rather than agora specifically because my tails wallet still shows unconformed but i know they are confirmed every software application included in each new build of tails is configured to only connect to the net through tor if an application in tails tries to connect to the clearnet directly tails will automatically block that connection for security purposes this is why the devs done recommend anyone adding additional software to their own personal copy of tails in case it hasnt been configured properly if it hasnt been it could potentially create a security issue for the user theres many variables which contribute to the speed in which etc transactions are professed sometimes delays do occur usually because of increased volumes but things will eventually settle down in due course and return to normal in sure theresident quote p s even my clearnet wallet to tor wallet trx shows as fine on the clearnet wallet but unverified on tor wallet so that trxs that i know are confirmed many times that show as unconformed on tails to wallet this is an example of poor security and should be stopped immediately never send coins from your own personal clearnet wallet to the wallet you use to make purchases from any dm or alike and vice versa they should be kept completely separate and never be used to send coins either way that just creates a link between the two which is something you want to avoid like the plague only open your wallet used for dm purchases over tor and only use your btc wallet on the clearnet for purchases on there never on a do please done mix the two together because its a risk you dont have to take . the dnm community is impossible

unexpected or unpredictable events which might one day come to fruition think ahead and ask yourself about not only protecting your anonymity privacy today but what can i do to ensure it stays protected for as long as it can possibly be one simple example is to use a asa bit pip key pair instead of one thats only bits or smaller keys that are bits will last for many years to come approx to or there abouts but a key which is double the size to bits will last much longer again once a mistake is made here on the darknet its there forever unfortunately theres no going back whether or not it could be used to one day come back and bite you in the ass remains to be seen but at the very least it could be used as a piece in a jigs puzzle of which youre now a part of who the fuck knows what

is progressing these days anything is possible if you have the resources at your disposal things are nothing like they used to be and its only going to get tougher so we all have to move with the times and step it up a little imo blockchain analysis is a very detailed and findeth look at the transaction history of a particular target and shouldnt be taken lightly it will only improve as time goes on . over hours later still no transaction for our withdrawal on the blockchain were going into vacation mode if we can get the site to load any current orders will be cancelled if coins arent moving stop using the market there has been too much historical evidence that coins not moving is bad news . just use localbitcoins and pay cash or do a cash deposit and you will avoid linking your

weaknesses that could effect other markets wish there was more into to defend against whatever the weakness is i read somewhere that it is unknown how many relays are owned operated by the letters nsa ghcq also read that many people involved with the letters helped incubate the tor project cant help think the blockhain is becoming a giant honeypot .
