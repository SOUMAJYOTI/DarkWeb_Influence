given by one of the mods on dhl today is it true what is being said yes it is true attackers did move btc into one and successfully withdrew about btc before it was halted but continue reading the btc was their own lol the attacker deposited their own coins in increments to our deposit wallet while trying to confuse the order system with order spam but with big everything is tied to the blockchain there is no internal accounting system to confuse afterwards they withdrew about again of their own btc before we cut it off thanks for the btc we are able to prove this at any time if a high standing and trusted member of the community would like to audit we can do this through simply passing our market xpub but we don t do that in a public medium since we take our users transaction privacy seriously forum was restored from a backup instead of scripting a clean up a few posts and messages might have been lost but should be below please double check each and every attack just keeps us on our toes and has actually pushed us quicker into ending beta we were going to do security bounties and tests ourselves but whosoever is paying the attackers is covering those costs for us any other claims in regards to stealing del coins are completely false although somewhat amusing what people come up as already stated the only thing this attacker has done of any really annoyance is swam our forums which we ll be adding more anti spam measures for shortly so again funds will always be safe from theft or seizure but of course if it is your own coins i can t exactly go against you withdrawing them lol for the moment while security is put in vendors will not be able to process orders but this will be fixed within a couple of hours full market functionality should be restored and all other measures in place within hours at least the btc will be going to a charity that we ll maybe create a poll on which our users can make recommendations . hacks crack is ve is dnmthief he is
