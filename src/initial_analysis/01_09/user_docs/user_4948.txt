from defcon on february pmi am deeply thankful for the hundreds of supporting messages i ve received i am consistently blown away by how the core of this community come together in times of strife to the multitude of you who lost faith in silk road i still am glad i ve heard your words i am still devastated that i have failed you and even i have fallen victim to this attack the majority of my personal earnings are completely gone my life is not in danger though and my identity is still protected i m thankful for this so now it s time to share with you our plan to move forward i realize you have no way of knowing whether i m telling the truth on anything trying to communicate the authenticity of my true character on the darknet is difficult to say the least and i do not expect any of you to take me at my word but my actions over the next few weeks will speak louder than words ever could and if you stick around you ll realize this silk road is not dead are here to stay and for the most part i believe our values are the same as yours the community s and even though i represent the latest idiot to make a security mistake i am unlike those who simply give in and am determined to use lessons learned to fight for this community s long term security i m focusing on mufti signature transactions as our only safe trading mechanism long term additional i am ready and willing to collaborate with other darknet administrators and utilize our talents penetration testing team to help them to regularly audit their security and although the tinfoil club will probably hate this and continue to tear me to shreds without regard for my actions in december and whether you choose to believe them or not here are the facts i live a very busy and complicated life i take opsec to extreme levels which consume many of my hours per day any time you see me here it means i have completed a checklist which requires over an hour of preparation for me to reposition and reconfigure many things to ensure i leave the most animal trail possible and can safely connect to this place this job will never be safe and it is impossible to be perfectly covert i know what i am facing both from le and from vendors who do not share my opinions of non violence all released announcements were my true plans and all delays were due to anticipated external factors upon which i can not elaborate my staff has been very frustrated at my lack of ability to keep the dev team on time again this is completely my fault and something for which i take complete responsibility i do not trust any developers so i meticulously review anything the dev team sends to me many have criticise me for this and i listened to them had i reviewed the code even more meticulously and delayed the fix to speed up slow withdrawals last month transaction malleability would not have affected us at all this is completely my fault for listening to critics instead of my own sense of caution the public has known that auto finalize has been disabled for a long time and has known that the escrow balance is massive any smart person could deduce that re enabling of auto finalize requires me to move a vast sum from cold storage to the hot storage wallet to ensure adequate fund availability which admitted was too large and one of my biggest failures this month the attack was survival and timed perfectly the reason such a high quantity of coins was stolen was because we were preparing to implement auto finalization and had therefore moved a huge volume from the cold storage to the hot storage to ensure the coins from all auto finalized orders could be withdrawn without a hitch here are as many details on the attack as i can provide i am still investigating and do not want to leak anything which could compromise any other markets transparency in this issue is key however you deserve as granular an explanation as possible as to why this happened s attack investigation results as of feb when withdrawal delays were happening last month we wrote a custom bitcoin implementation using several available libraries a reference and built it on a shared infrastructure to load balance across accounts and provide risk mitigation if ever one server was compromise as this implementation was being written by behind the scenes dev staff a lynch mob was getting exponentially worse in the forums our moderate staff became more and more insisted that it was crucial to fix this problem immediately relaying to me many concerns and threats from the community we cut a corner deciding to watch transactions many community members were reporting missing withdrawals weeks after sending them we implemented a liberal check to the refresh deposit balances link on the account page in essence we allowed it to search deeply for any missing coins rescanning and rescanning one of our team members was familiar with magog s procedures and source code and vouched for the idea our thoughts were that if the largest bitcoin exchange was using this approach to find missing coins it must be commonplace i received her his permission to publish this the transaction malleability bug was published last week at a time when i was disconnected from the internet for an extended period for open reasons i did not become aware of the threat until the attack was already occurring this was a failure on my part to trust more staff with critical access to stop withdrawals the people who did have access to disable withdrawals were terrified of doing it without my permission due to how negatively the community reacts when withdrawals are turned off they knew if they disabled withdrawals then re enabled them there would be a run on the bank and i would need to be online to deposit cold storage into hot storage in effect this was my failure to emphasize to staff that it is always day to lean on the side of caution and hit killswitches as they deem necessary it was also my failure to communicate expectations to the community that sometimes killswitches will have to be hit and it just means we re playing it safe this month it is clear we did not play it safe killswitches are pointless if the only person confident enough to hit them is the boss the attacker used an account first registered in early jan to try exploiting the vulnerability looking back at the account s history indicates that this account has been used to pentest many aspects of our system unsuccessfully every previous attempt to find an attack vector failed due to hardening done by our penetration testing team i had previously seen these attempts in the logs as something to celebrate look our hardening is working this hacker would have won but we put security over features several people suggested disabling the hacker s accounts but that is pointless in our business as anyone can simply re register we are still unclean as to the exact approach used to cause our servers perception of transactions to mismatch with reality because we have largely been focusing on preparing for relaunch and building communication to share with you the community over the past day to the best of our understanding the attacker deposited increasingly larger amounts of bitcoins and withdrew them while flooding the blockchain with ddos of similar transactions our system reflected his withdrawals and his account showed as zero the attacker rapidly clicked refresh deposits link until our code assumed that the transaction failed all indications point to malleability as the root case our system re credited his account with the x btc it judged unsuccessfully withdrawn this again due to the liberal rescanning mechanisms added last month see point in reality our servers perceived the transactions accurately and the btc were successfully withdrawn as a result our system accurately represented the user s balance as larger than it truly was this allowed the attacker to withdraw coins again the attacker began depositing larger amounts such as btc at a time in order to exploit the vulnerability quickly they then drained our entire hot storage in one bitcoin server shard and tried the attack from one of their other accounts the other account was on a different shard and allowed that hot storage to be drained the attacker continued using different accounts until virtual all of our hot storage shards were drained due to the type of vulnerability our accounting system had an inaccurate perception of bitcoins on hand and therefore did not trigger any alerts until real user withdrawals began failing unexpectedly this was a failure on our part to build a new server alert to check each shard of the new shared bitcoin infrastructure and another symptom of how rushed we were when implementing the new system during a forum lynch mob about slow withdrawals lessons learned so far more staff should have access to killswitches and should not be afraid to use them even if it s just because of some news post about on clearnet about some transaction malleability thing killswitches should be used liberally and regularly a community needs to be comfortable with regular downtime especially during periods when community safety and the safety of its money could be threatened a good staff will be responsible paranoid and hitting killswitches as they deem necessary and should not be afraid of their community panicking each time precaution is exercised there s more to web security than rigorous penetration testing it also requires the constant review of external services systems and infrastructures never make assumptions when implementing protocols you did not design had we not trusted magog s staff procedures we would have reviewed our approaches with much more rigor just because a large company s procedures are successful does not make them are safe accept that your community will hate you regardless in the darknet you will be crucified by your community if anything ever goes wrong psychologically prepare for everyone to hate you because you inevitably will fail at something and you will need to stay determined no matter what don t let it get to your head and don t let it affect your rigor with security we cut corners with our deposit withdrawal speed optimizations because we were afraid of the lynch mob we were foolish in this regard we should have taken the entire site offline for as long as it took to implement a high volume fault tolerant bitcoin server in a well tested rigorous manner this cost us an unspeakable amount of trust that we had saved to build some of us for years this is where we re at with as much transparency as this medium allows the worst that could happen did not happen the worst thing that could happen for our community s finances however did we hate that it occurred under our watch there is nothing we can do to change this all we can do is be transparent about where we are at and move forward to those who will respond here for dramatic effect please consider contributing your energy to the reconstruction of our community if you can not bring yourself to do this then please take your negativity elsewhere this is simple if you have lost faith in silk road i don t blame you in the least i also do not want to read about it in perpetuity trolling is easy trolling during a disaster is cowardice choosing to strengthen rather than troll when trolling is the popular move that s noble i know that i speak for all silk road staff seen and unseen when i speak these words we are going nowhere we will remain rebuilt and move forward toward the greater goal for which we strive by our running of this marketplace personal freedom and foundation human rights silk road will always rise again . as vendors over on sr and other open markets we will be listing but we will explain to customers that until the coin from their purchase is in our personal wallet we will not ship the order up to that point they will be accepting

broken promises and failed deadlines personally i done see the point of trading on s any more when i can buy here from trusted vendors and not have to pay commission fees . we also suggest that people use the pm functions here and on the market for direct trades instead of over email better opsec jor . for moving forwardquote from defcon on february amfirst to dispel rumors we are deep into the investigation of data surrounding the attacks and it there is absolutely hero evidence of any staff member being involved we will publish more information as we determine its accuracy thank you to all who have contributed tips on the attackers identities after much self reflection and deliberation with community members we value highly it is clear that there is only one way forward this leadership and this community will not stop until you are completely repaid we know you feel defenceless right now you are naked many of you are convinced there is no logical reason any darknet admin would ever fight to get your coins back i can stand here and reiterate that all i want to do is defend you to steer this community towards incrementally safer operation but my words are no comfort and i understand that you will never meet me we are all anonymous i gave a similar speech in december when we met our first impossible situation you have no reason to trust my words my actions will prove you wrong here is the current plan thank you to the dedicated vendors and buyers who helped draft this approach this is not necessarily a final plan we are open to suggestions on how to improve this and want your feedback the plan for moving forward as of feb this administration will not earn any commissions until everyone is completely paid back and will be very transparent about the progress towards this goal the marketplace will relaunch as no escrow we will not re implement escrow unless it is mufti signature and decentralized to multiple crow providers trusted mediators with feedback just like vendors never buy from a market which uses centralized escrow again you will only get hurt no matter how honest the team is all items will be priced at a flat commission which will go directly into victims balances upon purchase vendors who lost funds commissions from your items will go directly into your wallet until you are completely repaid then will be distributed to other vendors until they are repaid vendor bonds are considered lost funds and we also commit to paying these back all vendors can opt in to give a higher percentage back on their listings and all buyers will be presented with a donate box on the shopping cart vendors donation percentage will be publicly visible we will launch the support system immediately resubmit any open support requests you had which are still applicable all previous messages will be ignored due to our inbound message volume i have received over private messages over the past hours for example this fresh start will allow us to stay on top of the support queue rather than paying down a large debt incurred by previous administrators we will still handle dispute resolution for existing crow orders until all balances site wide are in pending balance category your stolen balances and escrows will display as pending balance and pending escrow yes like christmas i hoped to never have to take this approach again all shipped orders have been cancelled to the vendors who have shipped orders despite no access to the portal you are beautiful people try to resolve with your buyer directly and file a support ticket if you do not receive a refund to your pending escrow balance within a month the plans above are subject to change as we consider your input the statistics are humbling of our monthly active users have lost their entire sr funds that represents of users who have purchased or sold items since launch our inbound traffic has been growing at a rapid pace the first ten days of february saw as many purchases as the entire month of january by feb we surpassed january total user registrations we strongly believe that we can work together and make this right silk road is not a name easily forgotten and how we pull through this struggle will only solidify our name as the strongest community in the darknet buyers and vendors we are committed to getting everyone repaid even if it takes a year do not forget to check your sr accounts frequently for balances repaid and withdraw them when you see them vendors you are welcomed and encouraged to vend on multiply markets i only trust myself and will not endorse any of them but i have failed you wherever you vend may you prosper buyers do not purchase using centralized escrow use markets which have implements mufti signature or only purchase with no escrow fe from very trusted vendors this is not an ideal climate but it is the reality of the darknet today i can not emphasize strongly enough that every market which uses centralized escrow will fail centralization makes a market a huge target for attackers and a huge target for dishonest administrators again we welcome your feedback on this approach to moving forward and will continue to refine it throughout the year based on sales data i dont care how long it takes or how expensive it is we will fight to get this community repaid . in my opinion defcons words are as shallow and empty as a leaking swimming pool hard to take him serious after all the broken promises and failed deadlines personally i done see the point of trading on s any more when i can buy here from trusted vendors and not have to pay commission fees . as vendors over on sr and other open markets we will be listing but we will explain to customers that until the coin from their purchase is in our personal wallet

is not dead are here to stay and for the most part i believe our values are the same as yours the community s and even though i represent the latest idiot to make a security mistake i am unlike those who simply give in and am determined to use lessons learned to fight for this communitys long term security im focusing on mufti signature transactions as our only safe trading mechanism long term additional i am ready and willing to collaborate with other darknet administrators and utilize our talents penetration testing team to help them to regularly audit their security and although the tinfoil club will probably hate this and continue to tear me to shreds without regard for my actions in december and whether you choose to believe them or not here are the facts i live a very busy and complicated life i take opsec to extreme levels which consume many of my hours per day any time you see me here it means i have completed a checklist which requires over an hour of preparation for me to reposition and reconfigure many things to ensure i leave the most animal trail possible and can safely connect to this place this job will never be safe and it is impossible to be perfectly covert i know what i am facing both from le and from vendors who do not share my opinions of non violence all released announcements were my true plans and all delays were due to anticipated external factors upon which i can not elaborate my staff has been very frustrated at my lack of ability to keep the dev team on time again this is completely my fault and something for which i take complete responsibility i do not trust any developers so i meticulously review anything the dev team sends to me many have criticise me for this and i listened to them had i reviewed the code even more meticulously and delayed the fix to speed up slow withdrawals last month transaction malleability would not have affected us at all this is completely my fault for listening to critics instead of my own sense of caution the public has known that auto finalize has been disabled for a long time and has known that the escrow balance is massive any smart person could deduce that re enabling of auto finalize requires me to move a vast sum from cold storage to the hot storage wallet to ensure adequate fund availability which admitted was too large and one of my biggest failures this month the attack was survival and timed perfectly the reason such a high quantity of coins was stolen was because we were preparing to implement auto finalization and had therefore moved a huge volume from the cold storage to the hot storage to ensure the coins from all auto finalized orders could be withdrawn without a hitch here are as many details on the attack as i can provide i am still investigating and do not want to leak anything which could compromise any other markets transparency in this issue is key however you deserve as granular an explanation as possible as to why this happened s attack investigation results as of feb when withdrawal delays were happening last month we wrote a custom bitcoin implementation using several available libraries a reference and built it on a shared infrastructure to load balance across accounts and provide risk mitigation if ever one server was compromise as this implementation was being written by behind the scenes dev staff a lynch mob was getting exponentially worse in the forums our moderate staff became more and more insisted that it was crucial to fix this problem immediately relaying to me many concerns and threats from the community we cut a corner deciding to watch transactions many community members were reporting missing withdrawals weeks after sending them we implemented a liberal check to the refresh deposit balances link on the account page in essence we allowed it to search deeply for any missing coins rescanning and rescanning one of our team members was familiar with mtgoxs procedures and source code and vouched for the idea our thoughts were that if the largest bitcoin exchange was using this approach to find missing coins it must be commonplace i received her his permission to publish this the transaction malleability bug was published last week at a time when i was disconnected from the internet for an extended period for open reasons i did not become aware of the threat until the attack was already occurring this was a failure on my part to trust more staff with critical access to stop withdrawals the people who did have access to disable withdrawals were terrified of doing it without my permission due to how negatively the community reacts when withdrawals are turned off they knew if they disabled withdrawals then re enabled them there would be a run on the bank and i would need to be online to deposit cold storage into hot storage in effect this was my failure to emphasize to staff that it is always day to lean on the side of caution and hit killswitches as they deem necessary it was also my failure to communicate expectations to the community that sometimes killswitches will have to be hit and it just means were playing it safe this month it is clear we did not play it safe killswitches are pointless if the only person confident enough to hit them is the boss the attacker used an account first registered in early jan to try exploiting the vulnerability looking back at the accounts history indicates that this account has been used to pentest many aspects of our system unsuccessfully every previous attempt to find an attack vector failed due to hardening done by our penetration testing team i had previously seen these attempts in the logs as something to celebrate look our hardening is working this hacker would have won but we put security over features several people suggested disabling the hackers accounts but that is pointless in our business as anyone can simply re register we are still unclean as to the exact approach used to cause our servers perception of transactions to mismatch with reality because we have largely been focusing on preparing for relaunch and building communication to share with you the community over the past day to the best of our understanding the attacker deposited increasingly larger amounts of bitcoins and withdrew them while flooding the blockchain with ddos of similar transactions our system reflected his withdrawals and his account showed as zero the attacker rapidly clicked refresh deposits link until our code assumed that the transaction failed all indications point to malleability as the root case our system re credited his account with the x btc it judged unsuccessfully withdrawn this again due to the liberal rescanning mechanisms added last month see point in reality our servers perceived the transactions accurately and the btc were successfully withdrawn as a result our system accurately represented the users balance as larger than it truly was this allowed the attacker to withdraw coins again the attacker began depositing larger amounts such as btc at a time in order to exploit the vulnerability quickly they then drained our entire hot storage in one bitcoin server shard and tried the attack from one of their other accounts the other account was on a different shard and allowed that hot storage to be drained the attacker continued using different accounts until virtual all of our hot storage shards were drained due to the type of vulnerability our accounting system had an inaccurate perception of bitcoins on hand and therefore did not trigger any alerts until real user withdrawals began failing unexpectedly this was a failure on our part to build a new server alert to check each shard of the new shared bitcoin infrastructure and another symptom of how rushed we were when implementing the new system during a forum lynch mob about slow withdrawals lessons learned so far more staff should have access to killswitches and should not be afraid to use them even if its just because of some news post about on clearnet about some transaction malleability thing killswitches should be used liberally and regularly a community needs to be comfortable with regular downtime especially during periods when community safety and the safety of its money could be threatened a good staff will be responsible paranoid and hitting killswitches as they deem necessary and should not be afraid of their community panicking each time precaution is exercised there s more to web security than rigorous penetration testing it also requires the constant review of external services systems and infrastructures never make assumptions when implementing protocols you did not design had we not trusted magots staff procedures we would have reviewed our approaches with much more rigor just because a large companys procedures are successful does not make them are safe accept that your community will hate you regardless in the darknet you will be crucified by your community if anything ever goes wrong psychologically prepare for everyone to hate you because you inevitably will fail at something and you will need to stay determined no matter what dont let it get to your head and done let it affect your rigor with security we cut corners with our deposit withdrawal speed optimizations because we were afraid of the lynch mob we were foolish in this regard we should have taken the entire site offline for as long as it took to implement a high volume fault tolerant bitcoin server in a well tested rigorous manner this cost us an unspeakable amount of trust that we had saved to build some of us for years this is where were at with as much transparency as this medium allows the worst that could happen did not happen the worst thing that could happen for our communitys finances however did we hate that it occurred under our watch there is nothing we can do to change this all we can do is be transparent about where we are at and move forward to those who will respond here for dramatic effect please consider contributing your energy to the reconstruction of our community if you can not bring yourself to do this then please take your negativity elsewhere this is simple if you have lost faith in silk road i dont blame you in the least i also do not want to read about it in perpetuity trolling is easy trolling during a disaster is cowardice choosing to strengthen rather than troll when trolling is the popular move thats noble i know that i speak for all silk road staff seen and unseen when i speak these words we are going nowhere we will remain rebuilt and move forward toward the greater goal for which we strive by our running of this marketplace personal freedom and foundation human rights silk road will always rise again . for moving forwardquote from defcon on february amfirst to dispel rumors we are deep into the investigation of data surrounding the attacks and it there is absolutely hero evidence of any staff member being involved we will publish more information as we determine its accuracy thank you to all who have contributed tips on the attackers identities after much self reflection and deliberation with community members we value highly it is clear that there is only one way forward this leadership and this community will not stop until you are completely repaid we know you feel defenceless right now you are naked many of you are convinced there is no logical reason any darknet admin would ever fight to get your coins back i can stand here and reiterate that all i want to do is defend you to steer this community towards incrementally safer operation but my words are no comfort and i understand that you will never meet me we are all anonymous i gave a similar speech in december when we met our first impossible situation you have no reason to trust my words my actions will prove you wrong here is the current plan thank you to the dedicated vendors and buyers who helped draft this approach this is not necessarily a final plan we are open to suggestions on how to improve this and want your feedback the plan for moving forward as of feb this administration will not earn any commissions until everyone is completely paid back and will be very transparent about the progress towards this goal the marketplace will relaunch as no escrow we will not re implement escrow unless it is mufti signature and decentralized to multiple crow providers trusted mediators with feedback just like vendors never buy from a market which uses centralized escrow again you will only get hurt no matter how honest the team is all items will be priced at a flat commission which will go directly into victims balances upon purchase vendors who lost funds commissions from your items will go directly into your wallet until you are completely repaid then will be distributed to other vendors until they are repaid vendor bonds are considered lost funds and we also commit to paying these back all vendors can opt in to give a higher percentage back on their listings and all buyers will be presented with a donate box on the shopping cart vendors donation percentage will be publicly visible we will launch the support system immediately resubmit any open support requests you had which are still applicable all previous messages will be ignored due to our inbound message volume i have received over private messages over the past hours for example this fresh start will allow us to stay on top of the support queue rather than paying down a large debt incurred by previous administrators we will still handle dispute resolution for existing crow orders until all balances site wide are in pending balance category your stolen balances and escrows will display as pending balance and pending escrow yes like christmas i hoped to never have to take this approach again all shipped orders have been cancelled to the vendors who have shipped orders despite no access to the portal you are beautiful people try to resolve with your buyer directly and file a support ticket if you do not receive a refund to your pending escrow balance within a month the plans above are subject to change as we consider your input the statistics are humbling of our monthly active users have lost their entire sr funds that represents of users who have purchased or sold items since launch our inbound traffic has been growing at a rapid pace the first ten days of february saw as many purchases as the entire month of january by feb we surpassed january total user registrations we strongly believe that we can work together and make this right silk road is not a name easily forgotten and how we pull through this struggle will only solidify our name as the strongest community in the darknet buyers and vendors we are committed to getting everyone repaid even if it takes a year do not forget to check your sr accounts frequently for balances repaid and withdraw them when you see them vendors you are welcomed and encouraged to vend on multiply markets i only trust myself and will not endorse any of them but i have failed you wherever you vend may you prosper buyers do not purchase using centralized escrow use markets which have implements mufti signature or only purchase with no escrow fe from very trusted vendors this is not an ideal climate but it is the reality of the darknet today i can not emphasize strongly enough that every market which uses centralized escrow will fail centralization makes a market a huge target for attackers and a huge target for dishonest administrators again we welcome your feedback on this approach to moving forward and will continue to refine it throughout the year based on sales data i dont care how long it takes or how expensive it is we will fight to get this community repaid . we also suggest that people use the pm functions here and on the market for direct trades instead of over email better opsec jor . as vendors over on sr and other open markets we will be listing but we will explain to customers that until the coin from their purchase is in our personal wallet we will not ship the order up to that point they will be accepting all liability we will also publicise on each of our listings that if they want to avoid this risk the fees then they can deal directly with us here just our two cents for . from defcon on february pmi am deeply thankful for the hundreds of supporting messages ive received i am consistently blown away by how the core of this community come together in times of strife to the multitude of you who lost faith in silk road i still am glad give heard your words i am still devastated that i have failed you and even i have fallen victim to this attack the majority of my personal earnings are completely gone my life is not in danger though and my identity is still protected i m thankful for this so now it s time to share with you our plan to move forward i realize you have no way of knowing whether im telling the truth on anything trying to communicate the authenticity of my true character on the darknet is difficult to say the least and i do not expect any of you

they take commission from this costing both you and the vendor money to use their service of helping you two meet it is in offering this service in the competition context of a free market that you would expect they would rise to the challenge of being the best investment of time money effort and more money for you in pretty much all cases online or office legal or illegal people who do more research will likely achieve the most satisfying ends however expecting a business to at the very least not scam you is totally reasonable and a business violating that expectation is completely worth being a target of harsh criticism . well people can criticize all they want but ultimately if they invested that critical energy before rather than after being scammed they probably couldve prevented it most of the posts i saw about scammers were for some semi sketch vendor once you did minutes research i just feel that the huge quantity of complaints directed at sr regarding scammers was distracting from real issues like billy mentioned auto finalize and locked accounts personally i suffered from a form of scam by the s administration normally when using sr my btc were spent immediately upon receipt by my sr account however due to an order cancellation and system glitch which resulted in my balance reading in the negative for about days well my btc were still on s accounts when the hack happened instead of if i had access to them in which case they wouldve been spent moved days earlier there was is definitely some fishy behaviour by the s admin but its not their failure to deal with swam vendors the best way to prevent swam vendors is reading feedback and the forum and contacting the vendor a few times and establishing some conversation the admin are a third party with little information evidence to make educated decisions on whether or not scams are taking place the buyer is the most empowered individual to prevent scamming by providing good feedback and reviews community authority . there were many problems with sr but why is it that so much onus is placed on the marketplace to deal with scammers ive been using darknet since btc were s to be precise give never been slammed its essential to read forum threads about vendors ask people on the forums who you get a good vibe from generally just do some research scams only happen if you just jump in buy drugs jump out i understand not everyone has time to participate in the forums i participate more then i should but normally any swam couldve been prevented by doing some research and being cautious escrow is definitely topic dealing directly with vendors like this marketplace is the way have a little faith and ye shall be rewarded vendors are held to account by the forum members and their opinions and details thats what makes dark net trading possible better than in person trades . dma the marketplaces rascally only broker deals they take commission from this costing both you

updatedforum thread updatedforum footer dated with link to pgp thread agora not yet dated . quote from el presidente on january amupdate this post has been dated to take into account current gnupg behavior and encryption sub key selection we are mutilated to post this by a recent post from the subject comments from hux nightcrawler and one or two queries we received on the topic that well thought out post is here and we would suggest it is worth a read we can not find any step by step instructions for rolling keys here on the forum so we have put this post together risk rationalethere is a risk attached to the fact that over time we can collect many messages all of which are encrusted to the same encryption sub key and all of which can be decrypted using a single state pgp private key the effect of this data aggregation and lack of key change is to significantly increase the impact of a key compromise if data retention practices have been poor or for whatever reason historic data is untractable then this problem can become very significant counter measureswe are able to counter the effects of data aggregation to some extent by periodically changing rolling the encryption

method above is relatively painless and may save your ass loveel presidente . quote from el presidente on january amupdate this post has been dated to take into account current gnupg behavior and encryption sub key selection we are mutilated to post this by a recent post from the subject comments from hux nightcrawler and one or two queries we received on the topic that well thought out post is here and we would suggest it is worth a read we can not find any step by step instructions for rolling keys here on the forum so we have put this post together risk rationalethere is a risk attached to the fact that over time we can collect many messages all of which are encrusted to the same encryption sub key and all of which can be decrypted using a single state pgp private key the effect of this data aggregation and lack of key change is to significantly increase the impact of a key compromise if data retention practices have been poor or for whatever reason historic data is untractable then this problem can become very significant counter measureswe are able to counter the effects of data aggregation to some extent by periodically changing rolling the encryption key and there are two obvious ways of doing that throw away the old key and use a new key perhaps signing the new key with the old to prove that the key change is legitimate and redistributeor keep the existing pgp key and identity but periodically change the encryption sub key and redistributeour post will describe the nd option which is useful where the keyholder wants to keep their identity but

quote from el presidente on january amupdate this post has been dated to take into account current gnupg behavior and encryption sub key selection we are mutilated to post this by a recent post from the subject comments from hux nightcrawler and one or two queries we received on the topic that well thought out post is here and we would suggest it is worth a read we can not find any step by step instructions for rolling keys here on the forum so we have put this post together risk rationalethere is a risk attached to the fact that over time we can collect many messages all of which are encrusted to the same encryption sub key and all of which can be decrypted using a single state pgp private key the effect of this data aggregation and lack of key change is to significantly increase the impact of a key compromise if data retention practices have been poor or for whatever reason historic data is untractable then this problem can become very significant counter measureswe are able to counter the effects of data aggregation to some extent by periodically changing rolling the encryption key and there are two obvious ways of doing that throw away the old key and use a new key perhaps signing the new key with the old to prove that the key change is legitimate and redistributeor keep the existing pgp key and identity but periodically change the encryption sub key and redistributeour post will describe the nd option which is useful where the keyholder wants to keep their identity but still benefit from rolling encryption keys periodically it is also useful when wanting to increase key size to while retaining your the original key identity the period should be as short as practically possible but remember that you will have to make a copy of your new key available each time a key expires so choose something achievable like or months with a month roll period you reduce your maximum exposure of a single key compromise to a worst case of months that means if your key is compromise by an adversary they will only have access to a maximum of months of encrusted data at most two encryption keys are stored in the pgp key at any one time to provide an overlap period and that is why the maximum exposure is x month keys most of the time the exposure is actually only months the overlay process is fairly straightforward although requires discipline create your pip public key if you have not already configure your encryption sub key to expire in months time distribute your key months later month before the first sub key expires you must create an additional encryption sub key set to expire in months time a month later shortly after the first sub key expires you must delete it this will leave you with the single current encryption sub key again go back to step warning once you have delete an encryption sub key anything you encrypted to it is lost forever the steps detailed below are primarily for linus users although they are applicable to any reasonable version of gnupg that incorporates the command line client gpg or gpg we have used seahorse where possible as it is relatively straightforward to use for non technical users initials key hash hardeningthe first step to perform on your key is to select stronger hashes by default rather than sha this is not essential but it is recommended and is a one time process you should

maintain rolling encryption sub keys make sure you have a copy of your keypair or your whole keyring before proceeding just in case download seahorse if you dont already have it this will make the job of key maintenance easier we think start seahorse and locate your key double click it and click the details tab and locate the subkeys section the bottom of the tab is a section called subkeys here you can add remove and edit all keys easily the top sub key listed is the master key we will ignore that one it is your primary identity the second key is your encryption sub key this is the sub key that we are going to edit and start to roll periodically select the second subkey hopefully the encryption subkey and click expire if you have not yet set it to expire on the pop up calendar unlock never expires and select a date in the future when you want the key to expire let us choose months in the future when done click change you are done for now make sure it works then delete that backup you took earlier and redistribute your public key the main public key id your identity will remain the same so there is little reason for anyone to doubt the legitimacy of the key change the new key is reflectively signed so does not necessarily need further explanation to recipients month before your encryption sub key expires it is time to create a replacement and redistribute as follows month before expiry fire up seashore select your key double click it and click the details tab navigating to the sub keys section click add key to add the next encryption sub key and select the following settings key type rsa encrypt only key length bit expiration date set this to be months from now redistribute your keya month later when your old encryption sub key expires you remove the expired key leaving you with the current key that you created above in step there is no need to redistribute your key at this stage using seahorse again select your key double click it and click the details tab in the sub keys section select the now expired sub key and click delete now go back above to step a month before the next key expires this cycle repeats for the operation lifetime of the key key rolling using the gpg command line toolthe gpg command line tools provides the most granular control of keys and is usually accessible on most systems make sure you have a copy of your keypair or your

and one month before this happens we will generate a new sub key as per step this cycle repeats for the operation lifetime of the key and requires us to redistribute our key every months remember though the actual key identity remains the same it is just the encryption sub key that is changing final noteit is important to purge any and all backups of your key every time you roll the encryption sub keys otherwise there is little point to rolling encryption keys you must be aware that all data encrusted to old and expired sub keys that you have delete purged will not be recoverable this may

quote from el presidente on january amupdate this post has been dated to take into account current gnupg behavior and encryption sub key selection we are mutilated to post this by a recent post from the subject comments from hux nightcrawler and one or two queries we received on the topic that well thought out post is here and we would suggest it is worth a read we can not find any step by step instructions for rolling keys here on the forum so we have put this post together risk rationalethere is a risk attached to the fact that over time we can collect many messages all of which are encrusted to the same encryption sub key and all of which can be decrypted using a single state pgp private key the effect of this data aggregation and lack of key change is to significantly increase the impact of a key compromise if data retention practices have been poor or for whatever reason historic data is untractable then this problem can become very significant counter measureswe are able to counter the effects of data aggregation to some extent by periodically changing rolling the encryption key and there are two obvious ways of doing that throw away the old key and use a new key perhaps signing the new key with the old to prove that the key change is legitimate and redistributeor keep the existing pgp key and identity but periodically change the encryption sub key and redistributeour post will describe the nd option which is useful where the keyholder wants to keep their identity but still benefit from rolling encryption keys periodically it is also useful when wanting to increase key size to while retaining your the original key identity the period should be as short as practically possible but remember that you will have to make a copy of your new key available each time a key expires so choose something achievable like or months with a month roll period you reduce your maximum exposure of a single key compromise to a worst case of months that means if your key is compromise by an adversary they will only have access to a maximum of months of encrusted data at most two encryption keys are stored in the pgp key at any one time to provide an overlap period and that is why the maximum exposure is x month keys most of the time the exposure is actually only months the overlay process is fairly straightforward although requires discipline create your pip public key if you have not already configure your encryption sub key to expire in months time distribute your key months later month before the first sub key expires you must create an additional encryption sub key set to expire in months time a month later shortly after the first sub key expires you must delete it this will leave you with the single current encryption sub key again go back to step warning once you have delete an encryption sub key anything you encrypted to it is lost forever the steps detailed below are primarily for linus users although they are applicable to any reasonable version of gnupg that incorporates the command line client gpg or gpg we have used seahorse where possible as it is relatively straightforward to use for non technical users initials key hash hardeningthe first step to perform on your key is to select stronger hashes by default rather than sha this is not essential but it is recommended and is a one time process you should

you can add remove and edit all keys easily the top sub key listed is the master key we will ignore that one it is your primary identity the second key is your encryption sub key this is the sub key that we are going to edit and start to roll periodically select the second subkey hopefully the encryption subkey and click expire if you have not yet set it to expire on the pop up calendar unlock never expires and select a date in the future when you want the key to expire let us choose months in the future when done click change you are done for now make sure it works then delete that backup you took earlier and redistribute your public key the main public key id your identity will remain the same so there is little reason for anyone to doubt the legitimacy of the key change the new key is reflectively signed so does not necessarily need further explanation to recipients month before your encryption sub key expires it is time to create a replacement and redistribute as follows month before expiry fire up seashore select your key double click it and click the details tab navigating to the sub keys section click add key to add the next encryption sub key and select the following settings key type rsa encrypt only key length bit expiration date set this to be months from now redistribute your keya month later when your old encryption sub key expires you remove the expired key leaving you with the current key that you created above in step there is no need to redistribute your key at this stage using seahorse again select your key double click it and click the details tab in the sub keys section select the now expired sub key and click delete now go back above to step a month before the next key expires this cycle repeats for the operation lifetime of the key key rolling using the gpg command line toolthe gpg command line tools provides the most granular control of keys and is usually accessible on most systems make sure you have a copy of your keypair or your whole keyring before proceeding just in case execute gog list key xxxxxxxxx where xxxxxxxxx is your pip keyid at this point you should see output which shows the main public key and encryption sub key s as below code select user server gog list keys x e pub r e did rollf keyz ein rollfz mein key sub r d e dd here we see that the main key id is x e with pub listed before it and following that we see a subkey of x d e dd with sub listed before it some of you may only have a single key shown if this is the case then you will first need to add an encryption sub key execute gpg edit key xxxxxxxxx where xxxxxxxxx is your pip keyid at the gpg prompt enter key this will select the st subkey at the prompt enter expire and when prompted enter m for the time period months confirm changes and when you are back to the gpg prompt type save you are done make sure it works then delete that backup you took earlier and redistribute your public key we can apply the above steps to our example key and

one month before your encryption sub key expires it is time to add the next periods encryption sub key as follows execute gpg edit key xxxxxxxxx where xxxxxxxxx is your pip keyid at the gpg prompt

key xd e dd has gone it will no longer be possible to use this pgp key to recover any messages or data encrusted to that original encryption sub key our current key xaab d b is due to expire in june and one month before this happens we will generate a new sub key as per step this cycle repeats for the operation lifetime of the key and requires us to redistribute our key every months remember though the actual key identity remains the same it is just the encryption sub key that is changing final noteit is important to purge any and all backups of your key every time you roll the encryption sub keys otherwise there is little point to rolling encryption keys you must be aware that all data encrusted to old and expired sub keys that you have delete purged will not be recoverable this may seem daunting but it certainly makes good sense from a risk reduction perspective using the seahorse method above is relatively painless and may save your ass loveel presidente . we have now dated our
