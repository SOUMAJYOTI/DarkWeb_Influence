hello guys im from a country of non english talking so i hope you can understand me in planning a personal onion html based and very simple market only for offer my products in my country begining with our city here are a huge market the problem is that here no exists that kind of portal blue boxes usa where you can send letters or things just using postage and without interacting with any portal office the most near thing is buying postage in the office and use it but i will have to go inside the portal office and let the package or letters there without any signing and when i purchase the postage ill have to go inside the portal too so i dont like it because there are came etc i was thinking in oratory aleatory in site drops inside the city like this the customer see a product read the see instructions and make the purchase sending his exactly amount bt to our bt adress and the pip message with the info that will be the neighborwood or some relative geoposition in the city for what we concern we recieve the bt and message so we go near to the site he send us without telling anybody only me for now and never in exactly the site and simply locate a site for drop the package maybe in a trash container in a wall like an marketing object i dont know how translate or whatever there just be a lot of possibilitys for make this with a liitle of creativity if i have been intercepted or contracted by le they will never know where i am exactly only a relative location that will be a lot of surface for cover nobody know where is this place because i improvise the place in site we left the place and when have a good and secure distance send the last message encrypted with the exactly location of the package so there always be a distance between me and the customers in case of le or something and always using correct opsec and all required security online and office surveillance etc etc let me know what you think pd if you have any other idea for my case i will appreciate a lot that we have learned a lot of experience in sr sr tcf and all that good forums and good people love your work . hello guys im from a country of non english talking so i hope you can

better to place the item somewhere before you tell the person the general location if it is le they will watch what everyone does in the area and will likely see you do it place it somewhere with gps coordinates and a general description like in the gray trash barrel by the lamp post or under the big bush under some leaves with a soda can on top better still to just buy the stamps somewhere and bring in your package to the post office they may have a cam but will not be able to connect you to the exact package unless you have to stand in line and give it to the person . what do you think about this crypto they claims to be the hidden services cryptocurrency i copy paste from his web quoteabout the coinanoncoin is mainly targeting to be used through the invisible internet i p and tor introducing another layer of security within the cryptocurrency markets by providing new coin features and services to build on top of these lets get on with the facts the coin can not be stopped by central banks or governments this is is achieved by decentralization combining the use of clearnet invisible web and services if the coin is being used on i p or tor there is no way to identify who is operating the nodes and clients this will in turn enable the production of new better anonymous services what if the coins are being traced in the blockchain coin mixer services operating through i p are in development to put a stop to coins being traced back to any one wallet or person these will make it possible to mix up coins you have received or mine by sending them to the mixer service coins sent there will be mixed with all other coins within the service before being sent to any address of your choosing what are the basin features of anoncoin there can be million coins in existence the

you use gas to locate the coordinates of the spot after you leave it and then shut off the gps no they cant trace you that way in sure dont you have several post offices in your area you could go to a different one each time and rotate them it must be easier to do it that way than to drive miles to someone elses neighborhood perhaps you can do the drop for customers near by and mail it to those farther away for the first thing im planning a lot of hide places that can be leave there without suspect i have good ideas but no comment here for security thanks for gps advice here are less than offices of public portal enterprise but a lot more of private couriers that require sign and more information so maybe could be dangerous but i really done know if that its a lot or a few offices many of that offices are in malls so ill be caught in more cams more risk for shipping all the country and maybe just maybe international or continental portal mail its the better option and i have to think how to send using any service public private without leaving any trace any idea about this i really have to resolve this trouble because in my city i can do with deaddrops but in planning to expand the bussiness so yes or yes i have to use mail shipping if anyone have any idea ill appreciatte a lot maybe another options remember the problem is that here doesnt exist the portal boxes that blue ones in us for send letters or boxes without register anywhere only using pottage postage can be used here but i have to buy it in a portal office and send the items in portal offices without sign any paper but leaving cam traces and all stuff that comes with this risk any idea about how to send items here thanks guys . quote from trc on march amif you are going to go to that extreme why not just deliver well that will be so dangerous because the person who contact me can be a le of or a person interested in caught me so that is not a good idea the thing is that the customer never know who i am and never know where is the drop until i has gone from there thanks for your answer anyway quoted have delivered product via remote controller toy plane beforewow that may be a good idea in some cases but its a main city its so big and that will be so rare i was thinking how to camouflage my visits to the portal office maybe with sunglasses or makeup something like that like i said i have problems i have to go personally to the office for buy the postage and again for ship the package with postage i dont have to give my real name or something only leave the letters over there but maybe that can be rare the other option is using a private service like fedex but again i have to go personally so that its a risk do anyone have other options than portal shipping that can be

cam but will not be able to connect you to the exact package unless you have to stand in line and give it to the person . i think you are over thinking this i walk into post offices to purchase stamps postage all the time my normal non darknet routine involves me going into multiply portal locations frequently it does not look that unusual for someone to visit the post on a regular basis and purchase dozens of stamps at one time and do nothing else when you go to drop off your packages just act calm and normal man walk in with all of your packages in a box or a cloth bag to prevent you having to touch them while also avoiding looking odd for wearing gloves in the summer time for your drop you dont make eye contact with the cameras and wear a hat to make it harder to id you you just walk in dump your bag into the bin or casually pour them onto the counter for the po employee to handle from then then just walk out change up which post offices you ship out of and rotate your shipping days ie pick days per week that you will ship orders do all your prep early in the day when you can take your time and be very clean about packaging make a run to one of the post offices you use after a few months change your days up so if you were shipping say mon wed fir change it up to like tues fri sat or something like that change your appearance so its hard to identify you are the same person each time you make a drop changing your hat general attire slightly helps this go get a few outfits that are several sizes too large to use for this the loose clothing will further obscure your physical description it never looks odd for someone to be shipping packages from a post office people acting sketchy in a post office attracts attention just figure out a method that you are comfortable with and practice it hell send thank you cards or invitaitons to long lost friends or random people for a couple of runs until you get comfortable with your surroundings you may even consider continuing this process after you begin shipping your product as again it further obscures your intentions and provides a nice legit reason for you to be in the po so frequently the best of us out there understand that the most effective disguise is to hide in plain sight my domestic stealth is not the most advanced i have experienced but at the same time you would never guess my package is what it is without knowing in advance it looks just like any other random piece of mail i never use the same exact style of stealth for two drop runs in a row ie i have about different materials i use to make up my packages of those materials i can create up to around unique styles of stealth package all of them are very plain jane looking on the outside and flat plus the materials i use are fairly inexpensive this same policy applies to shipping your merchandise the best way to hide is to look like your not doing anything wrong walk in looking pleasant but in a slight hurry its important not to look nervous make idle comments to random people in the lobby if you have to wait in line keep your conversation mundane and revealing be safe out there . great ill add it to the list what do i think its got no chance . honestly this sounds just like any other crap coin the list of benefits are impressive but mostly it just relates to things you could do with any crypto what im waiting for is a coin that causes actually untraceable transactions i had a theory about that a while back designing a crypto that you never send coins to anyone but rather to relay nodes that pass along requests and the coins are literally moved in random died up segments from other peoples wallets since the increments are standard its impossible to tell which slices belong to which transactions but i got far to much else on my plate to actually try and pull that off . rc everyone thanks a lot for your answer it gave me a lot of answers and very good ideas you are right maybe in thinking too much im so paranoid so ill keep that in mind if i could i ll give you karma man jajaja really you give me a lot of info and good ideas thanks man with all your answers i got a really good ideas and resolve of my problem thank you so much for everyone love this community . great ill add it to the list what do i think its got no chance . honestly this sounds just like any other crap coin the list of benefits

the increments are standard its impossible to tell which slices belong to which transactions but i got far to much else on my plate to actually try and pull that off . i think you are over thinking this i walk into post offices to purchase stamps postage all the time my normal non darknet routine involves me going into multiply portal locations frequently it does not look that unusual for someone to visit the post on a regular basis and purchase dozens of stamps at one time and do nothing else when you go to drop off your packages just act calm and normal man walk in with all of your packages in a box or a cloth bag to prevent you having to touch them while also avoiding looking odd for wearing gloves in the summer time for your drop you dont make eye contact with the cameras and wear a hat to make it harder to id you you just walk in dump your bag into the bin or casually pour them onto the counter for the po employee to handle from then then just walk out change up which post offices you ship out of and rotate your shipping days ie pick days per week that you will ship orders do all your prep early in the day when you can take your time and be very clean about packaging make a run to one of the post offices you use after a few months change your days up so if you were shipping say mon wed fir change it up to like tues fri sat or something like that change your appearance so its hard to identify you are the same person each time you make a drop changing your hat general attire slightly helps this go get a few outfits that are several sizes too large to use for this the loose clothing will further obscure your physical description it never looks odd for someone to be shipping packages from a post office people acting sketchy in a post office attracts attention just figure out a method that you are comfortable with and practice it hell send thank you cards or invitaitons to long lost friends or random people for a couple of runs until you get comfortable with your surroundings you may even consider continuing this process after you begin shipping your product as again it further obscures your intentions and provides a nice legit reason for you to be in the po so frequently the best of us out there understand that the most effective disguise is to hide in plain sight my domestic stealth is not the most advanced i have experienced but at the same time you would never guess my package is what it is without knowing in advance it looks just like any other random piece of mail i never use the same exact style of stealth for two drop runs in a row ie i have about different materials i use to make up my packages of those materials i can create up to around unique styles of stealth package all of them are very plain jane looking on the outside and flat plus the materials i use are fairly inexpensive this same policy applies to shipping your merchandise the best way to hide is to look like your not doing anything wrong walk in looking pleasant but in a slight hurry its important not to look nervous make idle comments to random people in the lobby if you have to wait in line keep your conversation mundane and revealing be safe out there . honestly this sounds just like any other crap coin the list of benefits are impressive but mostly it just relates to things you could do with any crypto what im waiting for is a coin that causes actually untraceable transactions i had a theory about that a while back designing a crypto that you never send coins to anyone but rather to relay nodes that pass along requests and the coins are literally moved in random died up segments from other peoples wallets since the increments are standard its impossible to tell which slices belong to which transactions but i got far to much else on my plate to actually try and pull that off . great ill add it to the list what do i think its got no chance . i think you are over thinking this i walk into post offices to purchase stamps

web quoteabout the coinanoncoin is mainly targeting to be used through the invisible internet i p and tor introducing another layer of security within the cryptocurrency markets by providing new coin features and services to build on top of these lets get on with the facts the coin can not be stopped by central banks or governments this is is achieved by decentralization combining the use of clearnet invisible web and services if the coin is being used on i p or tor there is no way to identify who is operating the nodes and clients this will in turn enable the production of new better anonymous services what if the coins are being traced in the blockchain coin mixer services operating through i p are in development to put a stop to coins being traced back to any one wallet or person these will make it possible to mix up coins you have received or mine by sending them to the mixer service coins sent there will be mixed with all other coins within the service before being sent to any address of your choosing what are the basin features of anoncoin there can be million coins in existence the first blocks are worth anc the blocks up to are worth anc the blocks from are worth and then subside halves blocks every years along with the exclusive features this should provide a long and healthy lifespan strength in numbers crypts services and users anoncoin will keep gaining its strength by the services offered and the numbers of users utilizing these services the coin is growing stronger every day and this gives us an excellent chance to further expand the invisible web services to all the users and anons already supporting the coin thank you clearnet alarm here are the bitcointalk official post do you know or think about this crypto any technical or any type advice issue or something good vibes .
