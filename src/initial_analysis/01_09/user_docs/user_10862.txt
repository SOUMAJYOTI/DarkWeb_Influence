for a very long time ive had a meta refresh with a html ended link as a countermeasure against mitm phishing onion cloner it redirects the user over to the correct site as the browser decodes the character but onion cloner did not lately i have been getting more users visiting through mitm phishing proxys again i investigated and found that it now rewrites html encoded characters to keep the browser on the wrong onion host so the meta refresh redirect trick above does not work any more i have written a very simple javascript that runs in the browser and checks if the correct host is used the correct hostname is base encoded inside the javascript and so far this is not written by the mitm proxy sites the base encoded string is then decided on browser side and if its not correct it will redirect over to the correct host if window location host atob yml ymxlbmrlcnzyzmt ci vbmlvbg window location host atob yml ymxlbmrlcnzyzmt ci vbmlvbg i am not encouraging to activate javascript in browsers but if the user has it activated i might as well use it for something good . for a very long time ive had a meta refresh with a html ended link as a countermeasure against mitm phishing onion

i implement something and then the mitm phishing pray guys write a replace script for that or whatever it is they do in february i wrote a small javascript and placed it on my site it was not in any way mandatory to run this javascript to access the site i am not promoting users to have javascript actuated in their browser but if it is actuated i thought i could use it for something good all it did was check if the correct url was used and if not then redirect to the correct one this has been working good and the number of phishing complaints went down but now months later a user complained about my javascript that he could not access my site when using high security settings in his browser i also found that the latest mitm phishing sites rewrites my javascript so its not effective anyways so its now removed as it does not work anymore against these phishing sites i might try to write a new javascript that is not blocked by mitm phishing proxys yet but before i put energy on that does anyone here have any objections against me having a javascript on my site that tries to protect users against mitm phishing sites as long as its not required to access and use the site those who use high security settings in browser can do so also implemented a watermark or what you call it inside the captcha image since february this has helped and i have not seen any mite phishing proxys that prevents it yet which is good anyone here with more ideas how to prevent the mitm phishing proxys to be effective against my site thanks . quote from bitblender on june pmhi i have a never

effective against my site thanksyou could possibly write another script which could solve the problem however this is a problem many users could simply solve themselves with a little due diligence on their part storing the correct url on an encrusted medium flash drive hard drive etc so they dont get wished when they want to tumble their coins is a common sense approach people have to take personal responsibility for their own actions instead of blaming others for their own misgivings if they dont have the correct uri saved they should be cross checking any url they have for bitblender with other imputable sites where it may be posted at the very least that means do not use the hidden wiki for any links ever . good reply hoof personal responsibility accountability is a must in this world to you .
