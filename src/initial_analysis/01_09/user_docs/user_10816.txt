quote from pax on april pmthis is very interesting but only increases my paranoia because not i have to worry about people listening to my typing in public too lolyou needn worry the odds of someone targeting you with a parabolic mic are slim to none furthermore if youre out in public they could just as easily watch what you type using a high powered scope thats why i always maintain that the best defense is anonymity if they dont know who you are they can not target you zaphod . i found this read from bruce scheiners blog rather interesting even though it is a few years old its not something give ever really seen discussed anywhere else snooping on text by listening to the keyboard research out of berkeley ed felten has a good summary li zhuang feng zhou and doug tygar have an interesting new paper showing that if you have an audit recording of somebody typing on an ordinary computer keyboard for fifteen minutes or so you can figure out everything they typed the idea is that different keys tend to make slightly different sounds and although you dont know in advance which keys make which sounds you can use machine learning to figure that out assuming that the person is mostly typing english text presumably it would work for other languages too read the rest the paper is on the web heres the abstract we examine the problem of keyboard acrostic emanations we present a novel attack taking as input a minute sound recording of a user typing english text using a keyboard and then recovering up to of type characters there is no need for a labelled training recording moreover the recognizer bootstrapped this way can even recognize random text such as passwords in our experiments of character random passwords using only letters can be generated in fewer than attempts by an adversary of character passwords can be generated in fewer than attempts our attack uses the statistical constraints of the underlying content english language to reconstruct text from sound recordings without any labelled training data the attack uses a combination of standard machine learning and speech recognition techniques including cepstrum features hidden markov models linear classification and feedback based incremental learning . i found this read from bruce scheiners blog rather interesting even though it is a few years old its not something give ever really seen

accelerometer a few years ago these are only in most modern touch screen phones their originally used to detect the orientation of the phone to flip the screen automatically orientation in gps and some games this application of pickup vibrations is limited to when the phone is on the same surface as the keyboard three letter agencies wouldnt sink much money into this but this new application of using the microphone to decifer keystrokes is a huge step towards to supreme mass surveilance they could theoretically sample all the keyboards in the world which wouldnt be so far fetched since most brands feel sound very similar they wouldnt even have to be exact with the words most of you guys have seen that email wehre letres not hvae to be in correct order to understand them very negative development indeed all phones picked more sound than one hears via the speaker on phones the more advanced phones seem to pickup a substantial amount of sound from the microphones compared to older models how many of you guys have a phone in a rather close proximity of your computer cellphone or landline most people can test whether or not your celllphone are vulnerable to these types of surveilance using a voice recording apt thats available on most modern phones would be one way or make a dummy phone call with another phone building or buying a friday enclosure google it for ones cell phone can make sure they arent able to monitor your keystrokes unless they were amazing and able to record offline keystrokes as well a person would have to be rather high on their ship list to receive that kind of treatment though totally possible though fun stuff . glad to see this being discussed most of us walk around with a very powerful microphone a cellphone ga tech researchers were
