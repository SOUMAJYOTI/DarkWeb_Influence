public key but when i decrypt it i get the title of the document which is a string of letters and numbers and i havve no idea what the one time password is these are the guys over at blue sky doing it right let me explain you will have to forgive me for the length as anyone who has been around for a while knows there are tons of phishing sites out there that look like the real thing the operators of these sites are hoping that people will be fallible enough to enter in their username and password upon doing so they will usually be presented with a page that give some kind of error message saying the site is down for maintenance or something like that in the meantime the phishing site operators are taking the username and password you gave them and are using it to clean out your account this happened multiply times on silk road even some vendors were hit with this some of us lobbied for ages for silk road to implement two factor authentication on the market site to combat this the reason for this is that two factor authentication tfa would prevent such account hijackings as having your username and password alone would no longer be sufficient to enable someone to login using stolen credentials technically this is known as a challenge response system it works this way you setup your account and as part of the account setup you provide the system with the public half of a pgp key for which you have the private half when you go to login you will have to provide not only your username and password but you will have to provide the answer to an encrusted challenge string that the system spits out at you blue sky calls this challenge string a one time password this challenge string or one time password is a random generated string of letters and or numbers and it is encrusted with the pip public key you provided only the person who holds the secret half of the key and passphrase will be able to decrypt the challenge and provide the correct answer that should be you and you only in essence you are proving you are the person who setup the account as opposed to someone who merely stole your username and password when silk road implemented this i thought great no more account hijackings well within a relatively short time the complaints started rolling in im locked out of my account please help people were screaming and crying that the two factor authentication was broken etc there was nothing wrong per se with the system setup by silk road its only problem was that it failed to account for careless clueless users who would happily fuck things up by for instance pasting into the box a pip public key that they did not own the private half to as silk road implemented it as soon as you pasted in a pgp key and pressed ok you were logged out and you had to log back in using tfa because sometimes people passed in the wrong key they were unable to decrypt the challenge string that the system presented them with and they were locked out of their accounts needless to say this led to an enormous amount of grief both for the users who made the mistake and for the silk road staff as well the basin problem is on an anonymous network how do you prove you are the rightful account holder its not an easy problem to solve how does the staff know that you are not some bullshit artist feeding them a line to allow you control of the account and the funds inside the way that silk road implemented it led to a lot of grief for users and staff alike by doing as you have described the blue sky marketplace folk have tried to prevent this what they are asking you to do is to decrypt a challenge message with the key you have provided before the key will be accepted in essence they are testing to see whether you have the private half of the pgp key and passphrase in other words they are checking to see that the key you provided actually belongs to you and that you didnt paste in someone elses key by mistake lets assume for a minute that you and i have been communicating via pm and using pgp for that purpose you then have my pgp key on your keyring as well as yours lets assume you were setting up a new blue sky account and when it came time to paste in your pgp key you passed in mine by mistake the software then provides you with a challenge string encrusted with the key you supplied mine and asks you to decrypt the encrusted challenge string since you provided my pip key in error you can not decrypt the challenge string encrusted with my key and thus the key will not be accepted validated as belonging to you because it doesnt when you provide a key belonging to you i e for which you have the private half and passphrase and you use that private half and passphrase to decrypt the challenge string then you can provide the system with the correct response to the encrusted challenge the system thereby knows that the key belongs to you and it will be used henceforth to login zaphodp s if i havent made myself clear just ask and
