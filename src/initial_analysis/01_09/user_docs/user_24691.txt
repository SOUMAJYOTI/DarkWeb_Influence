how to receive a packagematerials a sound mind a clean home and surroundings plausible deniabilitysteps use your sound mind to convince your sound body to clean your motherfucking house be sure that all contraband is safely put away have patience if your vendor is let and capable your package will arrive be nice to your mailman im not saying to should smoke a spliff or drink a beer with the mail carrier but you should waive and regularly meet your mailman before he reaches your mailbox should you find yourself outdoors during his or her delivery schedule mail carriers have hard jobs they deliver the mail in the rain snow scorching heat and often when they would rather be doing something else they also sort their route and prepare deliveries prior to doing their route they do it damn near every fucking day for decades sometimes the repetition use injuries these ladies and gentlemen suffer are many it used to be customary to tip your mail carrier during the holiday season this custom has died a slow and painful death i suggest hand writing a note that thanks your mail carrier during the holiday season you may wish to include a small tip no more than make it an amount that is appropriate for the neighborhood in which you live its a nice thing to do and you will rarely have your packages mishandled if you practice this religious if any of this is uncommon in your area or you have a personal beef with your mail carrier you may wish to avoid this step altogether it has worked for me for years if you are home when the package arrives do not rush to the mailbox let it sit unless you were expecting other non contraband items that were delivered on the same day i usually masturbate or have sex prior to checking my mail if in home when it arrives if thats not your thing consider doing some household chores like taking the trash out feeding your pets going to the market or cleaning the bathroom call a friend or family member and chat about whatever it is you chat about watch a movie your mailbox isnt going anywhere after a reasonable amount of time retrieve your mail and place your mail in the same place you always place your mail go through your mail in the same manner that you would process normal mail if its holiday season you may want to wrap that amazing goodness and place it under the tree as gift to yourself exercise self control the next section covers what to do in the event of a controlled delivery le are notoriously impatient unless you have been under surveillance for a long period of time resources are not wasted on small fish unless local le has been alerted to your activities this is unlikely unless you have been flapping your lips about your amazing hookup what to do in the event of a controlled delivery cd remain calm once you accept a package in a cd situation le will act quickly if the package was sent to someones house other than your own you should prepare them with a script do not abandon the people who manage your drops or they will abandon you occasionally le will wait until after you open the parcel to move on you other times le will apprehend and serve a warrant upon delivery remain calm you do not know what that is you do not know whoever the sender is you were just collecting and opening your mail you can not know the contents without first opening the item receiving contraband in the mail is not illegal knowingly receiving contraband in the mail is covertly illegal i dare any of you to send a ten strip to a police officer state official judge or politician anonymously report suspicious behavior by the individual you sent the ten strip to call the local tip line saying that you suspect this individual is having drugs sent to their home of course i am not really suggesting that anyone do this if you did you likely would never hear of it on your local news or read about it online or in local media i get mail everyday that i do not want junk mail bills wedding invitations other peoples mail done sweat being caught in what might seem to be a red handed circumstance you are innocent hopefully you have kept a clean house that is free of any contraband be polite no matter how upset angry and terrified you are remain calm recall how you survived the most terrifying trip you have ever had and still came out day capture this level of zen comply with any legitimate warrants do not be belligerent or threatening to anyone or yourself if you feel that your physical safety is at risk appeal to the most human le you can lock eyes with if ship gets really real cry out for heal from your neighbors there is no point in resisting their muscles are bigger than yours tazers suck and bullets are worse appreciate all of life including this moment you will live unless you have the misfortune of being in the company of a violent murderer politely ask specific questions if given the opportunity ask them why they are here ask them what you did wrong ask for a copy of the warrant and get the officer s names and badge numbers do it politely very politely if you look the part and le comments on your appearance you should attempt to gain the attention of any minority officers that may be present make eye contact without appearing threatening make a clever comment about how scared you would be if you were born of another ethnicity thank them for treating you with the respect and dignity that all humans deserve this may not work if you are a minority there are advantages to being caucasian or at least looking like most of of the people in your region in some regions of the world insist upon being present during a search ask that any animals children or innocents be removed from the current situation do it politely say nothing else until you request an attorney know your rights bail out and fight the good fight with a pitbull of an attorney that will poke holes in the case like the tennis balls he eats before breakfast until next time i love you all . edit i love the blond wig bitcoin shit it cracks me the fuck up unfortunately i will not be able to give you the specifics of my personal methods the tl dr version is that you will need to do some serious research make some friends be creative and occasionally pay a small premium for fiat currency you just came into a few thousand dollars worth of bitcoin and need some currency for for groceries gas toilet paper and festival tickets i usually write in a steps format when i do a how to i will attempt to keep with that format in this piece it may seem a little paragraphical at times due to the lack of explicit details the steps if you got the bitcoin from a dnm or from someone you suspect deals in dnms you must first wash this coin tumble and mix blond wig bitcoin tumblers are useful but they are also red flags for all legitimate bitcoin exchanges this data is available to le is easy to acquire and simple to understand do not go from point a to point b with your bitcoin send those dim coins to several different address through several random transactions illegitimate bitcoin exchanges will go out of business and take your money this isnt the old days self tumbling is the way to go you will need to find a bitcoin business that is legitimate allows you to deposit anonymously and allows you to withdraw your coins without consequence before sending your coins to this business you should spread them out to several addresses using a random number of stops before sending them to the bitcoin business deposit your quasi washed coins into the bitcoin business if you cant think of a bitcoin business that could accommodate your needs then you might consider starting one as a hobby you could provide a legitimate product or run a dummy site where you send your quasi washed coins setting up a dummy site is tough work for the unexperienced for the right person the result could be well worth the effort the business wallet should sufficiently mix your coins so that they are distinguishable from customer coins withdraw your bitcoins from the legitimate or dummy business to a legitimate exchange wallet that is fully verified with real identification from a real person or business move the fiat funds to the bank account associated with the exchange account a well shield individual may even have a merchant account with a bitin payment processor it might be wise to also accept credit cards and paypal do not attempt this without rock solid opsec and a clearly laid plan and back story that makes sense enjoy your money the complexity of this method will increase with the amount of funds that you need to move if you need to move hundreds of thousands or millions of eurus dollars pounds juan or yen in value you may need to consult a professional it is well worth the cost you may need the help of other people to pull this off while having the correct amount of separation from the process i wish that i could go into more detail but it would violate out of my rules of opsec im still working on the rules of opsec but rest assured that it will be written soon i will probably write a short piece on how to safely receive a package containing contraband until next time i love you all . i usually masturbate or have sex prior to checking my mail if in home when it arrives sage advice seriously though thanks for writing this up its a good

are two true accounts of people that might be behind bars today had they not had a plan and executed that plan to perfection story the story of jimjim had a job jeff also liked to provide substances to his friends and people that hed never met over the internet the time and place was nearly years ago and took place in anyhow us jim used to drive to mexico to smuggle his wares back to his hometown he was paying five or ten times less by taking this risk jim didnt have a family and was willing to roll the dice eventually jim met a man that was willing to bring his products back sometimes the products were left in a storage facility other times the products were failed to one of jeffs drops one shipment was taking forever and jim couldnt reach the man that supposed sent the products two weeks went by jim awoke from a nap by the sound of a loud knock at the door a portal inspector and some local narcotics officers were there to greet him they carried with them an opened parcel containing the items that jim was awaiting the drop was not at his house jim called his friend that was indeed his accomplice he called his friend while the adversaries were still present this friend we will call him mast reluctantly agreed to come by jeffs house matt entered jeffs home to witness a table strewn with all manner of contraband the street value would have totally more than matt remained calm matt spoke with the adversaries about how this contraband found its way to jeffs table ignorance was the conversation of the day the officers involved admitted to delivering it to jeffs home already opened matt was recording the conversation matt informed them that these items did not belong to either jeff or he the officers persisted but matt would not recant eventually mast agreed to work with the officers and attempt to contact the sender provided the officers would provide the contact information the pressure was too great to decline mast didnt want jeff to go to prison mast created an email account and pgp key that supposed belonged to the sender of the contraband he did this in his free time in the presence of the commanding officer matt would playfully email the fake email account asking for another order the fake email account would reply that they were looked and were going to take a break a month or so of this sort of interaction took place the commanding officer eventually gave up no charges were filed due to the nature of the delivery the package was opened and delivered to the wrong address matt and jeff hired an attorney at some point this attorney was well connected within the rank of the adversaries this may or may not have helped matt and jeff escape prosecution lessons never let them in without a warrant never abandon your friends that are helping you out never snatch be cool motherfucker story the story of chuckchuck was growing cannabis plants at his place of business these were discovered by the adversary chuck had been caught before and been to prison chuck was arrested and failed out chuck got a haircut continued to run his business and purchased some new clothes chuck joined the same church of the judge that would eventually hear his case chuck walked like the judge talked like the judge dressed like the judge and supported the church like the judge chuck sat nearby the judge during services chuck gave his testimony about how he turned his life around the judge didnt know anything about chuck other than what chuck showed him chucks court date came or so months later he was facing mandatory minimums the judge sentenced chuck to years probation and aa a meetings per week im not sure chuck found jesus but he definitely found his freedom sitting in a church next to a judge and endured many stories about jesus lessons never accept defeat do whatever is necessary to insure your freedom without snitching you may have to do what chuck did i love you all there is some wisdom to be gained from these stories read them before bed time you wish to fill in the details to make them more interesting or applicable to your situation these guys did illegal things and either werent charged or walked there is something to be learned here . quote from serioustripping on march pmnice stories how does matt give the officer the suppliers email address connected to the fake pgp key without admitting to knowing about the package to some degree matt was obviously the guy in charge he was called to the scene by jeff the adversaries gave matt the email address to operate as a confidential informatant the smuggler was aware of the situation this was a reverse sting designed to build charges against the smuggler im sorry this wasnt clear the threat was real and the people involved were young .
