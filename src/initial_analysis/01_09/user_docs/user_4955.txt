good reason otherwise . lol but yet tguk did exit scam not only did he run with everyones coins he threatened to release the dox for all his customers and he did all this because he couldnt keep up the competition that he started with jor . i was slammed a few hundred blotters or so from him about a year ago or so never missed with him again i like things that are lukewarm as opposed to scolding hot . it was clear tguk was heading for an exit scam not only was his track record appalling anyway he definitely practiced detective scamming but he also suddenly put up ridiculous amounts of suspiciously large listings he was ultimately much more interested in making money than in maintaining his pride and integrity as one of the largest lsd wholesalers his surname love of top gear attest to his materialist attitude and lifestyle he undoubtedly loves his cars more than his customers i never bought acid off tguk nor did i desire to enrich him in any way despite him having been on the dnms for ages precisely because i did not trust him and suspected his attitude sorry to hear that some people fell to his exit scam its not nice being so unlucky im glad that hes off the dnms for now

vendor has to leave country leave state ditch everything they know one of their op partners could mean the whole operation under that name and area is gone theres so many situations that are typical he vendor is gone for their safety and the amount of real life repercussions the slammed amount will never really ever heal but at least serve as a small cushion if it even happens though market scams giving scammer customers free refunds so they can fuck off because i swear customers on a new vendor are just like that south park episode where they re like oh but im a yelp reviewer its like a customer messaging you like oh im a reddit reviewer the inclined hostility is so real yes just stretch me out and fuck me in the ass because when are you not going to comply when its your permanent rating on the line many vendors are victim to scammers in the opening of their career for the sake of saving their rating and not making all their work useless it sure sucks to lose or the orders the many many of them ive never gotten but i bet its a lot worse to be running for your life or your k you have sitting on a market as a vendor . quote from dancesuite on february ami was slammed a few
