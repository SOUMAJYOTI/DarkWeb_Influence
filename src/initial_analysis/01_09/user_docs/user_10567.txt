well it is no longer a question of can they do it yes the nsa can de anonymize the tor network the real question is have you sucked up bad enough to get on their radar the good news is they still have to maintain the veil of legality the nsa charter clearly specifies they are not allowed to spy on americans since it is tor the nsa can always say we didnt know if they were american citizens or not another question people fail to ask themselves is how many years has the nsa and fbi built and owned their own tor nodes they have had years to study tor traffic now combine this with advanced correlation attacks and that cas article and peta byte processors and yeah were sucked the bottom line is as automatic algorythims advance more and more what used to be insurmountable for the human

company that announced its findings monday kaspersky did not implicitly name from which country or intelligence agency the spying software was found but former operatives from the nsa confirmed that the findings corrected with asa activity reuters reported the nsa s spyware lies within drives manufactured by western digital and seagate who deny that they had any knowledge of such programs samsung

labkaspersky said that pcs in different countries were infected by the most advanced hacking operation ever uncovered with the most in iran russia parisian afghanistan and china the nsa has a number of ways in which it can obtain the drives source code which it requires to embed the spyware the asa s methods include posing as software companies or asking for it directly reuters reported the government can also request it for a security audit from manufacturers who wish to sell hard drives to the department of defense and then use it to infect the manufacturer s products the nsa also would intercept failed items such as cds or us drives to infect them according to a report from ars technica the infections also affect iphones and other apple products the nsa is targeting a number of organizations including government and military offices telecommunication energy and media companies as well as unclean research facilities and slavic activists institutions with infected hard

it is profitable to mine with gpus for now schlangemann is it really profitable to mine how much did you make i tried mining bitcoins some time ago but to no end my computer was slow as hell and worked non stop with no profit in sight as far as i have read you must have brutal hardware to make some profit out of it at least with btc ether could be another story . etherium and ether as its currency is called is something much bigger than bitcoin and differs in many technical ways for example etherium has its own programming language solidity which is turing complete whereas bitcoin is using the stack based language script for its transactions with solidity you can build your own distributed applications apps for example cryptocurrencies virtual democracies casinos etc every computation on the network however cost gas this is where ether enters the picture the fee in ethers is calculated by the required gas the gas price because of this it is unlikely that the price of ethers will skyrocket the way it did with bitcoins so while etherium isnt directly competing with bitcoin its gaining a lot of support and popularity even microsoft is investing and building systems that translate common programming languages such as visual basic into solidity oded smart contracts in that aspect you can say that it brings competition to all the existing cryptocurrencies . ether isnt a currency but like most things in life if there is a need and demand for it then itll be used regardless i dont believe any of us have an understanding just how powerful the ethereum network will become in the next chapter of the digital age those that were part of the ipo will do well in the long run and there is no reason why ether cant match btc for price in a few years there are issues with it but bitcoin has worse issues a lot hinges on the dao and what they do with the m already raised if it makes good on its promises then ether will become a household name at least in cryptocurrency circles . etherium and ether as its currency is called is something much bigger than bitcoin and differs in many technical ways for example etherium has its own programming language

they will stay accused on bitcoin for a while we need to stay a step ahead th seems that choice anyone care to weigh in on what i say bitcoin fits the needs of today as long a bip can be intreated th and btc can co exist just look at the last hours on the markets btc goes up so does eth and dao th isnt here to replace btc far from it eths roadmap in comparision has loftier ambitions those that can bend it to the deep web now will be a good position in a few years there is already a developer working on a clearnet p p marketplace using the ethereum network and i cant see it being long before multiply teams bring it below the surface like the one aforementioned what eth can provide will blow your mind if you let it its like going back to the late s and someone trying to explain btc to you and all its capabilities its hard to contemplate . quote from dillis on june pmquote from schlangemann on may amand it is profitable to mine with gpus for now schlangemann is it really profitable to

ethereum based darknet market bitcoin based darknet markets probably fair open source and enforced via smart contract proprietary system unknown quality deposits ongoing escrow are protected via smart contract deposits ongoing escrow are at risk no central server operations are handled by anonymous shareholders central server connecting and management expose organizationby using smart contracts the vendor or customer funds are never under the control of the operators or shareholders vendor and customer funds are held by individual smart contracts while the order is in progress the contract releases the funds only under one of three conditions either the order completes by the customer acknowledging the product arrived timeout reached or the moderators are asked to rule on a conflict otherwise the the funds are sent back to the customer orders in conflict will always be handled by two to three moderators the two random selected moderators must come to unanimous decision or a third random selected moderator is introduced to a break tie theres also a teach area that does a deep dive on the technology behind the currency im a little toasted on both sides but i want to echoes some holographic past string show i believe if eth is used for nefarious purposes the kid is going to jail the endorsers wont have any of it and completely operate with eyes and such ledgers tying in all kinds of revenue for the opposition if th becomes a currency for the deep markets then the ethereum foundation will behind closed doors be pretty happy due to more positive publicity its current riding a high usd and also in the media any publicity is good publicity the foundation doesnt really want price increase and their core dev openly said the price is already too high they want adoption check out dr gavin wood who with rid singularity he was on the original ethereum team and the more understanding people have of ethereum the more its hard to deny that it could be the biggest thing to hit the internet in years if you do have in interest in sidechain cryptos id recommend reading up on maidsafecoin which is a decentralised storage network as is sirloin . heres a good overview and
