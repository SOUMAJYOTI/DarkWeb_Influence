at us we are hiding on darknet forums not daring to talk about our interests in public separating us even further from the average non drug user making it harder to change the public opinion its a vicious circle wow well put i totally agree there in fact this went through my head a number of times why are we hiding if we want to convince the public at mass we need to come out right and speak the truth hiding out just makes us look more devious and corrupt like we are just a bunch of scheming drug peddlers handing out led coated lolipopsto little children now envision krusty the clown handing out lolipops to kids hehehehehe come here little boy have a nice little caaaaaaaaaaaaandy muahahahaha and yeah that is literally what the average parent thinks when you say led or any other implicit drug for that matter or they see a picture of the negative condition caused by drugs like crack cocaine heroin meth etc homeless people strung out which is often very real the problem with this perception is that it is seen as the majority when in fact it is a minority most people who use drugs are not strung out hobos sprawled in the streets many are passionate hard working folks who make great contributions to society and for the folks who are severely compromise by drugs look at where they already are look at who targets them its pretty obvious that the ones who fall to drugs are already weak ignorant and dis satisfied with their lives looking for some type of escape we all need to set that straight we all need to show the world who we are that we are living proof that completely contradicts all of the preconceived and programme beliefs about how evil drugs are sometimes i wonder if the prohibition folks were to meet us or see these threads what they would think whether it would wake them up to realize that yes we can self medicate in a controlled manner and function and actually be more productive creative humans perhaps it would be a surprise to many of them that indeed there are members of our society who use various drugs to enhance their lives many of them are people that we rely on or have benefited from their work in some way now i am not going to say one drug is better than another but from evidence it is clear that when the media le and legislators point to social dysfunction caused by illicit drugs they are with certainty referring to the effects of drugs like crack heroin meth etc not weed or psychedelics but when they talk about drugs it dont matter they all get jumped into the same category labelled with the same stigmas but i dont have an answer to this i feel like im just rambling on here we want freedom right then whether drug a is worse than b is not the issue the issue is we have imprisoned ourselves in our own cages made up of written laws that dicatate how we should live that define what is acceptable but with no gradients no rational differentiation between extremes the law is such that it can not see the individual or the circumstances surrounding on another note it really sucks that the sr forums are down they served as a history of many peoples lives and shared experiences it was a great point of reference a catalogue of memories and friendships built and it definatelyshowed the intelligience of the community if anyone were to read through the forums its pretty clear that most are sensible thoughtful caring rational people far from the picture the media would like to project so have you all any thoughts on how we might shake the populace show them that most of the illicit drugs are not worse or more destructive than alcohol and tobacco perhaps we should all start clearnetting our drug use and tell family and friends write it on our shirts in big bold letters im on lsd right now while pumping gas and running errands around town hahaha perhaps we shoud also be flooding congress and local officials en masse i can almost be assured that if the majority of society really got it saw the truth when they saw that a very very large number of functioning educated people smoke weed chillax after work that many lawyers doctors even police and legislators bump lines of coke throughout the day the fucking truth that many musicicans and artists drop acid once in a while and these are all members of our society that we see everyday greet on the street chat with in subways and cafes work with etc and maybe maybe just maybe then they will start to see it that its not a black and white closed case issue that drugs any drugs natural or man made will always play a role in society and maybe then they will seethat drug abuse is a case by case person to person problem that itis a public health concern not a criminal issue that we need to reform policy and shift the cause to education and harm reduction i never thought silk road was a great thing i saw allot of ignorant people there too and i also saw alot of greed vendors and staff its not all beachy clean no but what i did see was a safe means to communicate and get solid information and very good pure drugs if silk road and the other markets were sooooooooooooooo bad and so evil then why has crime and murder gone up in the us why are there not droves up people all fucked up on drugs everywhere where are that not acid freakouts and suicides and people jumping out of buildings because they think they can fly all over the place yes there have been recently a small rise in some lsd folly re related accidents and deaths big whoop when compared to the numbers of people who are actually using and benefiting from these drugs every day insignificant small numbers its about the same number as the one guy girl in the bar who falls off her bar stool every week it happens but not often most people have respect most people know what they are getting into and know their limits its an insult to humanity that we have to make laws that brainwash everyone into believing people cant think for themselves cant make moral decisions its so sad and puh leeeeeeeeze stfu all you hypocrites fools who ate tons of drugs in your youth and now stomp around the podium slamming gavels like a bunch of shiny zealots because your hair is greying and

repeated them anyway for what it s worth agora is keeping their shit much tighter together no unnecessary rambling no public exposure tightly knit team just doing their thing not saying that it won t be the one to fall next but at least the complaint won t be so painful to read seriously signing up for your drug empire hosting with a personal fucking email not that people here need it but take take this as a reminder to stay safe and never trust the markets to do anything for you pgp is there to protect you exactly in the event of a hostile takeover hopefully there will be a time when we don t need to do what we do in hiding but that time is far from now . while im actually thinking about throwing my cents in the discussion here right now i am more worried about that will happen to agora did the website get sized during the time the last sr was shut down or did it manage to stay hidden give heard people praise it as being quite safe but how safe do you guys think it is safe in terms of not getting your orders messed up because the website was closed while the btc were in escrow and the order wasnt shipped yet . it s not going well at the moment so i would not be surprised

are hiding on darknet forums not daring to talk about our interests in public separating us even further from the average non drug user making it harder to change the public opinion it s a vicious circle wow well put i totally agree there in fact this went through my head a number of times why are we hiding if we want to convince the public at mass we need to come out right and speak the truth hiding out just makes us look more devious and corrupt like we are just a bunch of scheming drug peddlers handing out led coated lolipopsto little children now envision krusty the clown handing out lolipops to kids hehehehehe come here little boy have a nice little caaaaaaaaaaaaandy muahahahaha and yeah that is literally what the average parent thinks when you say led or any other implicit drug for that matter or they see a picture of the negative condition caused by drugs like crack butt plugs heroin met etc homeless people strung out which is often very real the problem with this perception is that it is seen as the majority when in fact it is a minority most people who use drugs are not strung out hobos sprawled in the streets many are passionate hard working folks who make great contributions to society and for the folks who are severely compromise by drugs look at where they already are look at who targets them it s pretty obvious that the one s who fall to drugs are already weak ignorant and dis satisfied with their lives looking for some type of escape we all need to set that straight we all need to show the world who we are that we are living proof that completely contradicts all of the preconceived and programme beliefs about how evil drugs are sometimes i wonder if the prohibition folks were to meet us or see these threads what they would think whether it would wake them up to realize that yes we can self medicate in a controlled manner and function and actually be more productive creative humans perhaps it would be a surprise to many of them that indeed there are members of our society who use various drugs to enhance their lives many of them are people that we rely on or have benefited from their work in some way now i am not going to say one drug is better than another but from evidence it is clear that when the media le and legislators point to social dysfunction caused by illicit drugs they are with certainty referring to the effects of drugs like crack heroin meth etc not weed or psychedelics but when they talk about drugs it don t matter they all get jumped into the same category labelled with the same stigmas but i don t have an answer to this i feel like i m just rambling on here we want freedom right then whether drug a is worse than b is not the issue the issue is we have imprisoned ourselves in our own cages made up of written laws that dicatate how we should live that define what is acceptable but with no gradients no rational differentiation between extremes the law is such that it can not see the individual or the circumstances surrounding on another note it really sucks that the sr forums are down they served as a history of many peoples lives and shared experiences it was a great point of reference a catalogue of memories and friendships built and it definatelyshowed the intelligience of the community if anyone were to read through the forums it s pretty clear that most are sensible thoughtful caring rational people far from the picture the media would like to project so have you all any thoughts on how we might shake the populace show them that most of the illicit drugs are not worse or more destructive than alcohol and tobacco perhaps we should all start clearnetting our drug use and tell family and friends write it on our shirts in big bold letters i m on lsd right now while pumping gas and running errands around town hahaha perhaps we shoud also be flooding congress and local officials en masse i can almost be assured that if the majority of society really got it saw the truth when they saw that a very very large number of functioning educated people smoke weed chillax after work that many lawyers doctors even police and legislators bump lines of coke throughout the day the fucking truth that many musicicans and artists drop acid once in a while and these are all members of our society that we see everyday greet on the street chat with in subways and cafes work with etc and maybe maybe just maybe then they will start to see it that it s not a black and white closed case issue that drugs any drugs natural or man made will always play a role in society and maybe then they will seethat drug abuse is a case by case person to person problem that itis a public health concern not a criminal issue that we need to reform policy and shift the cause to education and harm reduction i never thought silk road was a great thing i saw allot of ignorant people there too and i also saw alot of greed vendors and staff it s not all beachy clean no but what i did see was a safe means to communicate and get solid information and very good pure drugs if silk road and the other markets were sooooooooooooooo bad and so evil then why has crime and murder gone up in the us why are there not droves up people all fucked up on drugs everywhere where are that not acid freakouts and suicides and people jumping out of buildings because they think they can fly all over the place yes there have been recently a small rise in some lsd folly re related accidents and deaths big whoop when compared to the numbers of people who are actually using and benefiting from these drugs every day insignificant small numbers it s about the same number as the one guy girl in the bar who falls off her bar stool every week it happens but not often most people have respect most people know what they are getting into and know their limits it s an insult to humanity that we have to make laws that brainwash everyone into believing people can t think for themselves can t make moral decisions it s so sad and puh leeeeeeeeze stfu all you hypocrites fools who ate tons of drugs in your youth and now stomp around the podium slamming gavels like a bunch of shiny zealots because your hair is greying and viagra is expensive awwwwww too fucking bad you don t want your children to overdose because because what you had a good time and we can t ahhhhhhhhhh i am exhausted now whew quote from magicmountain on november amtalking about the war on drugs and its victims is not appropriate here this guy knew the risks and wanted to make a whole lot of money he s definitely not one of those poor innocent victims of the war on drugs i mean think of central america a whole society is affected by the war on drugs and often times the people involved don t have the set of choices this guy had very true yeah this guy is a smart white middle class silicone valley hipster i still don t see why he should get life in prison that s not right i m sure the gov t will be using him for silk road ok so again folks chime in what s the next step where do we go where do we go now sweeeeeeeeeeeet child o h mine where do we go . to you tostitosfor informing us wow its still
