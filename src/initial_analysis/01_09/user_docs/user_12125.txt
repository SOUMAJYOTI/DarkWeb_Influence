the darknet we can not go into too much detail about how we do this but you can be assured that you will never receive tainted coins the coins we send you will be completely related to the coins you sent us even if we ever had to mix our dirty coins with the clean coins we use a combination of old school mixing techniques combined with advanced scripts to make sure you would still receive clean coins there will always be taint we wash all of our dirty coins before they even touch the clean coins so even if our mixing pool runs low and we have to transfer coins you will still not receive dirty coins again we continuously have a steady flow of new coins coming in through other businesses so i can confidently say that our mixing pool will never run low and we will never have to mix dirty coins with clean coins but if we do you can be assured that you will never receive tainted coins we keep your bitcoin in cold storage to prevent hackers from stealing them it takes around hours for transactions to go through after you withdraw them this is because we have to mutually allow the coins to be withdrawn we also review the pending withdrawals and if we notice anything unusual we can check to make sure that the user really deposited those coins that way even if the server is somehow hacked your coins are safe nobody will be able to generate fake transactions to steal your coins combining these two methods means it is almost impossible for us to lose your money if get hacked this is only for mixing our reload pack withdrawals are instant in the future we will be adding an auto withdrawal service for smaller amounts so you dont have to wait for bitin withdrawals we do store logs temporarily for troubleshooting purposes we purge all logs after weeks be advised that we will never reveal these logs to any third parties you should always create partition of trust by using another mixing service in addition to ours our fees are very low and we will keep them that way that way even if we are a honeypot and turn out to be logging you will still be safe we do not store in logs our server is on tor and it only shows connections from localhost fees we charge a fee on all deposits the fee is randomized each time we started this service anonymously to prevent shutting down under pressure from law enforcement we dont require any personally identifiable information we
