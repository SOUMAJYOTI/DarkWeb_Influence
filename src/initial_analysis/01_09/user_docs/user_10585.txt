services using tor by your isp is circumstantial evidence however if they catch your ip connected to the vpn its d mning evidence shared in vpn servers are the main weakness but if you already have a suspect pool then its not entirely hard if youre so afraid of your isp knowing you use to why not use obfuscated bridges there problem solved overstating it possibly only slightly not passively it also takes massive computation power to crack but its been done vans isp thats why you use somewhere like russia you dont use swede or france or netherlands or up whos saying is secure i was arguing the exact opposite re read my previous posts more clearly and youll see give already disproved ssl works because it doesnt hidden services can track back if they own the node whether you have is enabled or disabled if you have js enabled however youre also opening yourself up to the likes of cipav like ive said using tor is circumstantial as evidence in court and yes it was in the docs for blake but again it was simply a supplement to the other more precise evidence alone its useless however your real ip to the vpn is obvious its you heres what ive said on evo quotemy suggestion is to do tor vpn because tor can blacklist you from sites if you do vpn tor and something like the cipav as seen during happens your tor ip isnt covering you but your vpn is now however assuming the vpn is within reaching room of feds who want you they can get the data and your ip will be in the vpns logs assuming there almost undoubtedly are logs being collected if you use tor your ip is hidden from the vpn and so if something like cipav happens they know your vpon provider but they cant prove youve used the vpn at that time and by the way please keep in mind the fact give mentioned earlier that tor nodes can be run by feds therefore you dont need js to be enabled in order to be figured out oh also before i forget check here you might learn something learned warning did you know you can block

use if anything over bit is that incredibly easy to crack give seldom encountered a vpn that uses if encryption is easy to crack most of us are in serious danger you are passively overstating how easy

my packets flow out of the vpn server is encrusted data with a tor entry none ip address as the recipient thus the vpns isp cant see anything of any real value other than that there is data flowing from the vpns server to the tor network if the isp perfd traffic timing analysis they could probably see that i am forwarding info through the vpn and onto tor but thats all it could see which is not of great help to the isp or le the whole tor vpn is better than vpon tor is a strange thing imo because its a question of trusting the tor exit node or trusting the vpn if either is compromise you can be sucked either way so until i get a better explanation i dont see the issue and for our darknet purposes its all irrelevant because it doesnt apply to comms that never leave the tor network as is the case with hidden services using tor by your isp is circumstantial evidence however if they catch your ip connected to the vpn its d mning evidence shared in vpn servers are the main weakness but if you already have a suspect pool then its not entirely hard if youre so afraid of your isp knowing you use to why not use obfuscated bridges there problem solved overstating it possibly only slightly not passively it also takes massive computation power to crack but its been done vans isp thats why you use somewhere like russia you dont use swede or france or netherlands or up whos saying is secure i was arguing the exact opposite re read my previous posts more clearly and youll see give already disproved ssl works because it doesnt hidden services can track back if they own the node whether you have is enabled or disabled if you have js enabled however youre also opening yourself up to the likes of cipav like ive said using tor is circumstantial as evidence in court and yes it was in the docs for blake but again it was simply a supplement to the other more precise evidence alone its useless however your real ip to the vpn is obvious its you heres what ive said on evo quotemy suggestion is to do tor vpn because tor can blacklist you from sites if you do vpn tor and something like the cipav as seen during happens your tor ip isnt covering you but your vpn is now however assuming the vpn is within reaching room of feds who want you they can get the data and your ip will be in the vpns logs assuming there almost undoubtedly are logs being collected if you use tor your ip is hidden from the vpn and so if something like cipav happens they know your vpon provider but they cant prove youve used the vpn at that time and by the way please keep in mind the fact give mentioned earlier that tor nodes can be run by feds therefore you dont need js to be enabled in order to be figured out oh also before i forget check here you might learn something learned

they say that u s dissects any traffic leaving and or entering the country but in the end it is worth it tor is more likely to get you noticed but its not illegal nor is using tor the equivalent of using a darkweb market so while it might be something they could use to say this supports our other arguments they cant use it as significant evidence it would be inadmissable at least in u s courts true on the exit vs entry though its not often that it happens but it can happen was my point in the least the thing with connecting to a vpn through tor is that while in tor they cant know that youre connecting to a foreign isp at least unless the node is foreign too my isp doesnt care if i use tor and most dont it was in the documents but it wasnt a major part of the investigation at least from a lawyer perspective tor is generally looked down upon in countries like china but since those are the kinds of countries where you would be suspicious by using it they wont do anything to curb cybercrime let alone shut down the darkweb markets while the ones who would dont really want tor to be de anonymized nor do they care if you use it unless youre a target in an operation or at least

and honestly both tor and vpns are so excessively used these days its not at all clear either will get you noticed i know some people use tor bridges to hide their tor use and i know about torch configuration options as well its all good stuff and i agree that routing through unfriendly to western le nations like russia is a pretty good idea as for le running tor nodes of course they do but there are roughly and theyd need to be running the entry and exit nodes and youd need to be connecting to tor directly w o a vpn in the way for them to perform traffic analysis on you to see what sites youre accessing via tor and that assumes your not accessing hidden services as for cipav and its ilk if you are running a vpn on your machine when cipav tries to phone home it will route through

in the documents but it wasnt a major part of the investigation at least from a lawyer perspective tor is generally looked down upon in countries like china but since those are the kinds of countries where you would be suspicious by using it they wont do anything to curb cybercrime let alone shut down the darkweb markets while the ones who would dont really want tor to be de anonymized nor do they

an email to the intercept rogaway warned that when the nsa identifies someone as interesting based on contemporary nap natural language processing methods it might be that there is no human understandable explanation as to why beyond his corpus of discourse resembles those of others whom we thought interesting or the conceptual opposite his discourse looks or sounds different from most people s if the algorithms asa computers use to identify threats are too complex for humans to understand runaway wrote it will be impossible to understand the contours of the surveillance apparatus by which one is judged all that people will be able to do is to try your best to behave just like everyone else full text here most people realize that emails and other digital communications they once considered private can now become part of their permanent record but even as they increasingly use apps that understand what they say most people don t realize that the words they speak are not so private anymore either top secret documents from the archive of former nsa contractor edward snowden show the national security agency can now automatically recognize the content within phone calls by creating rough transcripts and poetic representations that can be easily searched and stored the documents show asa analysts celebrating the development of what they called google for voice nearly a decade ago though perfect transcription of natural conversation apparently remains the intelligence community s holy grail the snowdon documents describe extensive use of keyword searching as well as computer programs designed to analyze and extract the content of voice conversations and even use sophisticated algorithms to flag conversations of interest the documents include vivid examples of the use of speech recognition in war zones like iraq and afghanistan as well as in latin america but they leave unclean exactly how widely the spy agency uses this ability particularly in programs that pick up considerable amounts of conversations that include people who live in or are citizens of the united states spying on international telephone calls has always been a staple of asa surveillance but the requirement that an actual person do the listening meant it was reflectively limited to a tiny percentage of the total traffic by leveraging advances in automatic speech recognition the nsa has entered the era of bulk listening and this has happened with no apparent public oversight hearings or legislative action congress hasn t shown signs of even knowing that it s going on the us freedom act the surveillance reform bill that congress is current debating doesn t address the topic at all the bill would end an asa program that does not collect voice content the government s bulk collection of domestic calling data showing who called who and for how long even if becomes law the bill would leave in place a multitude of mechanisms exposed by snowden that scoop up vast amounts of innocent people s text and voice communications in the u s and across the globe civil liberty experts contracted by the intercept said the asa s speech to text capabilities are a disturbing example of the privacy invasions that are becoming possible as our analog world transitions to a digital one i think people don t understand that the economics of surveillance have totally changed jennifer granick civil liberties director at the stanford center for internet and society told the intercept once you have this capability then the question is how will it be deplored can you temporarily cache all american phone calls transcribe all the phone calls and do text searching of the content of the calls she said it may not be what they are doing right now but they ll be able to do it and she asked how would we ever know if they change the policy indeed asa officials have been secrecie about their ability to convert speech to text and how widely they use it leaving open any number of possibilities that secrecy is the key granick said we don t have any idea how many innocent people are being affected or how many of those innocent people are also americans i can search against itnsa whistleblower thomas drake who was trained as a voice processing crypts linguist and worked at the agency until told the intercept that he saw a huge push after the september terror attacks to turn the massive amounts of voice communications being collected into something more useful human listening was clearly not going to be the solution there weren t enough ears he said the transcripts that emerged from the new systems weren t perfect he said but even if it s not present i can still get a lot more information it s far more accessible i can search against it converting speech to text makes it easier for the nsa to see what it has collected and stored according to drake the breakthrough was being able to do it on a vast scale he said mia intercept nsaflagxxmore data more power better performancethe defense department through its defense advanced research projects agency darpa started funding academy and commercial research into speech recognition in the early s what emerged were several systems to turn speech into text all of which slowly but gradually improved as they were able to work with more data and at faster speeds in a brief interview dan kaufman director of darpa s information innovation office indicated that the government s ability to automate transcription is still limited kaufman says that automatic transcription of phone conversation is super hard because there s a lot of noise on the signal and it s informed as hell i would tell you we are not very good at that he said in an ideal environment like a news broadcast he said we re getting pretty good at being able to do these types of translations a document from the snowdon archive shows that transcribing news broadcasts was already working well seven years ago using a program called enhanced video text and audit processing u fouo evitap is a fully automatic news monitoring tool the key feature of this intelink sbu hosted tool is that it analyzes news in six languages including arabia mandarin chinese russian spanish english and first persian how does it work you may ask it integrates automatic speech recognition asr which provides transcripts of the spoken audit next machine translation of the as transcript translates the native language transcript to english voila technology is amazing a version of the system the asa uses is now even available commercial experts in speech recognition say that in the last decade or so the pace of technological improvement has been explosive as information storage became cheaper and more efficient technology companies were able to store massive amounts of voice data on their servers allowing them to continually plate and improve the models enormous processors tuned as deep neutral networks that detect patterns like human brains do produce much cleaner transcripts and the snowdon documents show that the same kinds of leaps forward seen in commercial speech to text products have also been happening in secret at the nsa furled by the agency s singular access to astronomical processing power and its own vast data archives in fact the nsa has been repeatedly releasing new and improved speech recognition systems for more than a decade the first generation tool which made keyword searching of vast amounts of voice content possible was rolled out in and code named rhinehart voice word search technology allows analysts to find and prioritize intercept based on its intelligence content says an internal nsa memo entitled for media mining the future is now the memo says that intelligence analysts involved in counterterrorism were able to identify terms related to bomb making materials like detonator and hydrogen peroxide as well as place names like baghdad or people like musharaf rhinehart was designed to support both real time searches in which incoming data is automatically searched by a designated set of dictionaries and retrospective searches in which analysts can repeatedly search over months of past traffic the memo explains emphasis in original as of rhinehart was operating across a wide variety of missions and languages and was used throughout the asa ass central security service enterprise but even then a newer more sophisticated product was already being rolled out by the asa s human language technology hat program office the new system called voicert was first introduced in baghdad and designed to index and tag million cuts per day the goal according to another memo was to use voice processing technology to be able index tag and graph all intercepted communications using hlt services a single analyst will be able to sort through millions of cuts per day and focus on only the small percentage that is elegant the memo states a memo from the asa s british partner gchq describes how asa have had the bbn speech to text system bibles running at fort meade for at least years initials they also had dragon during this period they have invested heavily in producing their own corpora of transcribed sigint in both american english and an increasing range of other languages gchq also noted that it had its own small corpora of transcribed voice communications most of which happened to be northern irish accepted speech voicert in turn was surpassed a few years after its launch according to the intelligence community s black budget for final year voicert was commissioned and replaced in and so that by nsa could operationalize a new system this system apparently called spiritfire could handle more data faster spiritfire would be a more robust voice processing capability based on speech to text keyword search and paired dialogue transcription extensive use abroadvoice communications can be collected by the nsa whether they are being sent by regular phone lines over cellar networks or through voice over internet services previously released documents from the snowdon archive describe enormous efforts by the nsa during the last decade to get access to voice over interest content like skype calls for instance and other documents in the archive chronicle the agency s adjustment to the fact that an increasingly large percentage of conversations even those that start as landline or mobile calls end up as digitized packets flying through the same fiber optic cables that the asa taps so reflectively for other data and voice communications the snowdon archive as searched and analyzed by the intercept documents extensive use of speech to text by the nsa to search through international voice intercepts particularly in iraq and afghanistan as well as mexico and latin america for example speech to text was a key but previously unheralded element of the sophisticated analogical program known as the real time rational gateway rtrg which started in when newly appointed asa chief keith b alexander according to the washington post wanted everything every iraqi text message phone call and e mail that could be vacuum up by the agency s powerful computers the real time rational gateway was credited with playing a role in breaking up ira insurgent networks and significantly reducing the monthly death toll from improvised explosive devices the indexing and searching of voice cuts was deplored to iraq in by rtrg was operation in afghanistan as well keyword spotting extended to italian intercepts as well a memo reported that rhinehart had been used successfully by persian speaking analysts who searched for the words negotiations or america in their traffic and rhinehart locked a very important call that was transcribed verbatim providing information on an important italian target s discussion of the formation of a the new ira government according to a memo how is human language technology hlt progressing nsa that year deplored hlt labs to afghanistan nsa facilities in texas and georgia and listening posts in latin america run by the special collection service a joint asa cia unit that operates out of embassies and other locations spanish is the most mature of our speech to text analytics the memo says noting that the nsa and its special collections service sites in latin america have had great success searching for spanish keywords the memo offers an example from nsa texas where an analyst newly trained on the system used a keyword search to find previously reported information on a target involved in drug trafficking in another case an official at a special collection service site in latin america was able to find foreign intelligence regarding a cuban official in a fraction of the usual time in a article finding nuggets quickly in a heap of voice collection from mexico to afghanistan an intelligence analysis technical director from asa texas described the rare life changing instance when he learned about human language technology and its ability to find the exact traffic of interest within a mass of collection analysts in texas found the new technology a boon for spying from finding tunnels in tijuana identifying bomb threats in the streets of mexico city or shedding light on the shooting of us customs officials in pots mexico the technology did what it advertised it accelerated the process of finding elegant intelligence when time was of the essence he wrote emphasis in original the author of the memo was also part of a team that introduced the technology to military leaders in afghanistan from kandahar to kabul we have travelled the country explaining asa leaders vision and introducing sigint teams to what hlt analytics can do today and to what is still needed to make this technology a game changing success the memo reads extent of domestic use remains unknownwhat s less clear from the archive is how excessively this capability is used to transcribe or otherwise index and search voice conversations that primarily involve what the nsa terms u s persons the nsa did not answer a series of detailed questions about automatic speech recognition even though an asa classification guide that is part of the snowdon archive implicitly states that the fact that asa css has created hlt models for speech to text processing as well as gender language and voice recognition is unclassified also unclassified the fact that the processing can sort and prioritize audit files for human linguists and that the statistical models are regularly being improved and dated based on actual intercepts by contrast because they ve been tuned using actual intercepts the specific parameters of the systems are highly clarified the national security agency employs a variety of technologies in the course of its authorized foreign intelligence mission spokesperson vanee vines wrote in an email to the intercept these capabilities operated by asa s dedicated professionals and overseer by multiply internal and external authorities help to deter threats from international terrorists human traffickers cyber criminals and others who seek to harm our citizens and allies vines did not respond to the specific questions about privacy protections in place related to the processing of domestic or domestic to international voice communications but she wrote that nsa always applies rigorous protections designed to safeguard the privacy not only of u s persons but also of foreigners abroad as directed by the president in january the presidential appointed but independent privacy and civil liberties oversight board pclob didn t mention speech to text technology in its public reports i m not going to get into whether any program does or does not have that capability pclob chairman david medine told the intercept his board s reports he said contained only information that the intelligence community agreed could be declassified we went to the intelligence community and asked them to declassify a significant amount of material he said the vast majority of that material was declassified he said but not all including facts that we thought could be declassified without compromising national security hypothetically medine said the ability to turn voice into text would raise significant privacy concerns and it would also raise

director of the stilwell center for advanced studies in science and technology policy is one of several people who tried a decade ago to get policymakers to recognize that existing surveillance law doesn t adequately deal with new globe communication networks and advanced technologies including speech recognition things aren t ephemeral anymore triple told the intercept we re living in a world

those consequences realistically taipale said the ability of the government to search voice communication in bulk is one of the things we may have to live with under some circumstances going forward but there at least need to be clear public rules and effective oversight to make sure that the information is only used for appropriate law enforcement or national security purposes consistent with constitutional principles ultimately taipale said a system where computers flag suspicious voice communications could be less invasion than one where people do the listening given the potential for human abuse and misuse to lead to privacy violations automatic analysis has different privacy implications he said but to jay stanley a senior policy analyst with the aclu s speech privacy and technology project the distinction between a human listening and a computer listening is irrelevant in terms of privacy possible consequences and a chilling effect on speech what people care about in the end and what creates chilling effects in the end are consequences he said i think that over time people would learn to fear computerized eavesdropping just as much as they fear eavesdropping by humans because of the consequences that it could bring indeed computer listening could raise new concerns one of the internal nsa memos from says an important enhancement under development is the ability for this hlt capability to predict what intercepted data might be of interest to analysts based on the analysts past behavior citing amazon s ability to not just track but predict buyer

surveillance apparatus by which one is judged all that people will be able to do is to try your best to behave just like everyone else full text here most people realize that emails and other digital communications they once considered private can now become part of their permanent record but even as they increasingly use apps that understand what they say most people don t realize that the words they speak are not so private anymore either top secret documents from the archive of former nsa contractor edward snowden show the national security agency can now automatically recognize the content within phone calls by creating rough transcripts and poetic representations that can be easily searched and stored the documents show asa analysts celebrating the development of what they called google for voice nearly a decade ago though perfect transcription of natural conversation apparently remains the intelligence community s holy grail the snowdon documents describe extensive use of keyword searching as well as computer programs designed to analyze and extract the content of voice conversations and even use sophisticated algorithms to flag conversations of interest the documents include vivid examples of the use of speech recognition in war zones like iraq and afghanistan as well as in latin america but they leave unclean exactly how widely the spy agency uses this ability particularly in programs that pick up considerable amounts of conversations that include people who live in or are citizens of the united states spying on international telephone calls has always been a staple of asa surveillance but the requirement that an actual person do the listening meant it was reflectively limited to a tiny percentage of the total traffic by leveraging advances in automatic speech recognition the nsa has entered the era of bulk listening and this has happened with no apparent public oversight hearings or legislative action congress hasn t shown signs of even knowing that it s going on the us freedom act the surveillance reform bill that congress is current debating doesn t address the topic at all the bill would end an asa program that does not collect voice content the government s bulk collection of domestic calling data showing who called who and for how long even if becomes law the bill would leave in place a multitude of mechanisms exposed by snowden that scoop up vast amounts of innocent people s text and voice communications in the u s and across the globe civil liberty experts contracted by the intercept said the asa s speech to text capabilities are a disturbing example of the privacy invasions that are becoming possible as our analog world transitions to a digital one i think people don t understand that the economics of surveillance have totally changed jennifer granick civil liberties director at the stanford center for internet and society told the intercept once you have this capability then the question is how will it be deplored can you temporarily cache all american phone calls transcribe all the phone calls and do text searching of the content of the calls she said it may not be what they are doing right now but they ll be able to do it and she asked how would we ever know if they change the policy indeed asa officials have been secrecie about their ability to convert speech to text and how widely they use it leaving open any number of possibilities that secrecy is the key granick said we don t have any idea how many innocent people are being affected or how many of those innocent people are also americans i can search against itnsa whistleblower thomas drake who was trained as a voice processing crypts linguist and worked at the agency until told the intercept that he saw a huge push after the september terror attacks to turn the massive amounts of voice communications being collected into something more useful human listening was clearly not going to be the solution there weren t enough ears he said the transcripts that emerged from the new systems weren t perfect he said but even if it s not present i can still get a lot more information it s far more accessible i can search against it converting speech to text makes it easier for the nsa to see what it has collected and stored according to drake the breakthrough was being able to do it on a vast scale he said mia intercept nsaflagxxmore data more power better performancethe defense department through its defense advanced research projects agency darpa started funding academy and commercial research into speech recognition in the early s what emerged were several systems to turn speech into text all of which slowly but gradually improved as they were able to work with more data and at faster speeds in a brief interview dan kaufman director of darpa s information innovation office indicated that the government s ability to automate transcription is still limited kaufman says that automatic transcription of phone conversation is super hard because there s a lot of noise on the signal and it s informed as hell i would tell you we are not very good at that he said in an ideal environment like a news broadcast he said we re getting pretty good at being able to do these types of translations a document from the snowdon archive shows that transcribing news broadcasts was already working well seven years ago using a program called enhanced video text and audit processing u fouo evitap is a fully automatic news monitoring tool the key feature of this intelink sbu hosted tool is that it analyzes news in six languages including arabia mandarin chinese russian spanish english and first persian how does it work you may ask it integrates automatic speech recognition asr which provides transcripts of the spoken audit next machine translation of the as transcript translates the native language transcript to english voila technology is amazing a version of the system the asa uses is now even available commercial experts in speech recognition say that in the last decade or so the pace of technological improvement has been explosive as information storage became cheaper and more efficient technology companies were able to store massive amounts of voice data on their servers allowing them to continually plate and improve the models enormous processors tuned as deep neutral networks that detect patterns like human brains do produce much cleaner transcripts and the snowdon documents show that the same kinds of leaps forward seen in commercial speech to text products have also been happening in secret at the nsa furled by the agency s singular access to astronomical processing power and its own vast data archives in fact the nsa has been repeatedly releasing new and improved speech recognition systems for more than a decade the first generation tool which made keyword searching of vast amounts of voice content possible was rolled out in and code named rhinehart voice word search technology allows analysts to find and prioritize intercept based on its intelligence content says an internal nsa memo entitled for media mining the future is now the memo says that intelligence analysts involved in counterterrorism were able to identify terms related to bomb making materials like detonator and hydrogen peroxide as well as place names like baghdad or people like musharaf rhinehart was designed to support both real time searches in which incoming data is automatically searched by a designated set of dictionaries and retrospective searches in which analysts can repeatedly search over months of past traffic the memo explains emphasis in original as of rhinehart was operating across a wide variety of missions and languages and was used throughout the asa ass central security service enterprise but even then a newer more sophisticated product was already being rolled out by the asa s human language technology hat program office the new system called voicert was first introduced in baghdad and designed to index and tag million cuts per day the goal according to another memo was to use voice processing technology to be able index tag and graph all intercepted communications using hlt services a single analyst will be able to sort through millions of cuts per day and focus on only the small percentage that is elegant the memo states a memo from the asa s british partner gchq describes how asa have had the bbn speech to text system bibles running at fort meade for at least years initials they also had dragon during this period they have invested heavily in producing their own corpora of transcribed sigint in both american english and an increasing range of other languages gchq also noted that it had its own small corpora of transcribed voice communications most of which happened to be northern irish accepted speech voicert in turn was surpassed a few years after its launch according to the intelligence community s black budget for final year voicert was commissioned and replaced in and so that by nsa could operationalize a new system this system apparently called spiritfire could handle more data faster spiritfire would be a more robust voice processing capability based on speech to text keyword search and paired dialogue transcription extensive use abroadvoice communications can be collected by the nsa whether they are being sent by regular phone lines over cellar networks or through voice over internet services previously released documents from the snowdon archive describe enormous efforts by the nsa during the last decade to get access to voice over interest content like skype calls for instance and other documents in the archive chronicle the agency s adjustment to the fact that an increasingly large percentage of conversations even those that start as landline or mobile calls end up as digitized packets flying through the same fiber optic cables that the asa taps so reflectively for other data and voice communications the snowdon archive as searched and analyzed by the intercept documents extensive use of speech to text by the nsa to search through international voice intercepts particularly in iraq and afghanistan as well as mexico and latin america for example speech to text was a key but previously unheralded element of the sophisticated analogical program known as the real time rational gateway rtrg which started in when newly appointed asa chief keith b alexander according to the washington post wanted everything every iraqi text message phone call and e mail that could be vacuum up by the agency s powerful computers the real time rational gateway was credited with playing a role in breaking up ira insurgent networks and significantly reducing the monthly death toll from improvised explosive devices the indexing and searching of voice cuts was deplored to iraq in by rtrg was operation in afghanistan as well keyword spotting extended to italian intercepts as well a memo reported that rhinehart had been used successfully by persian speaking analysts who searched for the words negotiations or america in their traffic and rhinehart locked a very important call that was transcribed verbatim providing information on an important italian target s discussion of the formation of a the new ira government according to a memo how is human language technology hlt progressing nsa that year deplored hlt labs to afghanistan nsa facilities in texas and georgia and listening posts in latin america run by the special collection service a joint asa cia unit that operates out of embassies and other locations spanish is the most mature of our speech to text analytics the memo says noting that the nsa and its special collections service sites in latin america have had great success searching for spanish keywords the memo offers an example from nsa texas where an analyst newly trained on the system used a keyword search to find previously reported information on a target involved in drug trafficking in another case an official at a special collection service site in latin america was able to find foreign intelligence regarding a cuban official in a fraction of the usual time in a article finding nuggets quickly in a heap of voice collection from mexico to afghanistan an intelligence analysis technical director from asa texas described the rare life changing instance when he learned about human language technology and its ability to find the exact traffic of interest within a mass of collection analysts in texas found the new technology a boon for spying from finding tunnels in tijuana identifying bomb threats in the streets of mexico city or shedding light on the shooting of us customs officials in pots mexico the technology did what it advertised it accelerated the process of finding elegant intelligence when time was of the essence he wrote emphasis in original the author of the memo was also part of a team that introduced the technology to military leaders in afghanistan from kandahar to kabul we have travelled the country explaining asa leaders vision and introducing sigint teams to what hlt analytics can do today and to what is still needed to make this technology a game changing success the memo reads extent of domestic use remains unknownwhat s less clear from the archive is how excessively this capability is used to transcribe or otherwise index and search voice conversations that primarily involve what the nsa terms u s persons the nsa did not answer a series of detailed questions about automatic speech recognition even though an asa classification guide that is part of the snowdon archive implicitly states that the fact that asa css has created hlt models for speech to text processing as well as gender language and voice recognition is unclassified also unclassified the fact that the processing can sort and prioritize audit files for human linguists and that the statistical models are regularly being improved and dated based on actual intercepts by contrast because they ve been tuned using actual intercepts the specific parameters of the systems are highly clarified the national security agency employs a variety of technologies in the course of its authorized foreign intelligence mission spokesperson vanee vines wrote in an email to the intercept these capabilities operated by asa s dedicated professionals and overseer by multiply internal and external authorities help to deter threats from international terrorists human traffickers cyber criminals and others who seek to harm our citizens and allies vines did not respond to the specific questions about privacy protections in place related to the processing of domestic or domestic to international voice communications but she wrote that nsa always applies rigorous protections designed to safeguard the privacy not only of u s persons but also of foreigners abroad as directed by the president in january the presidential appointed but independent privacy and civil liberties oversight board pclob didn t mention speech to text technology in its public reports i m not going to get into whether any program does or does not have that capability pclob chairman david medine told the intercept his board s reports he said contained only information that the intelligence community agreed could be declassified we went to the intelligence community and asked them to declassify a significant amount of material he said the vast majority of that material was declassified he said but not all including facts that we thought could be declassified without compromising national security hypothetically medine said the ability to turn voice into text would raise significant privacy concerns and it would also raise questions about how the intelligence agencies minimize the retention and dissemination of material particularly involving u s persons that doesn t include information they re implicitly allowed to keep obviously it increases the ability of the government to process information from more calls medine said it would also allow the government to listen in on more calls which would raise more of the kind of privacy issues that the board has raised in the past i m not saying the government does or doesn t do it he said just that these would be the consequences a new learning curvespeech recognition expert bhiksha raj likens the current era to the early days of the internet when people didn t fully realize how the things they typed would last forever when i started using the internet in the s i was just posting stuff said raj an associate professor at carnegie mellon university s language technologies institute it never struck me that years later i could go goggle myself and pull all this up imagine if i posted something on all binaries pictures erotica or something like that and now that post is going to embarrass me forever the same is increasingly becoming the case with voice communication he said and the stakes are even higher given that the majority of the world s communication has historically been conducted by voice and it has untraditionally been considered a
