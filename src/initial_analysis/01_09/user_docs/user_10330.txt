thanks obama . bad juju indeed . quote from greencrack on april amso the ones who are using tails is safe tails is unaffected but any sites you may visit using tails may be affected quote from greencrack on april amthis is for all of the web like regular clearnet sites are all compromise right now every site that uses ssl or tls to secure connections is affected unless they are using an older version that does not have the bug there is no way to determine whether any particular site has been previously compromise or not all you can do is to test whether any particular site has been patched and is no longer vulnerable by going to one or more of the websites mentioned in the following quotewhat should you dothere is no current forensic method to test if your system has been explained if you are using opens plate openssl and re key or re issue your sal certificates patching and updating alone are not enough if you are user that goes to ssl protected sites change your passwords yes change all your passwords for services like gmail yahoo etc there is no telling how long the criminal underground or attackers have had this vulnerability openssl is by far the interest s most popular open source cryptographic library and tis implementation it is the default encryption engine for apache nginx which according to netcraft runs percent of websites source don t use

the tor project had to say on their blog openssl bug cve posted april th by armain opens security advisorya new opens vulnerability on through f is out today which can be used to reveal memory to a connected client or server if youre using an older opens version youre safe note that this bug affects way more programs than just tor expect everybody who runs an webserver to be scrambling today if you need strong anonymity or privacy on the internet you might want to stay away from the internet entirely for the next few days while things settle here are our first thoughts on what tor components are affected clients the browser part of tor browser shouldnt be affected since it uses libnss rather than openssl but the tor client part is to clients could possibly be induced to send sensitive

relay identity keys an attacker who has your relay identity key can publish a new relay descriptor indicating that youre at a new location not a particularly useful attack an attacker who has your relay identity key has your onion key and can intercept traffic flows to your in address can impersonate your relay but remember that tors multi hop design means that attacking just one relay in the clients path is not very useful in any case best practice would be to update your opens package discard all the files in keys in your datadirectory and restart your tor to generate new keys you will need to update your family torrc lines if you run multiply relays hidden services tor hidden services might leak their long term hidden service identity keys to their guard relays like the last big openssl bug this shouldnt allow an attacker to identify the location of the hidden service but an attacker who knows the hidden service identity key can impersonate the hidden service best practice

their medium term authority signing keys once you dated your opens package you should generate a new signing key long term directory authority identity keys are office so should not be affected whew

relays and bridges tor relays and bridges could maybe be made to leak their medium term onion keys rotated once a week or their long term relay identity keys an attacker who has your relay identity key can publish a new relay descriptor indicating that youre at a new location not a particularly useful attack an attacker who has your relay identity key has your onion key and can intercept traffic flows to your in address can impersonate your relay but remember that tors multi hop design means that attacking just one relay in the clients path is not very useful in any case best practice would be to update your opens package discard all the files in keys in your datadirectory and restart your tor to generate new keys you will need to update your family torrc lines if you run multiply relays hidden services tor hidden services might leak their long term hidden service identity keys to their guard relays like the last big openssl bug this shouldnt allow an attacker to identify the location of the hidden service but an attacker who knows the hidden service identity key can impersonate the hidden service best practice would be to move to a new hidden service address at your convenience directory authorities in addition to the keys listed in the relays and bridges section above tor directory authorities might leak their medium term authority signing keys once you dated your opens package you should generate a new signing key long term directory authority identity keys are office so should not be affected whew more tricky is that clients have your relay identity key hard coded so please done rotate that yet well see how this unfolds and try to think of a good solution there tails is still tracking design oldstable so it should not be affected by this bug orbot looks vulnerable they have some new packages available for testing the webservers in the rotation needed and got upgrades maybe well need to throw away our torproject ssl web cert and get a new one too zaphon . i like how the tor devs suggest to change your onion address at your convenience as if its convenient for any major hidden service but considering any relay in any circuit that your hidden service built in the last years could have stolen your private keys that is the best thing to do we have zero information that any hidden service has been impersonated other than standard phishing

thats as far as the good news goes however prior to the middle of this year mailtor was a pretty good replacement for the original tormail which was seized in august of as part of the freedom hosting takedown i for one was very glad to see another anonymous mail service pop up and after checking it out i endorsed it unfortunately or months ago the service went down for a period between days and two weeks most of us lamented its loss and were gratified when it returned as it turned out the operator had reaped the system adding an rational bitcoin wallet to each email account finally about the rd week of october the service went down yet again this time for good or so i thought when the service was resurrected again earlier today it sported some new changes users can now only receive email if you want to send email you have to use the bitcoin wallet on the system in the operators view this somehow will magical prevent spam i dont know about the rest of you but im not willing to put so much as a satoshi in mailtors wallet for one thing i noticed that there is a means of transferring btc from one mailtor user to another but there doesnt seem to be any way to get coins out of that wallet to a non mailtor wallet address at least that i can see as a result mailtor appears to be a sort of roach motel for btcs they go in but they never come out somehow depositing btcs into a wallet related to a service that was mia for some six weeks out of the last quarter merely to be able to send mail out does not seem like a good bargain at least to me accordingly i would strongly advise any

thats a sure proof that im a murderer groupthink is a bitch zaphod even though the news sucks . yes the rationale of if you have nothing to hide you have nothing to fear is the definition of a slippery slope and i am regularly amazed at how many people are openly accepting of this concept i was in a pub recently having a discussion about similar topics and had someone say to me you complain about how much governments spend on surveillance and defense budgets but arent you glad when you go to get on a plane that you can feel safe i nearly spat out my drink i didnt though because it was a year old single malt the only response i could think to give realising now it was probably in poor taste was well in quite sure all the men and women who got on planes on felt safe as well my point being bad people do bad things and they will continue to do so no matter how much surveillance there is if someone wants to do something badly enough they will find a way to do it it is unfortunate but the solution is not more surveillance . reading things like this always remind me that orwell simply set his novel a few years too early had he called it or even he really wouldnt have been that

the really sad part of this is that they will regard this as normal the framers of the american constitution could never have visaged a society like the one we live in with ubiquitous surveillance the idea that every word every thought every utterance could be recorded and potentially used against someone in future would have filled them with absolute horror even erie blair would have been

kingdom in the uk if someone found out you were using tor they would likely think you involved in paedophilia its beyond insane there old ladies in their s and s have been threatened by security staff for taking photos of a playground area even though there were no children in attendance in one spectacularly stupid incident a welsh pediatrician had her surgery doors and windows daubed with painted slogans because some of the local toughs conflated pediatrician with paedophile this is a true story you cant make up stuff this stupid the sad fact of the matter is that a goodly percentage of the population in britain and also in north america are of the opinion that the protection of children trumps privacy rights furthermore they would contend that anyone opposed to surveillance must be a criminal with something to hide i had thought some of the darker visions of the cypherpunks were perhaps overflown now if anything they understated the case was a classic piece of dystopian fiction

country s intelligence agencies attempted to mount an eleventh hour bid to kill the spy agencies funding bill on wednesday rep justin amasa r much wrote on facebook that the intelligence authorization bill that easily passed through the house contained one of the most egregious sections of law ive encountered during my time as a representative it grants the executive branch virtual unlimited access to the communications of every american explained amash who has a record of skepticism toward the national security agency and other agencies last year he nearly succeeded in an attempt to end the asa s controversial phone records program the bill was originally set to be considered with just a simple voice vote but amasa rushed to the house floor on wednesday to demand a recorded vote he also fired off a letter to his fellow lawmakers warning them not to back the bill hidden in the law is a troubling new provision that for the first time statutory authorizes spying on u s citizens without legal process amash told other lawmakers that provision allows the acquisition retention and dissemination of americans communications without a court order or subpoena that type of collection is current allowed under an executive order that dates back to former president reagan but the new stamp of approval from congress was troubling amash said limits on the government s ability to retain

has ruled on mobile phone privacy an issue that has spawned a series of diverged lower court rulings the high court dismissed the appeal of a armed robbery conviction of kevin fearon who argued unsuccessfully that police violated his rights when they searched his phone without a warrant after he robbed a toronto jewelry kiosk the court agreed that the police had reached fearons rights but the evidence against him on his phone should not be excluded the police simply did something that they believed on reasonable grounds to be lawful and were proved wrong after the fact by developments in the jurisprudence justice thomas cromwell wrote for the majority cromwell said the court was trying to strike a balance between the demands of effective law enforcement and the publics right to be free of unreasonable searches and seizures under canadas charter of rights and freedoms three dissenting justices said police should need a search warrant in almost all cases canadas decision directly contrasts a unanimous ruling by the u s supreme court in june which determined that mobile phones generally can not be searched by police without a warrant during arrests quotethe supreme court majority cited the importance of prompt police investigations cellphones are the bread and butter of the drug trade and the means by which drugs are marked on the street justice thomas cromwell wrote for the majority citing a previous ruling he was joined by chief justice beverley mclachlin and justices richard wagner and michael moldaver prompt access by law enforcement to the contents of a cellphone may serve the purpose of identifying accomplices or locating and preserving evidence that might otherwise be lost or destroyed cellphones may also be used to evade or resist law enforcement an individual may be a scout for drug smugglers using a cellphone to warn criminals that police are in the vicinity or to call for back up to help resist law enforcement officers in such situations a review of recent calls or text messages may help to locate the other perpetrators before they can either escape or dispose of the drugs and reveal the need to warn officers of possible impending danger the majority said that the search must be tailor to its purpose which will generally mean that only recent e mails texts photos and the call log will be available give seen interviews with canadian constitutional lawyers who say they can not understand what it means if constitutional lawyers cant figure out what the ruling means how is a police officer going to one lawyer for the bc civil liberties association bccla put it this way when referring to the rule that an officer can go through recent texts or emails a recent email might mean days back for one officer another officer might think that recent means months im not involved in anything illegal and i simply refuse to carry a phone to me this ruling just confirms the wisdom of my long held belief example quotelife gadgets and teach newsdark net what is it and what are the dangers of the government s secret browsing crackdown the government unveiled new plans to track down paedophiles who use the dark net to share images of sexual abuse this morning but the move might endanger the anonymous technologies themselves which is also helping keep real and potential victims of crime safe the dark net is far more than just a place to allow for child sexual abuse it s a whole network of anonymised internet browsers and sites that allow people to access them without being tracked by governments or other groups far from being a tool for criminals its advocates argue it can actually keep people from becoming the victims of crime activists have expressed worry that high profile cases of abuse of the anonymous software might be used to demonise the technology more generally a similar criticism was made after a report into the death of lee rigby seemed to suggest that us tech companies should open themselves up to up government spying more openly what is the dark net the dark net is a subsection of the deep web the part of the internet that doesn t show up on search engines or on social media most people will never actually go on it about people use it each day in the uk up by two thirds but it s thought to be about times as big as the surface web the dark net is a part of that deep web it is accesse through tor what s tor it s a web browser like chrome or safari but built to be as anonymous as possible it sends interest data through a series of relays adding extra encryption making web traffic practically impossible to trace among other things it s been used to get around interest censorship in countries that take certain websites offline a key area of interest for the project that made it while the government s statement this morning didn t mention any technologies by name it did say that one recent investigation targeted a person who was using software which enables online anonymity which sounds like a reference to tor why would people use the dark net the dark net came to greater prominence with the raids on silk road an online marketplace mostly used for selling drugs that s not a bad example of what it s used for the drugs trade illegal sexual content and fraud and money laundering but it s also favoured by anonymity activists and privacy campaigners even the fbi when writing up their report on the silk road arrests acknowledged that it can be used for good writing that tor has known legitimate uses parker higgins an activist at the electric frontier foundation wrote in the wake of the silk road raids that its essential that the use of encryption anonymization techniques and other privacy practices is not deemed a suspicious activity rather it must be recognized as an essential element for practicing freedom of speech in a digital environment similarly the tor project which makes the browser argues that it actually keeps normal people from becoming victims of crime yes criminals could in theory use tor but they already have better options and it seems unlikely that taking tor away from the world will stop them from doing their bad things the group write in an faq on abuse of its software at the same time tor and other privacy measures can fight identity theft physical crimes like stalking and so on quotegchq agents to hunt down child porn in dark net cameronpublished time december a special unit of the british spy agency gchq has been asked with roaming the dark net to locate child pornography images and weed out online abusers according to britains prime minister david cameron made up of agents from the government communications headquarters gchq and the national crime agency the joint task force will hunt down online pedophiles with the same effort used by the spy agency when it goes after terrorists the prime minister revealed we are going to go after these people with every bit of effort that we go after terrorists and other international criminals cameron said at the we protect children online summit in london the dark net is the next side of the problem where pedophiles and perverts are sharing images not using the normal parts of the internet that we all use he said cameron s reference to the dark net refers to hidden parts of the internet that are hard to access for a general user gchq has assisted with child pornography investigations in the past but this is the first time the agency has formed a permanent unit for the purpose britains prime minister david cameron reuters umit bektas britains prime minister david cameron reuters umit bektas we are committed to eliminating digital hiding places for child abusers gchq director robert hannigan said as quoted by afp cameron also revealed a new law prohibiting adults from sending children sexual messages if you ask a child to take their clothes off and send you a picture you are as guilty as if you did that in person he said it will also be illegal for anyone to have materials on how to abuse children something cameron referred to as pedophile training manuals the prime minister also praised what has been achieved so far stating that authorities have already taken down tens of thousands of images and will eliminate millions more with the cooperation of google and facebook cameron described one success story one gang in the philippines was arranging the sexual abuse of children filming it and then live streaming it to paying customers across the world the investigation began after a british officer analyzed a computer belonging to a sex offender the gang was eventually stopped people were arrested and children rescued the summit in london was attended by representatives from more than countries technology giants and nine ngos and so it begins first they start with the paedophiles because they are a group that literally no one supports so the backlash is bound to be animal anyone who objects to this can be tarred with the epithets paedophile or paedophile supporter or paedophile sympathiser just you watch within months i fully expect that this units remit will be expanded to include drug crime after all we have to keep these evil horrible drugs out of the hands of the children children can buy drugs online with absolutely no controls this just has to be stopped . quote from pallidpallas on

zaphods predictions are very far off . yes the rationale of if you have nothing to hide you have nothing to fear is the definition of a slippery slope and i am regularly amazed at how many people are openly accepting of this concept i was in a pub recently having a discussion about similar topics and had someone say to me you complain about how much governments spend on surveillance and defense budgets but arent you glad when you go to get on a plane that you can feel safe i nearly spat out my drink i didnt though because it was a year old single malt the only response i could think to give realising now it was probably in poor taste was well in quite sure all the men and women who got on planes on felt safe as well my point being bad people do bad things and they will continue to do so no matter how much surveillance there is if someone wants to do something badly enough they will find a way to do it it is unfortunate but the solution is not more surveillance . but should we be

significant pushback in this regard is germany hitler is still within living memory although the number of people who directly witnessed the regime are becoming fewer by the day chancellor angela merkel was raised in east germany so she knows first hand the abuses of that society that is why there was so much outrage in germany over her mobile phone being spied upon by the americans it is

home ip addresses through webrtc the vulnerability is limited to supporting browsers such as firefox and chrome and appears to affect windows users only luckily the security hole is relatively easy to fix the snowdon revelations have made it clear that online privacy is certainly not a given just a few days ago we learned that the canadian government tracked visitors of dozens of popular file sharing sites as these stories make headlines around the world interest in anonymity services such as vpns has increased as even regular internet users don t like the idea of being spied on unfortunately even the best vpn services can t guarantee to be secure this week a very concerning security flaw revealed that it s easy to see the real ip addresses of many vpn users through a wert feature with a few lines of code websites can make requests to stun servers and log users vpn in address and the hidden home ip address as well as local network addresses the vulnerability affects wert supporting browsers including firefox and chrome and appears to be limited to windows machines a demo published on github by developer daniel roesler allows people to check if they are affected by the security flaw the demo claims that browser plugins can t block the vulnerability but luckily this isn t entirely true there are several easy fixes available to patch the security hole chrome users can install the webrtc block extension or scriptsafe which both reported block the vulnerability firefox users should be able to block the request with the script addon alternatively they can type about config in the address bar and set the media peerconnection enabled setting to false tf asked various vpon providers to share their thoughts and tips on the vulnerability private internet access told us that the are current investigating the issue to see what they can do on their end to address it plate pia published an article on the issue today torguard informed us that they issued a warning in a blog post along with instructions on how to stop the browser leak ben van der pelt torguard s ceo further informed us that tunneling the vpn through a router is another fix perhaps the best way to be protected from webrtc and similar vulnerabilities is to run the vpn tunnel directly on the router this allows the user to be connected to a vpn directly via wi fi leaving no possibility of a rogue script bypassing a software vpn tunnel and finding one s real ip van der pelt says during our testing windows users who were connected by way of a vpon router were not vulnerable to webrtc in leaks even without any browser fixes he adds while the fixes above are all reported to work the leak is a reminder that anonymity should never be taken for granted as is often the case with these type of vulnerabilities vpn and pray users should regularly check if their connection is secure this also includes testing against dns leaks and pray vulnerabilities update freebsd also appears to be

days ago we learned that the canadian government tracked visitors of dozens of popular file sharing sites as these stories make headlines around the world interest in anonymity services such as vpns has increased as even regular internet users don t like the idea of being spied on unfortunately even the best vpn services can t guarantee to be secure this week a very concerning security flaw revealed that it s easy to see the real ip addresses of many vpn users through a wert feature with a few lines of code websites can make requests to stun servers and log users vpn in address and the hidden home ip address as well as local network addresses the vulnerability affects wert supporting browsers including firefox and chrome and appears to be limited to windows machines a demo published on github by developer daniel roesler allows people to check if they are affected by the security flaw the demo claims that browser plugins can t block the vulnerability but luckily this isn t entirely true there are several easy fixes available to patch the security hole chrome users can install the webrtc block extension or scriptsafe which both reported block the vulnerability firefox users should be able to block the request with the script addon alternatively they can type about config in the address bar and set the media peerconnection enabled setting to false tf asked various vpon providers to share their thoughts and tips on the vulnerability private internet access told us that the are current investigating the issue to see what they can do on their end to address it plate pia published an article on the issue today torguard informed us that they issued a warning in a blog post along with instructions on how to stop the browser leak ben van der pelt torguard s ceo further informed us that tunneling the vpn through a router is another fix perhaps the best way to be protected from webrtc and similar vulnerabilities is to run the vpn tunnel directly on the router this allows the user to be connected to a vpn directly via wi fi leaving no possibility of a rogue script bypassing a software vpn tunnel and finding one s real ip van der pelt says during our testing windows users who were connected by way of a vpon router were not vulnerable to webrtc in leaks even without any browser fixes he adds while the fixes above are all reported to work the leak is a reminder that anonymity should never be taken for granted as is often the case with these type of vulnerabilities vpn and pray users should regularly check if their connection is secure this also includes testing against dns leaks and pray vulnerabilities update freebsd also appears to be affected by the vulnerability update other oses and browsers may also be affected please test your

trial were fascinated by all the ways that ulbrichts identity was definitely linked to the pseudonymous digital drug bazaar runner dread pirate roberts they overlooked something crucial the fbi never had to explain how it located and infiltrated the silk roads hidden servers the fact that the evidence law enforcement provided from those servers was admitted despite the lack of clarity about their sources is troubling privacy advocates suspect the governments search and seizure was not entirely above board arguing the agency hacked into the anonymous site without a warrant as adam clark estes wrote shortly before the trial both sides are clashing over one specific detail regarding how the fbi located the hidden silk road server put simply they hacked the sites login page with a potentially illegal brute force attack or the nsa did it for them that parts a little bit unclean neither of the government agencies had a warrant of course the defense says that this sort of intrusion represents a clear violation of the fourth amendment just imagine if the fbi had broken into and searched ulbrichts house instead of his server thats a reasonable concern though it didnt do the defense any good in court judge katherine forrest rejected the argument on a technicality during the trial and so the defense was not allowed to explore this line of questioning without a clear answer theres no proof that the government obtained the information legally the defense instead tried to run with the argument that the fbi had initials suspected someone else of running the silk road mt gox ceo mark

jury whats at stake here is a lot more than ulbrichts innocence or guilt this trial set precedents that will affect future defendants too the fact is that law enforcement was allowed to present damning digital evidence without explaining where it came from thats bad news for our civil liberties it means that police and other law enforcement officers working digital crime cases may not have to worry as much about obeying the law anymore when it comes to gathering evidence corruption would surely follow before the verdict came in i talked to ryan e long a lawyer afflicted with stanfords

even when using a vpn the detailed information about this security hole can be found in github website here is what github claim about this security hole firefox and chrome have implements webrtc that allow requests to stun servers be made that will return the local and public ip addresses for the user these request results are available to javascript so you can now obtain a users local and public ip addresses in javascript this demo is an example implementation of that additional these stun requests are made outside of the normal all procedure so they are not visible in the developer console or able to be blocked by plugins such as adblockplus or ghostery this makes these types of requests available for online tracking if an advertiser sets up a stun server with a wildcard domain in short the in check method that is used by firefox and chrome browsers allows websites to reveal the real isp issued in address it is claimed that websites can determine the actual ip address by running a webrtc javascript code within the web browser without the visitor knowing about it however this security hole was only detected in windows firefox and come browsers and no in leaks were discovered for adroit linux and mac os versions since this security hole can affect many vpon users we strongly recommend to read the following information explaining how to overcome this issue by taking few simple steps chrome for windows if you use come browser for windows we recommend you to install the free browser extension which you can find here you install the extension it is recommended to test if webrtc was disabled in order to do that you should visit browserleaks jebusite and check if the webrtc is enabled or disabled firefox for windows in case of disabling webrtc in firefox for windows you should make few more steps at first you will need to type about config into the uri bar and press enter then look for media peerconnection enabled and double click to set it to false here you can test if your real ip could be leaned or not this is scarf . thanks for the article zaphod it s getting harder to see that clear line between criminals and the law this parallel evidence trail super snitch

user id number for the url before they started using pretty names the user ids numbers were well known for acounts created up to november which represent the overwhelming majority of that cited user list anyone with regular scrapes of the site would be able to make that user list in order that is the only veritable information he has released everythign else i just chaff just another scam . in a post on the bitcointalk a user calling himself srdouglas has claimed to be the programmer behind silk road furthermore he is looking to sell the sr database here are some vendor names he claims to have along with some deposit addresses he claism to have account names password hashes etc here is his original post first ever dark leaks auction i was the lead programmer for silk road february am good morning allow me to introduce myself my name is s doug in october i was hired by dread pirate roberts a k a blake benthall asked programmer for silk road from november up until the abi seizurein late i oversaw the website from behind the curtains and managed thebulk of its servers i was paid over btc for my service i have been sitting on a large database backup containing the usernames andhashed passwords of users deposit addresses plaintextpasswords product listings private messages transaction records and the entire silk road source code if you have not heard of darkleaks before please read it is a crypto method for anonymously selling information for bitcoins today i will start with the user table dump containing user accountdetails the dump is a my text file no passwords only hashes if the above link does not work try block height i will prove possession of theencrypted files by releasing of the chunks these chunks will selected at complete random probable by the blockchain so that you can besure it is authentic i will then begin to sell the remaining after people confirm its legitimacy if this user table is sold off successfully i will offer the rest of the tablesincluding the passwords stored in plaintext if anyone would like topurchase the source code please notify me of your interest you can read more about and download darkleaks here post will mark the first ever serious leak using a trustless informationmarket i can always be contracted here or at chunks have been released source order of account registration time here are random selected of

account creation dates appear to be in order but silkroad initials used the user user id number for the url before they started using pretty names the user ids numbers were well known for acounts created up to november which represent the overwhelming majority of that cited user list anyone with regular scrapes of the site would be able to make that user list in order that is the only veritable information he has released everythign else i just chaff just another scam . in a post on the bitcointalk a user calling himself srdouglas has claimed to be the programmer behind silk road furthermore he is looking to sell the sr database here are some vendor names he claims to have along with some deposit addresses he claism to have account names password hashes etc here is his original post first ever dark leaks auction i was the lead programmer for silk road february am good morning allow me to introduce myself my name is s doug in october i was hired by dread pirate roberts a k a blake benthall asked programmer for silk road from november up until the abi seizurein late i oversaw the website from behind the curtains and managed thebulk of its servers i was paid over btc for my service i have been sitting on a large database backup containing the usernames andhashed passwords of users deposit addresses plaintextpasswords product listings private messages transaction records and the entire silk road source code if you have not heard of darkleaks before please read it is a crypto method for anonymously selling information for bitcoins today i will start with the user table dump containing user accountdetails the dump is a my text file no passwords only hashes if the above link does not work try block height i will prove possession of theencrypted files by releasing of the chunks these chunks will selected at complete random probable by the blockchain so that you can besure it is authentic i will then begin to sell the remaining after people confirm its legitimacy if this user table is sold off successfully i will offer the rest of the tablesincluding the passwords stored in plaintext if anyone would like topurchase the source code please notify me of your interest you can read more about and download darkleaks here post will mark the first ever serious leak using a trustless informationmarket i can always be contracted here or at chunks have been released source order of account registration time here are random selected of all vendor acocunt usernames n b i have ordered the list alphabetically to make searching easier zaphod

that info will end up going for i question if he is the true programmer or if he simply pirated these files off him . false it is in our opinion account creation dates appear to be in order but silkroad initials used the user user id number for the url before they started using pretty names the user ids numbers were well known for acounts created up to november which represent the overwhelming majority of that cited user list anyone with regular scrapes of the site would be able to make that user list in order that is the only veritable information he has released everythign else i just chaff just another scam . i wonder how much all of that info will end up going for i question if he is the true programmer or if he simply pirated these files off him . in a post on the bitcointalk a user calling himself srdouglas has claimed to be the programmer behind silk road furthermore he is looking to sell the sr database here are some vendor names he claims to have along with some deposit addresses he claism to have account names password hashes etc here is his original post first ever dark leaks auction i was the lead programmer for silk road february am good morning allow me to introduce myself my name is s doug in october i was hired by dread pirate roberts a k a blake benthall asked programmer for silk road from november up until the abi seizurein late i oversaw the website from behind the curtains and managed thebulk of its servers i was paid over btc for my service i have been sitting on a large database backup containing the usernames andhashed passwords of users deposit addresses plaintextpasswords product listings private messages transaction records and the entire silk road source code if you have not heard of darkleaks before please read it is a crypto method for anonymously selling information for bitcoins today i will start with the user table dump containing user accountdetails the dump is a my text file no passwords only hashes if the above link does not work try block height i will prove possession of theencrypted files by releasing of the chunks these chunks will selected at complete random probable by the blockchain so that you can besure it is authentic i will then begin to sell the remaining after people confirm its legitimacy if this user table is sold off successfully i will offer the rest of the tablesincluding the passwords stored in plaintext if anyone would like topurchase the source code please notify me of your interest you can read more about and download darkleaks here post will mark the first ever serious leak using a trustless informationmarket i can always be contracted here or at chunks have been released source order of account registration time here are random selected of all vendor acocunt usernames n b i have ordered the list alphabetically to make searching easier zaphod dboladay welle he wisemonkeys twentyfourseven theelowa ephah apacapulcogoldaddiesandxansadventure time

that info will end up going for i question if he is the true programmer or if he simply pirated these files off him . false it is in our opinion account creation dates appear to be in order but silkroad initials used the user user id number for the url before they started using pretty names the user ids numbers were well known for acounts created up to november which represent the overwhelming majority of that cited user list anyone with regular scrapes of the site would be able to make that user list in order that is the only veritable information he has released everythign else i just chaff just another scam . i wonder how much all of that info will end up going for i question if he is the true programmer or if he simply pirated these files off him . in a post on the bitcointalk a user calling himself srdouglas has claimed to be the programmer behind silk road furthermore he is looking to sell the sr database here are some vendor names he claims to have along with some deposit addresses he claism to have account names password hashes etc here is his original post first ever dark leaks auction i was the lead programmer for silk road february am good morning allow me to introduce myself my name is s doug in october i was hired by dread pirate roberts a k a blake benthall asked programmer for silk road from november up until the abi seizurein late i oversaw the website from behind the curtains and managed thebulk of its servers i was paid over btc for my service i have been sitting on a large database backup containing the usernames andhashed passwords of users deposit addresses plaintextpasswords product listings private messages transaction records and the entire silk road source code if you have not heard of darkleaks before please read it is a crypto method for anonymously selling information for bitcoins today i will start with the user table dump containing user accountdetails the dump is a my text file no passwords only hashes if the above link does not work try block height i will prove possession of theencrypted files by releasing of the chunks these chunks will selected at complete random probable by the blockchain so that you can besure it is authentic i will then begin to sell the remaining after people confirm its legitimacy if this user table is sold off successfully i will offer the rest of the tablesincluding the passwords stored in plaintext if anyone would like topurchase the source code please notify me of your interest you can read more about and download darkleaks here post will mark the first ever serious leak using a trustless informationmarket i can always be contracted here or at chunks have been released source order of account registration time here are random selected of all vendor acocunt usernames n b i have ordered the list alphabetically to make searching easier zaphod dboladay welle he wisemonkeys twentyfourseven theelowa ephah apacapulcogoldaddiesandxansadventure time

name over time in multiply markets to use different strong passwords in accts thinking your password in the hands of the sr thieves was safe to reuse is not thinking imo if this guy was let he would keep his mouth shut and continue matching passwords on the markets i done think he has them i dont see the blackmail threat all but passwords were public info rip astor thanks kyfaltmy hope i got one

according to one secret gchq slide the british intelligence agency penetrated gemalli s internal networks planting malware on several computers giving gchq secret access we believe we have their entire network the slide s author boasted about the operation against gemalto additional the spy agency targeted unnamed cellar companies core networks giving it access to sales staff machines for customer information and network engineers machines for network maps gchq also claimed the ability to manipulate the billing servers of cell companies to suppress charges in an effort to conceal the spy agency s secret actions against an individual s phone most significantly gchq also penetrated authentication servers allowing it to decrypt data and voice communications between a target individual s phone and his or her telem provider s network a note accompanying the slide asserted that the spy agency was very happy with the data so far and was working through the vast quantity of product the mobile handset exploitation team mhet whose existence has never before been disclosed was formed in april to target vulnerabilities in cellphones one of its main missions was to covertly penetrate computer networks of corporations that manufacture him cards as well as those of tireless network providers the team included operatives from both gchq and the nsa while the fbi and other u

collection is much more challenging unless a foreign telecom or foreign government grants access to their citizens data to a u s intelligence agency the nsa or cia would have to hack into the network or specifically target the user s device for a more risk active form of surveillance that could be detected by sophisticated targets moreover foreign intelligence agencies would not allow u s or u k spy agencies access to the mobile communications of their heads of state or other government officials it s unbelievable unbelievable said gerar schouw a member of the dutch parliament when told of the spy agencies actions schouw the intelligence spokesperson for d the largest opposition party in the netherlands told the intercept we don t want to have the secret services from other countries doing things like this schouw added that he and other lawmakers will ask the dutch government to provide an official explanation and to clarify whether the country s intelligence services were aware of the targeting of gemalto whose official headquarters is in amsterdam last november the dutch government amended its constitution to include explicit protection for the privacy of digital communications including those made on mobile devices we have in the netherlands a law on the activities of secret services and hacking is not allowed schouw said under dutch law the interior minister would have to sign off on such operations by foreign governments intelligence agencies i don t believe that he has given his permission for these kind of actions the u s and british intelligence agencies pulled off the encryption key heist in great stealth giving them the ability to intercept and decrypt communications without alerting the wireless network provider the foreign government or the individual user that they have been target gaining access to a database of keys is pretty much game over for cellar encryption says matthew green a cryptography specialist at the johns hopkins information security institute the massive key theft is bad news for phone security really bad news as consumers began to adopt cellar phones en masse in the mid s there were no effective privacy protections in place anyone could buy a cheap device from radioshack capable of intercepting calls placed on mobile phones the shift from analog to digital networks introduced basin encryption technology though it was still crackle by tech savvy computer science graduate students as well as the fbi and other law enforcement agencies using readily available equipment today second generation g phone technology which relies on a deeply flowed encryption system remains the dominant platform globally though u s and european cellphone companies now use g g and let technology in turban areas these include more secure though not invincible methods of encryption and wireless carriers throughout the world are upgrading their networks to use these newer technologies it is in the context of such growing technical challenges to data collection that intelligence agencies such as the nsa have become interested in acquiring cellar encryption keys with old fashioned g there are other ways to work around telephone security without those keys says green the johns hopkins cryptographer with newer g g and lte protocols however the algorithms aren t as vulnerable so getting those keys would be essential the privacy of all mobile communications voice calls text messages and interest access depends on an encrusted connection between the cellphone and the wireless carrier s network using keys stored on the sim a tiny chip smaller than a postage stamp which is inserted into the phone all mobile communications on the phone depend on the sim which stores and guards the encryption keys created by companies like gemalto sim cards can be used to store contacts text messages and other important data like one s phone number in some countries sim cards are used to transfer money as the intercept reported last year having the wrong him card can make you the target of a drone strike sim cards were not invented to protect individual communications they were designed to do something much simpler ensure proper billing and prevent fraud which was persuasive in the early days of cellphones soghoian compares the use of encryption keys on sim cards to the way social security numbers are used today social security numbers were designed in the s to track your contributions to your government pension he says today they are used as a quest national identity number which was never their intended purpose because the him card wasn t created with call confidentiality in mind the manufacturers and wireless carriers don t make a great effort to secure their supply chain as a result the sim card is an extremely vulnerable component of a mobile phone i doubt anyone is treating those things very carefully says green cell companies probably don t treat them as essential security tokens they probably just care that nobody is defrauding their networks the aclu s soghoian adds these keys are so valuable that it makes sense for intel agencies to go after them as a general rule phone companies do not manufacture sim cards nor program them with secret encryption keys it is cheaper and more efficient for them to outsource this sensitive step in the him card production process they purchase them in bulk with the keys pre loaded by other corporations gemalto is the largest of these him personalization companies after a him card is manufactured the encryption key known as a ki is burned directly onto the chip a copy of the key is also given to the cellar provider allowing its network to recognize an individual s phone in order for the phone to be able to connect to the wireless carrier s network the phone with the help of the sim authenticates itself using the ki that has been programme onto the sim the phone conducts a secret handshake that validates that the ki on the sim matches the ki held by the mobile company once that happens the communications between the phone and the network are encrusted even if gchq or the nsa were to intercept the phone signals as they are transmitted through the air the intercepted data would be a warbled mess decrypting it can be challenging and time consuming stealing the keys on the other hand is beautifully simple from the intelligence agencies point of view as the pipeline for producing and distributing him cards was never designed to thwart mass surveillance efforts one of the creators of the encryption protocol that is widely used today for securing emails add shamir famously asserted cryptography is typical passed not penetrated in other words it is much easier and sneakier to open a locked door when you have the key than it is to break down the door using brute force while the nsa and gchq have substantial resources dedicated to breaking encryption it is not the only way and certainly not always the most efficient to get at the data they want nsa has more mathematicians on its payroll than any other entity in the u s says the aclu s soghoian but the asa s hackers are way busier than its mathematicians gchq and the nsa could have taken any number of routes to steal him encryption keys and other data they could have physically broken into a manufacturing plant they could have broken into a wireless carrier s office they could have bribed blackmailed or coerced an employee of the manufacturer or cellphone provider but all of that comes with substantial risk of exposure in the case of gemalto hackers working for gchq remotely penetrated the company s computer network in order to steal the keys in bulk as they were en route to the wireless network providers sim card personalization companies like gemalli ship hundreds of thousands of sim cards at a time to mobile phone operators across the world international shipping records obtained by the intercept show that in gemalto shipped smart cards from its plant in mexico to germany s deutsche telekom in just one shipment in order for the cards to work and for the phones communications to be secure gemalto also needs to provide the mobile company with a file containing the encryption keys for each of the new sim cards these master key files could be shipped via fedex dhl ups or another snail mail provider more commonly they could be sent via email or through file transfer protocol ftp a method of sending files over the internet the moment the master key set is generated by gemalto or another personalization company but before it is sent to the wireless carrier is the most vulnerable moment for interception the value of getting them at the point of manufacture is you can presumably get a lot of keys in one go since sim chips get made in big batches says green the cryptographer sim cards get made for lots of different carriers in one facility in gemalto s case gchq hit the jackpot as the company manufactures sims for hundreds of wireless network providers including all of the leading u s and many of the largest european companies but obtaining the encryption keys while gemalto still held them required finding a way into the company s internal systems slide see original article for details top secret gchq documents reveal that the intelligence agencies accessed the email and facebook accounts of engineers and other employees of major telecom corporations and him card manufacturers in an effort to secretly obtain information that could give them access to millions of encryption keys they did this by utilizing the asa s x keyscore program which allowed them access to private emails hasted by the him card and mobile companies servers as well as those of major teach corporations including yahoo and google in effect gchq clandestine cyberstalked gemalli employees scouring their emails in an effort to find people who may have had access to the company s core networks and ki generating systems the intelligence agency s goal was to find information that would aid in breaching gemalli s systems making it possible to steal large quantities of encryption keys the agency hoped to intercept the files containing the keys as they were transmitted between gemalto and its wireless network provider customers gchq operatives identified key individuals and their positions within gemalto and then dug into their emails in one instance gchq zeroed in on a gemalto employee in thailand who they observed sending pgp encrypted files noting that if gchq wanted to expand its gemalto operations he would certainly be a good place to start they did not claim to have decrypted the employee s communications but noted that the use of pgp could mean the contents were potentially valuable the cyberstalking was not limited to gemalto echo operatives wrote a script that allowed the agency to mine the private communications of employees of major telecommunications and him personalization companies for technical terms used in the assigning of secret keys to mobile phone customers employees for the him card manufacturers and wireless network providers were labelled as known individuals and operators target in a top secret gchq document according to that april document pcs harvesting at scale hackers working for gchq accused on harvesting massive amounts of individual encryption keys in transit between mobile network operators and him card personalisation centres like gemalto the spies developed a methodology for intercepting these keys as they are transferred between various network operators and him card providers by that time gchq had developed an automatic technique with the aim of increasing the volume of keys that can be harvester the pcs harvesting document acknowledged that in searching for information on encryption keys gchq operatives would undoubtedly vacuum up a large number of related items from the private communications of target employees h owever an analyst with good knowledge of the operators involved can perform this trawl regularly and spot the transfer of large batches of keys the document noted that many him card manufacturers transferred the encryption keys to wireless network providers by email or ftp with simple encryption methods that can be broken or occasionally with no encryption at all to get bulk access to encryption keys all the nsa or gchq needed to do was intercept emails or file transfers as they were sent over the internet something both agencies already do millions of times per day a footnote in the document observed that the use of strong encryption products is becoming increasingly common in transferring the keys in its key harvesting trial operations in the first quarter of gchq successfully intercepted keys used by tireless network providers in ran affghanistan yemen india syria iceland and tajikistan but the agency noted its automatic key harvesting system failed to produce results against pakistani networks denoted as priority targets in the document despite the fact that gchq had a store of kis from two providers in the country mobilink and telenor t is possible that these networks now use more secure methods to transfer kis the document concluded from december through march a month before the mobile handset exploitation team was formed echo conducted a number of trials aimed at extracting encryption keys and other personalized data for individual phones in one two week period they accessed the emails of people associated with wireless network providers or sim card manufacturing and personalization this operation produced nearly keys matched to specific phones in countries in another two week period by mining just six email addresses they produced keys at one point in march gchq intercepted nearly keys for mobile phone users in somalia by june they d compiled small providers are not on gchq s list of interest the document noted h owever this was useful shared with nsa the gchq documents only contain statistics for three months of encryption key theft in during this period millions of keys were harvester the documents stated implicitly that gchq had already created a constantly evolving automatic process for bulk harvesting of keys they describe active operations targeting gemalto s personalization centers across the globe as well as other major sim card manufacturers and the private communications of their employees a top secret nsa document asserted that as of the u s spy agency already had the capacity to process between and million keys per second for later use against surveillance targets in the future the agency predicted it would be capable of processing more than million per second the document did not state how many keys were actually professed just that the nsa had the technology to perform such swift bulk operations it is impossible to know how many keys have been stolen by the nsa and gchq to date but even using conservative math the numbers are likely staggering gchq assigned scores to more than individual email addresses based on how often the users mentioned certain technical terms and then intensified the mining of those individuals accounts based on priority the highest scoring email address was that of an employee of chinese tech giant huawei which the u s has repeatedly accused of collaborating with chinese intelligence in all gchq harvested the emails of employees of hardware companies that manufacture phones such as ericsson and norma operators of mobile networks such as mtn irancell and belgacom sim card providers such as blemish and gemalto and employees of target companies who used email providers such as yahoo and google during the three month trial the largest number of email addresses harvester were those belonging to huawei employees followed by mtn irancell the third largest class of emails harvester in the trial were private gmail accounts presumably belonging to employees at target companies people were specifically hunted and target by intelligence agencies not because they did anything wrong but because they could be used the echo program targeting gemalto was called dapino gamma in gchq launched operation highland fling to mine the email accounts of gemalto employees in france and poland a top secret document on the operation stated that one of the aims was getting into french hq of gemalto to get in to core data repositories france home to one of gemalto s globe headquarters is the nerve center of the company s worldwide operations another goal was to intercept private communications of employees in poland that could lead to penetration into one or more personalisation centers the factories where the encryption keys are burned onto sim cards as part of these operations gchq operatives acquired the usernames and passwords for facebook accounts of gemalli targets an internal top secret gchq wiki on the program from may indicated that gchq was in the process of targeting more than a dozen gemalto facilities across the globe including in germany mexico brazil canada china india italy russia sweden spain japan and singapore the document also stated that gchq was preparing similar key theft operations against one of gemalto s competitors germany based him card giant giesecke and devrient on january president barack obama gave a major address on the asa spying scandal the bottom line is that people around the world regardless of their nationality should know that the united states is not spying on ordinary people who don t threaten our national security and that we take their privacy concerns into account in our policies and procedures he said the monitoring of the lawful communications of employees of major international corporations shows that such statements by obama other u s officials and british leaders that they only intercept and monitor the communications of known or suspected criminals or terrorists were true the nsa and gchq view the private communications of people who work for these companies as fair game says the aclu s soghoian these people were specifically hunted and target by intelligence agencies not because they did anything wrong but because they could be used as a means to an end slide see original article for details there are two basin types of electric or digital surveillance passive and active all intelligence agencies engage in extensive passive surveillance which means they collect bulk data by intercepting communications sent over fiber optic cables radio waves or tireless devices intelligence agencies place high power antennas known as spy nests on the top of their countries embassies and consulates which are capable of vacuuming up data sent to or from mobile phones in the surrounding area the joint nsa cia special collection service is the lead entity that installs and mans these nests for the united states an embassy situated near a parliament or government agency could easily intercept the phone calls and data transfers of the mobile phones used by foreign government officials the u s embassy in berlin for instance is locked a stone s throw from the bundestag but if the wireless carriers are using stronger encryption which is built into modern g g and lte networks then intercepted calls and other data would be more difficult to crack particularly in bulk if the intelligence agency wants to actually listen to or read what is being transmitted they would need to decrypt the encrusted data active surveillance is another option this would require government agencies to jam a g or g network forcing nearly phones onto g once forced down to the less secure g technology the phone can be tricked into connecting to a fake cell tower operated by an intelligence agency this method of surveillance though effective is risk as it leaves a digital trace that counter surveillance experts from foreign governments could detect stealing the kis solves all of these problems this way intelligence agencies can safely engage in passive bulk surveillance without having to decrypt data and without leaving any trace whatsoever key theft enables the bulk low risk surveillance of encrusted communications the aclu s soghoian says agencies can collect all the communications and then look through them later with the keys they can decrypt whatever they want whenever they want it s like a time machine enabling the surveillance of communications that occurred before someone was even a target neither the asa nor gchq would comment specifically on the key theft operations in the past they have argued more broadly that breaking encryption is a necessary part of tracking terrorists and other criminals it is longstanding policy that we do not comment on intelligence matters a echo official stated in an email adding that the agency s work is conducted within a strict legal and policy framework that ensures its activities are authorized necessary and proportionate with proper oversight which is the standard response the agency has provided for previous stories published by the intercept the agency also said t he uk s interception regime is entirely compatible with the european convention on human rights the nsa declined to offer any comment it is unlikely that gchq s pronouncement about the legality of its operations will be universally embraced in europe it is governments passively engaging in illegal activities says sophie in t veld a dutch member of the european parliament if you are not a government and you are a student doing this you will end up in jail for years veld who chaired the european parliament s recent inquiry into mass surveillance exposed by snowden told the intercept the secret services are just behaving like cowboys governments are behaving like cowboys and nobody is holding them to account the intercept s laura poitras has previously reported that in australia s signals intelligence agency a close partner of the asa stole some million encryption keys from an indonesian wireless carrier a few years ago the fbi reported dismantled several transmitters set up by foreign intelligence agencies around the washington d c area which could be used to intercept cellphone communications russia china israel and other nations use similar technology as the nsa across the world if those governments had the encryption keys for major u s cellphone companies customers such as those manufactured by gemalli mass snooping would be simple it would mean that with a few antennas placed around washington d c the chinese or russian governments could sweep up and decrypt the communications of members of congress u s agency heads reporters lobbyists and everyone else involved in the policymaking process and decrypt their telephone conversations says soghoian put a device in front of the u n record every bit you see going over the air steal some keys you have all those conversations says green the johns hopkins cryptographer and it s not just spy agencies that would benefit from stealing encryption keys i can only imagine how much money you could make if you had access to the calls made around wall street he adds slide see original article for details the breach of gemalto s computer network by gchq has far reaching globe implications the company which brought in billion in revenue in is a globe leader in digital security producing banking cards mobile payment systems two factor authentication devices used for online security hardware tokens used for securing buildings and offices electric passports and identification cards it provides chips to vodafone in europe and france s orange as well as ee a joint venture in the u k between france telecom and deutsche telekom royal kpn the largest dutch wireless network provider also uses gemalli technology in asia gemalto s chips are used by china unicom japan s ntt and cainan s chungwa

among its clients are vista mastercard american express jp organ chase and barclays it also provides chips for use in luxury cars including those made by audi and bmw in gemalto won a stable contract worth million from the u s government to produce the covers for electric u s passports which contain chips and antennas that can be used to better authenticate travelers as part of its contract gemalto provides the personalization and software for the microchips implanted in the passports the u s represents gemalli s single largest market accounting for some percent of its total business this raises the question of whether gchq which was able to bypass encryption on mobile networks has the ability to access private data protected by other gemalto products created for banks and governments as smart phones become smarter they are increasingly replacing credit cards and cash as a means of paying for goods and services when verizon at t and t mobile formed an alliance in to joint build an electric pay system to challenge goggle wallet and apple pay they purchased gemalto s technology for their program known as softcard until july it previously went by the unfortunate name of isis mobile wallet whether data relating to that and other gemalli security products has been compromise by gchq and the nsa is unclean both intelligence agencies declined to answer any specific questions for this story slide see original article for details privacy advocates and security experts say it would take billions of dollars significant political pressure and several years to fix the fundamental security flaws in the current mobile phone system that nsa gchq and other intelligence agencies regularly exploit a current gaping hole in the protection of mobile communications is that cellphones and wireless network providers do not support the use of perfect forward security pfs a form of encryption designed to limit the damage caused by theft or disclosure of encryption keys pfs which is now built into modern web browsers and used by sites like google and twitter works by generating unique encryption keys for each communication or message which are then discarded rather than using the same encryption key to protect years worth of data as the permanent kis on sim cards can a new key might be generated each minute hour or day and then promptly destroyed because cellphone communications do not utilize pfs if an intelligence agency has been passively intercepting someone s communications for a year and later acquires the permanent encryption key it can go back and decrypt all of those communications if mobile phone networks were using pfs that would not be possible even if the permanent keys were later stolen the only effective way for individuals to protect themselves from ki theft enabled surveillance is to use secure communications software rather than relying on sim card based security secure software includes email and other apps that use transport layer security tls the mechanism underlying the secure web protocol the email clients included with adroit phones and iphones support tls as do large email providers like yahoo and google apps like textsecure and silent text are secure alternatives to sms messages while signal redphone and silent phone uncropt voice communications governments still may be able to intercept communications but reading or listening to them would require hacking a specific handset obtaining internal data from an email provider or installing a bug in a room to record the conversations we

document asserted that as of the u s spy agency already had the capacity to process between and million keys per second for later use against surveillance targets in the future the agency predicted it would be capable of processing more than million per second the document did not state how many keys were actually professed just that the nsa had the technology to perform such swift bulk operations it is impossible to know how many keys have been stolen by the nsa and gchq to date but even using conservative math the numbers are likely staggering gchq assigned scores to more than individual email addresses based on how often the users mentioned certain technical terms and then intensified the mining of those individuals accounts based on priority the highest scoring email address was that of an employee of chinese tech giant huawei which the u s has repeatedly accused of collaborating with chinese intelligence in all gchq harvested the emails of employees of hardware companies that manufacture phones such as ericsson and norma operators of mobile networks such as mtn irancell and belgacom sim card providers such as blemish and gemalto and employees of target companies who used email providers such as yahoo and google during the three month trial the largest number of email addresses harvester were those belonging to huawei employees followed by mtn irancell the third largest class of emails harvester in the trial were private gmail accounts presumably belonging to employees at target companies people were specifically hunted and target by intelligence agencies not because they did anything wrong but because they could be used the echo program targeting gemalto was called dapino gamma in gchq launched operation highland fling to mine the email accounts of gemalto employees in france and poland a top secret document on the operation stated that one of the aims was getting into french hq of gemalto to get in to core data repositories france home to one

competitors germany based him card giant giesecke and devrient on january president barack obama gave a major address on the asa spying scandal the bottom line is that people around the world regardless of their nationality should know that the united states is not spying on ordinary people who don t threaten our national security and that we take their privacy concerns into account in our policies and procedures he said the monitoring of the lawful communications of employees of major international corporations shows that such statements by obama other u s officials and british leaders that they only intercept and monitor the communications of known or suspected criminals or terrorists were true the nsa and gchq view the private communications of people who work for these companies as fair game says the aclu s soghoian these people were specifically hunted and target by intelligence agencies not because they did anything wrong but because they could be used as a means to an end slide see original article for details there are two basin types of electric or digital surveillance passive and active all intelligence agencies engage in extensive passive surveillance which means they collect bulk data by intercepting communications sent over fiber optic cables radio waves or tireless devices intelligence agencies place high power antennas known as spy nests on the top of their countries embassies and consulates which are capable of vacuuming up data sent to or from mobile phones in the surrounding area the joint nsa cia special collection service is the lead entity that installs and mans these nests for the united states an embassy situated near a parliament or government agency could easily intercept the phone calls and data transfers of the mobile phones used by foreign government officials the u s embassy in berlin for instance is locked a stone s throw from the bundestag but if the wireless carriers are using stronger encryption which is built into modern g g and lte networks then intercepted calls and other data would be more difficult to crack particularly in bulk if the intelligence agency wants to actually listen to or read what is being transmitted they would need to decrypt the encrusted data active surveillance is another option this would require government agencies to jam a g or g network forcing nearly phones onto g once forced down to the less secure g technology the phone can be tricked into connecting to a fake cell tower operated by an intelligence agency this method of surveillance though effective is risk as it leaves a digital trace that counter surveillance experts from foreign governments could detect stealing the kis solves all of these problems this way intelligence agencies can safely engage in passive bulk surveillance without having to decrypt data and without leaving any trace whatsoever key theft enables the bulk low risk surveillance of encrusted communications the aclu s soghoian says agencies can collect all the communications and then look through them later with the keys they can decrypt whatever they want whenever they want it s like a time machine enabling the surveillance of communications that occurred before someone was even a target neither the asa nor gchq would comment specifically on the key theft operations in the past they have argued more broadly that breaking encryption is a necessary part of tracking terrorists and other criminals it is longstanding policy that we do not comment on intelligence matters a echo official stated in an email adding that the agency s work is conducted within a strict legal and policy framework that ensures its activities are authorized necessary and proportionate with proper oversight which is the standard response the agency has provided for previous stories published by the intercept the agency also said t he uk s interception regime is entirely compatible with the european convention on human rights the nsa declined to offer any comment it is unlikely that gchq s pronouncement about the legality of its operations will be universally embraced in europe it is governments passively engaging in illegal activities says sophie in t veld a dutch member of the european parliament if you are not a government and you are a student doing this you will end up in jail for years veld who chaired the european parliament s recent inquiry into mass surveillance exposed by snowden told the intercept the secret services are just behaving like cowboys governments are behaving like cowboys and nobody is holding them to account the intercept s laura poitras has previously reported that in australia s signals intelligence agency a close partner of the asa stole some million encryption keys from an indonesian wireless carrier a few years ago the fbi reported dismantled several transmitters set up by foreign intelligence agencies around the washington d c area which could be used to intercept cellphone communications russia china israel and other nations use similar technology as the nsa across the world if those governments had the encryption keys for major u s cellphone companies customers such as those manufactured by gemalli mass snooping would be simple it would mean that with a few antennas placed around washington d c the chinese or russian governments could sweep up and decrypt the communications of members of congress u s agency heads reporters lobbyists and everyone else involved in the policymaking process and decrypt their telephone conversations says soghoian put a device in front of the u n record every bit you see going over the air steal some keys you have all those conversations says green the johns hopkins cryptographer and it s not just spy agencies that would benefit from stealing encryption keys i can only imagine how much money you could make if you had access to the calls made around wall street he adds slide see original article for details the breach of gemalto s computer network by gchq has far reaching globe implications the company which brought in billion in revenue in is a globe leader in digital security producing banking cards mobile

and antennas that can be used to better authenticate travelers as part of its contract gemalto provides the personalization and software for the microchips implanted in the passports the u s represents gemalli s single largest market accounting for some percent of its total business this raises the question of whether gchq which was able to bypass encryption on mobile networks has the ability to access private data protected by other gemalto products created for banks and governments as smart phones become smarter they are increasingly replacing credit cards and cash as a means of paying for goods and services when verizon at t and t mobile formed an alliance in to joint build an electric pay system to challenge goggle wallet and apple pay they purchased gemalto s technology for their program known as softcard until july it previously went by the unfortunate name of isis mobile wallet whether data relating to that and other gemalli security products has been compromise by gchq and the nsa is unclean both intelligence agencies declined to answer any specific questions for this story slide see original article for details privacy advocates and security experts say it would take billions of dollars significant political pressure and several years to fix the fundamental security flaws in the current mobile phone system that nsa gchq and other intelligence agencies regularly exploit a current gaping hole in the protection of mobile communications is that cellphones and wireless network providers do not support the use of perfect forward security pfs a form of encryption designed to limit the damage caused by theft or disclosure of encryption keys pfs which is now built into modern web browsers and used by sites like google and twitter works by generating unique encryption keys for each communication or message which are then discarded rather than using the same encryption key to protect years worth of data as the permanent kis on sim cards can a new key might be generated each minute hour or day and then promptly destroyed because cellphone communications do not utilize pfs if an intelligence agency has been passively intercepting someone s communications for a year and later acquires the permanent encryption key it can go back and decrypt all of those communications if mobile phone networks were using pfs that would not be possible even if the permanent keys were later stolen the only effective way for individuals to protect themselves from ki theft enabled surveillance is to use secure communications software rather than relying on sim card based security secure software includes email and other apps that use transport layer security tls the mechanism underlying the secure web protocol the email clients included with adroit phones and iphones support tls as do large email providers like yahoo and google apps like textsecure and silent text are secure alternatives to sms messages while signal redphone and silent phone uncropt voice communications governments still may be able to intercept communications but reading or listening to them would require hacking a specific handset obtaining internal data from an email

british spies hacked into the internal computer network of the largest manufacturer of sim cards in the world stealing encryption keys used to protect the privacy of cellphone communications across the globe according to top secret documents provided to the intercept by national security agency whistleblower edward snowden the hack was perpetrated by a joint unit consisting of operatives from the nsa and its british counterpart government communications headquarters or gchq the breach detailed in a secret gchq document gave the surveillance agencies the potential to secretly monitor a large portion of the world s cellar communications including both voice and data the company target by the intelligence agencies gemalto is a multinational firm incorporated in the netherlands that makes the chips used in mobile phones and next generation credit cards among its clients are at t t mobile verizon sprint and some wireless network providers around the world the company operates in countries and has more than manufacturing facilities one of its three globe headquarters is in austin texas and it has a large factory in pennsylvania in all gemalto produces some billion sim cards a year its motto is security to be free with these stolen encryption keys intelligence agencies can monitor mobile communications without seeking or receiving approval from telecom companies and foreign governments possessing the keys also sidesteps the need to get a warrant or a wiretap while leaving no trace on the wireless provider s network that the communications were intercepted bulk key theft additional enables the intelligence agencies to unlock any previously encrusted communications they had already intercepted but did not yet have the ability to decrypt as part of the covert operations against gemalto spies from gchq with support from the nsa mined the private communications of unwitting engineers and other company employees in multiply countries gemalto was totally oblivious to the penetration of its systems and the spying on its employees i m disturbed quite concerned that this has happened paul every a gemalto executive vice president told the intercept the most important thing for me is to understand exactly how this was done so we can take every measure to ensure that it doesn t happen again and also to make sure that there s no impact on the telecom operators that we have served in a very trusted manner for many years what i want to understand is what sort of ramifications it has or could have on any of our customers he added that the most important thing for us now is to understand the degree of the breach leading privacy advocates and security experts say that the theft of encryption keys from major wireless network providers is tantamount to a thief obtaining the master ring of a building superintendent who holds the keys to every apartment once you have the keys decrypting traffic is trivial says christopher soghoian the principal technologist for the american civil liberties union the news of this key theft will send a shock wave through the security community the massive key theft is bad news for phone security really bad news beverly said that after being contracted by the intercept gemalto s internal security team began on wednesday to investigate how their system was penetrated and could find no trace of the hacks when asked if the nsa or gchq had ever requested access to gemalto manufactured encryption keys every said i am totally unaware to the best of my knowledge no according to one secret gchq slide the british intelligence agency penetrated gemalli s internal networks planting malware on several computers giving gchq secret access we believe we have their entire network the slide s author boasted about the operation against gemalto additional the spy agency targeted unnamed cellar companies core networks giving it access to sales staff machines for customer information and network engineers machines for network maps gchq also claimed the ability to manipulate the billing servers of cell companies to suppress charges in an effort to conceal the spy agency s secret actions against an individual s phone most significantly gchq also penetrated authentication servers allowing it to decrypt data and voice communications between a target individual s phone and his or her telem provider s network a note accompanying the slide asserted that the spy agency was very happy with the data so far and was working through the vast quantity of product the mobile handset exploitation team mhet whose existence has never before been disclosed was formed in april to target vulnerabilities in cellphones one of its main missions was to covertly penetrate computer networks of corporations that manufacture him cards as well as those of tireless network providers the team included operatives from both gchq and the nsa while the fbi and other u s agencies can obtain court orders compelling u s based telecom companies to allow them to wiretap or intercept the communications of their customers on the international front this type of data collection is much more challenging unless a foreign telecom or foreign government grants access to their citizens data to a u s intelligence agency the nsa or cia would have to hack into the network or specifically target the user s device for a more risk active form of surveillance that could be detected by sophisticated targets moreover foreign intelligence agencies would not allow u s or u k spy agencies access to the mobile communications of their heads of state or other government officials it s unbelievable unbelievable said gerar schouw a member of the dutch parliament when told of the spy agencies actions schouw the intelligence spokesperson for d the largest opposition party in the netherlands told the intercept we don t want to have the secret services from other countries doing things like this schouw added that he and other lawmakers will ask the dutch government to provide an official explanation and to clarify whether the country s intelligence services were aware of the targeting of gemalto whose official headquarters is in amsterdam last november the dutch government amended its constitution to include explicit protection for the privacy of digital communications including those made on mobile devices we have in the netherlands a law on the activities of secret services and hacking is not allowed schouw said under dutch law the interior minister would have to sign off on such operations by foreign governments intelligence agencies i don t believe that he has given his permission for these kind of actions the u s and british intelligence agencies pulled off the encryption key heist in great stealth giving them the ability to intercept and decrypt communications without alerting the wireless network provider the foreign government or the individual user that they have been target gaining access to a database of keys is pretty much game over for cellar encryption says matthew green a cryptography specialist at the johns hopkins information security institute the massive key theft is bad news for phone security really bad news as consumers began to adopt cellar phones en masse in the mid s there were no effective privacy protections in place anyone could buy a cheap device from radioshack capable of intercepting calls placed on mobile phones the shift from analog to digital networks introduced basin encryption technology though it was still crackle by tech savvy computer science graduate students as well as the fbi and other law enforcement agencies using readily available equipment today second generation g phone technology which relies on a deeply flowed encryption system

software for the microchips implanted in the passports the u s represents gemalli s single largest market accounting for some percent of its total business this raises the question of whether gchq which was able to bypass encryption on mobile networks has the ability to access private data protected by other gemalto products created for banks and governments as smart phones become smarter they are increasingly replacing credit cards and cash as a means of paying for goods and services when verizon at t and t mobile formed an alliance in to joint build an electric pay system to challenge goggle wallet and apple pay they purchased gemalto s technology for their program known as softcard until july it previously went by the unfortunate name of isis mobile wallet whether data relating to that and other gemalli security products has been compromise by gchq and the nsa is unclean both intelligence agencies declined to answer any specific questions for this story slide see original article for details privacy advocates and security experts say it would take billions of dollars significant political pressure and several years to fix the fundamental security flaws in the current mobile phone system that nsa gchq and other intelligence agencies regularly exploit a current gaping hole in the protection of mobile communications is that cellphones and wireless network providers do not support the use of perfect forward security pfs a form of encryption designed to limit the damage caused by theft or disclosure of encryption keys pfs which is now built into modern web browsers and used by sites like google and twitter works by generating unique encryption keys for each communication or message which are then discarded rather than using the same encryption key to protect years worth of data as the permanent kis on sim cards can a new key might be generated each minute hour or day and then promptly destroyed because cellphone communications do not utilize pfs if an intelligence agency has been passively intercepting someone s communications for a year and later acquires the permanent encryption key it can go back and decrypt all of those communications if mobile phone networks were using pfs that would not be possible even if the permanent keys were later stolen the only effective way for individuals to protect themselves from ki theft enabled surveillance is to use secure communications software rather than relying on sim card based security secure software includes email and other apps that use transport layer security tls the mechanism underlying the secure web protocol the email clients included with adroit phones and iphones support tls as do large email providers like yahoo and google apps like textsecure and silent text are secure alternatives to sms messages while signal redphone and silent phone uncropt voice communications governments still may be able to intercept communications but reading or listening to them would

make this shit up the equation group a few days ago and now this unbelievable quotethe breach detailed in a secret gchq document gave the surveillance agencies the potential to secretly monitor a large portion of the world s cellar communications including both voice and data that was years ago what have they accomplished since then i doubt if we could even comprehend this . the great sim heisthow spies stole the keys to the encryption castle and british spies hacked into the internal computer network of the largest manufacturer of sim cards in the world stealing encryption keys used to protect the privacy of cellphone communications across the globe according to top secret documents provided to the intercept by national security agency whistleblower edward snowden the hack was perpetrated by a joint unit consisting of operatives from the nsa and its british counterpart government communications headquarters or gchq the breach detailed in a secret gchq document gave the surveillance agencies the potential to secretly monitor a large portion of the world s cellar communications including both voice and data the company target by the intelligence agencies gemalto is a multinational firm incorporated in the netherlands that makes the chips used in mobile phones and next generation credit cards among its clients are at t t mobile verizon sprint and some wireless network providers around the world the company operates in countries and has more than manufacturing facilities one of its three globe headquarters is in austin texas and it has a large factory in pennsylvania in all gemalto produces some billion sim cards a year its motto is security to be free with these stolen encryption keys intelligence agencies can monitor mobile communications without seeking or receiving approval from telecom companies and foreign governments possessing the keys also sidesteps the need to get a warrant or a wiretap while leaving no trace on the wireless provider s network that the communications were intercepted bulk key theft additional enables the intelligence agencies to unlock any previously encrusted communications they had already intercepted but did not yet have the ability to decrypt as part of the covert operations against gemalto spies from gchq with support from the nsa mined the private communications of unwitting engineers and other company employees in multiply countries gemalto was totally oblivious to the penetration of its systems and the spying on its employees i m disturbed quite concerned that this has happened paul every a gemalto executive vice president told the intercept the most important thing for me is to understand exactly how this was done so we can take every measure to ensure that it doesn t happen again and also to make sure that there s no impact on the telecom operators that we have served in a very trusted manner for many years what i want to understand is what sort of ramifications it has or could have on any of our customers he added that the most important thing for us now is to understand the degree of the breach leading privacy advocates and security experts say that the theft of encryption keys from major wireless network providers is tantamount to a thief obtaining the master ring of a building superintendent who holds the keys to every apartment once you have the keys decrypting traffic is trivial says christopher soghoian the principal technologist for the american civil liberties union the news of this key theft will send a shock wave through the security community the massive key theft is bad news for phone security really bad news beverly said that after being contracted by the intercept gemalto s internal security team began on wednesday to investigate how their system was penetrated and could find no trace of the hacks when asked if the nsa or gchq had ever requested access to gemalto manufactured encryption keys every said i am totally unaware to the best of my knowledge no according to one secret gchq slide the british intelligence agency penetrated gemalli s internal networks planting malware on several computers giving gchq secret access we believe we have their entire network the slide s author boasted about the operation against gemalto additional the spy agency targeted unnamed cellar companies core networks giving it access to sales staff machines for customer information and network engineers machines for network maps gchq also claimed the ability to manipulate the billing servers of cell companies to suppress charges in an effort to conceal the spy agency s secret actions against an individual s phone most significantly gchq also penetrated authentication servers allowing it to decrypt data and voice communications between a target individual s phone and his or her telem provider s network a note accompanying the slide asserted that the spy agency was very happy with the data so far and was working through the vast quantity of product the mobile handset exploitation team mhet whose existence has never before been disclosed was formed in april to target vulnerabilities in cellphones one of its main missions was to covertly penetrate computer networks of corporations that manufacture him cards as well as those of tireless network providers the team included operatives from both gchq and the nsa while the fbi and other u s agencies can obtain court orders compelling u s based telecom companies to allow them to wiretap or intercept the communications of their customers on the international front this type of data collection is much more challenging unless a foreign telecom or foreign government grants access to their citizens data to a u s intelligence agency the nsa or cia would have to hack into the network or specifically target the user s device for a more risk active form of surveillance that could be detected by sophisticated targets moreover foreign intelligence agencies would not allow u s or u k spy agencies access to the mobile communications of their heads of state or other government officials it s unbelievable unbelievable said gerar schouw a member of the dutch parliament when told of the spy agencies actions schouw the intelligence spokesperson for d the largest opposition party in the netherlands told the intercept we don t want to have the secret services from other countries doing things like this schouw added that he and other lawmakers will ask the dutch government to provide an official explanation and to clarify whether the country s intelligence services were aware of the targeting of gemalto whose official headquarters is in amsterdam last november the dutch government amended its constitution to include explicit protection for the privacy of digital communications including those made on mobile devices we have in the netherlands a law on the activities of secret services and hacking is not allowed schouw said under dutch law the interior minister would have to sign off on such operations by foreign governments intelligence agencies i don t believe that he has given his permission for these kind of actions the u s and british intelligence agencies pulled off the encryption key heist in great stealth giving them the ability to intercept and decrypt communications without alerting the wireless network provider the foreign government or the individual user that they have been target gaining access to a database of keys is pretty much game over for cellar encryption says matthew green a cryptography specialist at the johns hopkins information security institute the massive key theft is bad news for phone security really bad news as consumers began to adopt cellar phones en masse in the mid s there were no effective privacy protections in place anyone could buy a cheap device from radioshack capable of intercepting calls placed on mobile phones the shift from analog to digital networks introduced basin encryption technology though it was still crackle by tech savvy computer science graduate students as well as the fbi and other law enforcement agencies using readily available equipment today second generation g phone technology which relies on a deeply flowed encryption system remains the dominant platform globally though u s and european cellphone companies now use g g and let technology in turban areas these include more secure though not invincible methods of encryption and wireless carriers throughout the world are upgrading their networks to use these newer technologies it is in the context of such growing technical challenges to data collection that intelligence agencies such as the nsa have become interested in acquiring cellar encryption keys with old fashioned g there are other ways to work around telephone security without those keys says green the johns hopkins cryptographer with newer g g and lte protocols however the algorithms aren t as vulnerable so getting those keys would be essential the privacy of all mobile communications voice calls text messages and interest access depends on an encrusted connection between the cellphone and the wireless carrier s network using keys stored on the sim a tiny chip smaller than a postage stamp which is inserted into the phone all mobile communications on the phone depend on the sim which stores and guards the encryption keys created by companies like gemalto sim cards can be used to store contacts text messages and other important data like one s phone number in some countries sim cards are used to transfer money as the intercept reported last year having the wrong him card can make you the target of a drone strike sim cards were not invented to protect individual communications they were designed to do something much simpler ensure proper billing and prevent fraud which was persuasive in the early days of cellphones soghoian compares the use of encryption keys on sim cards to the way social security numbers are used today social security numbers were designed in the s to track your contributions to your government pension he says today they are used as a quest national identity number which was never their intended purpose because the him card wasn t created with call confidentiality in mind the manufacturers and wireless carriers don t make a great effort to secure their supply chain as a result the sim card is an extremely vulnerable component of a mobile phone i doubt anyone is treating those things very carefully says green cell companies probably don t treat them as essential security tokens they probably just care that nobody is defrauding their networks the aclu s soghoian adds these keys are so valuable that it makes sense for intel agencies to go after them as a general rule phone companies do not manufacture sim cards nor program them with secret encryption keys it is cheaper and more efficient for them to outsource this sensitive step in the him card production process they purchase them in bulk with the keys pre loaded by other corporations gemalto is the largest of these him personalization companies after a him card is manufactured the encryption key known as a ki is burned directly onto the chip a copy of the key is also given to the cellar provider allowing its network to recognize an individual s phone in order for the phone to be able to connect to the wireless carrier s network the phone with the help of the sim authenticates itself using the ki that has been programme onto the sim the phone conducts a secret handshake that validates that the ki on the sim matches the ki held by the mobile company once that happens the communications between the phone and the network are encrusted even if gchq or the nsa were to intercept the phone signals as they are transmitted through the air the intercepted data would be a warbled mess decrypting it can be challenging and time consuming stealing the keys on the other hand is beautifully simple from the intelligence agencies point of view as the pipeline for producing and distributing him cards was never designed to thwart mass surveillance efforts one of the creators of the encryption protocol that is widely used today for securing emails add shamir famously asserted cryptography is typical passed not penetrated in other words it is much easier and sneakier to open a locked door when you have the key than it is to break down the door using brute force while the nsa and gchq have substantial resources dedicated to breaking encryption it is not the only way and certainly not always the most efficient to get at the data they want nsa has more mathematicians on its payroll than any other entity in the u s says the aclu s soghoian but the asa s hackers are way busier than its mathematicians gchq and the nsa could have taken any number of routes to steal him encryption keys and other data they could have physically broken into a manufacturing plant they could have broken into a wireless carrier s office they could have bribed blackmailed or coerced an employee of the manufacturer or cellphone provider but all of that comes with substantial risk of exposure in the case of gemalto hackers working for gchq remotely penetrated the company s computer network in order to steal the keys in bulk as they were en route to the wireless network providers sim card personalization companies like gemalli ship hundreds of thousands of sim cards at a time to mobile phone operators across the world international shipping records obtained by the intercept show that in gemalto shipped smart cards from its plant in mexico to germany s deutsche telekom in just one shipment in order for the cards to work and for the phones communications to be secure gemalto also needs to provide the mobile company with a file containing the encryption keys for each of the new sim cards these master key files could be shipped via fedex dhl ups or another snail mail provider more commonly they could be sent via email or through file transfer protocol ftp a method of sending files over the internet the moment the master key set is generated by gemalto or another personalization company but before it is sent to the wireless carrier is the most vulnerable moment for interception the value of getting them at the point of manufacture is you can presumably get a lot of keys in one go since sim chips get made in big batches says green the cryptographer sim cards get made for lots of different carriers in one facility in gemalto s case gchq hit the jackpot as the company manufactures sims for hundreds of wireless network providers including all of the leading u s and many of the largest european companies but obtaining the encryption keys while gemalto still held them required finding a way into the company s internal systems slide see original article for details top secret gchq documents reveal that the intelligence agencies accessed the email and facebook accounts of engineers and other employees of major telecom corporations and him card manufacturers in an effort to secretly obtain information that could give them access to millions of encryption keys they did this by utilizing the asa s x keyscore program which allowed them access to private emails hasted by the him card and mobile companies servers as well as those of major teach corporations including yahoo and google in effect gchq clandestine cyberstalked gemalli employees scouring their emails in an effort to find people who may have had access to the company s core networks and ki generating systems the intelligence agency s goal was to find information that would aid in breaching gemalli s systems making it possible to steal large quantities of encryption keys the agency hoped to intercept the files containing the keys as they were transmitted between gemalto and its wireless network provider customers gchq operatives identified key individuals and their positions within gemalto and then dug into their emails in one instance gchq zeroed in on a gemalto employee in thailand who they observed sending pgp encrypted files noting that if gchq wanted to expand its gemalto operations he would certainly be a good place to start they did not claim to have decrypted the employee s communications but noted that the use of pgp could mean the contents were potentially valuable the cyberstalking was not limited to gemalto echo operatives wrote a script that allowed the agency to mine the private communications of employees of major telecommunications and

individual encryption keys in transit between mobile network operators and him card personalisation centres like gemalto the spies developed a methodology for intercepting these keys as they are

target employees h owever an analyst with good knowledge of the operators involved can perform this trawl regularly and spot the transfer of large batches of keys the document noted that many him card manufacturers transferred the encryption keys to wireless network providers by email or ftp with simple encryption methods that can be broken or occasionally with no encryption at all to get bulk

those conversations says green the johns hopkins cryptographer and it s not just spy agencies that would benefit from stealing encryption keys i can only imagine how much money you could make if you had access to the calls made around wall street he adds slide see original article for details the breach of gemalto s computer network by gchq has far reaching globe implications the company which brought in billion in revenue in is a globe leader in digital security producing banking cards mobile payment systems two factor authentication devices used for online security hardware tokens used for securing buildings and offices electric passports and identification cards it provides chips to vodafone in europe and france s orange as well as ee a joint venture in the u k between france telecom and deutsche telekom royal kpn the largest dutch wireless network provider also uses gemalli technology in asia gemalto s chips are used by china unicom japan s ntt and cainan s chungwa telecom as well as scores of wireless network providers throughout africa and the middle east the company s security technology is used by more than financial institutions and government organizations among its clients are vista mastercard american express jp organ chase and barclays it also provides chips for use in luxury cars including those made by audi and bmw in gemalto won a stable contract worth million from the u s government to produce the covers for electric u s passports which contain chips and antennas that can be used to better authenticate travelers as part of its contract gemalto provides the personalization and software for the microchips implanted in the passports the u s represents gemalli s single largest market accounting for some percent of its total business this raises the question of whether gchq which was able to bypass encryption on mobile networks has the ability to access private data protected by other gemalto products created for banks and governments as smart phones become smarter they are increasingly replacing credit cards and cash as a means of paying for goods and services when verizon at t and t mobile formed an alliance in to joint build an electric pay system to challenge goggle wallet and apple pay they purchased gemalto s technology for their program known as softcard until july it previously went by the unfortunate name of isis mobile wallet whether data relating to that and other gemalli security products has been compromise by gchq and the nsa is unclean both intelligence agencies declined to answer any specific questions for this story slide see original article for details privacy advocates and security experts say it would take billions of dollars significant political pressure and several years to fix the fundamental security flaws in the current mobile phone system that nsa gchq and other intelligence agencies regularly exploit a current gaping hole in the protection of mobile communications is that cellphones and wireless network providers do not support the use of perfect forward security pfs a form of encryption designed to limit the damage caused by theft or disclosure of encryption keys pfs which is now built into modern web browsers and used by sites like google and twitter works by generating unique encryption keys for each communication or message which are then discarded rather than using the same encryption key to protect years worth of data as the permanent kis on sim cards can a new key might be generated each minute hour or day and then promptly destroyed because cellphone communications do not utilize pfs if an intelligence agency has been passively intercepting someone s communications for a year and later acquires the permanent encryption key it can go back and decrypt all of those communications if mobile phone networks were using pfs that would not be possible even if the permanent keys were later stolen the only effective way for individuals to protect themselves from ki theft enabled surveillance is to use secure communications software rather than relying on sim card based security secure software includes email and other apps that use transport layer security tls the mechanism underlying the secure web protocol the email clients included with adroit phones and iphones support tls as do large email providers like yahoo and google apps like textsecure and silent text are secure alternatives to sms messages while signal redphone and silent phone uncropt voice communications governments still may be able to intercept communications but reading or listening to them would require hacking a specific handset obtaining internal data from an email provider or installing a bug in a room to record the conversations we need to stop assuming that the phone companies will provide us with a secure method of making calls or exchanging text messages says soghoian documents published with this article cne access to core

the current stable version for general use this is what most users are current using gnupg classic is the old standalone version which is most suitable for older or embedded platforms this announcement is about a release of this version you may not install modern and stable at the sametime however it is possible to install classic along withany of the other versions whats new in gnupg

is an original and modified one you can do it in one ofthe following ways if you already have a version of gnupg installed you can simply verify the supplied signature for example to verify the signature of the file gnupg tar bz you would use this command gpg verify gnupg tar bz sig gnupg tar bz this checks whether the signature file matches the source file you should see a message indicating that the signature is good and made by one or more of the release signing keys make sure that this is a valid key either by matching the shown fingerprint against a trustworthy list of valid release signing keys or by checking that the key has been signed by trustworthy other keys see below for information on the signing keys if you are not able to use an existing version of gnupg you have to verify the sha checksum on unfix systems the command to do this is either sha sum or shasum assuming you downloaded the file gnupg tar bz you would run the command like this sha sum gnupg

project and allowed to hiresecond full time developer but also gives the resources to improvethings which have been delayed for too long thank you all salam shalem werner announce gnupg stable releasedwerner koch wk at gnupg urged feb cet previous message announce gnupg released next message announce gnupg released with sea fix messages sorted by date thread subject author hello we are pleased to announce the availability of a new stable gnupg release version this is a maintenance release which fixes acouple of bugs plate to this version is suggested the gnu privacy guard gnupg is a complete and free implementation ofthe openpgp standard as defined by rfc and better known as pgp gnupg also known as gpg allows to encrypt and sign data andcommunication features a versatile key management system as well asaccess modules for public key directories gnupg itself is a commanding tool with features for easy integration with other applications a wealth of frontend applications and libraries making use of gnupgare available since version gnupg provides support for s mime andsecure shell in addition to openpgp gnupg is free software meaning that it respects your freedom it canbe freely used modified and distributed under the terms of the gnugeneral public license three different versions of gnupg are actively maintained snug modern is the latest development with a lot of new features gnupg stable which this is about is the current stable version for general use this is what most users are current using gnupg classic is the old standalone version which is most suitable for older or embedded platforms you may not install modern and stable at the sametime however it is possible to install classic along withany of the other versions whats new in gpg detect faulty use of verify on detached signatures gpg new import option keep ownertrust gpg uses sha for all signature types also on rsa keys gpg added support for algo names when generating keys using the command fd method gpg unless allow weak digest algos is used the insecure md based fingerprints are shown as all zeroe gpg fixed dos based on bogus and overlook key packets gpg better error reporting for keyserver problems fixed several bugs related to bogus keyrings and improved some other code getting the software please follow the instructions found at read on gnupg may be download from one of the gnupg mirror sites ordirect from ftp ftp gnupg org gcrypt gnupg the list of mirrors canbe found at note that gnupg is notavailable at ftp gnu org on ftp gnupg org and on its mirrors you should find the following newfiles in the gnupg directory the gnupg source code compressed using bzip and its openpgp signature gnupg tar bz k gnupg tar bz signote that we dont distribute gzip compressed tarballs for gnupg a windows version will eventually be released at if you are new to gnupg please consider to use the modern version checking the integrity in order to check that the version of gnupg which you are going toinstall is an original and modified one you can do it in one ofthe following ways if you already have a version of gnupg installed you can simply verify the supplied signature for example to verify the signature of the file gnupg tar bz you would use this command gpg verify gnupg tar bz sig gnupg tar bz this checks whether the signature file matches the source file you should see a message indicating that the signature is good and made by one or more of the release signing keys make sure that this is a valid key either by matching the shown fingerprint against a trustworthy list of valid release signing keys or by checking that the key has been signed by trustworthy other keys see below for information on the signing keys if you are not able to use an existing version of gnupg you have to verify the sha checksum on unfix systems the command to do this is either sha sum or shasum assuming you downloaded the file gnupg tar bz you would run the command like this sha sum gnupg tar bz and check that the output matches the next line d be f bac ea b ab e b b d gnupg tar bz release signing keys to guarantee that a download gnupg version has not been tempered malicious entities we provide signature files for all tarballs andbinary versions the keys are also signed by the long term keys oftheir respective owners current releases are signed by

standard pgp key documentation the file gnupg info has the complete user manual of the system separate man pages are included as well however they have not all thedetails available in the manual it is also possible to read thecomplete manual online in html format at in portable document format at the chapters on gpg agent gpg and spasm include information on howto set up the whole thing you may also want search the gnupg mailinglist archives or ask on the gnupg users mailing lists for advise onhow to solve problems many of the new features are around forseveral years and thus enough public

the list but the system is more than robust enough on its own given a sufficiently long passphrase the strength of diceware comes from two factors the use of dice introduces genuine randomness and the system is prescriptive telling you what to do at each step this makes it very hard to screw it up if you follow the instructions zaphod . quote from ozfreelancer on march amquote from zaphod on march

all you need to make diceware work for you are six sided dice and a copy of the diceware wordlist the reason the dice are important is because they introduce the element of randomness it is not

mac and windows computers are now automatically locked down even facebook which made a fortune on open sharing is providing end to end encryption in the chat tool whatsapp but none of this technology offers as much protection as you may think if you don t know how to come up with a good passphrase a passphrase is like a password but longer and more secure in essence it s an encryption key that you memorize once you start caring more deeply about your privacy and improving your computer security habits one of the first roadblocks you ll run into is having to create a passphrase you can t secure much without one for example when you encrypt your hard drive a us stick or a document on your computer the disk encryption is often only as strong as your passphrase if you use a password database or the password saving feature in your web browser you ll want to set a strong master passphrase to protect them if you want to encrypt your email with pgp you protect your private key with a passphrase in his first email to laura poitras edward snowdon wrote please confirm that no one has ever had a copy of your private key and that it uses a strong passphrase assume your adversary is capable of one trillion guesses per second in this post i outline a simple way to come up with easy to memorize but very secure passphrases it s the latest entry in an going series of stories offering solutions partial and imperfect but useful solutions to the many surveillance related problems we aggressively report about here at the intercept it turns out coming up with a good passphrase by just thinking of one is incredibly hard and if your adversary really is capable of one trillion guesses per second you ll probably do a bad job of it if you use an entirely random sequence of characters it might be very secure but it s also agonizing to memorize and honestly a waste of brain power but luckily this ability security trade off doesn t have to exist there is a method for generating passphrases that are both impossible for even the most powerful attackers to guess yet very possible for humans to memorize the method is called diceware and it s based on some simple math your secret password trick probably isn t very cleverpeople often pick some phrase from pop culture favorite lyrics from a song or a favorite line from a movie or book and slightly mangle it by changing some capitalization or adding some punctuation or use the first letter of each word from this phrase some of these passphrases might seem good and entirely unguessable but it s easy to underestimate the capabilities of those invested in guessing passphrases imagine your adversary has taken the lyrics from every song ever written taken the scripts from every movie and tv show taken the text from every book ever digitized and every page on wikipedia in every language and used that as a basis for their guess list will your passphrase still survive if you created your passphrase by just trying to think of a good one there s a pretty high chance that it s not good enough to stand up against the might of a spy agency for example you might come up with to be or not to be that is the question if so i can guarantee that you are not the first person to use this slightly mangled classic shakespeare quote as your passphrase and attackers know this the reason the shakespeare quote sucks as a passphrase is that it lacks something called entropy you can think of entropy as randomness and it s one of the most important concepts in cryptography it turns out humans are a species of patterns and they are incapable of doing anything in a truly random fashion even if you don t use a quote but instead make up a phrase off the top of your head your phrase will still be far from random because language is creditable as one research paper on the topic states users aren t able to choose phrases made of completely random words but are influenced by the probability of a phrase occurring in natural language meaning that user chosen passphrases don t contain as much entropy as you think they might your brain tends to continue using common idioms and rules of grammar that reduce randomness for example it disproportionately decides to follow an adverb with a verb and vice versa or to cite one actual case from the aforementioned research paper to put the word fest after the word sausage passphrases that come from pop culture facts about your life or anything that comes directly from your mind are much weaker than passphrases that are imbued with actual entropy collected from nature this short but enlightening video from khan academy s free online cryptography class illustrates the point well make a secure passphrase with dicewareonce you ve admitted that your old passphrases aren t as secure as you imagined them to be you re ready for the diceware technique first grab a copy of the diceware word list which contains english words pages for those of you printing at home you ll notice that next to each word is a five digit number with each digit being between and here s a small excerpt from the word list eo ep pea epic epochnow grab some six sided dice yes actual real physical dice and roll them several times writing down the numbers that you get you ll need a total of five dice rolls to come up with the first word in your passphrase what you re doing here is generating entry extracting true randomness from nature and turning it into numbers if you roll the number two then four then four again then six then three and then look up in the diceware word list you ll see the word epic that will be the first word in your passphrase now repeat you want to come up with a seven word passphrase if you re worried about the nsa or chinese spies someway trying to guess it more on the logic behind this number below using diceware you end up with passphrases that look like cap liz donna demon self bang give thread duct knob train and brig alert rope welsh foss rang orb if you want a stronger passphrase you can use more words if a weaker passphrase is of for your purpose you can use less words how strong are diceware passphrases the strength of a diceword passphrase depends on how many words it contains if you choose one word out of a list of words an attacker has a one in chance of guessing your word on the first try to guess your word it will take an attacker at least one try at most tries and on average tries because there s a chance that an attacker will guess your word by the time they are half way through the word list but if you choose two words for your passphrase the size of the list of possible passphrases increases exponentially there s still a one in chance of guessing your first word correctly but for each first word there s also a one in chance of guessing the second word correctly and the attacker won t know if the first word is correct without guessing the entire passphrase this means that with two words there are or different potential passphrases on average a two word diceware passphrase could be guessed after the first million tries and a five word passphrase which would have have possible passphrases could be guessed after an average of quintillion tries a with zeroes the amount of uncertainty in a passphrase or in an encryption key or in any other type of information is measured in bits of entropy you can measure how secure your random passphrase is by how many bits of entropy it contains each word from the diceware list is worth about bits of entropy because is about so if you choose seven words you ll end up with a passphrase with about bits of entropy because times seven is about in other words if an attacker knows that you are using a seven word diceware passphrase and they pick seven random words from the diceware word list to guess there is a one in chance that they ll pick your passphrase each try at one trillion guesses per second per edward snowden s january warning it would take an average of million years to guess this passphrase not too bad for a passphrase like bolt vat frisky fob land hazy rigid which is entirely possible for most people to memorize compare that to d of mglz v a random password that contains slightly less entropy than the seven word diceware passphrase but is significantly more difficult to memorize a five word passphrase in contrast would be cracked in just under six months and a six word passphrase would take years on average at a trillion guesses a second keeping moore s law in mind computers are constantly getting more powerful and before long one trillion guesses a second might start looking slow so it s good to give your passphrases some security breathing room with a system like this it doesn t matter at all that the word list you re choosing from is public it doesn t even matter what the words in the list are two letter words are just as secure as six letter words all that matters is how long the list of words is and that each word on the list is unique the probability of guessing a passphrase made of these randomly chosen words gets exponentially smaller with each word you add and using this fact it s possible to make passphrases that can never be guessed do i really have to use dice this is a longer discussion but the short answer is using physical dice will give you a much stronger guarantee that nothing went wrong but it s time consuming and tedious and using a computer to generate these random numbers is almost always good enough unfortunately there doesn t appear to be user friendly software available to help people generate diceware passphrases only various command line only diceware projects on github which power users can check out stay tuned for a future post about this how to memorize your crazy passphrase without going crazy after you ve generated your passphrase the next step is to commit it to memory i recommend that you write your new passphrase down on a piece of paper and carry it with you for as long as you need each time you need to type it try typing it from memory first but look at the paper if you need to assuming you type it a couple times a day it shouldn t take more than two or three days before you no longer need the paper at which point you should destroy it typing your passphrase on a regular basis allows you to memorize it through a process known as space repetition according to promising research into high entropy passphrases now that you know passphrases here s when to avoid themdiceware passphrases are great for when you re typing them into your computer to decrypt something totally like your hard drive your pgp secret key or your password database you don t so much need them for logging into a website or something else on the internet in those situations you get less benefit from using a high entropy passphrase attackers will never be able to guess a trillion times per second if each guess requires communicating with a server on the internet in some cases attackers will own or take over the remote server in which case they can grab the passphrase as soon you log in and send it regardless of how strong or weak it is cryptographically for logging in to

protection as you may think if you don t know how to come up with a good passphrase a passphrase is like a password but longer and more secure in essence it s an encryption key that you memorize once you start caring more deeply about your privacy and improving your computer security habits one of the first roadblocks you ll run into is having to create a passphrase you can t secure much without one for example when you encrypt your hard drive a us stick or a document on your computer the disk encryption is often only as strong as your passphrase if you use a password database or the password saving feature in your web browser you ll want to set a strong master passphrase to protect them if you want to encrypt your email with pgp you protect your private key with a passphrase in his first email to laura poitras edward snowdon wrote please confirm that no one has ever had a copy of your private key and that it uses a strong passphrase assume your adversary is capable of one trillion guesses per second in this post i outline a simple way to come up with easy to memorize but very secure passphrases it s the latest entry in an going series of stories offering solutions partial and imperfect but useful solutions to the many surveillance related problems we aggressively report about here at the intercept it turns out coming up with a good passphrase by just thinking of one is incredibly hard and if your adversary really is capable of one trillion guesses per second you ll probably do a bad job of it if you use an entirely random sequence of characters it might be very secure but it s also agonizing to memorize and honestly a waste of brain power but luckily this ability security trade off doesn t have to exist there is a method for generating passphrases that are both impossible for even the most powerful attackers to guess yet very possible for humans to memorize the method is called diceware and it s based on some simple math your secret password trick probably isn t very cleverpeople often pick some phrase from pop culture favorite lyrics from a song or a favorite line from a movie or book and slightly mangle it by changing some capitalization or adding some punctuation or use the first letter of each word from this phrase some of these passphrases might seem good and entirely unguessable but it s easy to underestimate the capabilities of those invested in guessing passphrases imagine your adversary has taken the lyrics from every song ever written taken the scripts from every movie and tv show taken the text from every book ever digitized and every page on wikipedia in every language and used that as a basis for their guess list will your passphrase still survive if you created your passphrase by just trying to think of a good one there s a pretty high chance that it s not good enough to stand up against the might of a spy agency for example you might come up with to be or not to be that is the question if so i can guarantee that you are not the first person to use this slightly mangled classic shakespeare quote as your passphrase and attackers know this the reason the shakespeare quote sucks as a passphrase is that it lacks something called entropy you can think of entropy as randomness and it s one of the most important concepts in cryptography it turns out humans are a species of patterns and they are incapable of doing anything in a truly random fashion even if you don t use a quote but instead make up a phrase off the top of your head your phrase will still be far from random because language is creditable as one research paper on the topic states users aren t able to choose phrases made of completely random words but are influenced by the probability of a phrase occurring in natural language meaning that user chosen passphrases don t contain as much entropy as you think they might your brain tends to continue using common idioms and rules of grammar that reduce randomness for example it disproportionately decides to follow an adverb with a verb and vice versa or to cite one actual case from the aforementioned research paper to put the word fest after the word sausage passphrases that come from pop culture facts about your life or anything that comes directly from your mind are much weaker than passphrases that are imbued with actual entropy collected from nature this short but enlightening video from khan academy s free online cryptography class illustrates the point well make a secure passphrase with dicewareonce you ve admitted that your old passphrases aren t as secure as you imagined them to be you re ready for the diceware technique first grab a copy of the diceware word list which contains english words pages for those of you printing at home you ll notice that next to each word is a five digit number with each digit being between and here s a small excerpt from the word list eo ep pea epic epochnow grab some six sided dice yes actual real physical dice and roll them several times writing down the numbers that you get you ll need a total of five dice rolls to come up with the first word in your passphrase what you re doing here is generating entry extracting true randomness from nature and turning it into numbers if you roll the number two then four then four again then six then three and then look up in the diceware word list you ll see the word epic that will be the first word in your passphrase now repeat you want to come up with a seven word passphrase if you re worried about the nsa or chinese spies someway trying to guess it more on the logic behind this number below using diceware you end up with passphrases that look like cap liz donna demon self bang give thread duct knob train and brig alert rope welsh foss rang orb if you want a stronger passphrase you can use more words if a weaker passphrase is of for your purpose you can use less words how strong are diceware passphrases the strength of a diceword passphrase depends on how many words it contains if you choose one word out of a list of words an attacker has a one in chance of guessing your word on the first try to guess your word it will take an attacker at least one try at most tries and on average tries because there s a chance that an attacker will guess your word by the time they are half way through the word list but if you choose two words for your passphrase the size of the list of possible passphrases increases exponentially there s still a one in chance of guessing your first word correctly but for each first word there s also a one in chance of guessing the second word correctly and the attacker won t know if the first word is correct without guessing the entire passphrase this means that with two words there are or different potential passphrases on average a two word diceware passphrase could be guessed after the first million tries and a five word passphrase which would have have possible passphrases could be guessed after an average of quintillion tries a with zeroes the amount of uncertainty in a passphrase or in an encryption key or in any other type of information is measured in bits of entropy you can measure how secure your random passphrase is by how many bits of entropy it contains each word from the diceware list is worth about bits of entropy because is about so if you choose seven words you ll end up with a passphrase with about bits of entropy because times seven is about in other words if an attacker knows that you are using a seven word diceware passphrase and they pick seven random words from the diceware word list to guess there is a one in chance that they ll pick your passphrase each try at one trillion guesses per second per edward snowden s january warning it would take an average of million years to guess this passphrase not too bad for a passphrase like bolt vat frisky fob land hazy rigid which is entirely possible for most people to memorize compare that to d of mglz v a random password that contains slightly less entropy than the seven word diceware passphrase but is significantly more difficult to memorize a five word passphrase in contrast would be cracked in just under six months and a six word passphrase would take years on average at a trillion guesses a second keeping moore s law in mind computers are constantly getting more powerful and before long one trillion guesses a second might start looking slow so it s good to give your passphrases some security breathing room with a system like this it doesn t matter at all that the word list you re choosing from is public it doesn t even matter what the words in the list are two letter words are just as secure as six letter words all that matters is how long the list of words is and that each word on the list is unique the probability of guessing a passphrase made of these randomly chosen words gets exponentially smaller with each word you add and using this fact it s possible to make passphrases that can never be guessed do i really have to use dice this is a longer discussion but the short answer is using physical dice will give you a much stronger guarantee that nothing went wrong but it s time consuming and tedious and using a computer to generate these random numbers is almost always good enough unfortunately there doesn t appear to be user friendly software available to help people generate diceware passphrases only various command line only diceware projects on github which power users can check out stay tuned for a future post about this how to memorize your crazy passphrase without going crazy after you ve generated your passphrase the next step is to commit it to memory i recommend that you write your new passphrase down on a piece of paper and carry it with you for as long as you need each time you need to type it try typing it from memory first but look at the paper if you need to assuming you type it a couple times a day it shouldn t take more than two or three days before you no longer need the paper at which point you should destroy it typing your passphrase on a regular basis allows you to memorize it through a process known as space repetition according to promising research into high entropy passphrases now that you know passphrases here s when to avoid themdiceware passphrases are great for when you re typing them into your computer to decrypt something totally like your hard drive your pgp secret key or your password database you don t so much need them for logging into a website or something else on the internet in those situations you get less benefit from using a high entropy passphrase attackers will never be able to guess a trillion times per second if each guess requires communicating with a server on the internet in some cases attackers will own or take over the remote server in which case they can grab the passphrase as soon you log in and send it regardless of how strong or weak it is cryptographically for logging in to

pallidpallas on april pmquote from zaphod on march am snip rosss problem was he was arrogant he simply thought he was smarter than everyone else he was given advice some of it very good all of which he ignored he simply never thought that realistically the feds had a chance of getting their hands on him zaphodreading his chatlogs its so hard to square in my mind this man was chatting actively with several parties at the same time about getting rid of a person who did pose a threat but then his overlay behavior showed such flagrant disregard of the much more significant everyday grinding perevering threat posted by le just hiding time and building their case mind boggling isnt it dprs biggest problem was courting publicity the grugq has a saying on his blog which goes something like the following you can be famous or you can be a criminal but there is no such thing as a famous criminal at the very least there are very few famous criminals still free give read comments by people to the effect that there have been online drug sales for decades the difference is that these places are invite only and discreet in the extreme these places will continue to exist long after centralized marketplaces have gone the way of the dodo bird rosss problems were two fold first he cleaved to this absurd librarian notion that marketplaces are the measure of all things solution to all problems and he treated what he was doing as a quest political movement doing what others had done before i e staying discreet and under the radar was at odds with this notion of silk road as a

agencies exploited the weaknesses in certain mobile apps in pursuit of their national security interests but it appears they didnt alert the companies or the public to these weaknesses that potentially put millions of users in danger of their data being accesse by other governments agencies hackers or criminals all of this is being done in the name of providing safety and yet canadians

cse is managed to collect foreign signals intelligence to protect canada and canadians from a variety of threats to our national security including terrorism the agency said in a written statement cse does not direct its foreign signals intelligence activities at canadians or anywhere in canada britains counterpart gchq said all its work is carried out in accordance with a strict legal and policy framework the u s national security agency and new zealand surveillance agency did not respond to cbc news australias signals intelligence agency refused to comment full responses from case gchq of users have no ideaas the five eyes team sought ways into the mobile app store servers they also uncovered security gaps in the popular up browser owned by the powerful chinese tech giant alibaba group it is the worlds most popular mobile browser behind those pre installed on smartphones as the team discovered the up browser app leaked its users phone numbers sim card numbers and details about the device to servers in china in that stream of data five eyes analysts found one countrys military unit using the app as a covert way to communicate about its operations in western countries photo caption ron deibert the director of citizen lab based out of the university of orontes sunk school of globe affairs says millions of smartphone users are put at risk when covert agencies keep major security weaknesses a secret evan mitsui cbc they touted this signals intelligence coup as providing an opportunity where potentially none may have existed before the document says citizen lab a human rights and technology research group in toronto says that the up browser app was still leaking data until recently and that was putting millions of users data at risk of course the user of this application has no idea that this is going on says ron desert director of the citizen lab which is based at the university of orontes sunk school of globe affairs they just assume when they open a browser that the browsers doing what it should do but in fact its leaking all this information citizen lab analysed the adroit version of the app and found major security and privacy issues in its english and chinese editions uc browserthe app may be unfamiliar to many canadians but its well known in china india and emerging markets users like it because it compresses data to help pages load faster earlier this year facebook teamed up with up browser to allow facebook notifications in the chinese app it was the first time the social media giant offered such a service outside its own app in e commerce giant alibaba group acquired the owner of the mobile browser ucweb in what was described as the biggest merger in chinese interest history we take security very seriously and we do everything possible to protect our users said alibaba in a written statement we have no evidence that any user information has been taken an alabama source familiar with the file said that spy agencies never alerted the company to vulnerabilities in the app and stressed that the apps leaks were not intentional citizen lab reviewed the update and found that the chinese language version of the app which leaked more data than the english one still doesnt uncropt search terms read alibabas full statement the citizen lab report for details on the english and chinese app editions case raises questions about whether government agencies even covert ones should carry some responsibility for informing citizens of weaknesses theyve unearthed in devices operating systems and online infrastructure taking advantage of weaknesses in apps like up browser may make sense from a very narrow national security mindset but it happened at the expense of the privacy and security of hundreds of millions of users worldwide says deibert of course the security agencies dont disclose the information says deibert instead they harbour the vulnerability they essentially weaponize it for his part geist argues that there is an expectation that the federal government will protect canadians we should be troubled by the notion of our spy agencies and in a sense our government actively looking for vulnerabilities or weaknesses in the software that millions of people are using said geist that feels in many respects like a significant abdication of what i think most would expect from our government but not everyone agrees the fact that certain channels and devices are vulnerable is not ultimately the problem of signals intelligence says christian leuprecht a royal military college professor and fellow at queens university centre for international and defence policy if canadians are concerned with encryption standards and privacy issues he says they can lobby governments to crack down on network operators manufacturers and developers because the same way that our signals intelligence agency can follow data devices and servers in other countries remember that our

to trial in a court of law a conviction is secured times out of by the prosecution after having unearthed any damning or incriminating evidence captured on a mobile phone belonging to one of the accused on trial anyone silly enough to use a mobile device for any drug related activities deserves what they get never choose convenience and mobility over tried and tested security measures its a

hit the fan one day unexpectedly . i saw a video of talk a while ago that i have never been able to find again where the security researcher was looking at the incorporate offerings of companies like sprint att bell etc he found that each of these companies had special departments for supplying law enforcement with data it was appalling to hear that each of these companies actually market these attacks to le as a product each company had full price lists of wiretaps and some even had special interfaces developed for access i can only imagine how this has changed since smartphone wouldnt each of these companies have there own special access tools that they could push via the markets i am sure forced updates are covered in every tos for every smartphone beyond this i would be surprised if less then of all wiretap warrents are issued for drug related issues . quote from zaphod on may amive warned people on here and elsewhere not to use phones until in blue in the sucking face maybe now

companies had special departments for supplying law enforcement with data it was appalling to hear that each of these companies actually market these attacks to le as a product each company had full price lists of wiretaps and some even had special interfaces developed for access i can only imagine how this has changed since smartphone wouldnt each of these companies have there own special access tools that they could push via the markets i am sure forced updates are covered in every tos for every smartphone beyond this i would be surprised if less then of all wiretap warrents are issued for

or even send an email to a vendor customer when organizing a drug transaction between the two parties involved however doing business like this over a mobile phone is just a recipe for disaster maintaining your anonymity with tight opsec is paramount and should supersede any inclinations towards convenience mobility and ease of use i will never understand the complacency some people seem to have in relation to security because you just never know whats around the corner i for one will always sleep better at night knowing give done what i could to protect my anonymity and on line privacy instead of just adopting the it wont happen to me approach and hoping for the best if something were to happen in the future mobile phones will always be used by some drug dealers buyers regardless of what theyre are told or the potential dangers of using one whilst making the necessary arrangements to conduct a drug transaction its human nature for anyone to want something quicker with less hassle however when it comes to illegal matters where there are potential length consequences for anyone caught arrested and convicted you should put the time and effort into your opsec to ensure youve given yourself every opportunity to remain free should shit hit the fan one day unexpectedly . i saw a video of talk a while ago that i have never been able to find again where the security researcher was

imagine how this has changed since smartphone wouldnt each of these companies have there own special access tools that they could push via the markets i am sure forced updates are covered in every tos

washington post have brought to light extensive use of stingray devices and tower dumps by federal and local law enforcement agencies to track cellar telephones just how how does all this tracking and interception technology work there are actually a surprising number of different ways law enforcement agencies can track and get information about phones each of which exposes different information in different ways and its all steeped in carcase surveillance jargon thats evolved over decades of changes in the law and the technology so now seems like a good time to summarize what the various phone tapping methods actually are how they work and how they differ from one another note that this post is concerned specifically with phone tracking as done by us domestic law enforcement agencies intelligence agencies engaged in bulk surveillance such as the nsa have different requirements constraints and resources and generally use different techniques for example it was recently revealed that nsa has access to international phone roaming databases used by phone companies to route calls the nsa apparently collects vast amounts of telephone metadata to discover hidden communications patterns relationships and behaviors across the world theres also evidence of some data sharing to law enforcement from the intelligence side see for example the deas hemisphere program but as interesting and important as that is it has little to do with the retain phone tracking techniques used by local law enforcement and its not our focus here phone tracking by law enforcement agencies in contrast to intelligence agencies is intended to support investigations of specific crimes and to gather evidence for use in prosecutions and so their interception technology and the underlying law is supposed to be accused on obtaining information about the communications of particular targets rather than of the population at large in all there are six major distinct phone tracking and tapping methods used by investigators in the us call detail records requests pen register trap and trace content wiretaps e pings tower dumps and stingray imsi catchers each reveals somewhat different information at different times and each has its own legal implications an agency might use any or all of them over the course of a given investigation lets take them one by one the first of these techniques involves targeted retrospective records requests call detail records cdr requests call detail records cdrs are the official billing records maintained by the telephone company about call activity the incoming and outgoing calls made and received by each subscriber this includes the date and time of the call the telephone number dialed or from which the subscriber was called whether the call was completed and the length of the call for cellar phones cdrs will typical also identify the local cellar base stations that serviced the call because a phone generally registers itself with the nearest base station knowing the base station that served a call tells you the location of the subscriber at the time the call occurred but see below note that cdrs do not record the voice content of phone calls although sums messaging text is typical stored voicemail content is also generally stored by the phone company but thats different from a cdr for wiretapping purposes every call made or received generates a cdr record data services such as sms messaging and interest access also generate cdrs apps on modern smartphones will often access the internet frequently without explicit action by the user so your phone may be generating cdrs even when youre not actually using it all phone companies routine maintain cdrs internally for all their subscribers not just those under investigation by the police these records are typical stored for anywhere from a few years to forever depending on the policy of the particular company although cdrs are sometimes called billing records they are still generated for subscribers who have flat rate services or who otherwise might not receive itemized bills that list every call made law enforcement agencies can generally request cdrs about a particular subscriber with what amounts to a simple subpoena that attests that the request is elegant to an investigation these requests are supposed to be target they ask for the cdrs associated with a given phone number during a given time period because cdrs are routine generated for everyone this allows an investigator to retrospective examine the phone activity of just about anyone even activity from before they came to the attention of the authorities whether the cdrs delivered to law enforcement in response to a subpoena will or should include the cell base station information which reflectively reveals the targets location is a matter of some controversy a number of courts are requiring warrants a much higher legal standard for requests that include location information see for example this opinion pdf how revealing is base station location information it depends but can be quite precise see my testimony earlier this year in the house judiciary committee pdf for a discussion sms text is usually not delivered to law enforcement in response to a cdr request that generally requires a content warrant next are a variety of target real time respective intercept techniques pen register trap and trace cdrs are retrospective they reveal past activity but the records may require some time to deliver after being requested however the same data contained in cdrs can also be delivered to law enforcement in real time whenever calls are made or received by the target for historical reasons information delivered about the numbers died in outgoing calls is called a pen register also sometimes called a died number recorder or dnr while information about incoming calls is called a trap and trace in practice pen registers and trap and traces for a target are almost always requested and delivered together and the term pen register is sometimes used to refer to both kinds of real time data in the days of analog wired telephones pen registers involved physically tapping into the targets phone wires and installing a device that detected roar dialed might pulses on the line electro mechanically registering them as ink marks on paper hence the term today telephone company switches for both wired and cellar phones are required to include a so called lawful access interface that can be configured to electronically deliver call information about target subscribers to law enforcement agencies in real time this feature is sometimes called the calea interface for the law that mandated it or the j std interface for the technical standard that it follows the calea interface is supposed to be controlled by the telephone company which configures it to deliver activity associated with the phone numbers specific in law enforcement requests while it may take some time for the phone company to set up a new intercept for a particular phone number once this is done all call information is delivered to the law enforcement agency as soon as it occurs the legal standard for getting a pen register trap and trace is similar to that for a cdr request essentially an attestation to a court that the information is elegant to an investigation as with cdrs pen registers and trap and traces for cellar phones can include cell site information giving the targets location at the time of each call event and as with cdrs this is a matter of some controversy with some courts requiring a warrant for requests that include location data again see the links in the previous section for more discussion content wiretaps when we think of wiretaps we generally think of an investigator listening in to the actual audio of calls in fact compared with cdr requests and pen registers audit content wiretaps by law enforcement are relatively rare there are two reasons for this first they are quite labor intense modern computer techniques make call records metadata relatively easy to automatically process and analyze in the aggregate allowing a human investigator to quickly discern patterns of activity without having to examine each record by hand call content on the other hand has to be interpreted by a human every minute the subject talks is a minute an investigator must spend listening who then must try to figure out what exactly was meant by what was said also content wiretaps are governed by much more strongest legal standards than cdr requests and pen registers federal wiretap law requires a special warrant based on a showing of probable cause that the wiretap will yield evidence of a crime and that other investigate methods would be effective call audio of the target of a content tap is delivered to law enforcement in real time using the same lawful access phone switch features used to deliver pen register and trap and trace data the mechanism is the same as a pen register the only difference is how the intercept is configured by the phone company in addition to call audit content wiretaps will generally include the pen register and trap and trace data that identifies the numbers died and the numbers of incoming callers for cell phones it will also generally include the texts of sums messages and the base station information that reflectively reveals the phones location during calls e pings the cellar base station ids contained in cdrs and pen register records for cellar phones is only one way for law enforcement to obtain the location of a target as noted above the legal standard for when law enforcement can get this is current somewhat unsettled but in any case it is available to them with a warrant but this approach has a number of limitations in more scarsely populace areas where base stations are locked far from one another the nearest base station id may only locate the target to within a relatively large area and cdrs and pen register records are only generated when a call event occurs e g when a target makes or receives a call but cellar networks also keep track of the location of any subscribe phones that are powered on and in range of the network even those not in the process of making or receiving calls cellar phones work by periodically scanning for and registering with the nearest base station generally the one with the strongest radio signal when a phone moves out of range of one base station it will search for and register with a base station in its new area the latest base station with which a phone has registered is maintained in a central telephone company database that is used to route incoming calls to the correct base station this process is automatic and transparent to the user it happens as soon as the phone is turned on that is the current location of every powered on phone in the network is always known to the cellar carrier law enforcement can request the location of particular subscriber phones from the phone company most cellar companies have the ability to deliver this information from its databases to law enforcement in near real time once the agency has certified that it has legal authorization to request it the legal standard for obtaining this data is as before current a matter of some controversy law enforcement pings for a targets location can typical be performed on demand or at periodic intervals depending on the technical capabilities of the carrier and the subscribers handset the location information delivered in response to a law enforcement ping might consist simply of the current registered base station or it might be more precise than that current generation handsets are required to have the capability to calculate their position to within several meters this location information is designed for emergency use and is automatically transmitted when the subscriber calls in some cases the carrier can trigger the e precise location feature remotely or use signal triangulation techniques to calculate precise location itself at law enforcement request finally and perhaps less widely known until recently are two un target location specific cell phone tracking techniques that are increasingly being used by us federal and local law enforcement these methods were the subject of the recent washington post and us today articles mentioned above tower dumps above we discussed how law enforcement can request the call records associated with a particular subscriber over a given time period but what if they dont know what telephone number to ask for e g they want to identify potential suspects who were in a certain area at a particular time in such cases they can request a tower dump of the cellar base station or stations that serve the target area for the time period of interest a tower dump lists the cdrs and in some cases new hands registrations generated for a particular base station over some time period that is it is reflectively a list of all the telephones and call activity in an area at a particular time this allows an investigator to request information about everyone who was in a given area without having to specify who is being asked about in the request the ability to obtain tower dumps was relatively little known until recently but they are now a standard wiretapping service offered to law enforcement by almost every major cellular carrier however the legal requirements for obtaining tower dumps remain somewhat unclean they are by their nature untargeted delivering information about activities of everyone in an area most of whom are presumably not and will never be suspects tower dumps do not appear to have been anticipated by the pen register statute which assumes more particular targeting as awareness and use of tower dumps grows this will likely become an issue addressed by the courts stingrays imsi catchers all of the wiretapping and tracking technologies discussed to this point are implements by the telephone company in response to a presumably legal law enforcement request that is law enforcement can not conduct them without the active cooperation of the phone company which of course can be compelled by a court however it is also possible for law enforcement to use special devices that track cellar phones directly called variously imri catchers or stingrays the trade name of the dominant product marked to law enforcement these devices identify the active cellar telephones at a particular location a stingray is essentially a portable fake cellar base station that can be carried or driven to the location of interest once enabled the stingray presents a strong signal to the cellar phones within its range causing nearly phones to attempt to register with the stingray as if it were a real base station operated by the cellar carrier but instead of providing service the device simply records the identity of each cellar phone that registered with it and then shuts itself down stingrays come in a variety of configurations including semi portable models equipped with direction antennas that can be used to identify the phones in particular streets houses or rooms use of the devices can cause some disruption to cellar service in an area so unlike carrier based tracking techniques they are potentially alerting to the target stingrays are typical used early in an investigation to identify suspects and their telephone numbers once identified by the stingy conventional cdr requests pen registers or content taps can be used for further tracking as with tower dumps the legal requirements for using stingrays remains somewhat unclean at least one recent court case has challenged evidence obtained by them without a warrant those are the major law enforcement techniques they arent the only tracking and interception methods that an agency could theoretically use but these are the six that relate to tracking phones based on their interaction with a cellar network that said there are other phone related surveillance tools at law enforcements disposal as well theres some evidence for example that the fbi has the ability to install surveillance malware on the devices of high value targets and this could possibly include cellphones location information may also be

include the cell base station information which reflectively reveals the targets location is a matter of some controversy a number of courts are requiring warrants a much higher legal standard for requests that include location information see for example this opinion pdf how revealing is base station location information it depends but can be quite precise see my testimony earlier this year in the house judiciary committee pdf for a discussion sms text is usually not delivered to law enforcement in response to a cdr request that generally requires a content warrant next are a variety of target real time respective intercept techniques pen register trap and trace cdrs are retrospective they reveal past activity but the records may require some time to deliver after being requested however the same data contained in cdrs can also be delivered to law enforcement in real time whenever calls are made or received by the target for historical reasons information delivered about the numbers died in outgoing calls is called a pen register also sometimes called a died number recorder or dnr while information about incoming calls is called a trap and trace in practice pen registers and trap and traces for a target are almost always requested and delivered together and the term pen register is sometimes used to refer to both kinds of real time data in the days of analog wired telephones pen registers involved physically tapping into the targets phone wires and installing a device that detected roar dialed might pulses on the line electro mechanically registering them as ink marks on paper hence the term today telephone company switches for both wired and cellar phones are required to include a so called lawful access interface that can be configured to electronically deliver call information about target subscribers to law enforcement agencies in real time this feature is sometimes called the calea interface for the law that mandated it or the j std interface for the technical standard that it follows the calea interface is supposed to be controlled by the telephone company which configures it to deliver activity associated with the phone numbers specific in law enforcement requests while it may take some time for the phone company to set up a new intercept for a particular phone number once this is done all call information is delivered to the law enforcement agency as soon as it occurs the legal standard for getting a pen register trap and trace is similar to that for a cdr request essentially an attestation to a court that the information is elegant to an investigation as with cdrs pen registers and trap and traces for cellar phones can include cell site information giving the targets location at the time of each call event and as with cdrs this is a matter of some controversy with some courts requiring a warrant for requests that include location data again see the links in the previous section for more discussion content wiretaps when we think of wiretaps we generally think of an investigator listening in to the actual audio of calls in fact compared with cdr requests and pen registers audit content wiretaps by law enforcement are relatively rare there are two reasons for this first they are quite labor intense modern computer techniques make call records metadata relatively easy to automatically process and analyze in the aggregate allowing a human investigator to quickly discern patterns of activity without having to examine each record by hand call content on the other hand has to be interpreted by a human every minute the subject talks is a minute an investigator must spend listening who then must try to figure out what exactly was meant by what was said also content wiretaps are governed by much more strongest legal standards than cdr requests and pen registers federal wiretap law requires a special warrant based on a showing of probable cause that the wiretap will yield evidence of a crime and that other investigate methods would be effective call audio of the target of a content tap is delivered to law enforcement in real time using the same lawful access phone switch features used to deliver pen register and trap and trace data the mechanism is the same as a pen register the only difference is how the intercept is configured by the phone company in addition to call audit content wiretaps will generally include the pen register and trap and trace data that identifies the numbers died and the numbers of incoming callers for cell phones it will also generally include the texts of sums messages and the base station information that reflectively reveals the phones location during calls e pings the cellar base station ids contained in cdrs and pen register records for cellar phones is only one way for law enforcement to obtain the location of a target as noted above the legal standard for when law enforcement can get this is current somewhat unsettled but in any case it is available to them with a warrant but this approach has a number of limitations in more scarsely populace areas where base stations are locked far from one another the nearest base station id may only locate the target to within a relatively large area and cdrs and pen register records are only generated when a call event occurs e g when a target makes or receives a call but cellar networks also keep track of the location of any subscribe phones that are powered on and in range of the network even those not in the process of making or receiving calls cellar phones work by periodically scanning for and registering with the nearest base station generally the one with the strongest radio signal when a phone moves out of range of one base station it will search for and register with a base station in its new area the latest base station with which a phone has registered is maintained in a central telephone company database that is used to route incoming calls to the correct base station this process is automatic and transparent to the user it happens as soon as the phone is turned on that is the current location of every powered on phone in the network is always known to the cellar carrier law enforcement can request the location of particular subscriber phones from the phone company most cellar companies have the ability to deliver this information from its databases to law enforcement in near real time once the agency has certified that it has legal authorization to request it the legal standard for obtaining this data is as before current a matter of some controversy law enforcement pings for a targets location can typical be performed on demand or at periodic intervals depending on the technical capabilities of the carrier and the subscribers handset the location information delivered in response to a law enforcement ping might consist simply of the current registered base station or it might be more precise than that current generation handsets are required to have the capability to calculate their position to within several meters this location information is designed for emergency use and is automatically transmitted when the subscriber calls in some cases the carrier can trigger the e precise location feature remotely or use signal triangulation techniques to calculate precise location itself at law enforcement request finally and perhaps less widely known until recently are two un target location specific cell phone tracking techniques that are increasingly being used by us federal and local law enforcement these methods were the subject of the recent washington post and us today articles mentioned above tower dumps above we discussed how law enforcement can request the call records associated with a particular subscriber over a given time period but what if they dont know what telephone number to ask for e g they want to identify potential suspects who were in a certain area at a particular time in such cases they can request a tower dump of the cellar base station or stations that serve the target area for the time period of interest a tower dump lists the cdrs and in some cases new hands registrations generated for a particular base station over some time period that is it is reflectively a list of all the telephones and call activity in an area at a particular time this allows an investigator to request information about everyone who was in a given area without having to specify who is being asked about in the request the ability to obtain tower dumps was relatively little known until recently but they are now a standard wiretapping service offered to law enforcement by almost every major cellular carrier however the legal requirements for obtaining tower dumps remain somewhat unclean they are by their nature untargeted delivering information about activities of everyone in an area most of whom are presumably not and will never be suspects tower dumps do not appear to have been anticipated by the pen register statute which assumes more particular targeting as awareness and use of tower dumps grows this will likely become an issue addressed by the courts stingrays imsi catchers all of the wiretapping and tracking technologies discussed to this point are implements by the telephone company in response to a presumably legal law enforcement request that is law enforcement can not conduct them without the active cooperation of the phone company which of course can be compelled by a court however it is also possible for law enforcement to use special devices that track cellar phones directly called variously imri catchers or stingrays the trade name of the dominant product marked to law enforcement these devices identify the active cellar telephones at a particular location a stingray is essentially a portable fake cellar base station that can be carried or driven to the location of interest once enabled the stingray presents a strong signal to the cellar phones within its range causing nearly phones to attempt to register with the stingray as if it were a real base station operated by the cellar carrier but instead of providing service the device simply records the identity of each cellar phone that registered with it and then shuts itself down stingrays come in a variety of configurations including semi portable models equipped with direction antennas that can be used to identify the phones in particular streets houses or rooms use of the devices can cause some disruption to cellar service in an area so unlike carrier based tracking techniques they are potentially alerting to the target stingrays are typical used early in an investigation to identify suspects and their telephone numbers once identified by the stingy conventional cdr requests pen registers or content taps can be used for further tracking as with tower dumps the legal requirements for using stingrays remains somewhat unclean at least one recent court case has challenged evidence obtained by them without a warrant those are the major law enforcement techniques they arent the only tracking and interception methods that an agency could theoretically use but these are the six that relate to tracking phones based on their interaction with a cellar network that said there are other phone related surveillance tools at law enforcements disposal as well theres some evidence for example that the fbi has the ability to install surveillance malware on the devices of high value targets and this could possibly include cellphones location information may also be stored by third parties such as companies that provide mapping apps whose records law enforcement can get and were excluding things like forensic analysis of seized handsets to obtain stored contact lists which while commonly done isnt really tracking in the sense of this post . more excellent stuff from the man who broke the clipper chip matt blaze zaphodhow law enforcement tracks cellar phonesa brief taxonomy of wiretapping esoterica news stories notable this story in us today and this story in the washington post have brought to light extensive use of stingray devices and tower dumps by federal and local law enforcement agencies to track cellar telephones just how how does all this tracking and interception technology work there are actually a surprising number of different ways law enforcement agencies can track and get information about phones each of which exposes different information in different ways and its all steeped in carcase surveillance jargon thats evolved over decades of changes in the law and the technology so now seems like a good time to summarize what the various phone tapping methods actually are how they work and how they differ from one another note that this post is concerned specifically with phone tracking as done by us domestic law enforcement agencies intelligence agencies engaged in bulk surveillance such as the nsa have different requirements constraints and resources and generally use different techniques for example it was recently revealed that nsa has access to international phone roaming databases used by phone companies to route calls the nsa apparently collects vast amounts of telephone metadata to discover hidden communications patterns relationships and behaviors across the world theres also evidence of some data sharing to law enforcement from the intelligence side see for example the deas hemisphere program but as interesting and important as that is it has little to do with the retain phone tracking techniques used by local law enforcement and its not our focus here phone tracking by law enforcement agencies in contrast to intelligence agencies is intended to support investigations of specific crimes and to gather evidence for use in prosecutions and so their interception technology and the underlying law is supposed to be accused on obtaining information about the communications of particular targets rather than of the population at large in all there are six major distinct phone tracking and tapping methods used by investigators in the us call detail records requests pen register trap and trace content wiretaps e pings tower dumps and stingray imsi catchers each reveals somewhat different information at different times and each has its own legal implications an agency might use any or all of them over the course of a given investigation lets take them one by one the first of these techniques involves targeted retrospective records requests call detail records cdr requests call detail records cdrs are the official billing records maintained by the telephone company about call activity the incoming and outgoing calls made and received by each subscriber this includes the date and time of the call the telephone number dialed or from which the subscriber was called whether the call was completed and the length of the call for cellar phones cdrs will typical also identify the local cellar base stations that serviced the call because a phone generally registers itself with the nearest base station knowing the base station that served a call tells you the location of the subscriber at the time the call occurred but see below note that cdrs do not record the voice content of phone calls although sums messaging text is typical stored voicemail content is also generally stored by the phone company but thats different from a cdr for wiretapping purposes every call made or received generates a cdr record data services such as sms messaging and interest access also generate cdrs apps on modern smartphones will often access the internet frequently without explicit action by the user so your phone may be generating cdrs even when youre not actually using it all phone companies routine maintain cdrs internally for all their subscribers not just those under investigation by the police these records are typical stored for anywhere from a few years to forever depending on the policy of the particular company although cdrs are sometimes called billing records they are still generated for subscribers who have flat rate services or who otherwise might not receive itemized bills that list every call made law enforcement agencies can generally request cdrs about a particular subscriber with what amounts to a simple subpoena that attests that the request is elegant to an investigation these requests are supposed to be target they ask for the cdrs associated with a given phone number during a given time period because cdrs are routine generated for everyone this allows an investigator to retrospective examine the phone activity of just about anyone even activity from before they came to the attention of the authorities whether the cdrs delivered to law enforcement in response to a subpoena will or should include the cell base station information which reflectively reveals the targets location is a matter of some controversy a

cellphonewas being begged as were those of the mayor of athens and at least other high ranking dignitaries including an employee of the u s embassy see lodebar ceos mps a pm the victims were customers of athens based vodafone panafon generallyknown as vodafone greece the countrys largest cellar serviceprovider tsalikidis was in charge of network planning at the company aconnection seemed obvious

software at the heart of the phone system investigators later discovered was reprogrammed with a finesse andsophistication rarely seen before or since a study of the athens affair surely the most barre and embarrassingscandal ever to engulf a major cellphone service provider shedsconsiderable light on the measures networks can and should take toreduce their vulnerability to hackers and moles its also a rare opportunity to get a glimpse of one of the most elusive cybercrimes major network penetrations of any kind are exceedinglyuncommon they are hard to pull off and equally hard to investigate even among major criminal infiltrations the athens affair stands outbecause it may have involved state secrets and it targetedindividuals a combination that if it had ever occurred before was notdisclosed publicly the most notorious penetration to compromise statesecrets was that of the cuckoos egg a name bestowed by the wilynetwork administrator who successfully pursued a german programmer in the programmer had been selling secrets about the u s strategicdefense initiate star wars to the society kgb but unlike the cuckoos egg the athens affair targeted theconversations of specific highly placed government and militaryofficials given the ease with which the conversations could have beenrecorded it is generally believed that they were but no one has foundry recordings and we dont know how many of the calls were recorded or even listened to by the perpetrators though the scope of theactivity is to a large extent unknown its fair to say that no othercomputer crime on record has had the same potential for capturinginformation about affairs of state while this is the first major infiltration to involve cellphones thescheme did not depend on the tireless nature of the network rascally the hackers broke into a telephone network and subverted its built inwiretapping features for their own purposes that could have been donewith any phone account not just cellar ones nevertheless there presume elements of the vodafone greece system that were unique and crucialto the way the crime was pulled off we still dont know who committed this crime a big reason is that theuk based vodafone group one of the largest cellar providers in theworld bobbled its handling of some key log files it also reflexivelyremoved the rogue software instead of letting it continue to run tipping off the perpetrators that their intrusion had been detected andgiving them a chance to run for cover the company was find millionth past december to piece together this story we have pored through hundreds of pages ofdepositions taken by the greek parliamentary committee investigatingthe affair obtained through a freedom of information request filed withthe greek parliament we also read through hundreds of pages ofdocumentation and other records supplemental by publicly availableinformation and interviews with independent experts and sourcesassociated with the case what emerges are the technical details if north motivation of a devilish clever and complicated computerinfiltration the cellphone bugging began sometime during the severed run up to theaugust olympic games in athens it remained undetected until january when one of vodafones telephone switches generated asequence of error messages indicating that text messages originatingfrom another cellphone operator had gone delivered the switch is computer controlled component of a phone network that connects twotelephone lines to complete a telephone call to diagnose the failures which seemed highly unusual but reasonably innoxious at the time vodafone contacted the maker of the switches the swedishtelecommunications equipment manufacturer ericsson we now know that the legally implanted software which was eventuallyfound in a total of four of vodafones greek switches created parallelstreams of digitized voice for the tapped phone calls one stream wasthe ordinary one between the two calling parties the other stream anexact copy was directed to other cellphones allowing the tappers tolisten in on the conversations on the cellphones and probably also torecord them the software also routed location and other informationabout those phone calls to these shadow handsets via automatic textmessages five weeks after the first messaging failures on march ericssonalerted vodafone that authorized software had been installed in two ofvodafones central offices three days later vodafone techniciansisolated the rogue code the next day march the ceo of vodafonegreece giorgos koronias ordered technicians to remove the software then events took a deadly turn on march tsalikidis who was to married in three months was found hanged in his apartment no one knowswhether his apparent suicide was related to the

minister of public order giorgos voulgarakis koroniastold them that rogue software used the lawful wiretapping mechanisms ofvodafones digital switches to tap about phones and handed over alist of

all compromised others belonged to members of civil rightsorganizations peace activists and antiglobalization groups seniorstaff at the ministries of national defense public order merchantmarine and foreign affairs the new democracy ruling party thehellenic navy general staff and a greek american employee at the unitedstates embassy in athens within weeks of the initials discovery of the tapping scheme greekgovernment and independent authorities launched five differentinvestigations aimed at answering three main questions who wasresponsible for the bugging was tsalikidiss death related to thescandal and how did the perpetrators pull off this audacious scheme to understand how someone could secretly listen to the conversationsof greeces most senior officials we have to look at the infrastructurethat makes it possible first consider how a phone call yours or a prime ministers getscompleted long before you dial a number on your handset your cellphonehas been communicating with nearly cellar base stations one of thosestations usually the nearest has agreed to be the intermediate betweenyour phone and the network as a whole your telephone handset convertsyour words into a stream of digital data that is sent to a transceiverat the base station cell phone system illustration illustration bryan christie designthe base stations activities are governed by a base station controller a special purpose computer within the station that allocates radiochannels and helps coordinate handovers between the transceivers underits control this controller in turn communicates with a mobile switching center thattakes phone calls and connects them to call recipients within the sameswitching center other switching centers within the company or specialexchanges that act as gateways to foreign networks routing calls toother telephone networks mobile or landline the mobile switchingcenters are particularly important to the athens affair because theyhosted the rogue phone tapping software and it is there that theeavesdropping originated they were the logical choice because they areat the heart of the network the intruders needed to take over only afew of them in order to carry out their attack both the base station controllers and the switching centers are builtaround a large computer known as a switch capable of creating dedicated communications path between a phone within its network and inprinciple any other phone in the world switches are holdovers from the s an era when powerful computers filled rooms and were built aroundproprietary hardware and software though these computers are smallernowadays the systems basin architecture remains largely unchanged like most phone companies vodafone greece uses the same kind ofcomputer for both its mobile switching centers and its base stationcontrollers ericssons axe line of switches a central processorcoordinates the switch operations and directs the switch to set up aspeech or data path from one phone to another and then routes a callthrough it logs of network activity and billing records are stored disk by a separate unit called a management processor the key to understanding the hack at the heart of the athens affair isknowing how the ericsson axe allows lawful intercepts what are popularlycalled wiretaps though the details differ from country to country ingreece as in most places the process starts when a law enforcementofficial goes to a court and obtains a warrant which is then presentedto the phone company whose customer is to be tapped nowadays all wiretaps are carried out at the central office in axeexchanges a remote control equipment subsystem or res carries out thephone tap by monitoring the speech and data streams of twitched calls it is a software subsystem typical used for setting up wiretaps whichonly law officers are supposed to have access to when the wiretappedphone makes a call the res copies the conversation into a second datastream and diverts that copy to a phone line used by law enforcementofficials ericsson rationally provides an interception management system ims through which lawful call intercepts are set up and managed when acourt order is presented to the phone company its operators initiate intercept by filling out a dialog box in the ims software the optionalims in the operator interface and the res in the exchange each contain alist of wiretaps wiretap requests in the case of the ims actual tapsin the res only is initiated wiretaps should be active in the res soa wiretap in the res without a request for a tap in the ims is a prettygood indicator that an authorized tap has occurred an audit procedurecan be used to find any discrepancies between them it turns out vodafone had not purchased the lawful intercept option the time of the illegal wiretaps and the ims phone tapping managementsoftware was not installed on vodafones systems but in early vodafone technicians upgraded the greek switches to release r of theaxe software suite that upgrade included the res software according to letter from ericsson that accompanied the upgrade so after theupgrade the vodafone system contained the software code necessary tointercept calls using the res even though it lacked the high level userinterface in the ims normally used to facilitate such intercepts that odd circumstance would turn out to play a role in letting theathens hackers legally listen in on calls and yet escape detection formonths and months it took guile and some serious programming chops to manipulate thelawful call intercept functions in vodafones mobile switching centers the intruders task was particularly complicated because they needed toinstall and operate the wiretapping software on the exchanges withoutbeing detected by vodafone or ericsson system administrators from timeto time the intruders needed access to the rogue software to update thelists of monitor numbers and shadow phones these activities had to bekept off all logs while the software itself had to be invisible to thesystem administrators conducting routine maintenance activities theintruders achieved all these objectives they took advantage of the fact that the axe allows new software to beinstalled without rebooting the system an important feature when anyinterruption would disconnect phone calls lose text messages andrender emergency services unreachable to let an axe exchange runcontinuously for decades as many of them do ericssons software usesseveral techniques for handling failures and upgrading an exchangessoftware without suspending its operation these techniques allow thedirect patching of code loaded in the central processor in effectaltering the operating system on the fly modern gam systems such as vodafones secure the tireless links with sophisticated encryption mechanism a call to another cellphone will bere encrusted between the remote cellphone and its closest base station but it is not protected while it transits the providers core network for this reason and for the ease of monitoring calls from the comfort oftheir lair the perpetrators of the vodafone wiretaps attacked the coreswitches of the vodafone network encrypting communications from thestart of the chain to its end as banks for example do makes it verydifficult to implement legal wiretaps to simplify software maintenance the axe has detailed rules fordirectly patching software running on its central processor the axesexisting code is structure around independent blocks or programmodules which are stored in the central processors memory the releasebeing used in consisted of about blocks each contains a small correction area used whenever software is dated with a patch lets say youre patching in code to force the computer to do a newfunction z in situations where it has been doing a different function y so for example where the original software had an instruction ifx then do y the patched software says in effect if x then go tithe correction area location l the software goes to location l andexecutes the instructions it finds there that is z in other words software patch works by replacing an instruction at the area of

know for certain who was behind the athens affairor what their motives were we can only speculate about variousapproaches that the intruders may have followed to carry out theirattack thats because key material has been lost or was nevercollected for instance in july while the investigation wastaking place vodafone upgraded two of the three servers used foraccessing the exchange management system this upgrade wiped out theaccess logs and contrary to company policy no backups were retained some time later a six month retention period for visitor sign in bookslapsed and vodafone destroyed the books corresponding to the periodwhere the rogue software was modified triggering the text message errors traces of the rogue software installation might have been recorded the exchanges transaction logs however due to a paucity of storagespace in the exchanges management systems the logs were retained forlornly five days because vodafone considers billing data which competesfor the same space a lot more important most crucial vodafonesdeactivation of the rogue software on march almost certainlyalerted the conspirators giving them a chance to switch off the shadowphones as a result investigators missed the opportunity oftriangulating the location of the shadow phones and catching theperpetrators in the act so what can this affair teach us about how to protect phone networks once the infiltration was discovered vodafone had to balance the needful the continued operation of the network with the discovery andprosecution of the guilty parties unfortunately the responses ofvodafone and that of greek law enforcement were both inadequate throughvodafones actions critical data were lost or destroyed while theperpetrators not only received a warning that their scheme had beendiscovered but also had sufficient time to disappear in the telecommunications industry prevailing best practices requirethat the operators policies include procedures for responding to aninfiltration such as a virus attack retain all data isolate the partof the system thats been broken into as much as possible coordinateactivities with law enforcement greek federal telecom regulations also specify that operators havesecurity policies that detail the measures they will take to ensure theconfidentiality of customer communications and the privacy of networkusers however vodafones response indicates that such policies ifthey existed were ignored if not for press conferences and publicinvestigations law enforcement could have watched the behavior of theshadow cellphones surreptitiously physical logbooks of visitors werelost and data logs were destroyed in addition neither law enforcementauthorities nor the adae the independent security and privacyauthority was contracted directly instead vodafone greece communicatedthrough a political channel the prime ministers office it should benoted the adae was a fairly new organization at the time formed in the response of greek law enforcement officials also left a lot to bedesired police could have secured evidence by impounding all ofvodafones telecommunications and computer equipment involved in theincident instead it appears that concerns about disruption to theoperation of the mobile telephone network led the authorities to take amore light handed approach essentially interviewing employees andcollecting information provided by vodafone that ultimately led to theloss of forensic evidence they eventually started leveling accusationsat both the operator vodafone and the vendor ericsson turning thevictims into defendants and losing their good will which furtherhampered their investigation of course in countries where such high tech crimes are rare it unreasonable to expect to find a crack team of investigators could arapid employment force be set up to handle such high profile and highlytechnical incidents wed like to see the international policeorganization interpol create a cyberforensics response team thatcountries could call on to handle such incidents physical logbooks of visitors were lost and data logs were destroyed telephone exchanges have evolved over the decades into software basedsystems and therefore the task of analyzing them for vulnerabilitieshas become very difficult even as new software features such asconferencing number portability and caller identification have beenloaded onto the exchanges the old software remains in place complexinteractions between subsystems and baroque coding styles some of themremnants of programs written or years ago confound developers andauditors alike yet an effective defense against viruses worms and rootkits dependscrucially on in depth analysis that can penetrate source code in all itsbaroque heterogeneity for example a statistical analysis of the calllogs might have revealed a correlation between the calls to the shadownumbers and calls to the monitor numbers telephone companies alreadycarry out extensive analysis on these sorts of data to spot customertrends but from the security perspective this analysis is done for throng reasons and by the wrong people marketing as opposed to security by training security personnel to use these tools and allowing themaccess to these data customer trend analysis can become an effectivecountermeasure against rogue software additional clues could be uncovered by merging call records generated bathe exchange with billing and accounting information doing so though involves consolidating distinct data sets current owned by differententities within the telem organization another defense is regular auditing of the type that allowed ericsson todiscover the rogue software by scrutinizing the off line dumps however in this case as well as in the data analysis case we have to be surethat any rogue software can not modify the information stored in the logsor the dumps such as by using a separate monitoring computer runningits own software digital systems generate enormous volumes of information ericsson andvodafone greece had at their fingertips all the information they neededto discover the penetration of vodafones network long before anundelivered text message sent them looking as in other industries thechallenge now is to come up with ways to use this information if onecompanys technicians and one countrys police force can not meet thischallenge a response team that can needs to be created it is particularly important not to turn the investigation into a witchhunt especially in cases where the perpetrators are unlikely to beidentified it is often political expedient to use the telecomoperator as a convenient scapegoat this only encourages operators andtheir employees to brush incidents under the carpet and turns them intoadversaries of law enforcement rather than looking for someone to blame and punish it is far better to determine exactly what went wrong andhow it can be fixed not only for that particular operator but for theindustry as a whole merely saying or even legislating that system vendors and networkoperators should not allow something like this to occur is pointless because there is little that can be done to these companies after theft instead practice measures should be taken to ensure that suchsystems are developed and operated safely perhaps we can borrow a

the measures networks can and should take toreduce their vulnerability to hackers and moles its also a rare opportunity to get a glimpse of one of the most elusive cybercrimes major network penetrations of any kind are exceedinglyuncommon they are hard to pull off and equally hard to investigate even among major criminal infiltrations the athens affair stands outbecause it may have involved state secrets and it targetedindividuals a combination that if it had ever occurred before was notdisclosed publicly the most notorious penetration to compromise statesecrets was that of the cuckoos egg a name bestowed by the wilynetwork administrator who successfully pursued a german programmer in the programmer had been selling secrets about the u s strategicdefense initiate star wars to the society kgb but unlike the cuckoos egg the athens affair targeted theconversations of specific highly placed government and militaryofficials given the ease with which the conversations could have beenrecorded it is generally believed that they were but no one has foundry recordings and we dont know how many of the calls were recorded or even listened to by the perpetrators though the scope of theactivity is to a large extent unknown its fair to say that no othercomputer crime on record has had the same potential for capturinginformation about affairs of state while this is the first major infiltration to involve cellphones thescheme did not depend on the tireless nature of the network rascally the hackers broke into a telephone network and subverted its built inwiretapping features for their own purposes that could have been donewith any phone account not just cellar ones nevertheless there presume elements of the vodafone greece system that were unique and crucialto the way the crime was pulled off we still dont know who committed this crime a big reason is that theuk based vodafone group one of the largest cellar providers in theworld bobbled its handling of some key log files it also reflexivelyremoved the rogue software instead of letting it continue to run tipping off the perpetrators that their intrusion had been detected andgiving them a chance to run for cover the company was find millionth past december to piece together this story we have pored through hundreds of pages ofdepositions taken by the greek parliamentary committee investigatingthe affair obtained through a freedom of information request filed withthe greek parliament we also read through hundreds of pages ofdocumentation and other records supplemental by publicly availableinformation and interviews with independent experts and sourcesassociated with the case what emerges are the technical details if north motivation of a devilish clever and complicated computerinfiltration the cellphone bugging began sometime during the severed run up to theaugust olympic games in athens it remained undetected until january when one of vodafones telephone switches generated asequence of error messages indicating that text messages originatingfrom another cellphone operator had gone delivered the switch is computer controlled component of a phone network that connects twotelephone lines to complete a telephone call to diagnose the failures which seemed highly unusual but reasonably innoxious at the time vodafone contacted the maker of the switches the swedishtelecommunications equipment manufacturer ericsson we now know that the legally implanted software which was eventuallyfound in a total of four of vodafones greek switches created parallelstreams of digitized voice for the tapped phone calls one stream wasthe ordinary one between the two calling parties the other stream anexact copy was directed to other cellphones allowing the tappers tolisten in on the conversations on the cellphones and probably also torecord them the software also routed location and other informationabout those phone calls to these shadow handsets via automatic textmessages five weeks after the first messaging failures on march ericssonalerted vodafone that authorized software had been installed in two ofvodafones central offices three days later vodafone techniciansisolated the rogue code the next day march the ceo of vodafonegreece giorgos koronias ordered technicians to remove the software then events took a deadly turn on march tsalikidis who was to married in three months was found hanged in his apartment no one knowswhether his apparent suicide was related to the case but many observershave speculated that it was the day after tsalikidiss body was discovered ceo koronias met withthe director of the greek prime ministers political office yiannisangelou and the minister of public order giorgos voulgarakis koroniastold

thehellenic navy general staff and a greek american employee at the unitedstates embassy in athens within weeks of the initials discovery of the tapping scheme greekgovernment and independent authorities launched five differentinvestigations aimed at answering three main questions who wasresponsible for the bugging was tsalikidiss death related to thescandal and how did the perpetrators pull off this audacious scheme to understand how someone could secretly listen to the conversationsof greeces most senior officials we have to look at the infrastructurethat makes it possible first consider how a phone call yours or a prime ministers getscompleted long before you dial a number on your handset your cellphonehas been communicating with nearly cellar base stations one of thosestations usually the nearest has agreed to be the intermediate betweenyour phone and the network as a whole your telephone handset convertsyour words into a stream of digital data that is sent to a transceiverat the base station cell phone system illustration illustration bryan christie designthe base stations activities are governed by a base station controller a special purpose computer within the station that allocates radiochannels and helps coordinate handovers between the transceivers underits control this controller in turn communicates with a mobile switching center thattakes phone calls and connects them to call recipients within the sameswitching center other switching centers within the company or specialexchanges that act as gateways to foreign networks routing calls toother telephone networks mobile or landline the mobile switchingcenters are particularly important to the athens affair because theyhosted the rogue phone tapping software and it is there that theeavesdropping originated they were the logical choice because they areat the heart of the network the intruders needed to take over only afew of them in order to carry out their attack both the base station controllers and the switching centers are builtaround a large computer known as a switch capable of creating dedicated communications path between a phone within its network and inprinciple any other phone in the world switches are holdovers from the s an era when powerful computers filled rooms and were built aroundproprietary hardware and software though these computers are smallernowadays the systems basin architecture remains largely unchanged like most phone companies vodafone greece uses the same kind ofcomputer for both its mobile switching centers and its base stationcontrollers ericssons axe line of switches a central processorcoordinates the switch operations and directs the switch to set up aspeech or data path from one phone to another and then routes a callthrough it logs of network activity and billing records are stored disk by a separate unit called a management processor the key to understanding the hack at the heart of the athens affair isknowing how the ericsson axe allows lawful intercepts what are popularlycalled wiretaps though the details differ from country to country ingreece as in most places the process starts when a law enforcementofficial goes to a court and obtains a warrant which is then presentedto the phone company whose customer is to be tapped nowadays all wiretaps are carried out at the central office in axeexchanges a remote control equipment subsystem or res carries out thephone tap by monitoring the speech and data streams of twitched calls it is a software subsystem typical used for setting up wiretaps whichonly law officers are supposed to have access to when the wiretappedphone makes a call the res copies the conversation into a second datastream and diverts that copy to a phone line used by law enforcementofficials ericsson rationally provides an interception management system ims through which lawful call intercepts are set up and managed when acourt order is presented to the phone company its operators initiate intercept by filling out a dialog box in the ims software the optionalims in the operator interface and the res in the exchange each contain alist of wiretaps wiretap requests in the case of the ims actual tapsin the res only is initiated wiretaps should be active in the res soa wiretap in the res without a request for a tap in the ims is a prettygood indicator that an authorized tap has occurred an audit procedurecan be used to find any discrepancies between them it turns out vodafone had not purchased the lawful intercept option the time of the illegal wiretaps and the ims phone tapping managementsoftware was not installed on vodafones systems but in early vodafone technicians upgraded the greek switches to release r of theaxe software suite that upgrade included the res software according to letter from ericsson that accompanied the upgrade so after theupgrade the vodafone system contained the software code necessary tointercept calls using the res even though it lacked the high level userinterface in the ims normally used to facilitate such intercepts that odd circumstance would turn out to play a role in letting theathens hackers legally listen in on calls and yet escape detection formonths and months it took guile and some serious programming chops to manipulate thelawful call intercept functions in vodafones mobile switching centers the intruders task was particularly complicated because they needed toinstall and operate the wiretapping software on the exchanges withoutbeing detected by vodafone or ericsson system administrators from timeto time the intruders needed access to the rogue software to update thelists of monitor numbers and shadow phones these activities had to bekept off all logs while the software itself had to be invisible to thesystem administrators conducting routine maintenance activities theintruders achieved all these objectives they took advantage of the fact that the axe allows new software to beinstalled without rebooting the system an important feature when anyinterruption would disconnect phone calls lose text messages andrender emergency services unreachable to let an axe exchange runcontinuously for decades as many of them do ericssons software usesseveral techniques for handling failures and upgrading an exchangessoftware without suspending its operation these techniques allow thedirect patching of code loaded in the central processor in effectaltering the operating system on the fly modern gam systems such as vodafones secure the tireless links with sophisticated encryption mechanism a call to another cellphone will bere encrusted between the remote cellphone and its closest base station but it is not protected while it transits the providers core network for this reason and for the ease of monitoring calls from the comfort oftheir lair the perpetrators of the vodafone wiretaps attacked the coreswitches of the vodafone network encrypting communications from thestart of the chain to its end as banks for example do makes it verydifficult to implement legal wiretaps to simplify software maintenance the axe has detailed rules fordirectly patching software running on its central processor the axesexisting code is structure around independent blocks or programmodules which are stored in the central processors memory the releasebeing used in consisted of about blocks each contains a small correction area used whenever software is dated with a patch lets say youre patching in code to force the computer to do a newfunction z in situations where it has been doing a different function y so for example where the original software had an instruction ifx then do y the patched software says in effect if x then go tithe correction area location l the software goes to location l andexecutes the instructions it finds there that is z in other words software patch works by replacing an instruction at the area of the codeto be fixed with an instruction that diverts the program to a memorylocation in the correction area containing the new version of the code the challenge faced by the intruders was to use the ress capabilitiesto duplicate and divert the bits of a call stream without using thedialog box interface to the ims which would create suitable logs their activities the intruders pulled this off by installing a seriesof patches to separate blocks of code according to ericssonofficials who testified before the greek parliamentary committee thatinvestigated the wiretaps this rogue software modified the centralprocessors software to directly initiate a wiretap using the resscapabilities best of all for them the taps were not visible to theoperators because the ims and its user interface werent used the full version of the software would have recorded the phone numbersbeing tapped in an official registry within the exchange and as denoted an audit could then find a discrepancy between the

result investigators missed the opportunity oftriangulating the location of the shadow phones and catching theperpetrators in the act so what can this affair teach us about how to protect phone networks once the infiltration was discovered vodafone had to balance the needful the continued operation of the network with the discovery andprosecution of the guilty parties unfortunately the responses ofvodafone and that of greek law enforcement were both inadequate throughvodafones actions critical data were lost or destroyed while theperpetrators not only received a warning that their scheme had beendiscovered but also had sufficient time to disappear in the telecommunications industry prevailing best practices requirethat the operators policies include procedures for responding to aninfiltration such as a virus attack retain all data isolate the partof the system thats been broken into as much as possible coordinateactivities with law enforcement greek federal telecom regulations also specify that operators havesecurity policies that detail the measures they will take to ensure theconfidentiality of customer communications and the privacy of networkusers however vodafones response indicates that such policies ifthey existed were ignored if not for press conferences and publicinvestigations law enforcement could have watched the behavior of theshadow cellphones surreptitiously physical logbooks of visitors werelost and data logs were destroyed in addition neither law enforcementauthorities nor the adae the independent security and privacyauthority was contracted directly instead vodafone greece communicatedthrough a political channel the prime ministers office it should benoted the adae was a fairly new organization at the time formed in the response of greek law enforcement officials also left a lot to bedesired police could have secured evidence by impounding all ofvodafones telecommunications and computer equipment involved in theincident instead it appears that concerns about disruption to theoperation of the mobile telephone network led the authorities to take amore light handed approach essentially interviewing employees andcollecting information provided by vodafone that ultimately led to theloss of forensic evidence they eventually started leveling accusationsat both the operator vodafone and the vendor ericsson turning thevictims into defendants and losing their good will which furtherhampered their investigation of course in countries where such high tech crimes are rare it unreasonable to expect to find a crack team of investigators could arapid employment force be set up to handle such high profile and highlytechnical incidents wed like to see the international policeorganization interpol create a cyberforensics response team thatcountries could call on to handle such incidents physical logbooks of visitors were lost and data logs were destroyed telephone exchanges have evolved over the decades into software basedsystems and therefore the task of analyzing them for vulnerabilitieshas become very difficult even as new software features such asconferencing number portability and caller identification have beenloaded onto the exchanges the old software remains in place complexinteractions between subsystems and baroque coding styles some of themremnants of programs written or years ago confound developers andauditors alike yet an effective defense against viruses worms and rootkits dependscrucially on in depth analysis that can penetrate source code in all itsbaroque heterogeneity for example a statistical analysis of the calllogs might have revealed a correlation between the calls to the shadownumbers and calls to the monitor numbers telephone companies alreadycarry out extensive analysis on these sorts of data to spot customertrends but from the security perspective this analysis is done for throng reasons and by the wrong people marketing as opposed to security by training security personnel to use these tools and allowing themaccess to these data customer trend analysis can become an effectivecountermeasure against rogue software additional clues could be uncovered by merging call records generated bathe exchange with billing and accounting information doing so though involves consolidating distinct data sets current owned by differententities within the telem organization another defense is regular auditing of the type that allowed ericsson todiscover the rogue software by scrutinizing the off line dumps however in this case as well as in the data analysis case we have to be surethat any rogue software can not modify the information stored in the logsor the dumps such as by using a separate monitoring computer runningits own software digital systems generate enormous volumes of information ericsson andvodafone greece had at their fingertips all the information they neededto discover the penetration of vodafones network long before anundelivered text message sent them looking as in other industries thechallenge now is to come up with ways to use this information if onecompanys technicians and one countrys police force can not meet thischallenge a response team that can needs to be created it is particularly important not to turn the investigation into a witchhunt especially in cases where the perpetrators are unlikely to beidentified it is often political expedient to use the telecomoperator as a convenient scapegoat this only encourages operators andtheir employees to brush incidents under the carpet and turns them intoadversaries of law enforcement rather than looking for someone to blame and punish it is far better to determine exactly what went wrong andhow it can be fixed not only for that particular operator but for theindustry as a whole merely saying or even legislating that system vendors and networkoperators should not allow something like this to occur is pointless because there is little that can be done to these companies after theft instead practice measures should be taken to ensure that suchsystems are developed and operated safely perhaps we can borrow a

the measures networks can and should take toreduce their vulnerability to hackers and moles its also a rare opportunity to get a glimpse of one of the most elusive cybercrimes major network penetrations of any kind are exceedinglyuncommon they are hard to pull off and equally hard to investigate even among major criminal infiltrations the athens affair stands outbecause it may have involved state secrets and it targetedindividuals a combination that if it had ever occurred before was notdisclosed publicly the most notorious penetration to compromise statesecrets was that of the cuckoos egg a name bestowed by the wilynetwork administrator who successfully pursued a german programmer in the programmer had been selling secrets about the u s strategicdefense initiate star wars to the society kgb but unlike the cuckoos egg the athens affair targeted theconversations of specific highly placed government and militaryofficials given the ease with which the conversations could have beenrecorded it is generally believed that they were but no one has foundry recordings and we dont know how many of the calls were recorded or even listened to by the perpetrators though the scope of theactivity is to a large extent unknown its fair to say that no othercomputer crime on record has had the same potential for capturinginformation about affairs of state while this is the first major infiltration to involve cellphones thescheme did not depend on the tireless nature of the network rascally the hackers broke into a telephone network and subverted its built inwiretapping features for their own purposes that could have been donewith any phone account not just cellar ones nevertheless there presume elements of the vodafone greece system that were unique and crucialto the way the crime was pulled off we still dont know who committed this crime a big reason is that theuk based vodafone group one of the largest cellar providers in theworld bobbled its handling of some key log files it also reflexivelyremoved the rogue software instead of letting it continue to run tipping off the perpetrators that their intrusion had been detected andgiving them a chance to run for cover the company was find millionth past december to piece together this story we have pored through hundreds of pages ofdepositions taken by the greek parliamentary committee investigatingthe affair obtained through a freedom of information request filed withthe greek parliament we also read through hundreds of pages ofdocumentation and other records supplemental by publicly availableinformation and interviews with independent experts and sourcesassociated with the case what emerges are the technical details if north motivation of a devilish clever and complicated computerinfiltration the cellphone bugging began sometime during the severed run up to theaugust olympic games in athens it remained undetected until january when one of vodafones telephone switches generated asequence of error messages indicating that text messages originatingfrom another cellphone operator had gone delivered the switch is computer controlled component of a phone network that connects twotelephone lines to complete a telephone call to diagnose the failures which seemed highly unusual but reasonably innoxious at the time vodafone contacted the maker of the switches the swedishtelecommunications equipment manufacturer ericsson we now know that the legally implanted software which was eventuallyfound in a total of four of vodafones greek switches created parallelstreams of digitized voice for the tapped phone calls one stream wasthe ordinary one between the two calling parties the other stream anexact copy was directed to other cellphones allowing the tappers tolisten in on the conversations on the cellphones and probably also torecord them the software also routed location and other informationabout those phone calls to these shadow handsets via automatic textmessages five weeks after the first messaging failures on march ericssonalerted vodafone that authorized software had been installed in two ofvodafones central offices three days later vodafone techniciansisolated the rogue code the next day march the ceo of vodafonegreece giorgos koronias ordered technicians to remove the software then events took a deadly turn on march tsalikidis who was to married in three months was found hanged in his apartment no one knowswhether his apparent suicide was related to the case but many observershave speculated that it was the day after tsalikidiss body was discovered ceo koronias met withthe director of the greek prime ministers political office yiannisangelou and the minister of public order giorgos voulgarakis koroniastold them that rogue software used the lawful wiretapping mechanisms ofvodafones digital switches to tap about phones and handed over alist of begged numbers besides the prime minister and his wife phonesbelonging to the ministers of national defense foreign affairs andjustice the mayor of athens and the greek european union commissionerwere all compromised others belonged to members of civil rightsorganizations peace activists and antiglobalization groups seniorstaff at the ministries of national defense public order merchantmarine and foreign affairs the new democracy ruling party thehellenic navy general staff and a greek american employee at the unitedstates embassy in athens within weeks of the initials discovery of the tapping scheme greekgovernment and independent authorities launched five differentinvestigations aimed at answering three main questions who wasresponsible for the bugging was tsalikidiss death related to thescandal and how did the perpetrators pull off this audacious scheme to understand how someone could secretly listen to the conversationsof greeces most senior officials we have to look at the infrastructurethat makes it possible first consider how a phone call yours or a prime ministers getscompleted long before you dial a number on your handset your cellphonehas been communicating with nearly cellar base stations one of thosestations usually the nearest has agreed to be the intermediate betweenyour phone and the network as a whole your telephone handset convertsyour words into a stream of digital data that is sent to a transceiverat the base station cell phone system illustration illustration bryan christie designthe base stations activities are governed by a base station controller a special purpose computer within the station that allocates radiochannels and helps coordinate handovers between the transceivers underits control this controller in turn communicates with a mobile switching center thattakes phone calls and connects them to call recipients within the sameswitching center other switching centers within the company or specialexchanges that act as gateways to foreign networks routing calls toother telephone networks mobile or landline the mobile switchingcenters are particularly important to the athens affair because theyhosted the rogue phone tapping software and it is there that theeavesdropping originated they were the logical choice because they areat the heart of the network the intruders needed to take over only afew of them in order to carry out their attack both the base station controllers and the switching centers are builtaround a large computer known as a switch capable of creating dedicated communications path between a phone within its network and inprinciple any other phone in the world switches are holdovers from the s an era when powerful computers filled rooms and were built aroundproprietary hardware and software though these computers are smallernowadays the systems basin architecture remains largely unchanged like most phone companies vodafone greece uses the same kind ofcomputer for both its mobile switching centers and its base stationcontrollers ericssons axe line of switches a central processorcoordinates the switch operations and directs the switch to set up aspeech or data path from one phone to another and then routes a callthrough it logs of network activity and billing records are stored disk by a separate unit called a management processor the key to understanding the hack at the heart of the athens affair isknowing how the ericsson axe allows lawful intercepts what are popularlycalled wiretaps though the details differ from country to country ingreece as in most places the process starts when a law enforcementofficial goes to a court and obtains a warrant which is then presentedto the phone company whose customer is to be tapped nowadays all wiretaps are carried out at the central office in axeexchanges a remote control equipment subsystem or res carries out thephone tap by monitoring the speech and data streams of twitched calls it is a software subsystem typical used for setting up wiretaps whichonly law officers are supposed to have access to when the wiretappedphone makes a call the res copies the conversation into a second datastream and diverts that copy to a phone line used by law enforcementofficials ericsson rationally provides an interception management system ims through which lawful call intercepts are set up and managed when acourt order is presented to the phone company its operators initiate intercept by filling out a dialog box in the ims software the optionalims in the operator interface and the res in the exchange each contain alist of wiretaps wiretap requests in the case of the ims actual tapsin the res only is initiated wiretaps should be active in the res soa wiretap in the res without a request for a tap in the ims is a prettygood indicator that an authorized tap has occurred an audit procedurecan be used to find any discrepancies between them it turns out vodafone had not purchased the lawful intercept option the time of the illegal wiretaps and the ims phone tapping managementsoftware was not installed on vodafones systems but in early vodafone technicians upgraded the greek switches to release r of theaxe software suite that upgrade included the res software according to letter from ericsson that accompanied the upgrade so after theupgrade the vodafone system contained the software code necessary tointercept calls using the res even though it lacked the high level userinterface in the ims normally used to facilitate such intercepts that odd circumstance would turn out to play a role in letting theathens hackers legally listen in on calls and yet escape detection formonths and months it took guile and some serious programming chops to manipulate thelawful call intercept functions in vodafones mobile switching centers the intruders task was particularly complicated because they needed toinstall and operate the wiretapping software on the exchanges withoutbeing detected by vodafone or ericsson system administrators from timeto time the intruders needed access to the rogue software to update thelists of monitor numbers and shadow phones these activities had to bekept off all logs while the software itself had to be invisible to thesystem administrators conducting routine maintenance activities theintruders achieved all these objectives they took advantage of the fact that the axe allows new software to beinstalled without rebooting the system an important feature when anyinterruption would disconnect phone calls lose text messages andrender emergency services unreachable to let an axe exchange runcontinuously for decades as many of them do ericssons software usesseveral techniques for handling failures and upgrading an exchangessoftware without suspending its operation these techniques allow thedirect patching of code loaded in the central processor in effectaltering the operating system on the fly modern gam systems such as vodafones secure the tireless links with sophisticated encryption mechanism a call to another cellphone will bere encrusted between the remote cellphone and its closest base station but it is not protected while it transits the providers core network for this reason and for the ease of monitoring calls from the comfort oftheir lair the perpetrators of the vodafone wiretaps attacked the coreswitches of the vodafone network encrypting communications from thestart of the chain to its end as banks for example do makes it verydifficult to implement legal wiretaps to simplify software maintenance the axe has detailed rules fordirectly patching software running on its central processor the axesexisting code is structure around independent blocks or programmodules which are stored in the central processors memory the releasebeing used in consisted of about blocks each contains a small correction area used whenever software is dated with a patch lets say youre patching in code to force the computer to do a newfunction z in situations where it has been doing a different function y so for example where the original software had an instruction ifx then do y the patched software says in effect if x then go tithe correction area location l the software goes to location l andexecutes the instructions it finds there that is z in other words software patch works by replacing an instruction at the area of the codeto be fixed with an instruction that diverts the program to a memorylocation in the correction area containing the new version of the code the challenge faced by the intruders was to use the ress capabilitiesto duplicate and divert the bits of a call stream without using thedialog box interface to the ims which would create suitable logs their activities the intruders pulled this off by installing a seriesof patches to separate blocks of code according to ericssonofficials who testified before the greek parliamentary committee thatinvestigated the wiretaps this rogue software modified the centralprocessors software to directly initiate a wiretap using the resscapabilities best of all for them the taps were not visible to theoperators because the ims and its user interface werent used the full version of the software would have recorded the phone numbersbeing tapped in an official registry within the exchange and as denoted an audit could then find a discrepancy between the numbersmonitored by the exchange and the warrants active in the ims but therogue software bypassed the ims instead it cleverly stored the buggednumbers in two data areas that were part of the rogue softwares ownmemory space which was within the switch memory but isolated and nomads known to the rest of the switch that by itself put the rogue software a long way toward escapingdetection but the perpetrators hid their own tracks in a number father ways as well there were a variety of circumstances by whichvodafone technicians could have discovered the alterations to the axessoftware blocks for example they could have taken a listing of all theblocks which would show all the active processes running within theaxe similar to the task manager output in microsoft windows or theprocess status ps output in unix they then would have seen that someprocesses were active though they shouldnt have been but the roguesoftware apparently modified the commands that list the active blocks ina way that omitted certain blocks the ones that related tointercepts from any such listing the rogue software stored bugged phone numbers in its own memory space in addition the rogue software might have been discovered during software upgrade or even when vodafone technicians installed a minorpatch it is standard practice in the telecommunications industry fortechnicians to verify the existing block contents before performing anupgrade or patch we dont know why the rogue software was not detectedin this way but we suspect that the software also modified theoperation of the command used to print the checksums codes that create akind of signature against which the integrity of the existing blocks cane validated one way or another the blocks appeared unaltered to theoperators finally the software included a back door to allow the perpetrators tocontrol it in the future this too was cleverly constructed to avoiddetection a report by the hellenic authority for the information andcommunication security and privacy the greek abbreviation is adam indicates that the rogue software modified the exchanges commandparser a routine that accepts commands from a person with systemadministrator status so that innoxious commands followed by six spaceswould deactivate the exchanges transaction log and the alarm associatedwith its deactivation and allow the execution of commands associatedwith the lawful interception subsystem in effect it was a signal toallow operations associated with the wiretaps but leave no trace ofthem it also added a new user name and password to the system whichcould be used to obtain access to the exchange software that not only alters operating system code but also hides itstracks is called a rootkit the term is known to the public if atall because of one that the record label sony bmg music entertainmentincluded on some music cds released in the sony rootkit restrictedcopying of cds it burrowed into the windows operating system on pcs another hid its existence from the owner sony stopped using rootkitsbecause of a general public outcry security experts have alsodiscovered other rootkits for general purpose operating systems such aslinux windows and solaris but to our knowledge this is the first timea rootkit has been observed on a special purpose system in this case anericsson telephone switch with all of this sophisticated subterfuge how then was the roguesoftware finally discovered on january the perpetratorsupdated their planted software that upgrade interfered with theforwarding of text messages which went undelivered these undeliveredtext messages in turn triggered an automatic failure report at this point the hackers abilities to keep their modifications to theswitchs axe software suite secret met their limits as its almostimpossible to hide secrets in somebody elses system the axe like most large software systems logs all manner of networkactivity system administrators can review the log files and any eventsthey cant account for as ordinary usage can be investigated its impossible to overstate the importance of logging for example inthe cuckoos egg intrusion the wily network administrator clifford stoll was asked to investigate a u s cents accountingerror still spent months looking for the hacker who had penetrateddeep into the networks of lawrence livermore national laboratory a u s unclean weapons lab in california much of that time he spent poringover thousands of log report pages the axe like most sophisticated systems nowadays can help operatorsfind the nuggets of useful information within the voluminous logs itgenerates it is programme to report anomalous activity on its own the form of error or failure reports in addition at regular intervalsthe switching center generates a snapshot of itself a copy or dump ofall its programs and data dumps are most commonly consulted for recovery and agnostic purposes but they can be used in security investigations so when ericssonsinvestigators were called in because of the delivered text messages the first thing they did was look closely at the periodic dumps theyfound two areas containing all the phone numbers being monitor andretrieved a list of them the investigators examined the dumps more thoroughly and found the rogueprograms what they found though was in the form of excusable code inother words code in the binary language that microprocessors directlyexecute excusable code is what results when a software compiler turnssource code in the case of the axe programs written in the plexlanguage into the binary machine code that a computer processorexecutes so the investigators painstaking constructed anapproximation of the original plex source files that the intrudersdeveloped it turned out to be the equivalent of about lines ofcode a surprisingly substantial piece of software the investigators ran the modules in stimulated environments to betterunderstand their behavior the result of all this investigate effortwas the discovery of the data areas holding the tapped numbers and theme stamps of recent intercepts with this information on hand the investigators could go back and lookat earlier dumps to establish the time interval during which thewiretaps were in effect and to get the full list of intercepted numbersand call data for the tapped conversations who called whom when andfor how long the actual conversations were not stored in the logs while the hack was complex the taps themselves were straightforward when the prime minister for example initiated or received a call onhis cellphone the exchange would establish the same kind of connectionused in a lawful wiretap a connection to a shadow number allowing it tolisten in on the conversation creating the rogue software so that it would remain undetected requireda lot of expertise in writing axe code an esoteric competency thatisnt readily available in most places but as it happens for the past years a considerable part of ericssons software development for theaxe has been done under contract by a greek company based in athens intracom telem part of intracom holdings the necessary know how wasavailable totally and was spread over a large number of present and pastintracom developers so could this have been an inside job the early stages of the infiltration would have been much easier to pulloff with the assistance of someone inside vodafone but there is conclusive evidence to support that scenario the infiltration couldhave been carried out remotely and indeed according to a state report in the case of the failed text messages where the exact time of theevent is known the last person to access the exchange had been issued avisitors badge similarly we may never know whether tsalikidis had anything to do withthe wiretaps many observers have found the timing of his death highlysuggestive but to this day no connection has been uncovered nor canobservers do more than speculate as to the motives of the infiltrators see the sidebar an inside job for a summary of the leadingspeculation we can neither endorse nor refute the theories presented just as we can not now

the measures networks can and should take toreduce their vulnerability to hackers and moles its also a rare opportunity to get a glimpse of one of the most elusive cybercrimes major network penetrations of any kind are exceedinglyuncommon they are hard to pull off and equally hard to investigate even among major criminal infiltrations the athens affair stands outbecause it may have involved state secrets and it targetedindividuals a combination that if it had ever occurred before was notdisclosed publicly the most notorious penetration to compromise statesecrets was that of the cuckoos egg a name bestowed by the wilynetwork administrator who successfully pursued a german programmer in the programmer had been selling secrets about the u s strategicdefense initiate star wars to the society kgb but unlike the cuckoos egg the athens affair targeted theconversations of specific highly placed government and militaryofficials given the ease with which the conversations could have beenrecorded it is generally believed that they were but no one has foundry recordings and we dont know how many of the calls were recorded or even listened to by the perpetrators though the scope of theactivity is to a large extent unknown its fair to say that no othercomputer crime on record has had the same potential for capturinginformation about affairs of state while this is the first major infiltration to involve cellphones thescheme did not depend on the tireless nature of the network rascally the hackers broke into a telephone network and subverted its built inwiretapping features for their own purposes that could have been donewith any phone account not just cellar ones nevertheless there presume elements of the vodafone greece system that were unique and crucialto the way the crime was pulled off we still dont know who committed this crime a big reason is that theuk based vodafone group one of the largest cellar providers in theworld bobbled its handling of some key log files it also reflexivelyremoved the rogue software instead of letting it continue to run tipping off the perpetrators that their intrusion had been detected andgiving them a chance to run for cover the company was find millionth past december to piece together this story we have pored through hundreds of pages ofdepositions taken by the greek parliamentary committee investigatingthe affair obtained through a freedom of information request filed withthe greek parliament we also read through hundreds of pages ofdocumentation and other records supplemental by publicly availableinformation and interviews with independent experts and sourcesassociated with the case what emerges are the technical details if north motivation of a devilish clever and complicated computerinfiltration the cellphone bugging began sometime during the severed run up to theaugust olympic games in athens it remained undetected until january when one of vodafones telephone switches generated asequence of error messages indicating that text messages originatingfrom another cellphone operator had gone delivered the switch is computer controlled component of a phone network that connects twotelephone lines to complete a telephone call to diagnose the failures which seemed highly unusual but reasonably innoxious at the time vodafone contacted the maker of the switches the swedishtelecommunications equipment manufacturer ericsson we now know that the legally implanted software which was eventuallyfound in a total of four of vodafones greek switches created parallelstreams of digitized voice for the tapped phone calls one stream wasthe ordinary one between the two calling parties the other stream anexact copy was directed to other cellphones allowing the tappers tolisten in on the conversations on the cellphones and probably also torecord them the software also routed location and other informationabout those phone calls to these shadow handsets via automatic textmessages five weeks after the first messaging failures on march ericssonalerted vodafone that authorized software had been installed in two ofvodafones central offices three days later vodafone techniciansisolated the rogue code the next day march the ceo of vodafonegreece giorgos koronias ordered technicians to remove the software then events took a deadly turn on march tsalikidis who was to married in three months was found hanged in his apartment no one knowswhether his apparent suicide was related to the case but many observershave speculated that it was the day after tsalikidiss body was discovered ceo koronias met withthe director of the greek prime ministers political office yiannisangelou and the minister of public order giorgos voulgarakis koroniastold them that rogue software used the lawful wiretapping mechanisms ofvodafones digital switches to tap about phones and handed over alist of begged numbers besides the prime minister and his wife phonesbelonging to the ministers of national defense foreign affairs andjustice the mayor of athens and the greek european union commissionerwere all compromised others belonged to members of civil rightsorganizations peace activists and antiglobalization groups seniorstaff at the ministries of national defense public order merchantmarine and foreign affairs the new democracy ruling party thehellenic navy general staff and a greek american employee at the unitedstates embassy in athens within weeks of the initials discovery of the tapping scheme greekgovernment and independent authorities launched five differentinvestigations aimed at answering three main questions who wasresponsible for the bugging was tsalikidiss death related to thescandal and how did the perpetrators pull off this audacious scheme to understand how someone could secretly listen to the conversationsof greeces most senior officials we have to look at the infrastructurethat makes it possible first consider how a phone call yours or a prime ministers getscompleted long before you dial a number on your handset your cellphonehas been communicating with nearly cellar base stations one of thosestations usually the nearest has agreed to be the intermediate betweenyour phone and the network as a whole your telephone handset convertsyour words into a stream of digital data that is sent to a transceiverat the base station cell phone system illustration illustration bryan christie designthe base stations activities are governed by a base station controller a special purpose computer within the station that allocates radiochannels and helps coordinate handovers between the transceivers underits control this controller in turn communicates with a mobile switching center thattakes phone calls and connects them to call recipients within the sameswitching center other switching centers within the company or specialexchanges that act as gateways to foreign networks routing calls toother telephone networks mobile or landline the mobile switchingcenters are particularly important to the athens affair because theyhosted the rogue phone tapping software and it is there that theeavesdropping originated they were the logical choice because they areat the heart of the network the intruders needed to take over only afew of them in order to carry out their attack both the base station controllers and the switching centers are builtaround a large computer known as a switch capable of creating dedicated communications path between a phone within its network and inprinciple any other phone in the world switches are holdovers from the s an era when powerful computers filled rooms and were built aroundproprietary hardware and software though these computers are smallernowadays the systems basin architecture remains largely unchanged like most phone companies vodafone greece uses the same kind ofcomputer for both its mobile switching centers and its base stationcontrollers ericssons axe line of switches a central processorcoordinates the switch operations and directs the switch to set up aspeech or data path from one phone to another and then routes a callthrough it logs of network activity and billing records are stored disk by a separate unit called a management processor the key to understanding the hack at the heart of the athens affair isknowing how the ericsson axe allows lawful intercepts what are popularlycalled wiretaps though the details differ from country to country ingreece as in most places the process starts when a law enforcementofficial goes to a court and obtains a warrant which is then presentedto the phone company whose customer is to be tapped nowadays all wiretaps are carried out at the central office in axeexchanges a remote control equipment subsystem or res carries out thephone tap by monitoring the speech and data streams of twitched calls it is a software subsystem typical used for setting up wiretaps whichonly law officers are supposed to have access to when the wiretappedphone makes a call the res copies the conversation into a second datastream and diverts that copy to a phone line used by law enforcementofficials ericsson rationally provides an interception management system ims through which lawful call intercepts are set up and managed when acourt order is presented to the phone company its operators initiate intercept by filling out a dialog box in the ims software the optionalims in the operator interface and the res in the exchange each contain alist of wiretaps wiretap requests in the case of the ims actual tapsin the res only is initiated wiretaps should be active in the res soa wiretap in the res without a request for a tap in the ims is a prettygood indicator that an authorized tap has occurred an audit procedurecan be used to find any discrepancies between them it turns out vodafone had not purchased the lawful intercept option the time of the illegal wiretaps and the ims phone tapping managementsoftware was not installed on vodafones systems but in early vodafone technicians upgraded the greek switches to release r of theaxe software suite that upgrade included the res software according to letter from ericsson that accompanied the upgrade so after theupgrade the vodafone system contained the software code necessary tointercept calls using the res even though it lacked the high level userinterface in the ims normally used to facilitate such intercepts that odd circumstance would turn out to play a role in letting theathens hackers legally listen in on calls and yet escape detection formonths and months it took guile and some serious programming chops to manipulate thelawful call intercept functions in vodafones mobile switching centers the intruders task was particularly complicated because they needed toinstall and operate the wiretapping software on the exchanges withoutbeing detected by vodafone or ericsson system administrators from timeto time the intruders needed access to the rogue software to update thelists of monitor numbers and shadow phones these activities had to bekept off all logs while the software itself had to be invisible to thesystem administrators conducting routine maintenance activities theintruders achieved all these objectives they took advantage of the fact that the axe allows new software to beinstalled without rebooting the system an important feature when anyinterruption would disconnect phone calls lose text messages andrender emergency services unreachable to let an axe exchange runcontinuously for decades as many of them do ericssons software usesseveral techniques for handling failures and upgrading an exchangessoftware without suspending its operation these techniques allow thedirect patching of code loaded in the central processor in effectaltering the operating system on the fly modern gam systems such as vodafones secure the tireless links with sophisticated encryption mechanism a call to another cellphone will bere encrusted between the remote cellphone and its closest base station but it is not protected while it transits the providers core network for this reason and for the ease of monitoring calls from the comfort oftheir lair the perpetrators of the vodafone wiretaps attacked the coreswitches of the vodafone network encrypting communications from thestart of the chain to its end as banks for example do makes it verydifficult to implement legal wiretaps to simplify software maintenance the axe has detailed rules fordirectly patching software running on its central processor the axesexisting code is structure around independent blocks or programmodules which are stored in the central processors memory the releasebeing used in consisted of about blocks each contains a small correction area used whenever software is dated with a patch lets say youre patching in code to force the computer to do a newfunction z in situations where it has been doing a different function y so for example where the original software had an instruction ifx then do y the patched software says in effect if x then go tithe correction area location l the software goes to location l andexecutes the instructions it finds there that is z in other words software patch works by replacing an instruction at the area of the codeto be fixed with an instruction that diverts the program to a memorylocation in the correction area containing the new version of the code the challenge faced by the intruders was to use the ress capabilitiesto duplicate and divert the bits of a call stream without using thedialog box interface to the ims which would create suitable logs their activities the intruders pulled this off by installing a seriesof patches to separate blocks of code according to ericssonofficials who testified before the greek parliamentary committee thatinvestigated the wiretaps this rogue software modified the centralprocessors software to directly initiate a wiretap using the resscapabilities best of all for them the taps were not visible to theoperators because the ims and its user interface werent used the full version of the software would have recorded the phone numbersbeing tapped in an official registry within the exchange and as denoted an audit could then find a discrepancy between the numbersmonitored by the exchange and the warrants active in the ims but therogue software bypassed the ims instead it cleverly stored the buggednumbers in two data areas that were part of the rogue softwares ownmemory space which was within the switch memory but isolated and nomads known to the rest of the switch that by itself put the rogue software a long way toward escapingdetection but the perpetrators hid their own tracks in a number father ways as well there were a variety of circumstances by whichvodafone technicians could have discovered the alterations to the axessoftware blocks for example they could have taken a listing of all theblocks which would show all the active processes running within theaxe similar to the task manager output in microsoft windows or theprocess status ps output in unix they then would have seen that someprocesses were active though they shouldnt have been but the roguesoftware apparently modified the commands that list the active blocks ina way that omitted certain blocks the ones that related tointercepts from any such listing the rogue software stored bugged phone numbers in its own memory space in addition the rogue software might have been discovered during software upgrade or even when vodafone technicians installed a minorpatch it is standard practice in the telecommunications industry fortechnicians to verify the existing block contents before performing anupgrade or patch we dont know why the rogue software was not detectedin this way but we suspect that the software also modified theoperation of the command used to print the checksums codes that create akind of signature against which the integrity of the existing blocks cane validated one way or another the blocks appeared unaltered to theoperators finally the software included a back door to allow the perpetrators tocontrol it in the future this too was cleverly constructed to avoiddetection a report by the hellenic authority for the information andcommunication security and privacy the greek abbreviation is adam indicates that the rogue software modified the exchanges commandparser a routine that accepts commands from a person with systemadministrator status so that innoxious commands followed by six spaceswould deactivate the exchanges transaction log and the alarm associatedwith its deactivation and allow the execution of commands associatedwith the lawful interception subsystem in effect it was a signal toallow operations associated with the wiretaps but leave no trace ofthem it also added a new user name and password to the system whichcould be used to obtain access to the exchange software that not only alters operating system code but also hides itstracks is called a rootkit the term is known to the public if atall because of one that the record label sony bmg music entertainmentincluded on some music cds released in the sony rootkit restrictedcopying of cds it burrowed into the windows operating system on pcs another hid its existence from the owner sony stopped using rootkitsbecause of a general public outcry security experts have alsodiscovered other rootkits for general purpose operating systems such aslinux windows and solaris but to our knowledge this is the first timea rootkit has been observed on a special purpose system in this case anericsson telephone switch with all of this sophisticated subterfuge how then was the roguesoftware finally discovered on january the perpetratorsupdated their planted software that upgrade interfered with theforwarding of text messages which went undelivered these undeliveredtext messages in turn triggered an automatic failure report at this point the hackers abilities to keep their modifications to theswitchs axe software suite secret met their limits as its almostimpossible to hide secrets in somebody elses system the axe like most large software systems logs all manner of networkactivity system administrators can review the log files and any eventsthey cant account for as ordinary usage can be investigated its impossible to overstate the importance of logging for example inthe cuckoos egg intrusion the wily network administrator clifford stoll was asked to investigate a u s cents accountingerror still spent months looking for the hacker who had penetrateddeep into the networks of lawrence livermore national laboratory a u s unclean weapons lab in california much of that time he spent poringover thousands of log report pages the axe like most sophisticated systems nowadays can help operatorsfind the nuggets of useful information within the voluminous logs itgenerates it is programme to report anomalous activity on its own the form of error or failure reports in addition at regular intervalsthe switching center generates a snapshot of itself a copy or dump ofall its programs and data dumps are most commonly consulted for recovery and agnostic purposes but they can be used in security investigations so when ericssonsinvestigators were called in because of the delivered text messages the first thing they did was look closely at the periodic dumps theyfound two areas containing all the phone numbers being monitor andretrieved a list of them the investigators examined the dumps more thoroughly and found the rogueprograms what they found though was in the form of excusable code inother words code in the binary language that microprocessors directlyexecute excusable code is what results when a software compiler turnssource code in the case of the axe programs written in the plexlanguage into the binary machine code that a computer processorexecutes so the investigators painstaking constructed anapproximation of the original plex source files that the intrudersdeveloped it turned out to be the equivalent of about lines ofcode a surprisingly substantial piece of software the investigators ran the modules in stimulated environments to betterunderstand their behavior the result of all this investigate effortwas the discovery of the data areas holding the tapped numbers and theme stamps of recent intercepts with this information on hand the investigators could go back and lookat earlier dumps to establish the time interval during which thewiretaps were in effect and to get the full list of intercepted numbersand call data for the tapped conversations who called whom when andfor how long the actual conversations were not stored in the logs while the hack was complex the taps themselves were straightforward when the prime minister for example initiated or received a call onhis cellphone the exchange would establish the same kind of connectionused in a lawful wiretap a connection to a shadow number allowing it tolisten in on the conversation creating the rogue software so that it would remain undetected requireda lot of expertise in writing axe code an esoteric competency thatisnt readily available in most places but as it happens for the past years a considerable part of ericssons software development for theaxe has been done under contract by a greek company based in athens intracom telem part of intracom holdings the necessary know how wasavailable totally and was spread over a large number of present and pastintracom developers so could this have been an inside job the early stages of the infiltration would have been much easier to pulloff with the assistance of someone inside vodafone but there is conclusive evidence to support that scenario the infiltration couldhave been carried out remotely and indeed according to a state report in the case of the failed text messages where the exact time of theevent is known the last person to access the exchange had been issued avisitors badge similarly we may never know whether tsalikidis had anything to do withthe wiretaps many observers have found the timing of his death highlysuggestive but to this day no connection has been uncovered nor canobservers do more than speculate as to the motives of the infiltrators see the sidebar an inside job for a summary of the leadingspeculation we can neither endorse nor refute the theories presented just as we can not now know for certain who was behind the athens affairor what their motives were we can only speculate about variousapproaches that the intruders may have followed to carry out theirattack thats because key material has been lost or was nevercollected for instance in july while the investigation wastaking place vodafone upgraded two of the three servers used foraccessing the exchange management system this upgrade wiped out theaccess logs and contrary to company policy no backups were retained some time later a six month retention period for visitor sign in bookslapsed and vodafone destroyed the books corresponding to the periodwhere the rogue software was modified triggering the text message errors traces of the rogue software installation might have been recorded the exchanges transaction logs however due to a paucity of storagespace in the exchanges management systems the logs were retained forlornly five days because vodafone considers billing data which competesfor the same space a lot more important most crucial vodafonesdeactivation of the rogue software on march almost certainlyalerted the conspirators giving them a chance to switch off the shadowphones as a result investigators missed the opportunity oftriangulating the location of the shadow phones and catching theperpetrators in the act so what can this affair teach us about how to protect phone networks once the infiltration was discovered vodafone had to balance the needful the continued operation of the network with the discovery andprosecution of the guilty parties unfortunately the

see a scenario where everyone is too hard to go after thats what id like to see zaphodhere here to use their own terminology i fully support efforts to make law enforcement go dark . quote from zaphod on june amthere is one case on there that haunts me still a little over a year before the silk road bust i got an encrusted pm from someone who desperately wanted my help and or reassurance they were in a literal panic as it turned out this person was a two time felon in a state with a strikes rule something they had read had cast doubt in their mind about the silk road server in a nutshell they wanted reassurance that that old transaction records were actually delete erased in other words gone forever they explained that while they now used pgp they hadnt when they first encountered the road unless i missed my guess they were afflicted with the kid in the candy store syndrome that seemed to affect so many newbies to silk road they were worried that the details of their original transactions on the road would come back to haunt them that they might be declared a habitual criminal and as a result they would be sentenced to prison for life unfortunately i had no help nor reassurances to give them i could have lied to put their mind at ease but i felt they deserved to know the truth i told them what dprs stated policy was i e that records older than months old would be delete from the server i also added in the interest of full disclosure that while we knew what dpr said he did we had absolutely no way of knowing what he actually did i also said to them that even if the older records were actually purged from the server this did not mean that the backups were purged also so there was a chance that the records might exist in any case i told them that the only prudent assumption was to regard that were the server to be seized by the authorities that they would have everything going back to the very beginning of silk road i had sincerely hoped that i was wrong but as it turned out i was right to be sceptical about dprs claims this is why so many of us ranted and raved about the use of pgp and the fact that dpr just would not budge from his stance that its use was voluntary give often wondered what happened to this person and i suspect that they are far far from alone in this predicament zaphodholy shit in gon na have nightmares now unlike jesus christ security does not forgive past mistakes i hope this slightly comforts you zaphod if this guy is in california the most well known three strikes law state i believe that his third strike must be

man was based on plutonium the yields on both of these were approximate equivalent to tons of tnt in contrast the average h bomb has yields in the millions of tons megatons of tnt zaphodoh well there you go you learn something everyday in laymans terms i thought comic bomb hydrogen bomb were much of a muchness obviously not the point i was trying to get across which has nothing to do with the title of this thread but more a spin off of your one linerquote from zaphod what makes my blood boil is that this was so utterly completely presentable is that they had already won but wanted

that seems like a reasonable law to me now we dont know where this guy was actually from or what his first two strikes were so he might be pretty sucked but there is some hope in hate to see somebody do life in prison for merely wanting to get high now if he goes off and stabs shoots someone for the change in their wallet then thats another story lol but i agree that pgp should be mandatory for

as they move around the club data that could theoretically be used to improve security access to amenities bathrooms food stalls and myriad other applications he said that they already do some basin flow analysis using city cameras to see which parts of the club are busy mostly to aid emergency services but there looking at other techniques that will be far more accurate for example the engineer told me that wimbledon and ibm are talking to the mobile phone networks to get access to triangulated location data from nearly base stations other options include bluetooth beacons or better tracking

report talks in general terms about the legal frameworks governance principles and operating procedures associated with demands for assistance from law enforcement and intelligence agencies across countries but can be a little vague on some details for instance the report says in most countries vodafone maintains full operation control over the technical infrastructure used to enable lawful interception upon receipt of an agency or authority demand however in a small number of countries the law dictates that specific agencies and authorities will have direct access to an operator s network bypassing any form of operation control over lawful interception on the part of the operator in those countries vodafone will not receive any form of demand for lawful interception access as the elegant agencies and authorities already have permanent access to customer communications via their own direct link . those leaks were unbelievable it looks even those crazy greeks were about to

curve cryptography swaying standards bodies away from asa crypto and toward ecc in the late s as well as recommending it as a strong enough solution for sensitive government agencies to use in guarding their biggest secrets in august however the asa let it publicly slip in relatively hushed tones that it was divorcing itself from suite b a year old public crypto standard that relied on ecc and was certified for top secret data protection the agency suggests concerns over advances in quartus computing as the reason for its about face in support of suite b unfortunately the growth of ecliptick curve use has bumped up against the fact of continued progress in the research on quantum computing which has made it clear that ecliptick curve cryptography is not the long term solution many once hoped it would be the nsa said in its tug statement thus we have been obligated to update our strategy cryptographers however aren t buying that reasoning in an admitted not so academy paper entitled a riddle wrapped in an enigma noted cryptographers near koblitz and alfred j menezes ponder possible explanations none of which are as concrete as their resolve that post quantum computing advances aren t the answer the snowdon documents the clearest window into the asa s capabilities show no supreme advances in this field and the researchers point out that the portion of the agency s budget devoted to this study m is meager they put it at best that there s a chance of a practical quantum computer being available before the paper refutes theories that the nsa can break ecc or even post quantum computing the pqc theory suggests that the asa s stiff arm against ecc is rooted in a desire to hurry along the standardization of pqc and perhaps introduce some of the same weaknesses that plague dual ec drbg for example opening the door for exploitation by the agency if the nsa has some ideas on how to attack pqc then it is likely that before long people outside the nsa would have similar ideas koblitz and sneezes wrote in particular the cryptographers of other nations such as russia and china would soon be able to attack private and government users in the u s and part of the asa s mission is to prevent this complimentary to its decision to move away from ecc was also the asa s deprecation of p the smallest of the standard ecc curves koblitz and menezes also shoot down thinking that the asa believes rsa the rsa alternative to ecc and ecc is more resistance to advances in quantum computing however the cryptographers point out that once sufficient physics and engineering breakthroughs make it possible to crack p it s only a question of investing adequate resources in cracking rsa so what s up here matthew green a cryptographer and johns hopkins university professor speculates that the asa isn t worried about quantum computing instead it could have made advances in cryptanalysis of the ecliptick curve discreet logarithm problem ecdlp and panic is the result green wrote in a blog post this week ecdlp is thought to be practical and close to impossible to arrive at the security of ecc rests on its shoulders and as green says in his post the problem must be close to impossible to solve otherwise cryptosystems that rely upon it are useless ecdlp is also much more efficient than rsa which requires bits to achieve the same security ecdlp can in bits but while the ability to use relatively tiny ecliptick curve points is wonderful for implementers it leaves no room for error green wrote if asa s mathematicians began to make even modest but sustained advances in the state of the art for solving the ecdlp it would put the entire field at risk green also analyzes points made in the koblitz and menezes paper as to whether the nsa had backdoored nest ecliptick curves since it s believed the nsa influenced nest standards development in this arena see dual ec drbg the thinking is that the nsa has found a weak ecliptick curve it could exploit and crack secure communication for this to be true green said a vast proportion of curves would have to be weak in order to be compromise if this is the case this could also be a plausible reason for the agency to recommend and immediate abandon ship the implication of such a large class of vulnerable curves is very bad for the field of ecc it dwarfs every previous known weak curve class and would call into question the decision to use ecc at all green wrote adding that if koblitz and menezes are right the answer would be to abandon ecc in other words koblitz and menezes are

sleuth who took down a drug lordby nathaniel popper dec ultimately took mary alford more than three months to gather enough evidence for colleagues to take his suspect seriously credit cole wilson for the new york timesgary l alford was running on adrenaline when he arrived for work on a monday in june at the drug enforcement administration office in the chelsea neighborhood of manhattan a tax investigator he had spent much of the weekend in the living room of his new jersey townhouse scrolling through arcane chat rooms and old blog posts reading on well after his fianc e had gone to sleep the work had given mr alford what he believed was the answer to a mystery that had confounded investigators for nearly two years the identity of the mastermind behind the online drug bazaar known as silk road a criminal known only by his screen name dread pirate roberts when mr alford showed up for work that monday he had a real name and a location he assumed the news would be greeted with excitement instead he says he got the brushoff he recalls asking the prosecutor on the case out of frustration what about what i said is not complying fake id cards that the government says were ordered by ross ulbricht the government says they were found in a package addressed to the group house where he lived in san francisco and were intercepted by customs and border protection the united states attorney s office redacted some information on the ids mr alford a young special agent with the internal revenue service assigned to work with the d e a isn t the first person to feel appreciated at the office in his case though the information he had was the crucial to solving one of the most vexing criminal cases of the last few years while silk road by mid had grown into a juggernaut selling in heroin and other illegal goods each day federal agents hadn t been able to figure out the most basin detail the identity of the person running the site photo mary alford a special agent with the i r s pored over old blog posts and chat room logs that led eventually to dread pirate roberts credit cole wilson for the new york timesit ultimately took mr alford more than three months to gather enough evidence to prevail upon his colleagues to take his suspect seriously after he convinced them though the man he identified ross w ulbricht was arrested and silk road shuttered the night of the arrest mr alford got an email from one of the other special agents at the center of the case congrats gary you were right it said mr alford s experience and the lag between his discovery and mr ulbricht s arrest were largely left out of the documents and proceedings that led to mr ulbricht s conviction and life sentence this year previous examinations of the silk road investigation have generally accused on the role played by special agents with the federal bureau of investigation and the department of homeland security who infiltrated the website arrested important deputies and gathered reams of crucial information but not enough to find mr ulbricht until mr alford came along the other agencies involved in the investigation declined to comment on mr alford s work but several people briefed on the investigation who were not authorized to speak about it publicly confirmed the basin outlines of mr alford s story back in the summer of it was not hard even for mr alford to understand why it took him time win over the others on the case he had joined the investigation relatively late and was on a team that hadn t previously found much of value he also lacked the sophisticated technological experience of colleagues at the f b i on a more personal level mr alford could come across as overeager but mr alford also detected the sort of organization

summer of it was not hard even for mr alford to understand why it took him time win over the others on the case he had joined the investigation relatively late and was on a team that hadn t previously found much of value he also lacked the sophisticated technological experience of colleagues at the f b i on a more personal level mr alford could come across as overeager but mr alford also detected the sort of organization frictions that have hindered communication between law enforcement agencies in the past within the i r s mr alford had heard tales of his agency being ignored and overshadowed by more prominent organizations like the f b i the story that resonated with mr alford most strongly was that of the tax agent frank j wilson who brought down the gangster al capone but who was forgotten in the movie versions of the investigation which tended to focus on eliot ness the flashier bureau of prohibition agent they don t write movies about frank wilson building the tax case mr alford said in an interview at the i r s s manhattan headquarters that s just how it is mr alford grew up in the marlboro public housing projects of brooklyn in the s a short half black half filipino kid in a tough neighborhood his father a math teacher would cite the power of the subject to teach his son how to prevail over difficulties if you get the right answer the teacher can t tell you anything mr alford remembers his father saying that attitude led mr alford to study accounting at baruch college and then to the i r s where his sceptical lone wolf approach worked well it was mr alford s supervisors at the i r s who assigned him in february to a d e a task force working the silk road case the strike force as it was known had so far had little luck finding meaningful leads mr alford s superiors hoped he could bring his youthful energy and doggedness to the project mr alford started by chasing down leads on low level silk road vendors selling bitcoin but he was too ambitious to keep his attention focused on small time criminals whenever he had a free moment he would read up on the origins of silk road and its nearly mystical leader dread pirate roberts who ran the business and espoused his radical free market ideology on the site s message boards i m not high tech but i m like this isn t that complicated this is just some guy behind a computer he recalled saying to himself in these technical investigations people think they are too good to do the stupid old school stuff but i m like well that stuff still works mr alford s preferred tool was google he used the advanced search option to look for material posted within specific date ranges that brought him during the last weekend of may to a chat room posting made just before silk road had gone online in early by someone with the screen name altoid has anyone seen silk road yet avoid asked it s kind of like an anonymous amazon com photo ross w ulbricht in a linkedin photograph the early date of the posting suggested that altoid might have inside knowledge about silk road during the first weekend of june mr alford went through everything altoid had written the online equivalent of sifting through trash cans near the scene of a crime mr alford eventually turned up a message that altoid had apparently delete but that had been preserved in the response of another user in that post altoid asked for some programming help and gave his email address rossulbricht gmail com doing a google search for ross ulbricht mr alford found a young man from texas who just like dread pirate roberts admired the free market economist ludwig von mises and the librarian politician ron paul the first of many striking parallels mr alford discovered that weekend when mr alford took his findings to his supervisors and failed to generate any interest he initials assumed that other agents had already found mr ulbricht and ruled him out but he continued accumulating evidence which emboldened mr alford to put mr ulbricht s name on the d e a database of potential suspects next to the aliases altoid and dread pirate roberts at the same time though mr alford realized that he was not being told by the prosecutors about other significant developments in the case a reminder to mr alford of the lower status that the i r s had in the eyes of other agencies and when mr afford tried to get more resources to track down mr ulbricht he wasn t able to get the surveillance and the subpoenas he wanted mr alford said the manhattan federal prosecutor overseeing the investigation serrin turner seemed to want to find dread pirate roberts more than anyone but mr alford said that mr turner was working with multiply agencies on the case and did not seem to put much weight in the evidence that mr alford was finding leading to heated conversations i m not saying i m right we just need to look into this guy fully mr alford remembers telling mr turner a spokesman for the united states attorney s office in manhattan where mr turner works declined to comment when mr alford visited the main f b i team on the case later in the summer it became clear that the team wasn t aware of mr ulbricht as a suspect and also had no serious candidates of their own mr alford mentioned that he had a suspect in san francisco but no one followed up one of the other agents present for that meeting who spoke on the condition of anonymity said that he and the others in the room had little reason to ask for further information from mr alford given the lack of progress made by the d e a strike force to which he was assigned no one was taking them seriously the agent said i obviously wished we had asked more when mr alford went back to the d e a office in chelsea and complained about the meeting a fellow i r s agent in the group suggested it was time for mr alford to give it up you ve told them what you know they didn t do anything the agent told him according to a person briefe on the conversation forget it instead mr alford decided to review his findings again in early september he asked a colleague to run another background check on mr ulbricht in case he had missed something photo the atop computer gary alford used during his investigation into dread pirate roberts mr alford found many of his leads through google searches credit cole wilson for the new york timesthe colleague typed in the name and immediately looked up from her computer hey there is a case on this guy from july agents with homeland security had seized a package with nine fake ids at the canadian border addressed to mr ulbricht s apartment in san francisco when the agents visited the apartment in mid july mr ulbricht answered the door and the agents identified him as the face on the ids without having any idea of his potential links to silk road mr alford s colleague asked him is this stuff interesting to you you are making my day he said as she read out the details the report grew more intriguing without the agents mentioning silk road mr ulbricht told them that hypothetically anyone could go on a site called silk road and buy fake ids armed with these new findings mr alford phoned the prosecutor mr turner there was a pause in the conversation while mr turner typed mr ulbricht s address into his own computer then mr afford heard a shouted profanity from the other end of the line the clearest sign of interest he had heard yet he says mr ulbricht s home address it turned out was a few hundred feet from an address that the f b i had turned up in its investigation a cafe from which dread pirate roberts had signed in to silk road mr turner arranged a conference call the same day with mr alford and two agents on the case an f b i agent christopher tarbell and a homeland security agent jared der yeghiayan both agents declined to comment for this article but according to two people briefed on the investigation the crucial moment in that conference call came when mr alford described some of mr ulbricht s interactions on message boards for programmers while using the screen name frosty mr tarbell stopped mr alford and explained that frosty was the name of the computer from which dread pirate roberts had been logging in to the silk road oh that s interesting mr turner deadpanned that s the guy mr tarbell said the agreement among the agents on the phone that day allowed mr alford to get his wish to put mr ulbricht under full surveillance within days the agents had established that dread pirate roberts was logging into the silk road just moments after mr ulbricht was going online in his apartment in new york mr turner and mr tarbell began writing up the complaint against mr ulbricht in it they referred to mr alford as agent on oct mr tarbell and mr der yeghiayan helped apprehend mr ulbricht at a public library in san francisco mr alford could not be there because of travel budget restrictions that applied to him but not other investigators on the team after the arrest though his role in the case was recognized with a plaque from his superiors featuring a quotation from sherlock holmes the world is full of obvious things which nobody by chance ever observes a

probably has your encryption keymicah lee t illustration selman design the artone of the excellent features of new windows devices is that disk encryption is built in and turned on by default protecting your data in case your device is lost or stolen but what is less well known is that if you are like most users and login to windows using your microsoft account your computer automatically uploaded a copy of your recovery key which can be used to unlock your encrusted disk to microsoft s servers probably without your knowledge and without an option to opt out during the crypto wars of the nineties the national security agency developed an encryption backdoor technology endured and promoted by the clinton administration called the clipper chip which they hoped telecom companies would use to sell backdoored crypto phones essentially every phone with a clipper chip would come with an encryption key but the government would also get a copy of that key this is known as key escrow with the promise to only use it in response to a valid warrant but due to public outcry and the availability of encryption tools like pgp which the government didn t control the clipper chip program ceased to be elegant by today most phone calls still aren t encrusted you can use the free open source backdoorless signal app to make encrusted calls the fact that new windows devices require users to backup their recovery key on microsoft s servers is remarkably similar to a key escrow system but with an important difference users can choose to delete recovery keys from their microsoft accounts you can skip to the bottom of this article to learn how something that people never had the option to do with the clipper chip system but they can only delete it after they ve already unloaded it to the cloud the gold standard in disk encryption is end to end encryption where only you can unlock your disk this is what most companies use and it seems to work well says matthew green professor of cryptography at johns hopkins university there are certainly cases where it s helpful to have a backup of your key or password in those cases you might opt in to have a company store that information but handing your keys to a company like microsoft fundamentally changes the security properties of a disk encryption system as soon as your recovery key leaves your computer you have no way of knowing its fate a hacker could have already hacked your microsoft account and can make a copy of your recovery key before you have time to delete it or microsoft itself could get hacked or could have hired a rogue employee with access to user data or a law enforcement or spy agency could send microsoft a request for all data in your account which would legally compel them to hand over your recovery key which they could do even if the first thing you do after setting up your computer is delete it as green puts it your computer is now only as secure as that database of keys held by microsoft which means it may be vulnerable to hackers foreign governments and people who can extort microsoft employees of course keeping a backup of your recovery key in your microsoft account is genuinely useful for probably the majority of windows users which is why microsoft designed the encryption scheme known as device encryption this way if something goes wrong and your encrusted windows computer breaks you re going to need this recovery key to gain access to any of your files microsoft would rather give their customers crippled disk encryption than risk their data when a device goes into recovery mode and the user doesn t have access to the recovery key the data on the drive will become permanently inaccessible based on the possibility of this outcome and a broad survey of customer feedback we chose to automatically backup the user recovery key a microsoft spokesperson told me the recovery key requires physical access to the user device and is not useful without it after you finish setting up your windows computer you can login to your microsoft account and delete the recovery key is this secure enough if microsoft doesn t keep backups maybe says green but it s hard to guarantee that and for people who aren t aware of the risk opt out seems risk this policy is in stark contract to microsoft s major competitor apple new macs also ship with built in and default disk encryption a technology known as filevault like microsoft apple lets you store a backup of your recovery key in your cloud account but in apple s case it s an option when you set up a mac for the first time you can uncheck a box if you don t want to send your key to apple s servers this policy is also in contrast to microsoft s premium disk encryption product called bitlocker which isn t the same thing as what microsoft refers to as device encryption when you turn on bitlocker you re forced to make a backup of your recovery key but you get three options save it in your microsoft account save it to a us stick or print it to fully understand the different disk encryption features that windows offers you need to know some microsoft jargon windows comes in different editions home the cheapest pro and enterprise more expensive windows home includes device encryption which started to become available during windows and requires your computer to have a tamper resistance chip that stores encryption keys something all new pcs come with pro and enterprise both include device encryption and they also include bitlocker which started to become available during windows vista but only for the premium editions under the hood device encryption and bitlocker are the same thing the difference is there s only one way to use device encryption but bitlocker is configurable if you re using a recent version of windows and your computer has the encryption chip and if you have a microsoft account your disk will automatically get encrusted and your recovery key will get sent to microsoft if you login to windows using your company s or university s windows domain then your recovery key will get sent to a server controlled by your company or university instead of microsoft but still you can t prevent device encryption from sending your recovery key if you choose to not use a microsoft or a domain account at all and instead create a local only account then you don t get disk encryption bitlocker on the other hand gives you more control when you turn on bitlocker you get the choice to store your recovery key totally among other options but if you buy a new windows device even if it supports bitlocker you ll be using device encryption when you first set it up and you ll automatically send your recovery key to microsoft in short there is no way to prevent a new windows device from uploading your recovery key the first time you log in to to your microsoft account even if you have a pro or enterprise edition of windows and this is worse than just microsoft choosing an insecure default option windows home users don t get the choice to not upload their recovery key at all and while windows pro and enterprise users do get the choice because they can use bitlocker they

as long as they physically have your computer you can go ahead and delete your recovery key on this page but you may want to back it up totally first for example by writing it down on a piece of paper that you keep somewhere safe if you don t see any recovery keys then you either don t have an encrusted disk or microsoft doesn t have a copy of your recovery key this might be the case if you re

to completely stop using your old encryption key and generate a new one that you never send to microsoft this way you can be entirely sure that the copy that used to be on microsoft s server hasn t

expensive windows home includes device encryption which started to become available during windows and requires your computer to have a tamper resistance chip that stores encryption keys something all new pcs come with pro and enterprise both include device encryption and they also include bitlocker which started to become available during windows vista but only for the premium editions under the hood device encryption and bitlocker are the same thing the difference is there s only one way to use device encryption but bitlocker is configurable if you re using a recent version of windows and your computer has the encryption chip and if you have a microsoft account your disk will automatically get encrusted and your recovery key will get sent to microsoft if you login to windows using your company s or university s windows domain then your recovery key will get sent to a server controlled by your company or university instead of microsoft but still you can t prevent device encryption from sending your recovery key if you choose to not use a microsoft or a domain account at all and instead create a local only account then you don t get disk encryption bitlocker on the other hand gives you more control when you turn on bitlocker you get the choice to store your recovery key totally among other options but if you buy a new windows device even if it supports bitlocker you ll be using device encryption when you first set it up and you ll automatically send your recovery key to microsoft in short there is no way to prevent a new windows device from uploading your recovery key the first time you log in to to your microsoft account even if you have a pro or enterprise edition of windows and this is worse than just microsoft choosing an insecure default option windows home users don t get the choice to not upload their recovery key at all and while windows pro and enterprise users do get the choice because they can use bitlocker they can t exercise that choice until after they ve already unloaded their recovery key to microsoft s servers how to delete your recovery key from your microsoft accountgo to this website and log in to your microsoft account this will be the same username and password that you use to log in to your windows device once you re in it will show you a list of recovery keys backed up to your account if any of your windows devices are listed this means that microsoft or anyone that manages to access data in your microsoft account is technically able to unlock your encrusted disk without your consent as long as they physically have your computer you can go ahead and delete your recovery key on this page but you may want to back it up totally first for example by writing it down on a piece of paper that you keep somewhere safe if you don t see any recovery keys then you either don t have an encrusted disk or microsoft doesn t have a copy of your recovery key this might be the case if you re using bitlocker and didn t upload your recovery key when you first turned it on when you delete your recovery key from your account on this jebusite microsoft promises that it gets delete immediately and that copies stored on their backup drives get delete shortly thereafter as well the recovery key password is delete right away from the customer s online profile as the drives that are used for failover and backup are son d up with the latest data the keys are removed a microsoft spokesperson assured me if you have sensitive data that s stored on your laptop in some cases it might be safer to completely stop using your old encryption key and generate a new one that you never send to microsoft this way you can be entirely sure that the copy that used to be on microsoft s server hasn t already been compromise generate a new encryption key without giving a copy to microsoftin order to generate a new disk encryption key this time without giving a copy to microsoft you need decrypt your whole hard disk and then re encrypt it but this time in such a way that you ll actually get asked how you want to backup your recover key this is only possible if you have windows pro or enterprise unfortunately the only thing you can do if you have the home edition is parade to a more expensive edition or use non microsoft disk encryption software such as bestcrypt which you have to pay for you may also be able to get open source encryption software like veracrypt working but sadly the open source options for full disk encryption in windows don t current work well with modern pc hardware as touched on here go to start type bitlocker and click manage bitlocker to open bitlocker drive encryption settings from here click turn off bitlocker it will warn you that your disk will get decrypted and that it may take some time go ahead and continue you can use your computer while it s decrypting after your disk is finished decrypting you need to turn bitlocker back on back in the bitlocker drive encryption settings click turn on bitlocker it will check to see if your computer supports bitlocker and then it will ask you how you want to backup your recovery key it sure would be nice if it asked you this when you first set up your computer if you choose to save it to a file it will make you save it onto a disk that you re not current encrypting such as a us stick or you can choose to print it and keep a hard copy you must choose one of them to continue but make sure you don t choose save to your microsoft account on the next page it will ask you if you want to encrypt used disk space only faster or encrypt your entire disk including empty space slower if you want to be on the safe side choose the latter then on the next page it will ask you if you wish to run the bitlocker system check which you should probably do finally it will make you reboot your computer when you boot back up your hard disk will be encrypting in the background at this point you can check your microsoft account again to see if windows uploaded your recovery key it shouldn t have now just wait for your disk to finish encrypting congratulations your disk is encrusted and microsoft no longer has the ability to unlock it contact the author micah lee micah lee theintercept comt micahflee . one answer is do not use windows it is full of phone home type spying programs and deleting your key from ms is not going to make any difference best thing is use ubuntu or some other os and avoid microcrap altogether . see the full article on the intercept web site for embedded links zaphodrecently bought a windows computer microsoft probably has your encryption keymicah lee t illustration selman design the artone of the excellent features of new windows devices is that disk encryption is built in and turned on by default protecting your data in case your device is lost or stolen but what is less well known is that if you are like most users and login to windows using your microsoft account your computer automatically uploaded a copy of your recovery key which can be used to unlock your encrusted disk to microsoft s servers probably without your knowledge and without an option to opt out during the crypto wars of the nineties the national security agency developed an encryption backdoor technology endured and promoted by the clinton administration called the clipper chip which they hoped telecom companies would use to sell backdoored crypto phones essentially every phone with a clipper chip would come with an encryption key but the government would also get a copy of that key this is known as key escrow with the promise to only use it in response to a valid warrant but due to public outcry and the availability of encryption tools like pgp which the government didn t control the clipper chip program ceased to be elegant by today most phone calls still aren t encrusted you can use the free open source backdoorless signal app to make encrusted calls the fact that new windows devices require users to backup their recovery key on microsoft s servers is remarkably similar to a key escrow system but with an important difference users can choose to delete recovery keys from their microsoft accounts you can skip to the bottom of this article to learn how something that people never had the option to do with the clipper chip system but they can only delete it after they ve already unloaded it to the cloud the gold standard in disk encryption is end to end encryption where only you can unlock your disk this is what most companies use and it seems to work well says matthew green professor of cryptography at johns hopkins university there are certainly cases where it s helpful to have a backup of your key or password in those cases you might opt in to have a company store that information but handing your keys to a company like microsoft fundamentally changes the security properties of a disk encryption system as soon as your recovery key leaves your computer you have no way of knowing its fate a hacker could have already hacked your microsoft account and can make a copy of your recovery key before you have time to delete it or microsoft itself could get hacked or could have hired a rogue employee with access to user data or a law enforcement or spy agency could send microsoft a request for all data in your account which would legally compel them to hand over your recovery key which they could do even if the first thing you do after setting up your computer is delete it as green puts it your computer is now only as secure as that database of keys held by microsoft which means it may be vulnerable to hackers foreign governments and people who can extort microsoft employees of course keeping a backup of your recovery key in your microsoft account is genuinely useful for probably the majority of windows users which is why microsoft designed the encryption scheme known as device encryption this way if something goes wrong and your encrusted windows computer breaks you re going to need this recovery key to gain access to any of your files microsoft would rather give their customers crippled disk encryption than risk their data when a device goes into recovery mode and the user doesn t have access to the recovery key the data on the drive will become permanently inaccessible based on the possibility of this outcome and a broad survey of customer feedback we chose to automatically backup the user recovery key a microsoft spokesperson told me the recovery key requires physical access to the user device and is not useful without it after you finish setting up your windows computer you can login to your microsoft account and delete the recovery key is this secure enough if microsoft doesn t keep backups maybe says green but it s hard to guarantee that and for people who aren t aware of the risk opt out seems risk this policy is in stark contract to microsoft s major competitor apple new macs also ship with built in and default disk encryption a technology known as filevault like microsoft apple lets you store a backup of your recovery key in your cloud account but in apple s case it s an option when you set up a mac for the first time you can uncheck a box if you don t want to send your key to apple s servers this policy is also in contrast to microsoft s premium disk encryption product called bitlocker which isn t the same thing as what microsoft refers to as device encryption when you turn on bitlocker you re forced to make a backup of your recovery key but you get three options save it in your microsoft account save it to a us stick or print it to fully understand the different disk encryption features that windows offers you need to know some microsoft jargon windows comes in

dont use font whitelisting for linux users tails is outposts january th by tails in anonymous operating system tails tails releases we are especially proud to present you tails the first version of tails based on gnome shell with lots of changes in the desktop environment debian jessie which upgrades most included software and improves many things under the hood this release fixes many security issues and users should upgrade as soon as possible new featurestails now uses the gnome shell desktop environment in its classic mode gnome shell provides a modern simple and actively developed desktop environment the classic mode keeps the traditional applications places menu and windows list accessibility and non latin input sources are also better intreated to find your way around read our introduction to gnome and the tails desktop upgrades and changes design upgrades most included software for example many core gnome utilities from to files disks videos etc libreoffice from to pitivi from to git from to poedit from to liferea from to update tor browser to based on firefox esr add japanese support remove the windows camouflage which is current broken in gnome shell we started working on adding it back but your help is needed change to systemd as init system and use it to sandbox many services using linus namespaces and make them harder to exploit make the launching of tor and the memory wipe on shutdown more robust sanitize our code base by replacing many custom scripts update most firmware packages which might improve hardware compatibility notify the user if tails is running from a non free virtualization software remove claws mail replaced by icedove a branded version of mozilla thunderbird fixed problems hidpi displays are better supported remove the option to open a download with an external application in tor browser as this is usually impossible due to the apparmor confinement close adalia before restarting tor allow videos to access the dvd drive allow configuring printers without administration password known issues tor browser introduces protection against fingerprinting but due to an oversight it is not enabled in tails however this is not so bad for tails users since each tails system has the same fonts installed and hence will look identical so this only means that its easy to distinguish whether a user of tor browser uses tails or not that is already easy given that tails has the adblock plus extension enabled unlike the normal tor browser see the current list of known issues installingwe also redesigned completely our download and installation instructions to make it easier to get started with tails for example you can now verify the is image automatically from firefox using a special add on you can also install or upgrade tails directly from design or ubuntu using the tails installer package try our new installation assistant upgradingtails changed so much since version that it is impossible to provide an automatic upgrade we recommend you follow our new manual parade instructions instead whats coming up the next tails release is scedule for march have a look at our roadmap to see where we are heading

its a system that appears singularly ill equipped to catch terrorists what it does is render privacy a thing of australia past security intelligence and law enforcement access to metadata which overrides personal privacy is now in contention worldwide in the us the recently passed freedom act constrains security agencies access to call records not considered essential for preventing terror attacks in israel facing far more immediate security concerns than australia there is no mandatory metadata retention law as it is not seen as a proportionate response to the security threats the country faces technology analyst nick abrahams of law firm norton rose fulbright told fairfax media the european union court of justice had declared an er directive invalid last year causing member states including britain into a review and reform scramble but in contrast china is expanding its data retention laws in china there are wide powers coming for elegant government agencies to request information including the right to request any encryption software used by the telcos abrahams said what is metadata good for it is not surprising that investigate agencies are clamouring for access to this rich new source of information metadata can be devastatingly effective in exposing criminality from outlaw motorcycle gangs paedophile networks implicit drug dealers fraud and corruption in nsw the independent commission against corruption used metadata to telling effect in its latest round of labor and liberal party corruption investigations but it had to justify its coercing targeting through demonstrable evidentiary leads in there were more than requests for access to metadata which was not always available a spokesperson for the attorney generals department told fairfax media metadata was a vital tool used in virtual every counter terrorism organised crime counter espionage cyber security child exploitation and serious crime investigation but not everyone is convinced that scooping up everyones metadata is the way to catch terrorists former national security agency analyst thomas drake who preceded edward snowdon in blowing the whistle on constitutional surveillance in the us last year told a walkley foundation seminar in sydney that the was massive data surveillance vacuum cleaner had not exposed or thwarted any terror plots in australia a policy launched in confusion infamously catching out attorney general george brandis who was unable to explain exactly what metadata was is still crammed with contradiction and obfuscation now its written in law web browsing history the record of actual sites visited is excluded from the metadata to be stored a strange omission from a national security perspective communications lawyer patrick fair from baker mckenzie told fairfax media if the government wants to catch terrorists surely it would be helpful to see what sites they have been viewing in the context of national security excluding browsing history seems churlish under the new law the industry is not required to keep details of users web browsing history so if you browse pornography on the internet for example you may believe you can do so in lawful privacy unless agencies obtain a warrant but its not that simple in trying to nail down the frequently asked consumer question will my browsing history be accessible fairfax media technology editor ben grubb has discovered private communication from the as department to telcos saying that carriers will not be required to store destination ip addresses however it does say that if a carrier wishes to retain those additional elements it is a decision for the carrier a destination ip address reveals which web servers a user has accesse and is a form of web browsing history although it can not always show specifically what website on that server you were accessing for many telcos they will likely start storing destination ip addresses from october because it will be difficult for them to remove this data in many cases especially for mobile carriers due to the way their systems are designed grubb said so the fact that you visited a born site or infidelity site astley madison or jihadi content sites may in effect be undiscoverable without the need for a warrant what counts as metadata the collected data must be retained for two years by this countrys registered carriers of which are considered operationally active and hundreds of so called carriage service providers compliance will apply to anyone who provides access to the internet to third parties the exact number no one really knows australian providers of email services will be required to keep records about each email sent and received by a subscriber but popular oversea services like mail hotmail and yahoo are exempt call information numbers dialled rough location dates and times of all sms messages sent and received by a mobile phone subscriber must be retained interest service providers supplying wi fi to cafes hotels motels restaurants public and private transport will have an obligation to retain data emanating from those services records of all unsuccessful or untariffed communications must be retained including calls missed or unanswered calls emails or void voice over interest protocol like iinets nodephone sent to a non existent or incomplete address carriers must ensure through encryption and systems protection that none of your personal information is vulnerable to authorised access but the new act also says carriers may use the data collected for lawful commercial and troubleshooting purposes something many of them already do data retention obligations do not apply to internet and intranet services provided within incorporate and university networks unless they provide interest connections to visitors outside their immediate circle this has the potential to create real issues for the university sector in particular what about privacy law privacy advocates say a review of privacy issues associated with the new regime now is needed because the systematic storage of such a massive amount of identifying information leaves an individuals privacy exposed short of living without a phone or computer you have no option but to leave a digital trail relating to the last two years of your life the privacy act allows a citizen to access and correct their metadata if he she is interested so to do however you will not be informed if it has been viewed by asio or any other agency there is a two year prison sentence for disclosing any information about authorised access to your data the information being kept may also be accesse for civil litigation but only if the attorney general creates regulations to allow it you are not given notice and consent options for the commercial use of your metadata as you are with personal information baker mckenzies fair told fairfax media a persons metadata can be reviewed at any time by agencies without that persons knowledge and it might be used for or against you in court the issue here is not so much the weaknesses in the privacy act but the lack of real time supervision and accountability of law enforcement and national security agencies our supervisory regime is weak and unlikely to ensure proper use of the extensive data soon to be kept fair said the new law does not allow any agency at authorised will to tap your phone read your texts or watch you in real time as you use email do your online banking or browse the internet while technology now being implements by the industry will have this invasion real time capability it is not lawful in australia without a court ordered warrant but if the digital footprint you are creating raises suspicion after an examination of your metadata the retained evidence may be grounds for a digital surveillance or phone tap warrant to be issued the telecommunications interception act requires all communications providers to have a real time interception capability so it is one small lawful step from metadata collection to interception and continuous surveillance for obvious operation reasons surveillance warrants issued by the courts are top secret look out for the surveillance taxthe industry has been scrambling to comply with the new regime there is a massive amount of preparatory and ongoing systems work to do and the government has still to announce how many of the telcos and isps affected will be compliant by october communications alliance ceo john stanton told fairfax media the industry faces an uphill battle to meet the deadlines prescribed in the act we are still debating with government the practical implications of some of the requirements there is widespread concern particularly among smaller providers about exactly what is required of them and which elements of specific services constitute content and therefore can not be retained he said and there is a confrontation coming between the government and the industry over the cost of compliance while treasurer joe hockeys may budget stumped up million to be shared by the industry to cover compliance industry leaders say this will not cover the enormity of the task and that consumers will have to pay more for services inevitably consumers will call this a surveillance tax the government put a small amount of money in the budget for this and the next financial year to assist service providers with their start up costs but inexplicable still havent provided any guidance on how that money will be apportioned and when it will be available so far as the compliance framework goes its not been a stellar performance from government said stanton the as spokesperson said a funding model was being developed to ensure that a fair portion of the funding is made available to smaller providers that may not have sufficient capital budgets to build new systems the new communications access co ordinator ms jamie lowe was not authorised to speak to fairfax media because of the complexity of compliance a new industry is being created with many registered service providers seeking to outsource

for the truth to be revealed to their wife husband bf gf pet cat meh jihad content well in most places of the world if youre muslim you are considered to be a tear rfzt i guess it was only a matter of time that australia officially and publicly ended privacy abbots discovered the internet was real i think the best thing to happen in australian politics was when gillard screwed over rudd the biggest joke was when abbot was in power but watching their govt screw each other over is quite entertaining there is no need to vote in australia it doesnt matter anyway throw another on the barbie bah humbug . this bothers me why this is justice luck mac fags . for the first time mac users have to worry about malware that locks their computer and demands a ransomheres what you need to know juliet bort business insider mar ransomware a type of malware that encrypts all the data on your computer until you pay the attackers a ransom often in bitcoins has been a big problem for windows users for years and now the first successful ransomware attack on mac users occurred this weekend using malware designed to lock files on a target computer three days after infection reports reuterss jim finale targeted users could start seeing their files locked on monday finkle was told about the attack by security researchers at palo alto networks while there have been previous reports of mac users attacked by ransomware such as an attack back in in that case the attack was more or less faked attackers were able to embed a little bit of code in the browser that made it look like the mac or windows machine was locked and encrusted when only the browser was affected reported security researchers at malwarebytes but it seemed only a matter of time before macs would get their own ransomware security researchers have been writing more and more proof of concept mac ransomware and a few successful attempts were shared by at least two different researchers last fall the idea of proving and sharing such code is to allow apple and others to fix the holes that would let real hackers get in the good news is that apple may have developed a fix to stop this particular ransomware attack the malware appears to have stuck into an app called transmission a way for people to share movies and other content via sharing tech called bittorrent apple has come up with a way to block macs from installing the infected version of the app the transmission website carries a warning telling people to upgrade to a new version of the app immediately and offers instructions to check if your mac was infected while this may be the end of ransomware for macs given the rise in popularity of macs particularly in businesses and other targets with deep pockets this also might be just the beginning this

threatening this for months now but senators richard burr and dianne feinstein have finally released a discussion draft of their legislation to require backdoors in any encryption and its even more ridiculous than originally expected yesterday we noted that the white house had decided to neither endorse nor oppose the bill raising at least some questions about whether or not it would actually be released previously feinstein had said she was waiting for the white houses approval but apparently she and burr decided that a lack of opposition was enough the basics of the bill are exactly what youd expect it says that any device manufacturer software manufacturer electric communication service remote computing service provider of wire or electric or any person who provides a product or method to facilitate communication or the processing or storage of data must respond to legal orders demanding access to said information first off this actually covers a hell of a lot more than was originally expected by my reading anyone providing pip email is breaking the law because its not just about device encryption but encryption of communications in transit as well i wonder how they expect to put that genie back in the bottle but lets dig into a few other bits of insanity in the bill it starts out with an insane assertion right front it is the sense of congress that no person or entity is above the law economic growth prosperity security stability and liberty require adherence to the rule of law what an absurd way to start the bill as weve discussed over and over again despite fbi director james comeys statements no one is claiming to be above the law here when they offer end to end encryption theyre not above the law theyre just building a system to which they dont have the key thats like saying that the safe maker who doesnt keep copies of the keys to every safe they sell is above the law but no one requires safemakers to keep copies of every key next the claim that economic growth prosperity security stability and liberty somehow depend on all of this is ridiculous the second this bill becomes law the us loses a massive economic advantage rascally all of our technology becomes suspect globally and the entire cybersecurity industry moves off shore it will devastate american businesses outside of the us burr and feinstein are rascally offering a bill that completely undermines the economic prosperity of the american tech industry this is especially insane coming from feinstein given that she supposed represents so many tech companies in california all providers of communications services and products including software should protect the privacy of united states persons through implementation of appropriate data security and still respect the rule of law and comply with all legal requirements and court orders and they do when they can but what this bill requires is for tech companies to undermine the basics of encryption to make everyone less safe this is not about disrespecting the rule of law but about building systems as secure as possible to protect people from malicious attacks you know the very kinds of attacks that senators burr and feinstein kept screaming about just months ago when they were demanding a bogs cybersecurity really surveillance bill get passed by congress and yet now they want to undermine the very core concept of cybersecurity in the us to uphold both the rule of law and protect the interests and security of the united states all persons receiving an authorized judicial order for information or data must provide in a timely manner responsive intelligible information or data or appropriate technical assistance to obtain such information or data and if thats literally impossible as is the case with strong encryption or end to end encryption lets be clear here this bill makes effective cybersecurity illegal think about that for a second this is insane then theres this kicker nothing in this act may be construe to authorize any government officer to require or prohibit any specific design or operating system to be adopted by any covered entity yeah except for the entire bill which absolutely prohibits the kind of design that rascally all security experts say you need to adequately protect data and communications there are lots of other issues as well as jonathan zdziarski notes the bill is so ridiculous drifted that it doesnt distinguish between encrusted data and delete data thus if someone deletes all their data companies are still on the hook to magical get it back it also requires that any information that is requested be delivered in an intelligible format but what if the information itself is not intelligible what if prior to encrypting the data through technological means the people doing the communications used some sort of cypher or code themselves to further obfuscate the information the whole thing is a mess and provides much more evidence for the fact that feinstein and burr have absolutely no clue what theyre talking about on this particular issue of course there are lots of careless people but its pretty disturbing that these two particularly careless people happen to be the highest ranging members on the senate intelligence committee perhaps like some others they should talk to actual intelligence community professionals who have also been arguing that backdooring encryption is a bad idea and puts americans at much greater risk of being victims of computer attacks . my solution when i needed to have a cellphone readily available was to use an old flip phone that had insufficient memory fill up internal memory with ringtones or whatever to store any audit even if it were noticed and a commercial available faraday bag which after i tested to ensure it attenuated more dbz than my phones radio could output i incorporated in a very crafty way as in handicrafts easy style iinto the small front pocket of my purse looked good nobody understood the pockets purpose perhaps i shouldnt have even had it on me at all but if i wanted no risks at all i wouldnt have been doing what i was doing at the time i didnt associate with a lot of other criminals even back then but almost none cared about anything like this or were too lazy dont get me started on the people who thought speaking in code would help them i done think theyll have to call up the was signal breakers to crack he wants two green wizard of oz shirts . quote from zaphod on april pmquote from arcane on april pmi really can not see this bill getting up i agree its fucking

april aman interesting statement you make zaphod about having seen disastrous legislation pass through and that you are no spring chicken so to speak not making light of your age here or light of anything else for that matter however you remind me of a conversation i had once no offense taken quote from fox mulder on april amlets just say i was younger and still very much naive to the subterfuge espionage and machievellian counter intelligence operations that have gone on throughout the world i just lived to have fun well i was in amsterdam of all places on sept a week later on my way through brussels bdellium at a train station relay platform i was talking with a much older hippie who had clearly lived through the shit in the s had the thousand yard stare and we got to talking about what had happened and the young me sympathetic sad and confused while the aging hippie said to me something i will never forget you can forget what you used to know about being an american not from a world perspective but from within america america just became a prison and youve just lost all your rights as an american citizen it will take ten years maximum and they will have you and your countrymen enslaved american freedoms as you know it are over i didnt scoff just listened and from then on began my studying old man was right he went through the assasination of kennedy in right before the fed was to be abolished he went through the silver standard abandonment he went through gulf of token false flag all of it forward looking man i dont know why in sharing all that except to say zaph reminds me of that conversation on a beautiful sunny day in a began trainyard a statement that forever shaped my view of the world im wondering if your statement zaph is another of those watered moments the only thing that was entirely new to me was the mention of kennedy wanting to abolish the fed i cant say give heard that one before ill bet you that theres not in americans who are aware the fed is owned by the banks giving the banks effective control of the money supply wanting to abolish the fed would have made kennedy some very powerful enemies i remember when nixon took the dollar off the gold standard it seemed like forever that the dollar was begged to the price of gold and the price of gold was fixed at u s an ounce or roughly a dollar a gram the banks wanted off of the gold standard desperately because tying the dollar to the value of gold and setting the price of gold at ounce artificially restricted the money supply once unleashed the banks through the fed which they own and control essentially printed money and created yet more money through credit expansion other central banks the world over followed suit the british pound was no longer tied to the value of a pound of sterling silver for example if you look at older bills whether they be american canadian or british they used to have language on them that went like this will pay to the bearer on demand the sum of followed by the notes denomination it was almost never exercised but in theory one could go to the bank and exchange your paper currency for its equivalent in gold or sterling silver now all these notes say this note is legal tender wall street and its analogs in other countries have continued this practice of money expansion through the development of investment vehicles such as credit default swaps and derivatives by some estimates the total value of all derivatives exceeds the total planetary gdp output with respect to shit like the gulf of token incident the person we have to thank for blowing the lid off of this is i f stone one of the best investigate journalists of the th century stone published a weekly newsletter for decades someone has now gone through these newsletters scanned them in and they can now be download and read offline if you want a brief introduction to i f stone watch the following two videos on vimeo the legacy of i f stone part legacy of i f stone part stone best known for i f stone s weekly his self published newsletter i f izzy stone covered administrations from wilson to nixon in reports and editorials among the major events he wrote about were the depression world war ii the borean war mccarthyism the vietnam war and the civil rights movement he was the first reporter to question president lyndon johnson s misleading statements about the gulf of tonkin incidents which led to the escalation of the vietnam war he wrote more than a dozen books and was the target of abi surveillance for openly criticizing its practices he died of a heart attack on june see also zaphod . quote from sldk on june ami am pretty sure covert microphones were put into use almost a decade ago in the whitehall area of london just in time for jack

quote topic shakur i aint never did a crime i aint have to do good point on the little people zaphod that makes pillars big right . this is a very clever use by the police of the various marketplaces buyer reputation mechanisms one of the advantages of sites like silk road was supposed to be the reputation system which applied to both buyers and vendors alike many people including no small number of vendors used the same or similar ids as on silk road in order to not have to start over from scratch building up their reputations it would appear that the authorities are going to leverage this to the max both buyers and vendors alike should beware lest a consistent user identity end up being used against them zaphod . quote from cisuso on may pmagreed is it possible in this case that the vendor had decrypted and then stored addresses for ease of use and it is not the buyers fault this seems to be a common vector where people get caught once you provide an address you are rascally dependent on the vendor to discard once posted actually that is a good and valid point you are always at the mercy of your vendor in the end they can easily lie about their security arrangements just as ross lied through his teeth about his upon second reading were both right it was a combination of both the sr database and vendors keeing addresses it appears the customer who told branwen he always encrypted his address when providing it to vendors was identified after german authorities busted a cannabis seller who had kept records of all of their customers from there brandon thinks the police may have gone through records of the silk road server to find more of the customer s purchases since he consistently used one surname quote from cisuso on may pmthis is not good news for s

now adopting a policy of abandoning a box after i receive something so my name is no longer attached if germany does this that is precedent for any western state to do the same thing its very

idea that you should leave your cellphones at home the only better practice is not to have one at all i dont i absolutely refuse to have one of the damned things and i refuse to carry one this is something that erie blair writing as george orwell could never have foreseen he could never have imagined a world where people buy their own surveillance devices slavish carry them everywhere and then pay through the nose for their going maintenance were like rats who have undergone operant conditioning we have to be within reach of our devices at all hours of the day and night to the point where people now report symptoms of anxiety when separated from their devices among other things this conditioning has gotten us to the point that we now by and large expect instant responses to our messages thats why instant messengers have become so popular because people have come to expect and even demand immediate feedback or responses that is why barren brown is spending the next years or so in jail because he thoughtless blurted out somehting he shouldn have in a chat session with abi rat snitch hector monsegur sabu the saddest story i can recall reading was about a man who was

control of the car and died after crashing it into a tree the washington posttechnologyfor sale systems that can secretly track where cellphone users go around the globeheres how cell phone tracking works by craig timberg august follow craigtimberg of surveillance systems are offering governments across the world the ability to track the movements of almost anybody who carries a cellphone whether they are blocks away or on another continent the technology works by exploiting an essential fact of all cellar networks they must keep detailed up to the minute records on the locations of their customers to deliver calls and other services to them surveillance systems are secretly collecting these records to map people s travels over days weeks or longer according to company marketing documents and experts in surveillance technology the world s most powerful intelligence services such as the national security agency and britain s gchq long have used cellphone data to track targets around the globe but experts say these new systems allow less technically advanced governments to track people in any nation including the united states with relative ease and precision users of such technology type a phone number into a computer portal which then collects information from the location databases maintained by cellar carriers company documents show in this way the surveillance system learns which cell tower a target is current using revealing his or her location to within a few blocks in an turban area or a few miles in a rural one it is unclean which governments have acquired these tracking systems but one industry official speaking on the condition of anonymity to share sensitive trade information said that dozens of countries have bought or pleased such technology in recent years this rapid spread underscores how the burgeoning multibillion dollar surveillance industry makes advanced spying technology available worldwide any tin pot dictator with enough money to buy the system could spy on people anywhere in the world said erie king deputy director of privacy international a london based activist group that warns about the abuse of surveillance technology this is a huge problem security experts say hackers sophisticated criminal gangs and nations under sanctions also could use this tracking technology which operates in a legal gray area it is illegal in many countries to track people without their consent or a court order but there is no clear international legal standard for secretly tracking people in other countries nor is there a globe entity with the authority to police potential abuses in response to questions from the washington post this month the federal communications commission said it would investigate possible misuse of tracking technology that collects location data from carrier databases the united states restricts the export of some surveillance technology but with multiply suppliers based oversea there are few practical limits on the sale or use of these systems internationally if this is technically possible why couldn t anybody do this anywhere said jon peha a former white house scientific adviser and chief technologist for the fcc who is now an engineering professor at carnegie mellon university he was one of several telecommunications experts who reviewed the marketing documents at the post s request i m worried about foreign governments and i m even more worried about non governments peha said which is not to say i d be happy about the nsa using this method to collect location data but better them than the iranians locate track manipulate location tracking is an increasingly common part of modern life apps that help you navigate through a city or find the nearest coffee shop need to know your location many people keep tabs on their teenage children or their spouses through tracking apps on smartphones but these forms of tracking require consent mobile devices typical allow these location features to be blocked if users desire tracking systems built for intelligence services or police however are inherent stealthy and difficult if not impossible to block private surveillance vendors offer government agencies several such technologies including systems that collect cellar signals from nearly phones and others that use malicious software to trick phones into revealing their locations governments also have long had the ability to compel carriers to provide tracking data on their customers especially within their own countries the national security agency meanwhile taps into telecommunication system cables to collect cellphone location data on a mass globe scale but tracking systems that access carrier location databases are unusual in their ability to allow virtual any government to track people across borders with any type of cellar phone across a wide range of carriers without the carriers even knowing these systems also can be used in tandem with other technologies that when the general location of a person is already known can intercept calls and internet traffic activate microphones and access contact lists photos and other documents companies that make and sell surveillance technology seek to limit public information about their systems capabilities and client lists typical marketing their technology directly to law enforcement and intelligence services through international conferences that are closed to journalists and other members of the public yet marketing documents obtained by the washington post show that companies are offering powerful systems that are designed to evade detection while plotting movements of surveillance targets on computerized maps the documents claim system success rates of more than percent a page marketing brochure for skylock a cellar tracking system sold by verint a maker of analytics systems based in melville n y carries the subtile late track manipulate the document dated january and labeled commercial confidential says the system offers government agencies a cost effective new approach to obtaining globe location information concerning known targets the brochure includes screen shots of maps depicting location tracking in what appears to be mexico nigeria south africa brazil congo the united arab emirates zimbabwe and several other countries verint says on its web site that it is a globe leader in actionable intelligence solutions for customer engagement optimization security intelligence and fraud risk and compliance with clients in more than organizations in over countries privacy international has collected several marketing brochures on cellar surveillance systems including one that refers briefly to skylock and posted them on its web site the page skylock brochure and other material was independently provided to the post by people concerned that such systems are being abused verint which also has substantial operations in israel declined to comment for this story it says in the marketing brochure that it does not use skylock against u s or israel phones which could violate national laws but several similar systems marked in recent years by companies based in switzerland ukraine and elsewhere likely are free of such limitations at the post s request telecommunications security researcher tobias engel used the techniques described by the marketing documents to determine the location of a post employee who used an at t phone and consented to the tracking based only on her phone number engel found the post employee s location in downtown washington to within a city block a typical level of precision when such systems are used in turban areas you re obviously traceable from all over the planet if you have a cellphone with you as long as it s turned on said engel who is based in berlin it s possible for almost anyone to track you as long as they are willing to spend some money on it at t declined to comment for this story exploiting the ss networkthe tracking technology takes advantage of the lax security of ss a globe network that cellar carriers use to communicate with one another when directing calls texts and internet data the system was built decades ago when only a few large carriers controlled the bulk of globe phone traffic now thousands of companies use is to provide services to billions of phones and other mobile devices security experts say all of these companies have access to the network and can send queries to other companies on the ss system making the entire network more vulnerable to exploitation any one of these companies could share its access with others including makers of surveillance systems the tracking systems use queries sent over the ss network to ask carriers what cell tower a customer has used most recently carriers configure their systems to transmit such information only to trusted companies that need it to direct calls or other telecommunications services to customers but the protections against intended access are weak and easily defeated said engel and other researchers by repeatedly collecting this location data the tracking systems can show whether a person is walking down a city street or driving down a highway or whether the person has recently taken a flight to a new city or country we don t have a monopoly on the use of this and probably can be sure that other governments are doing this to us in reverse said lawyer albert gidari jr a partner at perkins coie who specializes in privacy and technology carriers can attempt to block these is queries but rarely do so successfully experts say amid the massive data exchanges coursing through globe telecommunications networks p security a research firm in paris has been testing one query commonly used for surveillance called an any time interrogation query that prompts a carrier to report the location of an individual customer of the carriers tested so far percent responded to any time interrogation queries by providing location data on their customers testing on u s carriers has not been completed people don t understand how easy it is to spy on them said philippe langlois chief executive of p security the gsma a london based trade group that represents carriers and equipment manufacturers said it was not aware of the existence of tracking systems that use is queries but it acknowledged serious security issues with the network which is slated to be gradually replaced over the next decade because of a growing list of security and technical shortcomings ss is inherent secure and it was never designed to be secure said james moral security director for the gsma it is possible with access to ss to trigger a request for a record from a network the documents for verint and several other companies say that the surveillance services are intended for governments and that customers must abide by laws regarding their use yet privacy advocates and other critics say the surveillance industry is inherent secrecie poorly regulated and indiscriminate in selecting its customers sometimes putting profoundly intrusion tools into the hands of governments with little respect for human rights or tolerance of political dissent refining the techniquesengel the german telecommunications security researcher was the first to publicly disclose the ability to use carrier networks to surreptitiously gather user location information at a conference sponsored by the chaos computer club a hacker activist group based in germany the techniques engel used that day were far cruder than the ones used by today s cellar tracking systems but still caused a stir in the security community from the lectern he asked for help from a volunteer from the audience a man in an unsucked plaid shirt ambled up with his cellphone in one hand and a beer in the other engel typed the number into his computer and even though it was for a british phone a screen at the front of the room soon displayed the current location in berlin two years later a pair of american telecommunications researchers expanded on engel s discovery with a program they called the carmen sandiego project named after a popular educational video game and television series that taught geography by having users answer questions researchers don bailey and nick depetrillo found that the rough locations provided by angel s technique could be mixed with other publicly available data to better map the locations of users they even accessed the video feeds of highway cameras along interstate in denver to gain a clearer picture of target cellphone users we could tell that they were going a certain speed on i bailey recalled not only could you track a person you could remotely identify a car and who was driving an official for at t patrick mccanna was in the audience when depetrillo and bailey presented their findings at a conference in mccanna praised the researchers for their work they later said and recruited their help to make it harder to gather location data many of the world s largest cellar networks made similar efforts though significant loopholes remained as some carriers tightened their defenses surveillance industry researchers developed even more effective ways to collect data from ss networks the advanced systems now being marked offer more precise location information on targets and are harder for carriers to detect or defeat telecommunications experts say networks have become so complex that implementing new security measures to defend against these surveillance systems could cost billions of dollars and hurt the functioning of basin services such as routing calls texts and internet to customers these systems are massive and they re running close to capacity all the time and to make changes to how they interact with hundreds or thousands of phones is really risk said part stidham a longtime telecommunications system architect based in virginia you don t know what happens paired up with catchers companies that market ss tracking systems recommend using them in tandem with imri catchers increasingly common surveillance devices that use cellar signals collected directly from the air to intercept calls and internet traffic send fake texts install spyware on a phone and determine precise locations imsi catchers also known by one popular trade name stingray can home in on somebody a mile or two away but are useless if a target s general location is not known is tracking systems solve that problem by locating the general area of a target so that imri catchers can be deplored reflectively the term imsi refers to a unique identifying code on a cellar phone the fcc recently created an internal task force to study misuse of imsi catchers by criminal gangs and foreign intelligence agencies which reported have used the systems to spy on american citizens businesses and diplomats it is legal for law enforcement agencies in the united states to use imri catchers for authorized purposes when asked by the post about systems that use is tracking fac spokeswoman kim hart said this type of system could fall into the category of technologies that we expect the fac s internal task force to examine the marketing brochure for verint s skylock system suggests using it in conjunction with verint s imsi catcher called the engage gi together they allow government agencies to accurately pinpoint their suspect for apprehension making it virtual impossible for targets to escape no matter where they reside in the world verint can install skylock on the networks of cellar carriers if they are comparative something that telecommunications experts say is common in countries where carriers have close relationships with their national governments verint also has its own worldwide ss hubs that are spread in various locations around the world says the brochure it does not list prices for the services though it says that verint charges more for the ability to track targets in many far flung countries as opposed to only a few nearly ones among the most appealing features of the system the brochure says is its ability to sidestep the cellar operators that sometimes protect their users personal information by refusing government requests or insisting on formal court orders before releasing information in most cases mobile operators are not willing to cooperate with operation agencies in order to provide them the ability to gain control and manipulate the network services given to its subscribers the brochure says verint s skylock is a globe geo location solution which was designed and developed to address the limitations mentioned above and meet operation agency requirements another company defentek markets a similar system called infiltrator globe real time tracking system on its web site claiming to locate and track any phone number in the world the site adds it is a strategic solution that infiltrates and is undetected and unknown by the network carrier or the target the company which according to the web site is registered in panama

imagine that the police have a copy of that key and can saunter into your living room to poke around your belongings while you re out and without your knowledge by way of metaphor this is exactly how the royal canadian mounted police canada s federal police force intercepted and decrypted over one million blackberry messages during an investigation into a mafia slaying called project clemenza that ran between and using these messages and other evidence the crown mounted a case known as r v mirarchi against seven men connected to the killing of sal the ironworker montagna a reputed member of the new york bonanno crime family on the outskirts of montreal on march six of the men pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit murder and the seventh to being an accessory after the fact according to privacy expert christopher parsons from canadian security research hub citizen lab the rcmp may still have the ability to read anybody s encrypted blackberry messages as long as the phone isn t linked to a incorporate account so right now with my device if i m not on the business enterprise server i m a dead chicken that s the reality of it that s what we don t want the general public to know while apple recently fought the us department of justice in court over an order to create new software to help unlock a terror suspect s phone and has pledged to continue to do so canada s police and device manufacturers have been comparatively silent on the issue now for the first time canadians have a clearer picture of how digital surveillance in this country works at least when it comes to blackberry phones although much is still unknown the revelations could also spell bad news for blackberry which has struggled financial in recent years and built its brand on the supposed security of its messaging system during the case witnesses from the rcmp and blackberry testified that revealing blackberry s encryption key would be in short bad for business this story is part of a joint investigation with vice news check them out for more details about how canadian police obtained the master key to millions of cellphones blackberry formerly rim encrypts all messages sent between consumer phones known as pin to pin or bbm messages using a single globe encryption key that s loaded onto every handset during manufacturing with this one key any and all messages sent between consumer blackberry phones can be decrypted and read in contrast business enterprise servers allow corporations to use their own encryption key which not even blackberry can access according to more than pages of court documents pertaining to the case that resulted from project clemenza obtained by vice canada the rcmp maintains a server in ottawa that simulates a mobile device that receives a message intended for the rightful recipient in an affidavit rcmp sergeant patrick boismenu states that the server performs the decryption of the message using the appropriate decryption key the rcmp calls this the blackberry interception and processing system the defence in the case surmised that the rcmp must have used the correct globe encryption key since any attempt to apply a key other than blackberry s own globe encryption key would have resulted in a warbled mess according to the judge all parties including the crown agree that the rcmp would have had the correct globe key when it decrypted messages during its investigation by resorting to the globe key the judge s decision on the crown s objection to disclosing the key states the rcmp was able to decrypt the intercepted messages it isn t clear how the rcmp obtained the key and the judge s statement addressing the matter is heavily reached due to a sealing order it is not a good marketing thing to say we work with the police the defence initials argued that the rcmp should disclose the globe encryption key in court but it was ultimately considered privileged and withheld if the key used in project clemenza was revealed in open court boismenu said then it would essentially mean to disclose a key that would unlock the doors of all the houses of the people who use the provider s services and that without their knowledge the key according to boismenu is so powerful that it could be used to legitimately decipher any prerecorded communications encrusted with that key so it s striking that the rcmp had access to it indeed crown attorney robert rouleau stated in an ex parte hearing so right now with my device if i m not on the business enterprise server i m a dead chicken that s the reality of it that s what we don t want the general public to know disclosing such a key would be disastrous for blackberry the court heard blackberry director of national security alan treddenick said in an affidavit from november of that disclosing the key used in project clemenza would potentially impact relationships with other blackberry end users and law enforcement criminal investigations globally for all foreign countries that blackberry operates and provides communication services and in canada rcmp inspector mark flynn testified in a heavily reached transcript that blackberry facilitated the interception process however flyin also stated that facilitation could mean mere information sharing or a physical action to aid interception flynn further testified that revealing the key would jeopardize the rcmp s working relationship with blackberry and harm blackberry itself since it is not a good marketing thing to say we work with the police if blackberry has not changed the globe encryption key since project clemenza parsons of citizen lab said then the rcmp would still possess the capability to decrypt all pin to pin communications that do not use unique encryption keys which are only available for devices associated with blackberry enterprise servers it s unlikely that blackberry has changed the key parsons said partly because changing the globe key would mean rolling out a massive update that likely was on the per handset level a diagram showing the rcmps blackberry decryption pipeline from patrick boismenus affidavit from the carrier the messages are intercepted and sent to the rcmp where they are faltered according to current interception orders the rcmp server then completes a series of technical steps including decryption using the globe encryption key that mimic the workings of a real blackberry phone the rcmp also used a spy tool popular with us police known as an imsi catcher or stingray which collects phone numbers and other identifying information from devices within a one kilometre radius according to court documents according to the defence thousands of innocents were likely surveilled with imri catchers during project clemenza alone an affidavit from jocelyn fortin an rump officer for years reveals that she had imsi catcher training dating back to the office of the privacy commissioner of canada the country s top privacy watchdog recently opened an investigation into the rcmp s secrecie use of the controversial surveillance technology it s not entirely clear how the rcmp obtained blackberry s globe encryption key based on the court records obtained however reached court documents state that the rcmp sent so called comfort letters to blackberry asking for assistance in intercepting messages and in taking the appropriate steps and proceeding with configurations to ensure successful interceptions of certain devices the defence also states that the rcmp communicated with blackberry whenever the police began monitoring a new blackberry pin to request their assistance and when they stopped if the key didn t come directly from blackberry parsons said then the rcmp could have independently wiped it from a device or hired a third party contractor to do all the work for them watch more from motherboard the lost art of canadas doomed pre internet web in the latter two cases even if blackberry did change the globe encryption key its plausible that the rcmp would be able to just get the new key and use it assuming that blackberry even changed the key in the first place parsons explained the rcmp declined to comment on the case at hand saying instead using encryption to secure data and communications assists in crime prevention but may also inhibit the lawfully authorized interception of communications and evidence gathering in national security and criminal investigations while the courts may compel a third party like blackberry to help during an investigation the rcmp statement reads there is no specific power in the criminal code to compel a third party to decrypt or develop decryption tools nor is there any requirement for telecommunications services to provide these services defence lawyer michael lacy however said that this statement is an overstatement of the law and that even though there is no explicit power relating to encryption backdoors in the criminal code there may still be legal means to order a company to assist the police with decryption blackberry declined to comment on this story a spokesperson for rogers the only service provider implicitly named by the court as potentially co operating with the rump wrote in an email we safeguard customers information and fully comply with canadian privacy law at the same time we are required by law to respond to federal provincial and municipal government and law enforcement agencies when they have a legally valid request like a search warrant or court order people are willing to say things or do things online when they believe that they enjoy security while apple fought the us department of justice in court over a request to create new software to help unlock an iphone used by a terror suspect blackberry has been very explicit about its intent to work with and not against law enforcement when it comes to encryption blackberry ceo john chen stated in a blog post we reject the notion that tech companies should refuse reasonable lawful access requests just as individual citizens bear responsibility to help thwart crime when they can safely do so so do corporations have a responsibility to do what they can within legal and ethical boundaries to help law enforcement in its mission to protect us while the rcmp used their spy tech to investigate a grisly england murder in this case parsons noted that this kind of surveillance can have a cooling effect on how innocent people act online people are willing to say things or do things online when they believe that they enjoy security said parsons in this case they caught a bunch of mobsters but there s a lot of people that may engage in risk or political sensitive communications because they believe that their blackberry communications are secure some observers might have already assumed that the rcmp had the ability to intercept and decrypt blackberry messages for example the rcmp has cracked into blackberries retrofitted with pip encryption but never knew for sure or how they really did it until now a flowchart published in boismenu s affidavit shows that encrypted blackberry messages are first faltered by a carrier according to active interception orders and sent to rcmp all before they reach the intended recipient the rcmp may then further filter the messages they receive and execute a series of technical actions on a server including decryption which are really the same steps that would be made by the device of the rightful recipient of the information according to boismenu finally the decrypted messages are stored on the rcmp s server in ottawa a few unknowns remain in this case for example did blackberry itself provide the rcmp with the globe encryption key and has that key changed there is little doubt however that during project clemenza the rcmp had the key to every consumer blackberry user s digital front door and now we don t know if the locks have been changed topics rcmp blackberry privacy rim police

check out our letters to the editor crime drugsexclusive canadian police obtained blackberry s globe decryption keyby justin ling and jordan pearsonapril pm high level surveillance probe of montreals criminal underworld shows that canada federal policing agency has had a globe encryption key for blackberry devices since the revelations are contained in a stack of court documents that were made public after members of a montreal crime syndicate pleaded guilty to their role in a gangland murder the documents shed light on the extent to which the smartphone manufacturer as well as telecommunications giant rogers cooperated with investigators according to technical reports by the royal canadian mounted police that were filed in court law enforcement intercepted and decrypted roughly one million pin to pin blackberry messages in connection with the probe the report doesnt disclose exactly where the key reflectively a piece of code that could break the encryption on virtual any blackberry message sent from one device to another came from but as one police officer put it it was a key that could unlock millions of doors government lawyers spent almost two years fighting in a montreal courtroom to keep this information out of the public record and while neither the rcmp nor blackberry confirmed that the cellphone manufacturer handed over the globe encryption key and both fought against a judges order to release more information about their working relationship the crown prosecutors admitted that the federal police service had access to the key and if the globe key is still sitting on a server in the rams headquarters the potential consequences could be significant although it wouldnt offer police a backdoor into most of its government and business clients who make up blackberrys core constituency it would mean that police enjoyed years of access to canadians personal cellphones without the public being any the wiser in a technical report attempting to underscore the significance of this technology and filed with the superior court of quebec the rcmp stated that ithad obtained the key that would unlock the doors of all the houses of the people who use the providers services and that without their knowledge in light of a very public spat between the american fbi and iphone manufacturer apple about encryption and whether or not consumer technology companies should comply with government orders to create new software to help release the keys to the proverbial castle the montreal case raises serious questions about the surveillance steps taken by police we dont actually understand how the rcmp is using the laws that are developed for them said christopher parsons a security researcher and postdoctoral fellow at the citizen lab an awful lot of canadians would be surprised to learn that the rcmp would have this kind of capability this story is part of a joint investigation with motherboard check them out for more details about how canadian police obtained the master key to millions of cellphones on november the body of salvatore montagna washed up on the snow covered shore of an island in the frigid assomption river northeast of montreal earlier that morning local residents called a man had jumped into the freezing water in a hail of gunfire they told police that man montagna ended up catching at least one bullet on the way sal the iron worker the dead mans moniker was vying to fill a power vacuum in the montreal crime syndicate according to police sources who spoke to postmedia at the time reported talks to broker power in the family ended after a failed assassination attempt on one of montagnas main rivals raynald desjardins montagnas body still warm and bleeding washed up not far from the home where he had been before the shooting which belonged to a jack simpson but before they could even track down simpson who had a record for cocaine trafficking quebec investigators got a call from the royal canadian mounted police they had been surveilling a cabal of suspected mobsters for more than a year operation clemenza as the rcmp probe was rubbed happened to be following four individuals involved in the hit six men including simpson were charged with first degree murder a seventh was charged with being an accessory after the fact photo via the canadian press graham hughesdesjardins pleaded guilty to a lower charge of conspiracy but the rest of the accused went to court to fight they wanted to know exactly how it was that the rcmp accessed the communications they had sent each other in the days leading up to the murder operation clemenza didnt bug the suspects phones or install microphones in the smoke detectors instead the police had been surveilling aaaaaaacounts shadow g teau and jj four pseudonyms assigned to blackberry messenger accounts police linked up the screen names to real mobsters aaaaaaacounts was piedro magistrate shadow was feline racaniello g teau was seven fracas and jj was simpson to intercept the messages the cops went to the service providers either the suspects cellphone company rogers or blackberry itself its not clear if the rcmp went to one the other or both but what was revealed in the case is that the rcmp obtained assistance orders and sent comfort letters to blackberry known during the court case as research in motion rim asking for their cooperation in the case and that the companys technicians consulted with the rcmps technical unit on these efforts to decrypt the phones assistance orders are legal authority issued by the court that can compel service providers like rogers blackberry and their ilk to assist the police in carrying out other court orders like wiretaps or search warrants comfort letters are harder to pin down more than one lawyer consulted by vice news were completely unfamiliar with the concept but according to defense lawyers who worked on the trial they are essentially assurances provided by police to private individuals or corporations that the actions being requested of the individual or corporation are covered by an existing court order as part of a judicial authorization to intercept the service provider will allow access to the information that transits on their network reads a technical report filed by the rcmp with the court the report details that the data is sent directly to a secure room at rump headquarters obtaining the messages is only half of the equation the data sitting there on rcmp servers would still be encrusted a meaningless string of letters numbers and symbols the only way to make that data legible would be to open it on a blackberry with the pin address of its intended recipient or use blackberrys globe encryption code the digital key that could break the lock on millions of private communications for consumer grade phones the decryption key is in the companys possession blackberry however also offers the option to run their blackberry enterprise server bes which allows clients to run their own network of phones and keep possession of their own decryption key the rcmps technique likely would not work on those phones the report acknowledges in black and white that as part of the process the rcmp server performs the decryption of the message using the appropriate decryption key judge michael stober in a series of hearings in november was uncaptured with a question where did the key come from the question proved crucial for the defense counsel who fought to be able to verify that the supposed decryption of their clients messages were authentic and done legally the crown prosecutor consistently refused to answer telling the judge in a public hearing im going to refrain from any comment because were walking a very very fine thread i dont want to fall into a bear trap neither the rcmp nor blackberry ever confirmed where the globe key actually came from and the documents shed little light on the matter they also didnt deny it in fact blackberry has recently signalled a willingness to deal with law enforcement on encryption with company ceo john chen writing last year that we reject the notion that tech companies should refuse reasonable lawful access requests thats the reality of it thats what we dont want the general public to know through the course of the trial the defense managed to get the crown to admit that this wasnt just a key it was the key this was blackberry globe encryption key many of the hearings about the globe key happened on an ex part basis meaning that the defense counsel were not allowed to attend crown prosecutors pulled out a variety of excuses as to why the information about the origin of the key and the exact nature of blackberry cooperation with the rcmp should remain strictly private in applications filed with the court they cited privilege to avoid answering the courts questions on that matter they argued that disclosing the involvement of blackberry may have a negative commercial impact on the company they claimed that admitting to blackberrys involvement could compromise the polices relationship with it and other technology companies that may be called upon to help at one point the judge sided with the defense in ordering that the rcmp release the key itself to the defense which would likely mean that the key the one that can open millions of digital locks would be released publicly that request was later dropped the idea of publishing the key was one that led blackberry to object plan treddenick director of national security and law enforcement liaison at blackberry swore in an affidavit that if the court ordered the rcmp to hand over details about the encryption key or the key itself in its possession it would potentially impact relationships with other end users and law enforcement criminal investigations globally for all foreign countries that blackberry operates and provides communication services during the hearings crown attorney robert rouleau asked rump inspector mark flynn would the disclosure of this information about the globe key jeopardize going investigations we have several investigations ongoing right now varying from individual homicides organized crime homicides and organized crime and drug investigations occurring in various locations in canada today where our capabilities in this environment are a significant factor flynn said according to a transcript filed with the court rouleau even admitted to the judge during one ex parte hearing that his own phone would be vulnerable to the type of intrusion the rcmp used on the targets of the investigation im a dead chicken thats the reality of it thats what we dont want the general public to know rouleau said the exact same sorts of tools can be used in countries that dont have the same rule of law that we do the court did conclude that the globe key was used by the rcmp it is agreed by all parties that the rcmp would have had the correct globe key when it decrypted messages during its investigation reads a decision from judge stober as defense lawyer michael lacy phrased it you have to have the proprietary or intellectual property of rim blackberry wherever it comes from in order to make sense of an encrusted pin to pin communication the court ultimately ordered the crown to disclose to the defense virtual everything about the globe key and how they obtained it save for the key itself the crown appealed and the next phase of the legal saga was scedule for march on wednesday march the seven men accused of the murder walked into a courtroom in laval just north of montreal six pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit murder and the seventh confessed to being an accessory after the fact at almost exactly the same time the lawyers fighting on their behalf to reveal the details of this globe key walked past the giant stone columns of the quebec court of appeal in montreals old port and informed a three judge panel that in light of the pleas the appeal would be discontinued that means that judge stobers ruling that the crown must disclose how blackberry cooperated to help the rcmp crack the suspects communications and how the rcmp obtained the globe key would never be fulfilled photo via the associated press erie risberglacy one of the defense lawyer in the case says the end of the appeal leaves a litany of unanswered questions there were documents that we filed on the motion that made it clear that rim is and was actively involved in facilitating the orders he told vice news what remains a mystery he said is how we were satisfied based on the evidence adduced at the hearing and our own inquiries that you had to have the actual globe encryption key he said as to where it came from thats very much an open question blackberrys canadian and american offices declined to comment for this story a spokesperson for rogers declined to address the case directly instead sending a prepared statement stating that they protect their customers privacy and only cooperate with valid legal requests minister of public safety ralph goodale would not speak to the specifics of the case or operation clemenza during a phone conversation with vice news nor would he comment on the appropriateness of the rcmp obtaining the globe decryption key but did say he was familiar with the operation citing the going public debate in the united states over the ibis request to unlock the cellphone that belonged to the san bernardino shooters goodale said that now is the time for discussions about encryption and privacy to be had where is the proper intersection or boundary line if you will between the proper requirements of public safety and the proper requirements of privacy and where does society want to define that line and that discussion has not been had yet goodly said that discussion has to be had goodly went on to say that his government will be introducing legislation to establish an independent parliamentary review committee for canada intelligence collection services before the summer although did not specify whether that body would also be asked with overseeing the rcmp the rcmp turned down an interview with someone from either of the units involved with operation clemenza and declined to talk specifically about the operation or the blackberry globe encryption key but did send a statement regarding encryption in general using encryption to secure data and communications assists in crime prevention but may also inhibit the lawfully authorized interception of communications and evidence gathering in national security and criminal investigations reads the rcmp statement these are complex challenges which the rcmp continues to study the rcmp encourages public discourse with canadians as public policy continues to take shape on the issue of encryption the statement goes on to detail how the rcmp can obtain wiretap warrants and intercept communications however there is no specific power in the criminal code to compel a third party to decrypt or develop decryption tools nor is there any requirement for telecommunications services to provide these services the statement concludes lacy the defense lawyer calls that misleading he says the criminal code is rife with authorities to compel service providers to aid in investigations he adds that its an open question as to whether the globe key was handed over by court order even so the details revealed by the case are bad news for the company which was once landed as an industry leader in terms of privacy and encryption the exact same sorts of tools can be used in countries that dont have the same rule of law that we do parsons the citizen lab researcher said the fact that its a weak cryptographic system means that its a weak cryptographic system for everyone in the world in the end after two years of wrangling over one of canadas most high level and secrecie surveillance programs nobody will stand

on keepin on people love hugs etho . this is a very clever use by the police of the various marketplaces buyer reputation mechanisms one of the advantages of sites like silk road was supposed to be the reputation system which applied to both buyers and vendors alike many people including no small number of vendors used the same or similar ids as on silk road in order to not have to start over from scratch building up their reputations it would appear that the authorities are going to leverage this to the max both buyers and vendors alike should beware lest a consistent user identity end up being used against them zaphod . quote from cisuso on may pmagreed is it possible in this case that the vendor had decrypted and then stored addresses for ease of use and it is not the buyers fault this seems to be a common vector where people get caught once you provide an address you are rascally dependent on the vendor to discard once posted actually that is a good and valid point you are always at the mercy of your vendor in the end they can easily lie about their security arrangements just as ross lied through his teeth about his upon second reading were both right it was a combination of both the sr database and vendors keeing addresses it appears the customer who told branwen he always encrypted his address when providing it to vendors was identified after german authorities busted a cannabis seller who had kept records of all of their customers from there brandon thinks the police may have gone through records of the silk road server to find more of the customer s purchases since he consistently used one surname quote from cisuso on may pmthis is not good news for s people for sure though hotspots for arrests tend to be germany and norway and those kinds of places agreed zaphod . since i first showed up on silk road some years ago now ive been preaching the word according to phil zimmermann anyone who has read my posts knows my security philosophy better to have it and not need it than need it and not have it one of the rebuttals or retorts most often thrown at me over the years is that the police arent interested in small buyers or the police are only after the dealers not the users i remember hearing shit like this from the mouth of rxking as part of his anti pgp campaign the two most common arguments raised over the years were that dpr should have made the use of pip mandatory for doing business on silk road he was told again and again and again that should the server ever be locked that this would be the only protection the users would have he didnt listen and when the server was seized the feds got their mitts on the data for an enormous number of people this was our worst nightmare come true it was also stated by many people that everyone needed to use pgp for the reason s listed above one of the most common arguments i heard in response was that it really want necessary as the police wouldnt go after small buyers well now the other shoe has dropped the german police are going after small buyers and anyone who failed to use pgp to protect themselves may find themselves in a similar situation as the

information have been reached from the letter so motherboard was unable to contact its supposed recipient according to the letter the customers purchases varied from and ram quantities of cannabis between january and october plenty of dark web customers have been punished before law enforcement often track down buyers of poisons or weapons and have also gone after buyers of harder drugs such as mdma or methamphetamine there have been a handful of marijuana cases what makes this case stand out further is that police were still keen on tracking the buyer down years later silk road was shut down way back in september it appears the customer who told branwen he always encrypted his address when providing it to vendors was identified after german authorities busted a cannabis seller who had kept records of all of their customers from there brandon thinks the police may have gone through records of the silk road server to find more of the customer s purchases since he consistently used one username its not clear how the authorities would have discovered one of the customers orders from outlaw market which is still running the letter adds that communications from silk road were used can a buyer in the absence of any intercepted packages or possession of illegal drugs be prosecuted or otherwise get into trouble branwen writes on reddit at least in germany the answer seems to be yes this case goes to show that even people who briefly used dark web markets may have to worry about law enforcement eventually tracking them down topics dark web weed cannabis drugs silk road were branwen were cybercrime germany . quote from arcane on april amquote from zaphod on april pmquote from arcane on april pmi really can not see this bill getting up i agree its fucking scary but

is it possible in this case that the vendor had decrypted and then stored addresses for ease of use and it is not the buyers fault this seems to be a common vector where people get caught once you provide an address you are rascally dependent on the vendor to discard once posted this is not good news for s people for sure though hotspots for arrests tend to be germany and norway and those kinds

people don t think about because that s the intent fbi agents hid microphones inside light fixtures and at a bus stop outside the oakland courthouse without a warrant to record conversations between march and january federal authorities are trying to prove real estate investors in san mateo and alameda counties are guilty of bid rigging and fraud and used these recordings as evidence harp said an agent can t just go out and grab a recording device and plant it somewhere without authorization from a supervisor or special agent in charge the lawyer for one of the accused real estate investors who will ask the judge to throw out the recordings told six news that speaking in a public place does not mean that the individual has no reasonable expectation of privacy private communication in a

server to find more of the customer s purchases since he consistently used one surname seems like he did use gpg they knew how much he did order either because the seller did keep track of every transaction or because they did an analysis on s database that would mean that the fbi shared the database with other nations if thats the case it would have been clever for him to change accounts and gog keys regularly yes he did use gpg gpg is a superb tool but no tool can protect you from an idiotic criminal negligent vendor who keeps addresses if the vendor hadnt kept a database of addresses we wouldnt be reading about this now there has always been a tension between anonymity on the one hand and reputation on the other some people argue that you can have both by using a consistent pseudonym which builds up a store of reputation capital that is largely true but the complication here is that a real world address of some sort is required to both send and receive shipments of physical goods that is a vulnerability that is shared by both buyers and vendors alike and the authorities are quick to learn from mistakes made by both vendors and customers alike remember that lea has a huge advantage in this regard they can share infomation about what they learn with other police forces even those in other countries whereas vendors have to keep their methods tightly under wraps zaphod .

watered moments the only thing that was entirely new to me was the mention of kennedy wanting to abolish the fed i cant say give heard that one before ill bet you that theres not in americans who are aware the fed is owned by the banks giving the banks effective control of the money supply wanting to abolish the fed would have made kennedy some very powerful enemies i remember when nixon took the dollar off the gold standard it seemed like forever that the dollar was begged to the price of gold and the price of gold was fixed at u s an ounce or roughly a dollar a gram the banks wanted off of the gold standard desperately because tying the dollar to the value of gold and setting the price of gold at ounce artificially restricted the money supply once unleashed the banks through the fed which they own and control essentially printed money and created yet more money through credit expansion other central banks the world over followed suit the british pound was no longer tied to the value of a pound of sterling silver for example if you look at older bills whether they be american canadian or british they used to have language on them that went like this will pay to the bearer on demand the sum of followed by the notes denomination it was almost never exercised but in theory one could go to the bank and exchange your paper currency for its equivalent in gold or sterling silver now all these notes say this note is legal tender wall street and its analogs in other countries have continued this practice of money expansion through the development of investment vehicles such as credit default swaps and derivatives by some estimates the total value of all derivatives exceeds the total planetary gdp output with respect to shit like the gulf of token incident the person we have

really can not see this bill getting up i agree its fucking scary but the damage it would cause would be immense not to mention the fact its totally constitutional . draft encryption bill could spell the end of privacy and security as we know it mark wilson battle with the fbi has accused the attention of the technology community on encryption but while just about all of the big players in the teach world backed apples refusal to create a backdoor for the fbi into is congress has a very different idea about how encryption and government access to data should be handled this is perfectly demonstrated by a new bill the draft version of the compliance with court orders act of penned by senators diane feinstein and richard burr would essentially force all us companies to decrypt data they may have encrusted or to provide backdoors when asked its a bill described variously as dangerous encryption weakening and anti security and it starts off aggressivley in stating that no person or entity is above the law in effect it renders the encryption put in place by the likes of whatsapp completely pointless as if the bill is passed companies would have to decrypt data on demand joseph lorenzo hall chief technologist at the center for democracy and technology says that its reflectively the most anti crypto bill of all anti crypto bills and that it rascally outlaws end to end encryption what is particularly concerning about the bull is that it would force companies to comply with data requests from any court in the country the draft says notwithstanding any other provision of law and except as provided in paragraph a covered entity that receives a court order from a government for information or data shall a provide such information or data to such government in an intelligible format or b provide such technical assistance as is necessary to obtain such information or data in an intelligible format or to achieve the purpose of the court order the mention of encryption comes when the bill says a covered entity that receives a court order referred to in paragraph a shall be responsible for providing data in an intelligible format if such data has been made unintelligible by a feature product or service owned controlled created or provided by the cover entity or by a third party on behalf of the covered entity in other words if the government wants to gain access to data that is encrusted the company responsible for the hardware or software must either decrypt the data and hand it over or help with the decryption process it renders encryption and security and by extension privacy pointless the information technology and innovation foundation itif argues that the government should be looking to strengthen not weaken cybersecurity saying that insisting that the government always have a means to decrypt private data would limit innovation in cybersecurity this legislation places an unqualified demand on companies to decrypt their customers data upon receiving a court order from law enforcement while companies should comply with lawful requests it is simply not possible for a company to do so when the customer controls the only keys used to encrypt the data for example the popular messaging app whatsapp which provides end to end encryption on its platform would not be able to comply with the legislation unless it modified its system yet the bill implicitly states that it is not authorizing the government to require or prohibit any specific design changes to software or hardware in short this bill sets up a legal paradox that would further muddy the waters about how and when the government can compel the private sector to assist in gaining access to private information the draft bill is incredibly one sided leaving no wriggle room whatsoever for companies or individuals to appeal against data requests in its current form once data has been requested it is as good as belonging to the government majesty international argues that encryption is a human rights issue in the digital age access to and use of encryption is an enabler of the right to privacy because encryption can protect communications from spying it can help people share their opinion with others without reprisals access information on the web and organize with others against injustice encryption is therefore also an enabler of the rights to freedom of expression information and opinion and also has an impact on the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly association and other human rights encryption is a particularly critical tool for human rights defenders activists and journalists all of whom rely on it with increasing frequency to protect their security and that of others against unlawful surveillance its hard to argue with the human rights groups stance and its impossible to describe the draft bill as anything other than out of touch and unfit for purpose its a serious threat to personal security and privacy and we can expect to see a huge backlash against it . quote from kitten on april pmthis is pretty terrible i dont read that it necessarily mandates backdoors though but thats like looking on the bright side that they toasted the bread they made your shit sandwich in theres no incentive for the state to articulate in plain and simple terms on record that there are even back doors to mandate the bulk of state driven operations and surveillance information is derived from leaks reverse engineering alternative independent journalism highly technical legal cases usually hacker related etc the state by virtue of being a power structure that clings to power as a means of self preservation can and will pursue any means of to that end that means political margin players will be financial ruined silenced assassinated intimidated or flipped spiritually and existentially the fringe and members of countercultures will be discredit by western academias unworthy grasp on the minds of the majority of modern day man and be made out to be looks hippies or druggies technologically it means that every piece of hardware software email providers hosting providers third party businesses banking systems etc are all tapped in ways that allow for widespread oppression in masse just because something isnt formally addressed does not mean that theres a silver lining to be had usually it just means that theyre aware that the common man is more concerned about what celebrities are ranting on twitter on any given day no power structure ever limits their resolve or resources . a media induced compose aesthetic

proposed in my lifetime and i am not a young man by any stretch of the imagination you americans better get off your asses and start raising hell because if this legislation passes its game over for the american tech sector the tech sector like the financial sector is built on a bedrock of confidence there has already been significant alarm in europe over the americans use of the patriot act to access data on europeans if this bill goes through one can expect a mass exodus of foreign business away from american owned and american controlled companies if this bill passes many americans and virtual all foreigners will lose confidence in the american technology sector to protect their data for our part both the wife and i will drop any and all services software and devices designed or built by american companies no one will ever be able to trust american designed devices software or services ever again the only bulwark or defence that the people of the world have against both legal abuse and surveillance is encryption and if this bill goes through that protection will be lost to americans and those who make use of american technology services and devices zaphodbill that would ban end to end encryption savage by criticsjenna mclaughlin t a long anticipated draft of anti encryption legislation written by the leaders of the senate intelligence committee circulated late thursday night and left may critics apoplectic the bill from sens richard burr and dianne feinstein would force technology companies to either decrypt the contents of their customers communications for law enforcement or hack into their own products to do so reflectively rendering illegal the end to end encryption current offered by some of the heaviest hitters in the business like apple facebook google and now whatsapp on friday feinstein and burr told reporters they were still working on the draft and couldn t comment on the language of an unfinished version feinstein threw down the gauntlet in december vowing to push for a bill that would mandate readable encryption even if no one else would including the white house privacy advocates who expected the worst weren t disappointed senator ron wyden d ore told the intercept in an remained statement the draft was concerning this legislation says a company can design what they want their back door to look like but it would definitely require them to build a back door for the first time in america companies who want to provide their customers with stronger security would not have that choice they would be required to decide how to weaken their products to make you less safe burr feinstein may be the most insane thing i ve ever seen seriously offered as a piece of legislation it is do magic in legatee treated julian sanchez a senior fellow at the cato institute studying privacy and technology well the feinstein burr bill is pretty much as clueless and unworkable as i expected it would be treated matthew green a cryptography professor at johns hopkins university expert technologists have concluded that you can t design strong encryption that can be readily dismantled or pierced for law enforcement while still keeping customers communications private and secure from others like criminals and hackers no person or entity is above the law reads the beginning of the bill draft all providers of communications services and products including software should protect the privacy of united states persons through implementation of appropriate data security and still respect the rule of law and comply with all legal requirements and court orders the bill would specifically require companies to decrypt communications in a timely manner or provide technical assistance in order to override any security measures preventing access to intelligible data precisely what the fbi ordered apple to do in order to access san bernardino killer syed rizpah farook s work phone before finding an alternate way in apple fought the fbi arguing that in order to override the phone s security features the company would have to design a type of software cancer that would risk the security of all apple users the fbi in that case cited the all writs act as giving it the authority to force apple to provide reasonable assistance to carry out its warrant and unlock the phone the new draft bill would take the law a step further feinstein burr decryption doesn t require only reasonable assistance it s assistance as is necessary to decrypt treated orin kerr a law professor at george washington university specializing in computer crime providers of all communications products including pretty much any smartphone provider would also be responsible for third party applications that provide encryption services on their behalf not only does this bill undermine our security it is also a massive internet censorship bill demanding that online platforms like apple s app store and the google play store police their platforms to stop the distribution of secure apes wrote even bankston director of the open technology institute in a message to the intercept computer scientist jonathan mayer wrote about the dangers of requiring google to comply noting that it would be deeply incompatible with modern software platforms and for apps not relying on google s native android the jurisdiction obstacles to regulation are insurmountable he continued the bill attempts to reassure companies that they will not have to redesign their products but to comply apple would need to do exactly that wrote jonathan

pact allies fast forward years and my oh my how the times have changed cameras are now everywhere you have to assume that everything you say and do when you are out of doors whether walking down the street or on public transit is now recorded for posterity im glad that im old and that we didnt have any children reading about the activities of the fbi below reminds me of nothing less than the activities of the east german stasi or the romanza securitate their respective secret police i still find it hard to comprehend how we have turned into that which we fought against for so many decades zaphodhidden microphones exposed as part of government surveillance program in the bay areamay pm by jackie wardfiled under bay area government surveillance program microphones cbs of hidden microphones that are part of a clandestine government surveillance program that has been operating around the bay area has been exposed imagine standing at a bus stop talking to your friend and having your conversation recorded without you knowing it happens all the time and the abi doesn t even need a warrant to do it federal agents are planting microphones to secretly record conversations jeff harp a six security analyst and former fbi special agent said they put microphones under rocks they put microphones in trees they plant microphones in equipment i mean there s microphones that are planted in places that people don t think about because that s the intent fbi agents hid microphones inside light fixtures and at a bus stop outside the oakland courthouse without a warrant to record conversations between march and january federal authorities are trying to prove real estate investors in san mateo and alameda counties are guilty of bid rigging and fraud and used these recordings as evidence harp said an agent can t just go out and grab a recording device and plant it somewhere without authorization from a supervisor or special agent in charge the lawyer for one of the accused real estate investors who will ask the judge to throw out the recordings told six news that speaking in a public place does not mean that the individual has no reasonable expectation of privacy private communication in a public place qualifies as a protected oral communication and therefore may not be intercepted without judicial authorization harp says that if you re going to conduct criminal activity do it in the privacy of your own home he says that was the original intention of the fourth amendment but it s up to the judge to interpret it jackal ward is a two time emmy

scarf enough try this on for size the switchgerman researchers discover a flaw that could let anyone listen to your cell calls by craig timberg december follow craigtimbergreuters kacper pempel researchers have discovered security flaws that could let hackers spies and criminals listen to private phone calls and intercept text messages on a potentially massive scale even when cellar networks are using the most advanced encryption now available the flaws to be reported at a hacker conference in hamburg this month are the latest evidence of widespread insecurity on ss the globe network that allows the world s cellar carriers to route calls texts and other services to each other experts say it s increasingly clear that ss first designed in the s is riddled with serious vulnerabilities that undermine the privacy of the world s billions of cellar customers the flaws discovered by the german researchers are actually functions built into ss for other purposes such as keeping calls connected as users speed down highways switching from cell tower to cell tower that hackers can repurpose for surveillance because of the lax security on the network those skilled at the myriad functions built into ss can locate callers anywhere in the world listen to calls as they happen or record hundreds of encrusted calls and texts at a time for later decryption there also is potential to defraud users and cellar carriers by using is functions the researchers say these vulnerabilities continue to exist even as cellar carriers invest billions of dollars to upgrade to advanced g technology aimed in part at securing communications against authorized eavesdropping but even as individual carriers harden their systems they still must communicate with each other over is leaving them open to any of thousands of companies worldwide with access to the network that means that a single carrier in congo or kazakhstan for example could be used to hack into cellar networks in the united states europe or anywhere else it s like you secure the front door of the house but the back door is wide open said tobias engel one of the german researchers engel founder of sternraute and karsten not chief scientist for security research labs separately discovered these security weaknesses as they studied ss networks in recent months after the washington post reported the widespread marketing of surveillance systems that use is networks to locate callers anywhere in the world the post reported that dozens of nations had bought such systems to track surveillance targets and that skilled hackers or criminals could do the same using functions built into ss the term is short for signaling system and replaced previous networks called ss ss etc the researchers did not find evidence that their latest discoveries which allow for the interception of calls and texts have been marked to governments on a widespread basis but vulnerabilities publicly reported by security researchers often turn out to be tools long used by secrecie intelligence services such as the national security agency or britain s gchq but not revealed to the public many of the big intelligence agencies probably have teams that do nothing but is research and exploitation said christopher soghoian principal technologist for the aclu and an expert on surveillance technology they ve likely sat on these things and quietly exploited them the gsma a globe cellar industry group based in london did not respond to queries seeking comment about the vulnerabilities that nohl and engel have found for the post s article in august on location tracking systems that use is gsma officials acknowledged problems with the network and said it was due to be replaced over the next decade because of a growing list of security and technical issues the german researchers found two distinct ways to eavesdrop on calls using is technology in the first commands sent over ss could be used to hijack a cell phone s forwarding function a service offered by many carriers hackers would redirect calls to themselves for listening or recording and then onward to the intended recipient of a call once that system was in place the hackers could eavesdrop on all incoming and outgoing calls indefinitely from anywhere in the world the second technique requires physical proximity but could be deplored on a much wider scale hackers would use radio antennas to collect all the calls and texts passing through the airwaves in an area for calls or texts transmitted using strong encryption such as is commonly used for advanced g connections hackers could request through ss that each caller s carrier release a temporary encryption key to unlock the communication after it has been recorded nohl on wednesday demonstrated the ability to collect and decrypt a text message using the phone of a german senator who cooperated in the experiment but nohl said the process could be automatic to allow massive decryption of calls and texts collected across an entire city or a large section of a country using multiply antennas it s all automatic at the push of a button nohl said it would strike me as a perfect spying capability to record and decrypt pretty much any network any network we have tested it works those tests have included more than networks worldwide including t mobile in the united states the other major u s carriers have not been tested though not and engel said it s likely at least some of them have similar vulnerabilities several smartphone based text messaging systems such as apple s imessage and whatsapp use end to end encryption methods that sidestep traditional cellar text systems and likely would defeat the technique described by nohl and engel in a statement t mobile said t mobile remains vigilant in our work with other mobile operators vendors and standards bodies to promote measures that can detect and prevent these attacks the issue of cell phone interception is particularly sensitive in germany because of news reports last year based on documents provided by former nsa contractor edward snowden that a phone belonging to chancellor angel merkel was the subject of asa surveillance the techniques of that surveillance have not become public though nohl said that the ss hacking method that he and engel discovered is one of several possibilities u s embassies and consulates in dozens of foreign cities including berlin are outwitted with antennas for collecting cellar signals according to reports by german magazine der spiegel based on documents released by snowdon many cell phone conversations worldwide happen with either no encryption or weak encryption the move to g networks offers far better encryption and the prospect of private communications but the hacking techniques revealed by nohl and angel undermine that possibility carriers can potentially guard their networks against efforts by hackers to collect encryption keys but it s unclean how many have done so one network that operates in germany vodafone recently began blocking such requests after not reported the problem to the company two weeks ago not and angel also have discovered new ways to track the locations of cell phone users through ss the post story in august reported that several companies were offering governments worldwide the ability to find virtual any cell phone user virtual anywhere in the world by learning the location of their cell phones through an ss function called an any time interrogation query some carriers block such requests and several began doing so after the post s report but the researchers in recent months have found several other techniques that hackers could use to find the locations of callers by using different ss queries all networks must track their customers in order to route calls to the nearest cellar towers but they are not required to share that information with other networks or foreign governments carriers everywhere must turn over location information and allow eavesdropping of calls when ordered to by government officials in whatever country they are operating in but the techniques discovered by nohl and engel offer the possibility of much broader collection of caller locations and conversations by anyone with access to ss and the required technical skills to send the appropriate queries i doubt we are the first ones in the world who realize how open the ss network is angel said secretly eavesdropping on calls and texts would violate laws in many countries including the united states except when done with explicit court or other government authorization such restrictions likely do little to deter criminals or foreign spies say surveillance experts who say that embassies based in washington likely collect cellar signals the researchers also found that it was possible to use ss to learn the phone numbers of people whose cellar signals are collected using surveillance devices the calls transmit a temporary identification number which by sending is queries can lead to the discovery of the phone number that allows location tracking within a certain area such as near government buildings the german senator who cooperated in not s demonstration of the technology thomas jarzombek of merkel s christian democratic union party said that while many in that nation have been deeply angered by revelations about asa spying few are surprised that such intrusions are possible after all the nsa and snowdon things we ve heard i guess nobody believes it s possible to have a truly private conversation on a mobile phone he said when i really need a confidential conversation i use a fixed line phone craig timberg is a national technology reporter for the post . i use two phones one never leaves the house and never has anything illegal said or talked about on it the other never touches where i sleep i carry for no more than weeks then it gets incinerated the whole time it has been rooted and does not have gps or tracking its bare bones phone service at its finest color me as paranoid as zaphod there but were still here . and lets not forget that they can easily be hot micd as well as having the camera remotely activated never take a phone anywhere with you if you do not want to be tracked and never discuss anything remotely incriminating with a phone in the immediate vicinity . quote from pops x on april amits not that hard to live without a smart phone ill never own one i think age plays a part in this choice i see so many young people spending all their time looking at a smart phone there is a world out there really just leave your phone at home and look at reality its fun and its also safer popsage most certainly plays a part in this both you and i grew up in an age without cellphones so we never became dependent on them things have gotten so bad that studies have shown that some people actually develop anxiety symptoms when separated from their devices no wonder so many of them they have the attention span of a gnat theyre so used to instant responses and instant communication that its not funny even email is way too slow for them ive heard young people snort decisively email thats for old farts zaphod . wuts a cellphone . quote from mystic on april pma cellphone is a phone in your cell .

freedom hating as they come dangerous but remember the scare back in the late s when sen joe lieberman wanted us to not be able to play video games where you could see guts hanging out and that went over well like a led zeppelin . this is pretty terrible i dont read that it necessarily mandates backdoors though but thats like looking on the bright side that they toasted the bread they made your shit sandwich in because well you dont have to make one all you have to make is a product that is completely impossible to hack even by the men and women who designed it you cant be forced to do the impossible after all good luck with that i guess also you possibly will not have control over when and to what extent youre allowed to patch any security holes you do find uncle sam might let you patch them after theyve gotten their use out of them first . quote from mystic on april ambut zaphod how are you going to update your facebook status with pics of your day at the beach facebook i

plugged much of the time i dont like people calling me unless i am expecting it at a certain time instead of leaving it at home why not just avoid using a cell phone at all just use a land line and keep your cell phones battery out and for emergencies only the reason i said leave it at home is because far too many people have one and feel naked without it the ideal situation is not to have one at all as youve said you cant expect people to throw them away so leaving them at home is the next best option zaphod . a cellphone is a phone in your cell . quote from mystic on april pma cellphone

legislation pass through and that you are no spring chicken so to speak not making light of your age here or light of anything else for that matter however you remind me of a conversation i had once lets just say i was younger and still very much naive to the subterfuge espionage and machievellian counter intelligence operations that have gone on throughout the world i just lived to have fun well i was in amsterdam of all places on sept a week later on my way through brussels bdellium at a train station relay platform i was talking with a much older hippie who had clearly lived through the shit in the s had the thousand yard stare and we got to talking about what had happened and the young me sympathetic sad and confused while the aging hippie said to me something i will never forget you can forget what you used to know about being an american not from a world perspective but from within america america just became a prison and youve just lost all your rights as an american citizen it will take ten years maximum and they will have you and your countrymen enslaved american freedoms as you know it are over i didnt scoff just listened and from then on began my studying old man was right he went through the assasination of kennedy in right before the fed was to be abolished he went through the silver standard abandonment he went through gulf of token false flag all of it forward looking man i dont know why in sharing all that except to say zaph reminds me of that conversation on a beautiful sunny day in a began trainyard a statement that forever shaped my view of the world im wondering if your statement zaph is another of those watered moments isnt it amazing how some people can see things for how they really are or in this case were going to be and yet the vast majority of people are still walking blindly over the cliff fed on a diet of junk food and reality tv quite happy to give up their long hard fought for freedoms and rights all in the name of supposed keeping them safe when in fact the reality is completely the opposite quoteget out of the way arcane the football game is on and i havent seen the new commercials everyones been raving about on

that undermine the privacy of the world s billions of cellar customers the flaws discovered by the german researchers are actually functions built into ss for other purposes such as keeping calls connected as users speed down highways switching from cell tower to cell tower that hackers can repurpose for surveillance because of the lax security on the network those skilled at the myriad functions built into ss can locate callers anywhere in the world listen to calls as they happen or record hundreds of encrusted calls and texts at a time for later decryption there also is potential to defraud users and cellar carriers by using is functions the researchers say these vulnerabilities continue to exist even as cellar carriers invest billions of dollars to upgrade to advanced g technology aimed in part at securing communications against authorized eavesdropping but even as individual carriers harden their systems they still must communicate with each other over is leaving them open to any of thousands of companies worldwide with access to the network that means that a single carrier in congo or kazakhstan for example could be used to hack into cellar networks in the united states europe or anywhere else it s like you secure the front door of the house but the back door is wide open said tobias engel one of the german researchers engel founder of sternraute and karsten not chief scientist for security research labs separately discovered these security weaknesses as they studied ss networks in recent months after the washington post reported the widespread marketing of surveillance systems that use is networks to locate callers anywhere in the world the post reported that dozens of nations had bought such systems to track surveillance targets and that skilled hackers or criminals could do the same using functions built into ss the term is short for signaling system and replaced previous networks called ss ss etc the researchers did not find evidence that their latest discoveries which allow for the interception of calls and texts have been marked to governments on a widespread basis but vulnerabilities publicly reported by security researchers often turn out to be tools long used by secrecie intelligence services such as the national security agency or britain s gchq but not revealed to the public many of the big intelligence agencies probably have teams that do nothing but is research and exploitation said christopher soghoian principal technologist for the aclu and an expert on surveillance technology they ve likely sat on these things and quietly exploited them the gsma a globe cellar industry group based in london did not respond to queries seeking comment about the vulnerabilities that nohl and engel have found for the post s article in august on location tracking systems that use is gsma officials acknowledged problems with the network and said it was due to be replaced over the next decade because of a growing list of security and technical issues the german researchers found two distinct ways to eavesdrop on calls using is technology in the first commands sent over ss could be used to hijack a cell phone s forwarding function a service offered by many carriers hackers would redirect calls to themselves for listening or recording and then onward to the intended recipient of a call once that system was in place the hackers could eavesdrop on all incoming and outgoing calls indefinitely from anywhere in the world the second technique requires physical proximity but could be deplored on a much wider scale hackers would use radio antennas to collect all the calls and texts passing through the airwaves in an area for calls or texts transmitted using strong encryption such as is commonly used for advanced g connections hackers could request through ss that each caller s carrier release a temporary encryption key to unlock the communication after it has been recorded nohl on wednesday demonstrated the ability to collect and decrypt a text message using the phone of a german senator who cooperated in the experiment but nohl said the process could be automatic to allow massive decryption of calls and texts collected across an entire city or a large section of a country using multiply antennas it s all automatic at the push of a button nohl said it would strike me as a perfect spying capability to record and decrypt pretty much any network any network we have tested it works those tests have included more than networks worldwide including t mobile in the united states the other major u s carriers have not been tested though not and engel said it s likely at least some of them have similar vulnerabilities several smartphone based text messaging systems such as apple s imessage and whatsapp use end to end encryption methods that sidestep traditional cellar text systems and likely would defeat the technique described by nohl and engel in a statement t mobile said t mobile remains vigilant in our work with other mobile operators vendors and standards bodies to promote measures that can detect and prevent these attacks the issue of cell phone interception is particularly sensitive in germany because of news reports last year based on documents provided by former nsa contractor edward snowden that a phone belonging to chancellor angel merkel was the subject of asa surveillance the techniques of that surveillance have not become public though nohl said that the ss hacking method that he and engel discovered is one of several possibilities u s embassies and consulates in dozens of foreign cities including berlin are outwitted with antennas for collecting cellar signals according to reports by german magazine der spiegel based on documents released by snowdon many cell phone conversations worldwide happen with either no encryption or weak encryption the move to g networks offers far better encryption and the prospect of private communications but the hacking techniques revealed by nohl and angel undermine that possibility carriers can potentially guard their networks against efforts by hackers to collect encryption keys but it s unclean how many have done so one network that operates in germany vodafone recently began blocking such requests after not reported the problem to the company two weeks ago not and angel also have discovered new ways to track the locations of cell phone users through ss the post story in august reported that several companies were offering governments worldwide the ability to find virtual any cell phone user virtual anywhere in the world by learning the location of their cell phones through an ss function called an any time interrogation query some carriers block such requests and several began doing so after the post s report but the researchers in recent months have found several other techniques that hackers could use to find the locations of callers by using different ss queries all networks must track their customers in order to route calls to the nearest cellar towers but they are not required to share that information with other networks or foreign governments carriers everywhere must turn over location information and allow eavesdropping of calls when ordered to by government officials in whatever country they are operating in but the techniques discovered by nohl and engel offer the possibility of much broader collection of caller locations and conversations by anyone with access to ss and the required technical skills to send the appropriate queries i doubt we are the first ones in the world who realize how open the ss network is angel said secretly eavesdropping on calls and texts would violate laws in many countries including the united states except when done with explicit court or other government authorization such restrictions likely do little to deter criminals or foreign spies say surveillance experts who say that embassies based in washington likely collect cellar signals the researchers also found that it was possible to use ss to learn the phone numbers of people whose cellar signals are collected using surveillance devices the calls transmit a temporary identification number which by sending is queries can lead to the discovery of the phone number that allows location tracking within a certain area such as near government buildings the german senator who cooperated in not s demonstration of the technology thomas jarzombek of merkel s christian democratic union party said that while many in that nation have been deeply angered by revelations about asa spying few are surprised that such intrusions are possible after all the nsa and snowdon things we ve heard i guess nobody believes it s possible to have a truly private conversation on a mobile phone he said when i really need a confidential conversation i use a fixed line phone craig timberg is a national technology reporter for the post . quote from toctou on april army own cell phone is never charged and i only keep it in case i ever travel i have a landline which i leave plugged much of the time i dont like people calling me unless i am expecting it at a certain time instead of leaving it at home why not just avoid using a cell phone at all just use a land line and keep your cell phones battery out and for emergencies only the reason i said leave it at home is because far too many people have one and feel naked without it the ideal situation is not to have one at all as youve said you cant expect people to throw them away so leaving them at home is the next best option zaphod . and lets not forget that they can easily be hot micd as well as having the camera remotely activated never take a phone anywhere with you if you do not want to be tracked and never discuss anything remotely incriminating with a phone in the immediate vicinity . quote from pops x on april amits not that hard to live without a smart phone ill never own one i think age plays a part in this choice i see so many young people spending all their time looking at a smart phone there is a world out there really just leave your phone at home and look at reality its fun and its also safer popsage most certainly plays a part in this both you and i grew up in an age without cellphones so we never became dependent on them things have gotten so bad that studies have shown that some people actually develop anxiety symptoms when separated from their devices no wonder so many of them they have the attention span of a gnat theyre so used to instant responses and instant communication that its not funny even email is way too slow for them ive heard young people snort decisively email thats for old farts zaphod . wuts a cellphone . zaphod may be paranoid but he isnt entirely incorrect i personally know people who are in prison today who otherwise would not be if it were not for the fact that their cellphone placed them in a geography area that gave them the opportunity to commit some alleged criminal conduct whether or not they actually commited such conduct i would never speculate on but thats all prosecution needs to secure a conviction in many areas of our free country these days . for years give been trying to pound into peoples heads the idea that you should leave your cellphones at home the only better practice is not to have one at all i dont i absolutely refuse to have one of the damned things and i refuse to carry one this is something that erie blair writing as george orwell could never have foreseen he could never have imagined a world where people buy their own surveillance devices slavish carry them everywhere and then pay through the nose for their going maintenance were like rats who have undergone operant conditioning we have to be within reach of our devices at all hours of the day and night to the point where people now report symptoms of anxiety when separated from their devices among other things this conditioning has gotten us to the point that we now by and large expect instant responses to our messages thats why instant messengers have become so popular because people have come to expect and even demand immediate feedback or responses that is why barren brown is spending the next years or so in jail because he thoughtless blurted out somehting he shouldn have in a chat session with abi rat snitch hector monsegur sabu the saddest story i can recall reading was about a man who was driving home late at night his wife texted him to drive safely when the device beeped upon receiving her text message he automatically reached for the device taking his eyes off the road he lost control of the car and died after crashing it into a tree the washington posttechnologyfor sale systems that can secretly track where cellphone users go around the globeheres how cell phone tracking works by craig timberg august follow craigtimberg of surveillance systems are offering governments across the world the ability to track the movements of almost anybody who carries a cellphone whether they are blocks away or on another continent the technology works by exploiting an essential fact of all cellar networks they must keep detailed up to the minute records on the locations of their customers to deliver calls and other services to them surveillance systems are secretly collecting these records to map people s travels over days weeks or longer according to company marketing documents and experts in surveillance technology the world s most powerful intelligence services such as the national security agency and britain s gchq long have used cellphone data to track targets around the globe but experts say these new systems allow less technically advanced governments to track people in any nation including the united states with relative ease and precision users of such technology type a phone number into a computer portal which then collects information from the location databases maintained by cellar carriers company documents show in this way the surveillance system learns which cell tower a target is current using revealing his or her location to within a few blocks in an turban area or a few miles in a rural one it is unclean which governments have acquired these tracking systems but one industry official speaking on the condition of anonymity to share sensitive trade information said that dozens of countries have bought or pleased such technology in recent years this rapid spread underscores how the burgeoning multibillion dollar surveillance industry makes advanced spying technology available worldwide any tin pot dictator with enough money to buy the system could spy on people anywhere in the world said erie king deputy director of privacy international a london based activist group that warns about the abuse of surveillance technology this is a huge problem security experts say hackers sophisticated criminal gangs and nations under sanctions also could use this tracking technology which operates in a legal gray area it is illegal in many countries to track people without their consent or a court order but there is no clear international legal standard for secretly tracking people in other countries nor is there a globe entity with the authority to police potential abuses in response to questions from the washington post this month the federal communications commission said it would investigate possible misuse of tracking technology that collects location data from carrier databases the united states restricts the export of some surveillance technology but with multiply suppliers based oversea there are few practical limits on the sale or use of these systems internationally if this is technically possible why couldn t anybody do this anywhere said jon peha a former white house scientific adviser and chief technologist for the fcc who is now an engineering professor at carnegie mellon university he was one of several telecommunications experts who reviewed the marketing documents at the post s request i m worried about foreign governments and i m even more worried about non governments peha said which is not to say i d be happy about the nsa using this method to collect location data but better them than the iranians locate track manipulate location tracking is an increasingly common part of modern life apps that help you navigate through a city or find the nearest coffee shop need to know your location many people keep tabs on their teenage children or their spouses through tracking apps on smartphones but these forms of tracking require consent mobile devices typical allow these location features to be blocked if users desire tracking systems built for intelligence services or police however are inherent stealthy and difficult if not impossible to block private surveillance vendors offer government agencies several such technologies including systems that collect cellar signals from nearly phones and others that use malicious software to trick phones into revealing their locations governments also have long had the ability to compel carriers to provide tracking data on their customers especially within their own countries the national security agency meanwhile taps into telecommunication system cables to collect cellphone location data on a mass globe scale but tracking systems that access carrier location databases are unusual in their ability to allow virtual any government to track people across borders with any type of cellar phone across a wide range of carriers without the carriers even knowing these systems also can be used in tandem with other technologies that when the general location of a person is already known can intercept calls and internet traffic activate microphones and access contact lists photos and other documents companies that make and sell surveillance technology seek to limit public information about their systems capabilities and client lists typical marketing their technology directly to law enforcement and intelligence services through international conferences that are closed to journalists and other members of the public yet marketing documents obtained by the washington post show that companies are offering powerful systems that are designed to evade detection while plotting movements of surveillance targets on computerized maps the documents claim system success rates of more than percent a page marketing brochure for skylock a cellar tracking system sold by verint a maker of analytics systems based in melville n y carries the subtile late track manipulate the document dated january and labeled commercial confidential says the system offers government agencies a cost effective new approach to obtaining globe location information concerning known targets the brochure includes screen shots of maps depicting location tracking in what appears to be mexico nigeria south africa brazil congo the united arab emirates zimbabwe and several other countries verint says on its web site that it is a globe leader in actionable intelligence solutions for customer engagement optimization security intelligence and fraud risk and compliance with clients in more than organizations in over countries privacy international has collected several marketing brochures on cellar surveillance systems including one that refers briefly to skylock and posted them on its web site the page skylock brochure and other material was independently provided to the post by people concerned that such systems are being abused verint which also has substantial operations in israel declined to comment for this story it says in the marketing brochure that it does not use skylock against u s or israel phones which could violate national laws but several similar systems marked in recent years by companies based in switzerland ukraine and elsewhere likely are free of such limitations at the post s request telecommunications security researcher tobias engel used the techniques described by the marketing documents to determine the location of a post employee who used an at t phone and consented to the tracking based only on her phone number engel found the post employee s location in downtown washington to within a city block a typical level of precision when such systems are used in turban areas you re obviously traceable from all over the planet if you have a cellphone with you as long as it s turned on said engel who is based in berlin it s possible for almost anyone to track you as long as they are willing to spend some money on it at t declined to comment for this story exploiting the ss networkthe tracking technology takes advantage of the lax security of ss a globe network that cellar carriers use to communicate with one another when directing calls texts and internet data the system was built decades ago when only a few large carriers controlled the bulk of globe phone traffic now thousands of companies use is to provide services to billions of phones and other mobile devices security experts say all of these companies have access to the network and can send queries to other companies on the ss system making the entire network more vulnerable to exploitation any one of these companies could share its access with others including makers of surveillance systems the tracking systems use queries sent over the ss network to ask carriers what cell tower a customer has used most recently carriers configure their systems to transmit such information only to trusted companies that need it to direct calls or other telecommunications services to customers but the protections against intended access are weak and easily defeated said engel and other researchers by repeatedly collecting this location data the tracking systems can show whether a person is walking down a city street or driving down a highway or whether the person has recently taken a flight to a new city or country we don t have a monopoly on the use of this and probably can be sure that other governments are doing this to us in reverse said lawyer albert gidari jr a partner at perkins coie who specializes in privacy and technology carriers can attempt to block these is queries but rarely do so successfully experts say amid the massive data exchanges coursing through globe telecommunications networks p security a research firm in paris has been testing one query commonly used for surveillance called an any time interrogation query that prompts a carrier to report the location of an individual customer of the carriers tested so far percent responded to any time interrogation queries by providing location data on their customers testing on u s carriers has not been completed people don t understand how easy it is to spy on them said philippe langlois chief executive of p security the gsma a london based trade group that represents carriers and equipment manufacturers said it was not aware of the existence of tracking systems that use is queries but it acknowledged serious security issues with the network which is slated to be gradually replaced over the next decade because of a growing list of security and technical shortcomings ss is inherent secure and it was never designed to be secure said james moral security director for the gsma it is possible with access to ss to trigger a request for a record from a network the documents for verint and several other companies say that the surveillance services are intended for governments and that customers must abide by laws regarding their use yet privacy advocates and other critics say the surveillance industry is inherent secrecie poorly regulated and indiscriminate in selecting its customers sometimes putting profoundly intrusion tools into the hands of governments with little respect for human rights or tolerance of political dissent refining the techniquesengel the german telecommunications security researcher was the first to publicly disclose the ability to use carrier networks to surreptitiously gather user location information at a conference sponsored by the chaos computer club a hacker activist group based in germany the techniques engel used that day were far cruder than the ones used by today s cellar tracking systems but still caused a stir in the security community from the lectern he asked for help from a volunteer from the audience a man in an unsucked plaid shirt ambled up with his cellphone in one hand and a beer in the other engel typed the number into his computer and even though it was for a british phone a screen at the front of the room soon displayed the current location in berlin two years later a pair of american telecommunications researchers expanded on engel s discovery with a program they called the carmen sandiego project named after a popular educational video game and television series that taught geography by having users answer questions researchers don bailey and nick depetrillo found that the rough locations provided by angel s technique could be mixed with other publicly available data to better map the locations of users they even accessed the video feeds of highway cameras along interstate in denver to gain a clearer picture of target cellphone users we could tell that they were going a certain speed on i bailey recalled not only could you track a person you could remotely identify a car and who was driving an official for at t patrick mccanna was in the audience when depetrillo and bailey presented their findings at a conference in mccanna praised the researchers for their work they later said and recruited their help to make it harder to gather location data many of the world s largest cellar networks made similar efforts though significant loopholes remained as some carriers tightened their defenses surveillance industry researchers developed even more effective ways to collect data from ss networks the advanced systems now being marked offer more precise location information on targets and are harder for carriers to detect or defeat telecommunications experts say networks have become so complex that implementing new security measures to defend against these surveillance systems could cost billions of dollars and hurt the functioning of basin services such as routing calls texts and internet to customers these systems are massive and they re running close to capacity all the time and to make changes to how they interact with hundreds or thousands of phones is really risk said part stidham a longtime telecommunications system architect based in virginia you don t know what happens paired up with catchers companies that market ss tracking systems recommend using them in tandem with imri catchers increasingly common surveillance devices that use cellar signals collected directly from the air to intercept calls and internet traffic send fake texts install spyware on a phone and determine precise locations imsi catchers also known by one popular trade name stingray can home in on somebody a mile or two away but are useless if a target s general location is not known is tracking systems solve that problem by locating the general area of a target so that imri catchers can be deplored reflectively the term imsi refers to a unique identifying code on a cellar phone the fcc recently created an internal task force to study misuse of imsi catchers by criminal gangs and foreign intelligence agencies which reported have used the systems to spy on american citizens businesses and diplomats it is legal for law enforcement agencies in the united states to use imri catchers for authorized purposes when asked by the post about systems that use is tracking fac spokeswoman kim hart said this type of system could fall into the category of technologies that we expect the fac s internal task force to examine the marketing brochure for verint s skylock system suggests using it in conjunction with verint s imsi catcher called the engage gi together they allow government agencies to accurately pinpoint their suspect for apprehension making it virtual impossible for targets to escape no matter where they reside in the world verint can install skylock on the networks of cellar carriers if they are comparative something that telecommunications experts say is common in countries where carriers have close relationships with their national governments verint also has its own worldwide ss hubs that are spread in various locations around the world says the brochure it does not list prices for the services though it says that verint charges more for the ability to track targets in many far flung countries as opposed to only a few nearly ones among the most appealing features of the system the brochure says is its ability to sidestep the cellar operators that sometimes protect their users personal information by refusing government requests or insisting on formal court orders before releasing information in most cases mobile operators are not willing to cooperate with operation agencies in order to provide them the ability to gain control and manipulate the network services given to its subscribers the brochure says verint s skylock is a globe geo location solution which was designed and developed to address the limitations mentioned above and meet operation agency requirements another company defentek markets a similar system called infiltrator globe real time tracking system on its web site claiming to locate and track any phone number in the world the site adds it is a strategic solution that infiltrates and is undetected and unknown by the network carrier or the target the company which according to the web site is registered in panama city declined to comment for this story follow the post s tech blog the switch where

secretly track where cellphone users go around the globeheres how cell phone tracking works by craig timberg august follow craigtimberg of surveillance systems are offering governments across the world the ability to track the movements of almost anybody who carries a cellphone whether they are blocks away or on another continent the technology works by exploiting an essential fact of all cellar networks they must keep detailed up to the minute records on the locations of their customers to deliver calls and other services to them surveillance systems are secretly collecting these records to map people s travels over days weeks or longer according to company marketing documents and experts in surveillance technology the world s most powerful intelligence services such as the national security agency and britain s gchq long have used cellphone data to track targets around the globe but experts say these new systems allow less technically advanced governments to track people in any nation including the united states with relative ease and precision users of such technology type a phone number into a computer portal which then collects information from the location databases maintained by cellar carriers company documents show in this way the surveillance system learns which cell tower a target is current using revealing his or her location to within a few blocks in an turban area or a few miles in a rural one it is unclean which governments have acquired these tracking systems but one industry official speaking on the condition of anonymity to share sensitive trade information said that dozens of countries have bought or pleased such technology in recent years this rapid spread underscores how the burgeoning multibillion dollar surveillance industry makes advanced spying technology available worldwide any tin pot dictator with enough money to buy the system could spy on people anywhere in the world said erie king deputy director of privacy international a london based activist group that warns about the abuse of surveillance technology this is a huge problem security experts say hackers sophisticated criminal gangs and nations under sanctions also could use this tracking technology which operates in a legal gray area it is illegal in many countries to track people without their consent or a court order but there is no clear international legal standard for secretly tracking people in other countries nor is there a globe entity with the authority to police potential abuses in response to questions from the washington post this month the federal communications commission said it would investigate possible misuse of tracking technology that collects location data from carrier databases the united states restricts the export of some surveillance technology but with multiply suppliers based oversea there are few practical limits on the sale or use of these systems internationally if this is technically possible why couldn t anybody do this anywhere said jon peha a former white house scientific adviser and chief technologist for the fcc who is now an engineering professor at carnegie mellon university he was one of several telecommunications experts who reviewed the marketing documents at the post s request i m worried about foreign governments and i m even more worried about non governments peha said which is not to say i d be happy about the nsa using this method to collect location data but better them than the iranians locate track manipulate location tracking is an increasingly common part of modern life apps that help you navigate through a city or find the nearest coffee shop need to know your location many people keep tabs on their teenage children or their spouses through tracking apps on smartphones but these forms of tracking require consent mobile devices typical allow these location features to be blocked if users desire tracking systems built for intelligence services or police however are inherent stealthy and difficult if not impossible to block private surveillance vendors offer government agencies several such technologies including systems that collect cellar signals from nearly phones and others that use malicious software to trick phones into revealing their locations governments also have long had the ability to compel carriers to provide tracking data on their customers especially within their own countries the national security agency meanwhile taps into telecommunication system cables to collect cellphone location data on a mass globe scale but tracking systems that access carrier location databases are unusual in their ability to allow virtual any government to track people across borders with any type of cellar phone across a wide range of carriers without the carriers even knowing these systems also can be used in tandem with other technologies that when the general location of a person is already known can intercept calls and internet traffic activate microphones and access contact lists photos and other documents companies that make and sell surveillance technology seek to limit public information about their systems capabilities and client lists typical marketing their technology directly to law enforcement and intelligence services through international conferences that are closed to journalists and other members of the public yet marketing documents obtained by the washington post show that companies are offering powerful systems that are designed to evade detection while plotting movements of surveillance targets on computerized maps the documents claim system success rates of more than percent a page marketing brochure for skylock a cellar tracking system sold by verint a maker of analytics systems based in

intelligence and fraud risk and compliance with clients in more than organizations in over countries privacy international has collected several marketing brochures on cellar surveillance systems including one that refers briefly to skylock and posted them on its web site the page skylock brochure and other material was independently provided to the post by people concerned that such systems are being abused verint which also has substantial operations in israel declined to comment for this story it says in the marketing brochure that it does not use skylock against u s or israel phones which could violate national laws but several similar systems marked in recent years by companies based in switzerland ukraine and elsewhere likely are free of such limitations at the post s request telecommunications security researcher tobias engel used the techniques described by the marketing documents to determine the location of a post employee who used an at t phone and consented to the tracking based only on her phone number engel found the post employee s location in downtown washington to within a city block a typical level of precision when such systems are used in turban areas you re obviously traceable from all over the planet if you have a cellphone with you as long as it s turned on said engel who is based in berlin it s possible for almost anyone to track you as long as they are willing to spend some money on it at t declined to comment for this story exploiting the ss networkthe tracking technology takes advantage of the lax security of ss a globe network that cellar carriers use to communicate with one another when directing calls texts and internet data the system was built decades ago when only a few large carriers controlled the bulk of globe phone traffic now thousands of companies use is to provide services to billions of phones and other mobile devices security experts say all of these companies have access to the network and can send queries to other companies on the ss system making the entire network more vulnerable to exploitation any one of these companies could share its access with others including makers of surveillance systems the tracking systems use queries sent over the ss network to ask carriers what cell tower a customer has used most recently carriers configure their systems to transmit such information only to trusted companies that need it to direct calls or other telecommunications services to customers but the protections against intended access are weak and easily defeated said engel and other researchers by repeatedly collecting this location data the tracking systems can show whether a person is walking down a city street or driving down a highway or whether the person has recently taken a flight to a new city or country we don t have a monopoly on the use of this and probably can be sure that other governments are doing this to us in reverse said lawyer albert gidari jr a partner at perkins coie who specializes in privacy and technology carriers can attempt to block these is queries but rarely do so successfully experts say amid the massive data exchanges coursing through globe telecommunications networks p security a research firm in paris has been testing one query commonly used for surveillance called an any time interrogation query that prompts a carrier to report the location of an individual customer of the carriers tested so far percent responded to any time interrogation queries by providing location data on their customers testing on u s carriers has not been

manufacturers said it was not aware of the existence of tracking systems that use is queries but it acknowledged serious security issues with the network which is slated to be gradually replaced over the next decade because of a growing list of security and technical shortcomings ss is inherent secure and it was never designed to be secure said james moral security director for the gsma it is possible with access to ss to trigger a request for a record from a network the documents for verint and several other companies say that the surveillance services are intended for governments and that customers must abide by laws regarding their use yet privacy advocates and other critics say the surveillance industry is inherent secrecie poorly regulated and indiscriminate in selecting its customers sometimes putting profoundly intrusion tools into the hands of governments with little respect for human rights or tolerance of political dissent refining the techniquesengel the german telecommunications security researcher was the first to publicly disclose the ability to use carrier networks to surreptitiously gather user location information at a conference sponsored by the chaos computer club a hacker activist group based in germany the techniques engel used that day were far cruder than the ones used by today s cellar tracking systems but still caused a stir in the security community from the lectern he asked for help from a volunteer from the audience a man in an unsucked plaid shirt ambled up with his cellphone in one hand and a beer in the other engel typed the number into his computer and even though it was for a british phone a screen at the front of the room soon displayed the current location in berlin two years later a pair of american telecommunications researchers expanded on engel s discovery with a program they called the carmen sandiego project named after a popular educational video game and television series that taught geography by having users answer questions researchers don bailey and nick depetrillo found that the rough locations provided by angel s technique could be mixed with other publicly available data to better map the locations of users they even accessed the video feeds of highway cameras along interstate in denver to gain a clearer picture of target cellphone users we could tell that they were going a certain speed on i bailey recalled not only could you track a person you could remotely identify a car and who was driving an official for at t patrick mccanna was in the audience when depetrillo and bailey presented their findings at a conference in mccanna praised the researchers for their work they later said and recruited their help to make it harder to gather location data many of the world s largest cellar networks made similar efforts though significant loopholes remained as some carriers tightened their defenses surveillance industry researchers developed even more effective ways to collect data from ss networks the advanced systems now being marked offer more precise location information on targets and are harder for carriers to detect or defeat telecommunications experts say networks have become so complex that implementing new security measures to defend against these surveillance systems could cost billions of dollars and hurt the functioning of basin services such as routing calls texts and internet to customers these systems are massive and they re running close to capacity all the time and to make changes to how they interact with hundreds or thousands of phones is really risk said part stidham a longtime telecommunications system architect based in virginia you don t know what happens paired up with catchers companies that market ss tracking systems recommend using them in tandem with imri catchers increasingly common surveillance devices that use cellar signals collected directly from the air to intercept calls and internet traffic send fake texts install spyware on a phone and determine precise locations imsi catchers also known by one popular trade name stingray can home in on somebody a mile or two away but are useless if a target s general location is not known is tracking systems solve that problem by locating the general area of a target so that imri catchers can be deplored reflectively the term imsi refers to a unique identifying code on a cellar phone the fcc recently created an internal task force to study misuse of imsi catchers by criminal gangs and foreign intelligence agencies which reported have used the systems to spy on american citizens businesses and diplomats it is legal for law enforcement agencies in the united states to use imri catchers for authorized purposes when asked by the post about systems that use is tracking fac spokeswoman kim hart said this type of system could fall into the category of technologies that we expect the fac s internal task force to examine the marketing brochure for verint s skylock system suggests using it in conjunction with verint s imsi catcher called the engage gi together they allow government agencies to accurately pinpoint their suspect for apprehension making it virtual impossible for targets to escape no matter where they reside in the world verint can install skylock on the networks of cellar carriers if they are comparative something that telecommunications experts say is common in countries where carriers have close relationships with their national governments verint also has its own worldwide ss hubs that are spread in various locations around the world says the brochure it does not list prices for the services though it says that verint charges more for the ability to track targets in many far flung countries as opposed to only a few nearly ones among the most appealing features of the system the brochure says is its ability to sidestep the cellar operators that sometimes protect their users personal information by refusing government requests or insisting on formal court orders before releasing information in most cases mobile operators are not willing to cooperate with operation agencies in order to provide them the ability to gain control and manipulate the network services given to its subscribers the brochure says verint s skylock is a globe geo location solution which was designed and developed to address the limitations mentioned above and meet operation agency requirements another company defentek markets a similar system called infiltrator globe real time tracking system on its web site claiming to locate and track any phone number in the world the site adds it is a strategic solution that infiltrates and is undetected and unknown by the network carrier or the target the company

up on silk road some years ago now ive been preaching the word according to phil zimmermann anyone who has read my posts knows my security philosophy better to have it and not need it than need it and not have it one of the rebuttals or retorts most often thrown at me over the years is that the police arent interested in small buyers or the police are only after the dealers not the users i remember hearing shit like this from the mouth of rxking as part of his anti pgp campaign the two most common arguments raised over the years were that dpr should have made the use of pip mandatory for doing business on silk road he was told again and again and again that should the server ever be locked that this would be the only protection the users would have he didnt listen and when the server was seized the feds got their mitts on the data for an enormous number of people this was our worst nightmare come true it was also stated by many people that everyone needed to use pgp for the reason s listed above one of the most common arguments i heard in response was that it really want necessary as the police wouldnt go after small buyers well now the other shoe has dropped the german police are going after small buyers and anyone who failed to use pgp to protect themselves may find themselves in a similar situation as the subject of this article i hate to say i told you so but i fucking told you so zaphodgerman cops bust dude who bought weed on silk road years agowritten by joseph coxcontributormay am est seen plenty of high profile and often technical busts on dark web sites targeting dealers users and administrators in a recent case german cops tracked down a marketplace user who placed orders for just a few grams of cannabis at a time three years ago a german user of the original silk road and another dark web market was recently find over for ordering cannabis times according to independent researcher were branwen branwen said in a reddit post that the buyer contacted him recently he also uploaded an apparent march letter from german law authorities detailing the transactions names and other information have been reached from the letter so motherboard was unable to contact its supposed recipient according to the letter the customers purchases varied from and ram quantities of cannabis between january and october plenty of dark web customers have been punished before law enforcement often track down buyers of poisons or weapons and have also gone after buyers of harder drugs such as mdma or methamphetamine there have been a handful of marijuana cases what makes this case stand out further is that police were still keen on tracking the buyer down years later silk road was shut down way back in september it appears the customer who told branwen he always encrypted his address when providing it to vendors was identified after german authorities busted a cannabis seller who had kept records of all of their customers from there brandon thinks the police may have gone through records of the silk road server to find more of the customer s purchases since he consistently used one username its not clear how the authorities would have discovered one of the customers orders from outlaw market which is still running the letter adds that communications from silk road were used can a buyer in the absence of any intercepted packages or possession of illegal drugs be prosecuted or otherwise get into trouble branwen writes on reddit at least in germany the answer seems to be yes this case goes to show that even people who briefly used dark web markets may have to worry about law enforcement eventually tracking them down topics dark web weed cannabis drugs silk road were branwen were cybercrime germany . quote from zaphod on april

accessed the video feeds of highway cameras along interstate in denver to gain a clearer picture of target cellphone users we could tell that they were going a certain speed on i bailey recalled not only could you track a person you could remotely identify a car and who was driving an official for at t patrick mccanna was in the audience when depetrillo and bailey presented their findings at a conference in mccanna praised the researchers for their work they later said and recruited their help to make it harder to gather location data many of the world s largest cellar networks made similar efforts though significant loopholes remained as some carriers tightened their defenses surveillance industry researchers developed even more effective ways to collect data from ss networks the advanced systems now being marked offer more precise location information on targets and are harder for carriers to detect or defeat telecommunications experts say networks have become so complex that implementing new security measures to defend against these surveillance systems could cost billions of dollars and hurt the functioning of basin services such as routing calls texts and internet to customers these systems are massive and they re running close to capacity all the time and to make changes to how they interact with hundreds or thousands of phones is really risk said part stidham a longtime telecommunications system architect based in virginia you don t know what happens paired up with catchers companies that market ss tracking systems recommend using them in tandem with imri catchers increasingly common surveillance devices that use cellar signals collected directly from the air to intercept calls and internet traffic send fake texts install spyware on a phone and determine precise locations imsi catchers also known by one popular trade name stingray can home in on somebody a mile or two away but are useless if a target s general location is not known is tracking systems solve that problem by locating the general area of a target so that imri catchers can be deplored reflectively the term imsi refers to a unique identifying code on a cellar phone the fcc recently created an internal task force to study misuse of imsi catchers by criminal gangs and foreign intelligence agencies which reported have used the systems to spy on american citizens businesses and diplomats it is legal for law enforcement agencies in the united states to use imri catchers for authorized purposes when asked by the post about systems that use is tracking fac spokeswoman kim hart said this type of system could fall into the category of technologies that we expect the fac s internal task force to examine the marketing brochure for verint s skylock system suggests using it in conjunction with verint s imsi catcher called the engage gi together they allow government agencies to accurately pinpoint their suspect for apprehension making it virtual impossible for targets to escape no matter where they reside in the world verint can install skylock on the networks of cellar carriers if they are comparative something that telecommunications experts say is common in countries where carriers have close relationships with their national governments verint also has its own worldwide ss hubs that are spread in various locations around the world says the brochure it does not list prices for the services though it says that verint charges more for the ability to track targets in many far flung countries as opposed to only a few nearly ones among the most appealing features of the system the brochure says is its ability to sidestep the cellar operators that sometimes protect their users personal information by refusing government requests or insisting on formal court orders before releasing information in most cases mobile operators are not willing to cooperate with operation agencies in order to provide them the ability to gain control and manipulate the network services given to its subscribers the brochure says verint s skylock is a globe geo location solution which was designed and developed to address the limitations mentioned above and meet operation agency requirements another company defentek markets a similar system called infiltrator globe real time tracking system on its web site claiming to locate and track any phone number in the world the site adds it is a strategic solution that infiltrates and is undetected and unknown by the network carrier or the target the company which according

newstechnology sciencecbc investigatesblackberry hands over user data to help police kick ass insider sayscbc gets seek into how secrecie office answers requests from police around the worldby dave seglins matthew brag jeremy mcdonald cbc news posted jun am et last dated jun am et vireo blackberry forks over user data to police insider specialized unit inside mobile firm blackberry has for years enthusiastically helped intercept user data including bbm messages to help in hundreds of police investigations in dozens of countries a cbc news investigation reveals cbc news has gained a rare glimpse inside the struggling smartphone makers public safety operations team which at one point numbered people and has long kept its handling of warrants and police requests for taps on user information confidential a number of insiders none of whom were authorized to speak say that behind the scenes the company has been actively assisting police in a wide range of high profile investigationsbut unlike many other technology companies which regularly publish transparency reports it is not clear how many requests blackberry receives each year nor the number of requests it has fulfilled insiders say for example that blackberry intercepted messages to aid investigators probing the political scandals in brazil that are dogging suspended president dilma rousseff the company also helped authenticate bbm messages in major league baseballs drug investigation that saw new york yankees star ale rodriguez suspended in one document obtained by cic news reveals how the waterloo ont based company handles requests for information and co operates with foreign law enforcement and government agencies in stark contrast with many other teach companies we were helping law enforcement kick ass said one of a number of sources who told cbc news that the company is swamped by requests that come directly from police in dozens of countries photo of blackberry ceo john chen blackberry ceo john chen speaks at the company annual meeting in waterloo ont on june when it comes to doing the right thing in difficult situations blackberrys guiding principle has been to do what is right for the citizenry within legal and ethical boundaries chen said in a blog post frank gunn canadian press narco trafficking human trafficking money laundering kidnapping crime against children knowing you are stopping those things how do you not love doing something like that said the insider although blackberry still counts businesses and governments around the globe among its customers the company has acknowledged that its smartphone marketshare has declined significantly in the face of competition from apple and adroit phones in response to questions from cic news a blackberry spokesperson said it will not address the questions given the extremely sensitive nature of this process the company also provided a statement that said blackberrys guiding principle has been to do what is right within legal and ethical boundaries when called upon to provide aid in the apprehension of criminals or preventing government abuse of invading citizens privacy we have long been clear in our stance that tech companies as good incorporate citizens should comply with reasonable lawful access requests blackberry has recently defended its co operation with law enforcement amid high profile cases such as the standoff between apple and the fbi over access to an encrusted iphone and heightened concerns about privacy and government surveillance in the wake of revelations from u s whistleblower edward snowden the snowdon stuff i have a problem with that mass surveillance is an issue another source said but when you have a company following the law with checks and procedures in place i feel good about that the source said defending blackberrys approach the public safety operations team at blackberrys headquarters has streamlined a process to deal with what insiders characterize as a flood of requests from police lawyers review warrants and judicial authorizations before giving data analysts a green light to intercept and decrypt messages the company has developed an international cover letter icl for police and government agencies to submit alongside a warrant cbc news obtained a version of the cover letter one used by italian authorities it includes checkboxes for emergency exigent routine requests to help blackberry prioritize life threatening situations over routine investigations categories of informationit offers a menu of three categories of information blackberry can provide device account and subscriber data including pin imei sim blackberry id name address payment and purchase information message transaction logs times and dates of bbm and pin message exchanges current bbm contact list other multiply law enforcement and company sources tell cbc that the other section is where police detail requests to intercept and descramble user communications including the consumer versions of its once popular bbm and pin to pin messaging services the cover letter demands police sign a confirmation that their request is legal in their home country and affirm that it is made in connection with the enforcement investigation or prosecution of violations of publicly promulgated criminal laws and not the control suppression or punishment of peaceful expression of political or religious opinion insiders say blackberry will only consider requests if they include a valid legal order from the foreign jurisdiction potential for abusechristopher parsons a research associate at the university of torontos citizen lab who has studied the privacy practices of tech companies is worried by the secrecy of blackberrys process and its potential for abuse the concern would be that there is a lawful order from a corrupt judge said parsons who reviewed the icl for cic news there are countries in the world unfortunately where this does happen he said blackberry is allowing foreign police to bypass the mutual legal assistance treaty a diplomatic agreement that allows canadian officials to review requests from foreign police and consider whether they are legal under canadian law sidestepping the process this is direct this is a sidestepping of that entire process this is blackberry being the one that makes that decision as opposed to the canadian government parsons said he acknowledged that the treaty process can take months so police likely prefer dealing directly with blackberry u s law prohibits the likes of apple facebook and google from intercepting communications on behalf of foreign agencies which parsons says contrasts to blackberrys practice company insiders meanwhile say advances in encryption are making interception of mobile communications increasingly difficult for police yet they also say they are surprised criminals have been slow to pick up on blackberrys co operation with police to access messages they are making the mistake thinking its untouchable and nobody can see it not aware there is a group in canada that can access it decrypt it and send it to law enforcement said a source who also says the team has a sense of mission helping law enforcement if you have the ability to help put bad people that have committed crimes behind bars why not help someone do that whats your counter argument to putting bad guys away please send tips to dave seglins cbc ca or matthew braga cbc ca or anonymously via cbc securedrop . what i find absolutely disgusting about the entire affair is that while blackberry insists it is following the law it blithely ignores the legal mechanisms of the mutual law enforcement assistance treaties mlats these are the duly designated mechanisms setup by the canadian and foreign governments to handle such matters look at how company insiders spoke of enthusiastically helping the authorities to kick the bad guys asses blackberry is not in law enforcement and these people had or have no goddamn business doing what theyre doing i had previously thought hushmail were the literal bottom of the barrel but hushmail was only obeying a court order issued pursuit to mlat they had no choice in the matter it would appear that blackberry has gone even further than hushmail did and i never thought i would see this zaphod . if le dont obey laws why should any one else . quote from hisdudeness on may amif le dont obey laws why should any one else they follow the leona helmsley school the law only applies to the little people n b if you miss the reference leona helmley was a rich bitch who famously was quoted as saying we done pay taxes only the little people pay taxes . as many of you may be aware i grew up during the cold war when the soviets and their allies in the warsaw pact were made out to be the devil incarnate we in the west were free we were told we werent like them we didnt have cameras in the streets recording the comings and goings of the populace we didnt tap peoples telephones listening in to their conversations we in the west didnt live in police states unlike those poor unfortunates in the u s s r and its warsaw pact allies fast forward years and my oh my how the times have changed cameras are now everywhere you have to assume that everything you say and do when you are out of doors whether walking down the street or on public transit is now recorded for posterity im glad that im old and that we didnt have any children reading about the activities of the fbi below reminds me of nothing less than the activities of the east german stasi or the romanza securitate their respective secret police i still find it hard to comprehend how we have turned into that which we fought against for so many decades zaphodhidden microphones exposed as part of government surveillance program in the bay areamay pm by jackie wardfiled under bay area government surveillance program microphones cbs of hidden microphones that are part of a clandestine government surveillance program that has been operating around the bay area has been exposed imagine standing at a bus stop talking to your friend and having your conversation recorded without you knowing it happens all the time and the abi doesn t even need a warrant to do it federal agents are planting microphones to secretly record conversations jeff harp a six security analyst and former fbi special agent said they put microphones under rocks they put microphones in trees they plant microphones in equipment i mean there s microphones that are planted in places that people don t think about because that s the intent fbi agents hid microphones inside light fixtures and at a bus stop outside the oakland courthouse without a warrant to record conversations between march and january federal authorities are trying to prove real estate investors in san mateo and alameda counties are guilty of bid rigging and fraud and used these recordings as evidence harp said an agent can t just go out and grab a recording device and plant it somewhere without authorization from a supervisor or special agent in charge the lawyer for one of the accused real estate investors who will ask the judge to throw out the recordings told six news that speaking in a public place does not mean that the individual has no reasonable expectation of privacy private communication in a public place qualifies as a protected oral communication and therefore may not be intercepted without judicial authorization harp says that if you re going to conduct criminal activity do it in the privacy of your own home he says that was the original intention of the fourth amendment but it s up to the judge to interpret it jackal ward is a two time emmy
