want to get on agora but i need an invite anyone wan na pm me one they all seem pretty smooth but it probably has to do with the lesser amount of traffic they have io after the public news of sr getting busted everyone and their grandma learned about it and when sr launched people who had no business on the darkweb figured out how to access it which obviously has been a bad thing thank you for the directions to the hub alfred . i am so glad to find this place the sr forums are very draining and the market is so wish washy with all the fe demands and scammers i do truly believe the sr admins are working very hard on cleaning the place up but their time is better spent working on the site instead of posting in the forums becuase even when they do it calms people down for what minutes then when everyone doesnt get a response to their questions they think defcon and staff have gone awl i will be spreading my business out over the other markets i have recently started

for a week or so and i think its a great idea they arent doing anyone a favor by keeping it going and letting these issues compound and have new issues come up only adding to the daunting laundry list of bs that needs to be sorted hell even two weeks in be cool with its not like we dont have other markets to use during that time i think the only problem with that is they would lose a week or two of revenue plus they would have to give everyone a timeframe to finish business and clear escrow otherwise lots of people would get piss . i am trying to get endor status on pandora will report back on
