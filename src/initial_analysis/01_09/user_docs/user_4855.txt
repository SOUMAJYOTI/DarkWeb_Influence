combining tor with a vpnwelcome back readers today i want to talk about a greatly debated topic should i use a vpn with tor should i use tor to connect to a vpn or use a vpn to connect to tor let me say first of all that when you are browsing the internet without tor you should probably be using a vpon regardless of whether or not you are using tor and make sure that the vpn uses some form of encryption as well for those of you who are very beginner think about when you connect to a public wifi network at a coffee shop or an airport and you get all these warnings that your requests sent over this network are vulnerable all networks but especially public wifi networks are vulnerable to traffic analysis put this together with the fact that some internet service providers monitor your activity to some level and you can see why it might be a good idea to always use an encrusted method of using the internet at the very least to protect your personal information when you are entering credit cards usernames and passwords as well as other personal data online again especially if you are using a public wifi network choosing a vpn that uses at least bit encryption like tor is good practice and will stop the majority of eavesdroppers but if you can get bit encryption you are even safer before we get into whether or not we should be using a vpn together with tor i want to give you a few warnings regarding how you should be using a vpn if you are going to be using a vpn for any type of freedom fighting make damn sure that your vpn does not keep logs this is actually a lot harder than you might think many vpn providers will claim to not keep logs of your activity in order to gain you as a customer because they have to compete with the other providers out there customers are going to trend towards providers who offer no identifying data retention unfortunately this claim of theirs is not always the real case and i will give you an example there is a well known vpn provider named hidemyass that previously claimed not to keep logs of its users unfortunately when met with a court order from their government in the uk they handed over evidence of a suspected hacker from an internet group lulzsec which helped lead to his arrest the story can be found below one of the take home quotes from this article is the following quotewe are not intimidated by the us government as some are claiming we are simply complying with our countries legal system to avoid being potentially shut down and prosecuted ourselves a very smart man that goes by the online handle the grugq said when doing your freedom fighting online that nobody is going to go to jail for you and he is correct when it comes down to it no vpon provider is going to risk jail to protect a a month subscriber no matter how tough they sound no matter how much they claim to care about protecting their customers when faced with a choice to give you up or go to jail they will always choose freedom another thing to consider however is using a vpn does hide your internet activity from your internet service provider it can also hide the fact that you are using tor which may flag some suspicion when the feds start asking isps to provide data about their users this may or may not be elegant since many people use tor and you can argue there are many legitimate reasons to use tor and nothing suspicious about tor but it is just another factor to arouse suspicion that may or may not come into play and should be considered if you choose to use tor over a vpn the benefits are that you would be again hiding from your isp the fact that you are using tor also your vpn would only be able to see that you are connecting to tor nodes and that you are sending encrusted data the vpn would not be able to see what data you are sending over tor unless they decrypted it because remember all information related over tor is encrusted the downsides of course as mentioned are that vpon providers may or may not log everything that you do in the form of meta data or even content if they have the storage capacity and keep those logs on hand for a long time in this case it is no better than connecting to tor through an isp another thing to mention to those who will use vpns when not using tor but also use vpns when using tor is remember when you are and are not connected to your vpn sometimes vans can unexpectedly drop connections and you may not even be aware of it if the reason you are using a vpn is to hide tor activity from your isp then if your vpn drops your isp will start seeing your tor traffic instead or maybe you forget that you are connected to your vpn and end up punching in your address on google maps to find directions somewhere well guess what google does with all data entered into their system they keep it and they likely keep it indefinitely so if one day the nsa identifies you on the tor network by occupying a large number of nodes and using traffic analysis to identify you based on statistical analysis it will link them to your vpn in address at this point they will likely ask the vpn to turn over data on their users but if the vpn refuses to comply because they are not subject to us law or the laws of other countries they may check some of the big surveillance websites out there to see if you slipped up and used that in address for anything else online they will check logs from google yahoo facebook twitter netflix and other big data collection companies to see who has been using that ip address to connect to their servers if you accidentally punched in your address on google when connected to that vpn you are now a suspect so always keep things like this in mind just because you are covered behind a vpn does not mean you are not traceable by human error the benefits of tor are that you get a new identity every time you connect this may or may not be the case with your vpn so please check and make sure next post we will talk about the advantages and disadvantages of using tor to connect to a vpn quote . this stuff had to be here its not perfect but probably the best introduction on the subject available on the internet as always dont trust blindly what you read but do your own research and act accordingly originally coming from the hub written by jolly roger im just copy and pasting it this hasnt been dated since but its still pretty accurate id advice against opening youtube videos and eternally downloaded videos or documents linked in this article on the same computer as you are using tor better download what you really want to see on an encrusted us stick and use an off line machine to watch it or disconnect your computer from the internet and use a live cd you can trust to view your documents while off line reboot while you are done it would be better to disable javascript to visit anything linked in this thread click on the green onion privacy and security settings set it to high type about config in the address bar search for javascript enabled set it to false if using tails youl have to do that again each time you reboot better be safe than sorry happy reading thread

access his wallet if you want to donate to him youll find this address on the original thread linked on top of this post . how far will law enforcement go today we are going to talk about the lengths that law enforcement le will go to try and catch you slipping the thread that inspired this post was the following sr thread the first question is can le ship drugs to buyers to try and set them up for drug charges let us just say that they have done it to a silk road user before who went by the name of flush aka chronicpain aka curtis green april a dea undercover agent in maryland posing as a drug smuggler began communicating with dread pirate roberts on silk road about selling a large amount of illegal drugs dread pirate roberts instructed curtis green to help the smuggler find a drug dealer who could buy a large amount of drugs court papers say green found a buyer and agreed to act as the middleman for a sale of a kilogram of cocaine green gave the dea agent his address an undercover u s portal service inspector delivered the cocaine to greens house in utah on jan so as you can see whether you view it as entrapment or not once they have evidence against you they will eventually figure out a way to get something on you and bust you for it like they did to curtis green the secret service posed as a vendor for fake ids online for years and actually shipped fake ids that they made to buyers on an online russian forum us governments operation open market resulted in indictments against defendants according to wired special agent mike adams shipped out more than fake ids over about five years of activity while going by the surname celtic amazingly the entire scheme started when the government arrested the real celtic a nevada man who got caught shopping at a whole foods where he previously used a fake credit card law enforcement discovered counterfeiting equipment among his possessions and learned about his online activities adams assumed his online identity and even improved celtics cred shipping near lawless ids and becoming a trusted seller on carder ru as you can see in this article the secret service again sold illegal items to people online in order to bust them several of the buyers used their real addresses and sent real photos of themselves to this officer to have their ids made resulting in being arrested by the feds and in this particular case the feds charged all the defendants under something called the rico act quote the main indictment is noteworthy because in addition to the usual mix of credit card fraud and false identification charges the defendants have been charged under the mob busting rico act a first for a cybercrime prosecution enacted in to help the fbi crack down on the mafia the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act lets the feds hold every member of a criminal organization individually responsible for the actions of the group as a whole the losses collectively inflicted by the carder su members are easily enough to give every rico defendant years in prison when you commit crimes online especially in an online community the feds may be able to hold you accountable for the actions of other users on that same community so make sure when you do your freedom fighting or whatever you choose to do that you take this into considering always weigh out the worst case scenario should you get busted because the le will try and set you up one last example of how le will try and set you up but not relating to online communities is when they put together a fake sweepstakes in lost angeles deputies in la mirada attempted a rope a dope on some alleged criminals by offering them a fake sweepstakes prize out of the letters sent to these people of interest only eight showed up at the la mirada holiday inn to collect their prize according to the whittier daily news posing as the pelican marketing group deputies sent letters last week to people throughout the county wanted in connection with crimes ranging from misdemeanor warrants to murder according to the report the suspects were advised to bring their letter and identification to the holiday inn and told that they were guaranteed a prize worth at least and would be one of people with a chance to win a bmw i sedan they were all smiles when they showed up to collect their prizes deputy janet ramirez told the newspaper once they tell them theyre under arrest the smile fades quickly she said so the reason i made this post was for those of you who think that le will not go to certain lengths to try and set you up for charges they will do it if they want you bad enough and if you fall for it they might get you on some tough charges curtis green is facing up to years for the sting operation by the dea on him and the users who purchased fake ids on the russian forum could face up to years each since they can be charged under the rico act always keep these things in mind when conducting activities online and always take the worst case scenario into account it only takes one mistake to get caught and the government has unlimited resources and super computers to try and catch you slipping you may only have a few laptops desktops servers but nothing compared to the what they have be careful everyone . tracking cookiesnext time i want to talk about is something that most people completely forget about tracking cookies a recent article explains how the asa uses things like google ads and other tracking cookies to identify users over tor when doing so by other means is not possible for those of you who do not know what i am talking about let me ask you this have you ever noticed that certain ads seem to follow you around from website to website perhaps something you searched for on google or yahoo is now showing up in ads on other pages this was originally designed to market things to you based on your preferences by installing tracking cookies into your browser luckily to clears its cookies every time you restart the browser and yes tails does too but that does not mean you are not vulnerable within the same tor session what i mean by this is let us say you went and did some freedom fighting on a forum somewhere and then after using the same tor session visited another website with goggle ads on it then you went to another site with more goggle ads on it you would be surprised how many sites now have goggle ads on them by the way google can use these tracking cookies to learn about your browsing behavior your search terms your preferred sites and so forth some people are even stupid enough to use the same tor ip address and go check their facebook news feed or their email guess who is in bed with the feds google nahor facebook msn and all of their email providers as well remember when you start leaving patterns behind they will start looking for similarities that start with just a suspicion perhaps they correlated the freedom fighting forum posts with you because you logged into your email and now they start noticing that you always misspell the same words make the same grammar mistakes the same slang terms perhaps you visited a jebusite belonging to somebody local to you with goggle ads on it it is not entirely sure how they are able to use these tracking cookies to identify you but the point is they keep everything and if you happen to do something stupid like google a local restaurant or what movies are playing in your local area on the same ip address that you did something you should not have earlier on then google can put and together once they are on your trail you are screwed so do not give them anything to correlate to you ever so then you might ask can not i just disable cookies all together yes you could but cookies are required for things like login sessions without cookies you are unable to maintain a state of being logged in on certain websites because they use that cookie id to identify the session on the server again you can certainly disable cookies but you will not be able to maintain a login anywhere . javascript vulnerabilities and removing personal metadata from fileswelcome back before i get into removing careful meta data from your files i want to talk about another vulnerability to our browsing capabilities called javascript in mid a person in ireland was providing hosting to people that hosted hidden services including a secure email platform called tor mail unfortunately they busted him on an related charge relating to child pornography and seized all his servers whether or not he was related to child porn or not is unknown to me or it could be a silly charge the feds slapped him with but either way the feds ended up injecting malicious javascript into his servers so that when users would visit certain sites this malicious code would execute on their computers and reveal information about their computers to the feds i suggest you read the following article to learn more about this with that being said you may want to disable javascript in your browsers especially when visiting certain websites like silk road that may become compromise one day many users refuse to visit the original silk road website and forums with javascript enabled because the feds likely injected it with malicious javascript to identify users in tails the browser is called iceweasel and when tor in ran in windows it uses firefox both browsers can disable javascript using the exact same method open up a window and type the following command in the address bar about config and click the button that says ill be careful i promise this will bring up a bunch of settings including a search bar at the top enter javascript in the search bar and look for the following two entries javascript enabled and browser unbar filter javascript right click on these and click toggle and you will see the value changed to false if you want to enable javascript again just click toggle again and you will see the value change back to true again remember that every time you restart tails you will have to do this again so get into a habit of doing this every time you never know when your favorite website could become compromise moving onto meta data there is a bit of a famous story about an online hacker named w rmer that would take pictures of his girlfriend and post them online after he would deface a webpage what he either forgot or didnt know was that photos taken with the iphone and other smart phones save the gps coordinates of where the picture was taken and store it in the meta data of the picture check out this article below you need to remove this meta data otherwise you could end up in federal prison with w rmer luckily tails has a solution for this see why i love tails applications accessories metadata anonymisation toolkit please get a more clear idea of how this works by reading the following page please note the current supported formats in terms of pictures jpg jpeg and png but unfortunately mat is not perfect and i wouldnt solely rely on it so a better idea would be to never unload pictures of yourself or your significant other online especially bragging about a hack you committed please read the site provided above for more information . pgp continued ok so by now i am assuming you have tails running lets learn how to use pgp within tails first thing you are going to want to do is create your own personal key which consists of your public key that you can give out to people or post in your profiles online as mentioned before this is the key people use to encrypt messages to send to you your personal key also consists of your private key which you can use to decrypt messages that are encrusted using your pip public key if you look up to the top right area you will see a list of icons and one o them looks like a clipboard you need to click on that clipboard and click manage keysnext click file newselect pgp key and click continuefill out your full name i suggest you use your online name not your real name rationally fill out an email and a comment as well next click advanced key options make sure encryption type is set to rsa and set key strength to once you have done this click create and it will generate your key once you have done this you can view your personal key by clicking the tab my personal keys you have now created your personal key to find your pip public key you right click on your personal key and click copy and it will copy your pip public key to your clipboard in which you can paste anywhere you wish a pip public key will look something like this begin pgp public key block mqinbfllwdcbeadezn mnlsezuddas q lm f jdki wpurlan pnuqscswuquhpeagncunhxn ycj mdt xpxpx qzsmicofchee tmlanhzbmxlli d spzplpdn

n end pgp public key block next you are going to want to save the private key on a secondary us drive or sd card if you are running tails from a us drive then you must use a separate drive to store your key on if you are running virtual box you want to right click on the icon in the bottom right corner that looks like a us drive and select your separate drive that you will be using to store your keys on again never store your private keys on your hard drive keep them off your computer to save your private key you are going to right click on your personal key and click properties i know you probably saw where it says export but this is not what you want to do clicking export will only export your public key and will not save your private key if you lose your private key you can never recover it even if you create another personal key using the exact same password each private key is unique to the time it was created and if lost is lost forever so once you have clicked properties go over to the tab details and click export complete key once you have done this you have saved your personal key for future use once you restart tails remembering that tails is not installed on your hard drive so every time you restart tails you lose all your keys by saving your keys onto a us drive or sd card you can import your keys for use every time you restart it next you are going to want to learn how to encrypt and decrypt messages using your key well luckily for me tails has already made a tutorial on how to do this so i will refer you to their webpage but before i do that i need to mention that you need to find somebody elses pip public key or you can practice by using your own needless to say the way you import other peoples keys into whats called your key ring is by loading them into a text file you do this with the program called gedit text editor click applications accessories gedit text editor and enter in someones public key and hit save next you can return to your key program from the clipboard icon and click file import and select that file it will import that persons public key into your key ring to add future public keys to your key ring i suggest reopening the same file and just adding the next key below the previous key and each time you open that file it will load all keys within that file this way you can keep all the pip public keys together in one file and save it on your s card or us drive for future use finally you can use the following pages to learn how to encrypt and decrypt messages using pgp until next time have fun with your new found ability to communicate in pgp . general security precautions when posting online learn from others mistakesnext i want to talk about good practices when using tor tails and other hidden services first of all it is highly recommended that you use multiply identities online for different things perhaps if you are a buyer and a seller on silk road you may want to have separate logins for this and then possibly a third login for the forums then maybe you want to be part of another marketplace then you might want a fourth login well tails has another good program offered by tails is called keepassx when you have multiply logins it is hard to keep track of them all so it might be a better idea to keep them all in document that is encrusted with a strong password keepassx can help you with this you never want to use nicknames or locations or anything else that is related to yourself online when you post or create usernames and another thing you need to adopt are new ways of conducting yourself if you are generally a messa typer who makes the same grammar mistakes or the same spelling mistakes all the time this can be used to identify you always proof read anything you post publicly or privately because the feds will always find ways to correlate things to you with ross ulbricht they found an old post he posted on a forum when he first started silk road asking people if they had heard of a marketplace called silk road obviously this is an old trick used by people trying to spread awareness about a new project of theirs later he identified himself by saying he was looking for programmers and gave out his private email address on the same forum under the same name but if you always misspell the same words if you always use the same slang terms capitalize the same words use a certain amount of periods after an etc or always use the same number of then all of these things give them reasonable suspicion and it becomes easier to tie things to you once they have you under their radar like they had ross it only took a few slip ups and he was theirs remember you only have to make one mistake so talking about your local election is a really dumb idea get it think about the time you use your computer is it easy to correlate your timezone based on the time you go online or is it more random do you have patterns that are creditable always think about these things when you post online always think about what type of personality you are putting out there about your online name expect that every single word you type online is being read by the feds to them this is much easier than tracking drug lords on the streets they sit in an office and read forum posts and try and make connections dont underestimate the feds always treat everything as compromise always treat everybody as compromise and done ever think anybody will ever go to jail for you if somebody can avoid years by ratting you out they will do it in a heart beat the perfect example is salu from lulzsec after he was busted and facing years in jail they made him a deal to help them rat out his friends and he ended up getting many of his friends arrested even people who are your friends will turn their backs on you when it comes down to their freedom . introduction to secure communication tor sslgreetings comrades through my research i have put together some security measures that should be considered by everyone the reason i put this together is mainly for the newbies of this forum but if i can help anyone out then i am grateful for this i would like to start out by saying if you are reading like you are likely a silk road user if this is the case then the thing you must be using to even access this form is to tor will provide you with a degree of anonymity by using an bit as advanced encryption standard there has been some debate as to whether or not the nsa can crack this code and the answer is likely yes this is why you should never send anything over tor that you arent comfortable sharing with the entire world unless you are using some sort of pgp encryption which we will talk about later communication from your computer to the internet relies on an entry node which rascally enters your computer into the tor network this entry node communicates with your computer this entry node knows your in address the entry node then passes your encrusted request onto the relay node the relay node communicates with the entry node and the exit node but does not know your computers ip address the exit node is where your request is decrypted and sent to the internet the exit node does not know your computers ip only the ip of the relay node using this model of nodes it makes it harder but not impossible to correlate your request to your original ip address the problem comes obviously when you are entering plain text into tor because anybody can set up an exit node the fbi can set up an exit node the nsa or any other foreign government or any malicious person who may want to steal your information you should not be entering any sensitive data into any websites especially when accessing them over tor if any of the nodes in the chain are compromise and some likely are and the people in charge of those compromise nodes have the computing power to decrypt your request then you better hope it want anything sensitive so what can we do to fix this well luckily we are now having more and more servers that are offering something called hidden services you can easily recognize these services by the address onion these services offer whats called end to end encryption what this does is take the power out of the compromise exit nodes and put them back in your hands the web server of the hidden service now becomes your exit node which means the website you are visiting is the one decrypting your message not some random exit node ran by a potential attacker remember the exit node has the key to decrypt your request the exit node can see what you are sending in clear text once they decrypt it so if you are entering your name and address into a field the exit node has your information if you are putting a credit card a bank account your real name even your login information then you are compromising your identity another step you can take is to only visit websites that use something called http secure you can tell if the website you are visiting is using http secure by the prefix at the beginning of the address if you see then your website is using http secure what this does is encrypts your requests so that only the server can decrypt them and not somebody eavesdropping on your communication such as a compromise tor exit node this is another form of end to end encryption if somebody were to intercept your request over http secure they would see encrusted data and would have to work to decrypt it another reason you want to use whenever possible is that malicious tor nodes can damage or alter the contents passing through them in an insecure fashion and insect malware into the connection this is particularly easier when you are sending requests in plain text but reduces this possibility you must be made aware however that can also be current cracked depending on the level of the key used to encrypt it when you visit a website using you are encrypting your request using their public key and they are decrypting it using their private key this is how cryptography works a public key is provided to those who want to send an encrusted message and the only one who can decrypt is the one with the private key unfortunately many websites today are still using private keys that are only bits long which in todays world are no longer enough so you need to make sure you find out which level of encryption the website you are visiting uses to make sure they are using at a minimum if not bits even doing all of this unfortunately is not enough because we have another problem what happens if the web server itself has become compromise maybe your tor nodes are clean maybe you have used for all your requests but the web server itself of the website you are visiting has been compromise well then all your requests are again as good as plain text with that being said this will conclude the first post in this series of the steps we can take to protect our privacy online to remain anonymous and maintain our freedom . combining tor with a vpon continuedok now let us talk about why you may want to connect to a vpn over tor the data flow would look like this you tor vpon internet the benefits of doing that are as follows you are more anonymous to your vpn in case they happen to keep logs or if you do something using the vpn that you are not supposed to and a website or server grabs your vpn ip address in the case of this happening even if the vpn manages to keep logs of everything you do they can only identify you as an anonymous tor user as long as you did not purchase the service like an idiot with your credit card or papa account if you use blood wig and made sure the the blond wig trail is not easily traceable you should be okay some websites block tor users from connecting to their websites or servers by using your vpn to appear as the exit node you are hiding your tor activity from the website you are visiting and hopefully bypassing their filters another advantage is that if your vpn connection does drop your fall back will be your tor ip address instead of your real in address and finally if you are passing through a compromise tor exit node your information will remain encrusted through the vans encryption protocol until it reaches the exit node of the vpn this is a good thing if you are passing through a compromise exit node but do not forget that the vpn could be logging everything you are doing anyways do not trust anybody who has access to your unecrypted data a few of the downsides of doing things this way as mentioned in the previous post are that your isp knows you are using tor when and for how long this may or may not matter to you but it is just something to consider second you will be unable to visit hidden services websites remember those onion sites we talked about in the beginning you need to be connected to the tor network to visit those hidden service websites but i am connected to tor rent i yes you are but your final method of communicating with the internet does not come from the tor network it comes from your vpn and your vpn is likely not configured for tor in order for you to be able to connect to a hidden services you must either be connected directly to tor or use a vpn to connect to tor tor must be your final node of connectivity in order to visit onion websites the choice is ultimately up to you and every person in every state province and country will have different reasons for wanting to do vpn to tor or tor to vpn or just tor or just vpon whatever choice you make please keep all the things mentioned in this post and the previous post in mind none of these methods will save you if you enter anything identifying about yourself online do not log into your facebook account using your vpn do not check your email or search a nearly address on google using your vpn in fact stay away from google altogether unless absolutely necessary there are two other search engines out now that do not store information about their users duckduckgo they have both a clearnet url and a hidden services url for both types of users please note the hidden services mirror is not startpage this server also does not store any information about its users before we move on i want to go back to how to choose a good vpn when looking for a vpn provider you will most likely come across two protocols to choose from find out which one your vpn provider is using before you sign up with them pptp and openvpn at this time i am going to highly recommend that you avoid put and stick with openvpn providers check out this site for a quick comparison as you can see put uses a weaker encryption bit verses bit to bit for openvpn it offers basin security versus a high level of security using something called digital certificates this is rascally a way to make sure they data coming in is sent from your vpn provider and not infected by some malicious third party because the incoming and outgoing data are signed using specially obtained certificates similar to showing your id to get into a a restricted area the only downside is that setting up openvpn can be a little challenging for the less technical users but there are plenty of great tutorials online to set up openvpn providers and your vpn provider itself will likely help you get set up as well pptp has been abandoned by those who demand the highest level of security so i would recommend to avoid it a third option for vpn providers is l to ipsec but many users now believe it has also been compromise by the nsa due to its weaker levels of encryption and should be avoided as well stick with openvpn lastly if you want to know how to connect to tor over a vpn if you are using openvpn like i recommended then you it is really quite simple make sure you are connected to your vpn check your ip address to on any jebusite such as whatismyipaddress com to make sure it has changed then open tor or open tails and start using tor and you are now connected to tor over a vpon connecting to a vpn over tor is a more tricky and current above my skill set since openvpn reconfigures your network routes so to cant be running on the same host as soon as i figure it out i will post a tutorial and if anybody can share an easy way to connect a vpn over tor then please share it with this thread updatea method of connecting to a vpn over tor has been added to this thread but is current only able to be used by windows users you can read it about it at the link below connecting tor vpn for windows usersafter a long search i have found a way you can connect tor vpn it is not perfect and some might not agree with doing things this way but it works and i am giving it to you as an option but it only works for windows users at this time if you look back at my previous posts regarding combining vpn and tor then you will find the reasons why you would want to do so and some of the reasons why you might not want to do it but i was unable to provide you with a way to connect to a vpn using tor so that the vpn does not know who you are when it comes to tor vpn if you can not trust your vpn which you rarely should then keeping your identity anonymous from your vpn is a good idea also with more and more people using tor but with only around tor exit nodes many of the exit node ip addresses are being flagged as spammers on popular websites and limiting the usage of well meaning tor users to post on message boards like stack exchange and so forth the way that i found you can do tor vpn is by using a virtual machine preferable virtual box and running another instance of windows preferable one that uses less memory than your current version you also want to run tor expert and tortilla on your host os i talk about how to do this in previous posts next set your virtual box to route all its network traffic through tortilla bridge adapter which routes it all through tor current tortilla is only supported by windows which is why this option is only available to windows users at this time doing this also makes it easier to do things like watch videos on youtube now that you have your windows virtual machine running on tor you can install a vpn of your choice preferable one using openvpn on your windows guest os and connect to it check your ip address before connecting and after and you should see a different ip address if all went well you now have a virtual machine running tor vpn then if you want to add another layer you can download tor browser bundle onto your virtual machine and run that as well giving you tor vpon tor for another layer of security also you have the option using this method to use a vpn on your host os then tor expert with tortilla then another vpn on your guest os then tor browser giving you vpn to vpn tor i am not advocating any which method you need to make that decision on your own i am just giving you the knowledge necessary to make an informed decison and you can ultimately choose which method you feel most comfortable with sometimes doing tor vpn is necessary because of the spam filter reasons i mentioned above and other times having tor as your last node to the internet is necessary like when accessing the onion network it is completely up to you and i know that we are trying to shy away from windows usage because of all the exploits and other reasons spoken about in the previous posts but if you have no other way of staying anonymous from your vpn than this then i think it is a good compromise until we have something like tortilla that is compatible with linus distributions . exif datai forgot to mention above when talking about metadata that when it comes to photos there is another risk involved called exit data this is another form of meta data specifically related to images and may not be properly removed by metadata anonymisation toolkit mentioned before exit data stands for changeable image file format and affects jug jpef tif and wav files a photo taken with a gps enabled camera can reveal the exact location and time it was taken and the unique in number of the device this is all done by default often without the users knowledge in december anti virus programmer john mcafee was arrested in guatemala while fleeing from alleged persecution in belize which shares a border vice magazine had published an exclusive interview with mcafee on the run that included a photo of mcafee with a vice reporter taken with a phone that had geotagged the image the photos metadata included gas coordinates locating mcafee in guatemala and he was captured two days later to avoid this only take photos that use png because it does not store exif data to check if your photo has any revealing exif data attached to it check out this site you can download a tool by doing a quick search online to see what exif data may be contained in your photos before you upload them be very careful with any files that you upload online because you never know what type of careful data could be attached in them it helps to use tails but always consider everything you put online as a potential piece of evidence to be used against you and always prepare for the day the feds come to your door . learning from others mistakes libertas dr sabu lulzseca little change of pace for this next post i want to talk about one of our fallen moderators libertas it has finally been confirmed what we all were hoping for that libertas one of the arrested moderators was released on bail recently according to an article silk road moderator mary davis aka libertas is officially free on bail and awaiting an extradition hearing on february the fbi flew to ireland that night for the express purpose of taking davis into custody and interrogating him in ireland with regard to his position and functions being a moderator on a jebusite allowing transactions to facilitate the sale of drugs online so as you can see just because libertas was a moderator on the site he is being charged with allowing transactions to faciliate sales of drugs he is rascally being charged as a drug dealer quotehowever davis was found in possession of illicit substances which could result in a maximum sentence he unfortunately was found with drugs on him at the time of his arrest which made things much easier to keep him in custody and it turns out that the alleged former owner of silk road ross ulbricht is fully complying with law enforcement to attempt to identify senior vendors on silk road according to the article ross communicated with the vendors frequently and likely in plain text is my guess the reason i bring this up is that we need to remind every user on here of the mistakes that were made by ross and the other three moderators so that we can hopefully learn from them we need to avoid these types of mistakes never ever ever give anybody any personal information about yourself online the story goes that ross required moderators to give him copies of their ids in order to become moderators of silk road and he likely kept a record of these on his computer unfortunately these are now in the hands of the fbi and moderators have been arrested as a result since and now according to the article they are after senior vendors as well a few take homes are always use pip encryption in all your communications which unfortunately in this case would not have muttered because ross ended up giving up his private keys to the feds but it is still another hurdle in their way to protect you from them taking away your freedom never give out any personal information to anybody online about yourself never put your trust in somebody elses hands because at the end of the day nobody is going to go to jail for you ross found an opportunity to possibly reduce his sentence and he is fully taking advantage of the opportunity this exact same scenario happened with sabu from lulzsec was threatened with years in prison he quickly turned on all his friends and worked with the feds to get them all locked up to help reduce his sentence sabu has kids and obviously decided he would rather snitch out his friends and have a chance at being a father rather than spend the rest of his life locked up in jail again nobody is going to go to jail for you . retaining a lawyer how to handle getting caught or interrogatednext entry into the series on security is how to handle getting caught let us face it we are all human and we make mistakes unfortunately you only need to make one mistake and the law enforcement commonly referred to as le on these forums can bust you maybe they will wait for you to do something more serious before they nab you but if you slip up and they feel you are worth going after you can expect them to get you no matter where you live with rare exception the first thing i want to do is link you to another thread i just came across on these forums main question is should i keep an emergency lawyer fund on hand and how much should it be the response i think was most appropriate for this question was the following quote from vanillaroyale on january give your lawyer k and put him on a retainer dont have a emergency fund stash lying around if that is what you mean you should already have your lawyer paid plus extra in case he needs to post bond for you and they seize the majority of your drug funds once you get arrested by le they can seize your money based on the assumption that it is drug related so you need to have a lawyer paid for ahead of time that way in the unfortunate case that you get a visit from the feds you have a lawyer ready to go the agreed upon amount was around next i want to talk to you about what to do in case you get interrogated by le there is a great thread about this the take homes from this thread are rascally keep your moouth shut the feds are going to try all types of tactics on you to get you to admit to guilt of the crimes you are being accused of they will likely use the good cop bad cop on you first they will tell you that they want to help you and that they are after the big guys they just need your help to put away the big guys do not listen to this i have never operated with a good cop le and have it end up working in my favor once you admit to being guilty you can kiss your freedom good bye secondly if you refuse to cooperate their attitude will change to bad cop they will say of fine you do not want to cooperate i tried to help but now you are going to be in a lot of trouble do you have any idea what kind of charges you are facing you are going away for a long time unless you start talking they are going to try and scare you into admitting guilt again keep your mouth shut and continue to ask for a lawyer hopefully the one you put on a retainer prior to this happening never speak without a lawyer present and never do anything you do not have to do legally if you have the right to remain silent then exercise that right i know there are some circumstances in which you do not have that right but unless that is the case you are better off staying quiet third drop the attitude do not argue with the cops about having nothing on you or something for that matter act scared anxious and confused act like you have no idea what is going on and that you are scared for your life tell the cops they are scaring you and you want to see your lawyer because you do not know what this is about they need evidence and solid evidence at that to charge you with a crime they are going to try and correlate posts you made on forums phone numbers you called perhaps a package shipped to your home all forms of communication bank transfers and so forth until they can find a way to link you to the crime you are being accused of but the biggest piece of evidence will always be your willingness to admit your guilt for a lesser sentence when sabu found that he was facing years in federal prison he quickly spilled everything and started working for the feds again talk to your lawyer find out the evidence against you and only answers questions your lawyer advises you to answer and answer them in a way your lawyer advises you to answer them try and be as honest as possible with your lawyer your lawyer can not and will not share any admittance of guilt you have with the prosecutors or le this is called attorney client privilege please note there are a few instances where this does not apply . pgp tails virtual box so keep in mind that if you are a user of silk road or any other form of activism you never want to enter any identifying details about yourself online make it so that even if the nsa intercepted and decrypted or compromise silk road that the only information they have against you is your surname and password how safe is that surname and password does your password contain any identifying information is it the same password that you use for your personal email does it contain a name of somebody you know personally always keep all of these factors in mind another step you must take especially when communicating with other users on sites such as silk road is using pip encryption this is not always possible such as in cases when you are logging into a jebusite filling out a form logging into an email etc consider any type of information you enter into a jebusite using plain text possibly compromised never put anything sensitive is any type of plain text formal online pgp comes into play because it uses a very strong method of encryption called cryptography pgp stands for pretty good privacy and it is used for encrypting decrypting and signing texts e mails files directories and whole disk partitions and to increase the security of e mail communications for the more technical users it uses a aerial combination of hashing data compression symmetry key cryptography and finally public key cryptography for the less technical users the process of encrypting messages using pgp is as follows you create a private key and a public key the public key is the key you give out to people you want to send you encrusted messages your private key is kept privately by you this private key is the only key that can unlock messages that were previously locked with your public key if you are still confused think about it like this think about a public key that can go around locking boxes that are intended for you anyone can lock a box that is intended for you but you are the only one with the key to unlock the box either if the person who sent you a message locked a box message with your public key they themselves can not unlock it only the person possessing the private key can unlock it if you wish to respond to this person you must use their public key to encrypt the message you intend to send to them and they themselves use their own private key to decrypt the message you sent them if you are still with me i am glad i havent lost you yet this is called cryptography and was designed so that anybody intercepting your message could not decrypt the message without your private key even if you yourself lose your private key there is no method of key recovery you can consider that message locked forever so how do you use pgp well before we get to that i want to introduce you to a live operating system which makes using pip encryption and decryption very easy a live operating system is an operating system that you can run on top of your current operating system so for example if you are a windows user you have choices you can download the live operating system burn it to a cd or dvd and then boot your computer from that dvd or cd this will make sure your computer run as if you have this operating system installed on your computer however if you remove the cd or dvd and reboot then your computer will boot as normal you can also use a us drive to perform this same feature secondly you can run this live operating system in whats called a virtual box the benefits of this are that you can run windows simultaneously as you run this other operating system and you can easily switch back and forth between them without rebooting the computer both methods have their pros and cons the pros of running a live cd boot are that reduce the risk of having your computer compromise by viruses malware and keyloggers that rely on windows vulnerabilities to run if you are going to run this os from a virtual box i suggest downloading virtual box from oracle note the next the live operating system i would encourage you to use is tails tails can be found at the following website the reason i choose tails is because it has many of the security features that you require to stay anonymous already installed some users are not happy with tails but it really is a great operating system loaded with security features many i will talk about in this series on security including pip encryption and decryption make sure you download the tails iso file from the official tails jebusite and you can either load it into virtual box or burn it to a dvd or load it onto a us and booting your computer from that drive there are plenty of tutorials on how to load tails into virtual box so i wont go into much detail other than make sure you run virtual box and tails from a us drive or s card i would suggest a us drive however for reasons i will explain later but rascally when when virtual box runs directly on your hard drive it creates a virtual hard drive that is uses as a temporary hard drive while tails is running once tails is closed this virtual drive is delete but its not permanently delete as we know from the power of recovery tools deleted files are easily recoverable with the right tools i will talk about how to protect your files from data recovery tools in future posts but for now just keep virtual box and tails off of your hard drive and load it either on a us drive or sd card the same goes when booting your computer directly into tails from a dvd or us stick your hard drive will be used to store files used by tails so make sure any files that are saved or accesse using tails are done from a us stick or sd card otherwise they will be recoverable this is why i prefer using a virtual box and running both the virtual box and tails inside of it off of a us stick keep as much as possible off of your actual hard drive it is possible to shred files beyond recovery but its much easier to do this on a go flash drive then it is a to hard drive next post we will get back on topic and start learning how to use pgp the reason i have to take a detour to using tails is because we will be using tails for many of the features from here on out including pgp . whole disk encryption and file shreddingwelcome back again now that we have pip figured out hopefully i want to remind you that using pgp whenever possible is very very very important one of the pitfalls of silk road is that some of the administrators including ross himself did not always communicate using pip encryption once ross was busted they had access to his servers and his computers and anything that wasnt encrusted was wide open for them to look at most users on silk road believe that ross had stored personal information about some of admins and moderators on his computer in plain text that was used to make more arrests of silk road users one of the reasons why i would suggest for you to store your pgp keys and other sensitive data on a s card is that if that day comes when you are compromise and you get a knock at your door you have time to dispose of that s card or us drive quickly even better if you have a micro sd card that plugs into an sd adapter then you can snap it with your fingers or at the very least hide it usbs would need to be smashed into pieces and it might not be easy to do this in the heat of the moment so do what you feel best about but always prepare for the day they might come for you but our next topic brings us to something called whole disk encryption or full disk encryption from here on out i will refer to it as de full disk encryption tails has a de feature built into it which is another reason why i encourage the use of tails it has many of these features to protect you essentially fde will protect your drive whether sd or usb from the people who may come for you one day the method in which it does this is it formats your drive and rewrites the file system in an encrusted fashion so that it can be only be accesse by someone who has the pass phrase if you lose your passphrase just like in pgp there is no recovery your only choice is to format the drive and start over again so make sure you remember it and please for the love of god allah buddah etc dont store the passphrase on your hard drive somewhere the tutorial on how to do this is locked at the following webpage again always prepare for the day they come knocking encrypt everything use pgp when communicating with others and always shred your files when finished with them which brings me to my next topic file shredding file shredding is extremely important and here is why if you delete a file from your computer you are only deleting where it is locked on the drive it is still on the actual drive just its location data has been removed if you take a file recovery tool you can recover virtual any file that you have recently removed file shredding combats this by overwriting files instead the idea is that instead of removing the files location you need to overwrite the file with random data so that is becomes recoverable there are a lot of debate happening on whether you can overwrite a file once or if you need to do it multiple times supposed the nsa recommends times supposed the department of defense recommends times and an old paper by a man named peter gutmann written in the s recommended times needless to say i personally think between times is sufficient and several people out there believe time will get the job done the reasoning behind this is that some people believe the drive may miss some files the first time it over writes them and to be more complete you should do multiply passes do what you feel most comfortable with but i even think passes would be sufficient although it wouldnt hurt every now and then to run passes and just leave it overnight the programs that can do file shredding are ones you will want to run from windows or whatever operating system your computer is running these programs can delete your files from your recycling bin delete your temporary internet files and even wipe your free disk space to make sure everything gets cleaned up you always need to think did i have any sensitive material on my hard drive if so maybe i need to shred my free disk space when empting your recycle bin you should always use a shredder when only deleting under gb at a time you can easily do passes pretty quickly to put this in perspective the leader of a group called lulzsec name topiary has been banned as part of his sentence from using any type of file shredding applications so that if the fbi wants to check up on him they can file shredding keeps your delete files actually delete here are some file shredding applications you can use were going to talk about removing careful metadata from files and some other topics as well . fraudulent private messagesbe careful with private messages pm online because one thing that comes with anonymity is plenty of scammers silk road users have been reporting suspicious and outright fraudulent messages from users posing as moderators asking them to download files to their computers here is an actual message received by another member quotethis message is to inform you that the version of tor bundle you are using may be vulnerable to a remote execution attack through a flaw in javascripts onreadystatechange event this vulnerability may disclose a users actual

appear to have been target please note if you are using linux or tails notable this vulnerability does not apply to you please disregard this message we are advising all of our community members to upgrade to the patched version tor bundle latest tor bundle mirror you do not need to remove your current tor bundle before installing this will overwrite the previous installation and upgrade you to

security and safety is not compromise well then you dont need to be here period any questions please feel free to message any mod and we will do our best to reply asaphappy new year stay safe in s staff they then provide a link for you to download an dated version of tor which has been removed for security purposes but this message is not coming from any silk road staff it is coming from a random account and the files are likely to be viruses or possibly even from law enforcement if you get any suspicious messages from anybody claiming to be a silk road moderator asking you to download software to your computer report it to a moderator immediately so that they can ban the accounts do not under any circumstances download any software to your computer unless it comes from an official website such as again stay safe everyone .
