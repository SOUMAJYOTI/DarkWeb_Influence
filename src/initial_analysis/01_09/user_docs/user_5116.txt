do absolutely anything i ever have to do i find it to be about as functions as it is aesthetically appealing barely at all i dont care about the aesthetics if the interface is well thought out and practical but i cant stand the interface on blackbank middle earth i find much easier to use there are a few little things i dislike like how conversations without unread messages have to be sorted alphabetically by the other persons name and cant be sorted phrenologically like a normal inbox so you can come back to a recent conversation even if you dont remember who it is because youre talking to a hundred different people and a few common features id like to see added like listing cloning which isnt that important to me but is definitely nice as well as some features ive never seen before but keep suggesting for the most part the interface works for me there i like that both nucleus and middle earth auto fe for fe listings unlike blackbank where even on a fe listing the buyer has to wait for you to accept before they can finalize and then you have to wait for them to finalize after that before you can withdraw so theres this whole correspondence dynamic that can leave funds sitting in limbo indefinitely whereas on middle earth and nucleus the second someone orders an fe listing you can withdraw and secure the funds middle earth has one issue that i find quite bothersome though buyers cant withdraw wtf is that its their money i dont care if me doesnt want to be a free tumbler if thats their excuse they can charge a withdrawal fee like blackbank people deposit more coin than they need all the time to make sure they have enough for their order during etc fluctuations if nothing else they also should have the right to change their mind and pull their coin out what if you deposit as much as you need to buy something the etc drops or the vendor raises the price or hits vacation mode and you can no longer afford it and want to take your coin back or order a smaller listing or something else and now have a bunch of leftover coin you cant withdraw i really like the endor side of middle earth but this troubles me to prevent it from being used as a tumbler if people actually use it as such and thats problematic they could charge a withdrawal fee for people who deposit then withdraw withut buying anything no withdrawal fee for people who spend more than half of the coin they deposit before withdrawing the remainder or something silly like that i still wouldnt like that but thats not nearly as bad as not letting people withdraw at all if there willing to let me vend there for a mere commission they should let people tumble their coins at a slight cost as well even if most buyer withdrawals arent even for that purpose but rather just because people want their money where they want their money somewhere safer than an anonymously run darknet market primarily used for drugs that are illegal in most of the world for example again i really like middle earth from the endor side of things but they lose major brownie points for this issue ive had multiply people refuse to buy there for this reason and i completely understand why if they resolve this theyll be one of my favorite markets of all time as it stands in having a great time vending there but this doesn sit right with me and nucleus nucleus scares me design wise its one of my favorite two markets of all time along with evolution in fact it reminds me so much of evolution i feel like its too good to be true yes i would like to see more features but this has all the essentials i can think of and its laid out in a very naturally accessible way the ui for nucleus like evolution makes for a wonderful work experience on the vendor side evolution was my favorite marketplace design wise but i was only there for weeks steady before they made off with all the moneys i dont want to fall in love with nucleus like i fell head over heels with evolution only to have my heart broken again yes nucleus i find you attractive and i really enjoy being with you but im faded from all my past relationships gone wrong and have my guard up and am not going to let myself get infatuated with you and get careless again as i have before im going to make the most of what we have together and hope it lasts but at the end of the day too much trust in your kind always ends badly

it doesnt matter to him if le locates and busts middle earth but keeps it online in some capacity after adding their own js that does reveal user locations because by the time they add their own code to the server its already over anyway maybe a ton of people should just message hobbit and gandalf asking if they ever heard of freedom hosting or tormail . i still don t get all this fuss about the

vendor s grams profile if they update their key there and on the linked markets that are still up will you lose your link feedback from defunct markets where you can not update your key will you lose any links feedback at all or does it still give you credit for having verified with your old key that grams previously recognized as being used on a market i d just really like to know because it takes an eternity to add most things and their support does not respond at all actually that s not true grams got back to me in less than hours saying my subject was too long and that they therefor could not read my message body for such a nice clean website and gamesome functionality i m surprised too many characters in the subject interferes with the body of the message at all kind of random and you d think they could prevent your subject from being too line by limiting how long it can be rather than letting you destroy your own messages lol after that they didn t get back to me and i think i ve asked them the same questions times now with short subject lines over months so i m guessing they re not going to would be nice if they had a forum seems like they ve pulled together a fifty set of services and i m very curious as to how many buyers utilize it in any way whatsoever and also about the prating public key stuff . ive used grams the problem i see with it though is that it only indexes a few sites one of my personal motivations with bb was to get listed on grams however due to all the dos ing chaos going on none of my into ever got established there i suspect that is the case for a lot of small time vendors amvd as stated hasnt been dated in ages so unless a vendor has been around a very long time it doesnt help too many people i suspect i think that a database that allows self registration as a vendor with a fee for some kind of verification may be a good idea i also see that there could be a lot of problems with identity as well my cents . i realize the amvd is outraged and no longer getting dated but i m still curious i m sure both are handy for keeping track of where vendors are and verifying that their key matches past different profiles etc but i m just curious as to how many darknet shoppers here actually use either or these two sites please give one of the following answers you use grams you use the amvd you use both you use neither and feel
