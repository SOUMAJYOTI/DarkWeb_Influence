fathertedmay i ask the reason why you would like the listings hidden for guests . let hansa know what you think is the multisig easy for you to learn can anything be improved on the site even some words of encouragement are welcomed your thoughts matter to the hansa team cheers jaxx . how about hiding the listings so there only available when logged in i messaged support about a few things but never got a reply . quote from yogsothoth on december amhansa was easy to use and loaded my btc within minutes transactions went smooth and i did feel pretty secure using their escrow system not a ton of vendorscompared to dream but it seems the listings are growing weekly just my opinion based on my experience there so far yogthank you glad to have you as a buyer jaxx . hansa was easy to use and loaded my btc within minutes transactions went smooth and i did feel pretty secure using their escrow system not a ton of vendorscompared to dream but it seems the listings are growing weekly just my opinion based on my experience there so far a couple of other things the interface is actually darn good and easy to understand and use the pgp login was a good touch encryption of messages could not have been simpler because of the tight escrow i would recommend hansa to my friends yog . what i like about hansa are the organized consolidated listings it really was a smart idea that was clearly thought out and not just implements for the sake of differentiating itself from the more popular markets i only ordered off the market once so far and this made finding what i wanted almost too easy i image this feature will become even more useful as the site grows another thing ive noticed is that all the listings ive seen only come with one picture and it appears theyve all been resided with no option to view them in their original glory thats a bit disappointing i would suggest allowing the option for vendors to post more than one picture if that option isnt already available and perhaps even encourage vendors to post more than one picture also give buyers the ability to view the pictures in full size . wouldnt putting a picture full screen put your opsec at risk i know when i accidentally pit my screen full size tor gives me a warning i agree though more pictures would be nice . quote from jaxx on december pm fathertedmay i ask the reason why you would like the listings hidden for guests so more people sign up to the market its not that important just not used to a market that shows the listings without sign up makes me feel like im on ebay or something and also as people said making the image full size would be a good option right clicking it and clicking view image dont seem to work . quote from jaxx on january pmfatherted i sent yours as well as the other

but that too will be brought up to them thank you guys for your input happy new year jaxxas said its not that important just not used to it is all but the image getting larger is something everyone would want and if you ask them to install an exit information delete script on serve side it wont reveal any information as to where the pics came from etc happy new year to you too and may it bring

transaction after that hansa will not have access to the funds this is necessary in case a vendor disappears if it went straight to the third party the funds would be lost in this situation hope this helps me will this workflow of the btc transfer from buyer to vendor with whatever market involvement in middle be the same deal with of i e where the market has custodianship of the for any amount of time if so in call this the blackbank evolution of multisig solution not bad i like to have options and baby turning up the mutlsig complex heat on newbies is obviously going to be challenging so having easy multsig but also having more complicated true multisig with no central party being able to do anything more than any other party made test buyer account today and setup a multisig vendor listing both buyer vendor has a signing wallet setup with their pubkey and they validated it of course but then i purchase the item and it wasnt clear how a buyer would choose between of or of so i proceed with general multisig selection it requires me to deposit to hansa central wallet this is the part thats disappointing but i give benefit of doubt and say that hansa is focuses on ui and ease of use as proved by their stellar i eic and tmp i p both allowed direct deposit to the multisig wallet itself i then noticed that the proper btc amounts went into a true multisig wallet this is where i get really confused because theres no multisig redeemscripts where and or when is the redeemscript presented to each party cant think why it wouldnt be immediate but i might be missing something this piece is so crucial in the multisig scheme of things without it i done even see value in multisig if i dont have all the pubkeys i dont have redeemscript i can not offline mutlisig finalize with the buyer no ifs ands or buts its very important that the redeemscript is needed to safeguard with ur privkey of the sign wallet ill update this because i need to wait days on hansa to finalize so if finale reveals more useful info ill pass it along in this thread id really . i set it up immediately as i did the pgp sign in i believe the function of the is to allow you to access your funds if the

now multi sig escrow is a great approach from a market imo and others should follow their lead its nice to know that there are markets out there who will listen to the needs of the dnm community and then after due consideration implement any changes they feel are necessary thats excellent news guys all the best for the future . hansa is our market . hansa is our market . i have to congratulate

they want to use of vs of and ultimately i believe the funds are being paid to a temp wallet wallet starting with ajsndasbfbdbfdsbfbsjdbfs and then passed to the multisig wallet fdfihfidhfihdfhdfhidhfidhihfdi but in having trouble grasping the financial flow and i really want to understand it because this is conceptually the best market to date so i can start using this market as my preferred multisig spot and likely preferred central escrow too jane maybe a video showing buyer set purchase of item and then vendor acceptance and finalize for of and then another video for of would be great for cementing how this is all supposed to work showing the redeemscript decoding in there would be nice too as the sigs help vendors in particular to feel comfortable with how the moneys being held and as a side note the interface is just gorgeous the more minutes i spend on here the more i appreciate the clean feel of the site . there is an in depth step by step walkthrough in the far section on hansas site on how the multi sig works also coin in has a very easy to learn walkthrough on their site that will give you a better idea of how this works only time there is a temporary wallet is at the beginning of the transaction the funds will stay in kansas wallet until the vendor accepts the transaction this is the only time hansa has access to the funds i do not believe we will be making any videos on how mufti sig works but i do know there are some if you google it jaxx . i must be missing something about how it works tho i made a test buyer account
