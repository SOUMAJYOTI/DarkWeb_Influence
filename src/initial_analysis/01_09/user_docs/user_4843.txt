in your settings and download the one for arm android from next grab meshup and you will find yourself wit a better selection then netflix and hulu combined for free will give you a great start and i will let you in on anther repo with huge amounts of addons are plenty to spend days going through ok so we have free internet next to free food and now free tv of you like it enough you can keep up with the live tv steams and have real tv i will think of another way for my community to save money and report back later . oh boy in half tempted to print all this out along with all your links im a

has changed its name to gs and is now renaming everything ucc to gs this digit signals to the pos system that it is canning a coupon not a regular up code unc company number the following five digits identifies the manufacturer of the composed item this number must be the same as on the products being composed what about if your company number assigned is longer than digits you would only use positions for the company prefix on the coupon the reamaining digits would be dropped family codethe following three digits is family code this code designates items being composed products being composed must be assigned a family code in order to the retailers to validte coupons this family code must be communicated to retailers before the coupons are issued family code applies on a group of products there are family code numbers however gs reserves the two ranges you should not use the these ranges value codeuse first chartthe two digits defines the value of the coupon value codes are

manufactures and models of routers you need to make sure that you have interest access through your house right so we can do that with a handy dd wrt firmware hack to an old or new router see if you have one on the list or find one next set up the bridge for the rest of the house amd you can even change the password and lock the original people out of your network lesson will be how to make a printable coupon for anything with any discount . oh boy in half tempted to print all this out along with all your links im a poor man myself and could make use of every last one of these with kali instead of making a live cd can you make a liveusb instead and do the same thing . wow this is really great but do the methods also work in eu . kali has the patched drivers built into the kernel so there is no need to update drivers i find that you may need to put the card in hardware monitor mode to be able to use the tools this walk through gives a better explanation of using your wifi in monitor mode and how to get it there with the current tools rever for was wep there is no longer a need to use dictionary files as you no longer need to find the login packet and hash out the password with dictionaries make sure that when you fire up the tool you are using to hack the wifi you tell it to use the wifi in monitor mode or you will miss of the stuff the cracker is truing to find for example you will want to use the commandreaver i mon b instead of reaver i wlan b the correct one using the monitor mode will begin the process of going through the combinations until it finds the wps then it will use that to dump the password in plain text . here i will talk about how you can make a up coupon desipte the efforts from gs to replace it with more advanced solutions u p c coupons are still the most common type all over north america you will need this list of info for the project up coupon a u p c coupon look like a regular upc a barcode except that the first digit is always a coupon number consists of five parts as illustrated in the barcode ucc prefixthe first digit of a upc a number is called unc prefix which identifies the type of the product it is also called number system or gs company prefix ucc has changed its name to gs and is now renaming everything ucc to gs this digit signals to the pos system that it is canning a coupon not a regular up code unc company number the following five digits identifies the manufacturer of the composed item this number must be the same as on the products being composed what about if your company number assigned is longer than digits you would only use positions for the company prefix on the coupon the reamaining digits would be dropped family codethe following three digits is family code this code designates items being composed products being composed must be assigned a family code in order to the retailers to validte coupons this family code must be communicated to retailers before the coupons are issued family code applies on a group of products there are family code numbers however gs reserves the two ranges you should not use the these ranges value codeuse first chartthe two digits defines the value of the coupon value codes are predefined for example code means off and means buy or more and get off for the detailed list obtain the manual titled the application standard for unc coupon codes from gs you can also find it here check digitthe last digit is the checksum the same as all upc a numbers you can calculate check digits at need to find a bar code printer for the os you are using and there are plenty of free ones out there try them on a self check out lane and try for small ones first use repaid cash loaded credit cards at all times so there will be no knock on the door months later asking for worth for groceries or other fun things next lesson will be easy to use free over the interest tv for the entire world . wow this is really great but do the methods also work in eu .

unfortunately the only thing we remain in is the amount of people we imprison for non violent crimes lack of proper education and general stupidity we are also ass backwards and will not change anything until it doesnt work at all i know of a small plane company that makes million dollar plains but runs their entire operation factory off computers from the s my cell phone has more power then all of their network combined there are more advanced versions of printing coupons and i will post the other better way soon i will check my hacker forums and places to see how the eu has changed their bar code system as they are using a few different ones and i know the more expensive items i think use a more advanced system . i like the coupon codes not like in steal but for razors and sincere items expensive supplements it might be worth it select items that you cant get cheap because of incorporate greed good stuff . ahhh the glory days of using fake coupons i still remember stumbling upon coupon threads years ago back in my days when i checked chan honestly though they are fucking amazing and will save you tons of cash just done use your cc and if you get caught act like

one end to the other and the server will be set not to keep logs and to allow pass through communication that will enable the encryption to be done from one client to the other the starting price for
