the book of ecclesiastes is a good primer on the subject yes i did just reference the bible or is it just king soloman in the throes of a dopamine and oxytocin deficiancy after his wives had all taken their turn on him vanity so many people wrapped up meaningless pursuits both mystical and temporal my razor of truth is what i m doing of service to those around me or is it simply serving myself of course every action is self serving even the self destructive actions are self serving even the self sacrificial actions are self serving it serves the ego but does it also serve others imo that is the highest level of royalty you can achieve service to your fellow man anything else is simply vanity why is it so important for you to find this group if i knew about such a group do you think that i or anyone else here would hold that knowledge back from a truthful seeker of course not you say that common people are not recorded by the world that they make nothing and die as nothing and that you have no soul inferring that you are common people would it be so strange to assume that you are looking to aquire one of these souls to attach yourself to someone who has one you are looking for something to change your fate to leave your mark on this world am i striking a chord here well then before enlightenment chop wood carry water after enlightenment chop wood carry water be of servicethat is the way that s it there is no secret club there is no hidden knowledge it s all right here for us ready when you are don t let your vanity get in the way of your calling of all our calling to serve that is how true royalty achieves greatness there are pleanty of historical figures that i remember that were awful people who have achieved great and horrible things if you measure the worth of a man with simply his ability to be remembered or to achieve something memorable then i ve got no interest in what you re after i implore you brother take up your cross lay down what s dear to you and make yourself of service it s truly the only way to enlightenment to become royalty by your calculations souls every years souls total this god of time is only got about years worth of souls to record are not the pyramids a direct refutation of these numbers i understand free egos and i know that there are may who will never be remembered i also know that there are many who will suffer in this world and many who could have stopped that who could have improved the lot of others but instead got lost in meaningless pursuits will you be one of those or are you capable of looking
