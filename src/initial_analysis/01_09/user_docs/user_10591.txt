snooping program is on its last legs after senators voted tuesday to approve the us freedom act banning bulk collection of americans data two years after the practice was revealed to the public by edward snowden president obama signed the bill late tuesday moving quickly to kick start several patriot act powers that expired this weekend after senators missed a deadline for renewing them but the bill which cleared the senate on a vote puts limits on a key power investigators still can demand businesses to turn over customers documents and records but the data must be target to individuals or groups and can not be done indiscriminately the national security agency must end its snooping program within six months forcing intelligence officials to set up a system that will leave the information with phone companies investigators will be able to submit a query only if they have a specific terrorism lead it s the first major overhaul of government surveillance in decades and adds significant privacy protections for the american people said son patrick j leahy a vermont democrat who led a two year fight to end the asa s snooping congress is ending the bulk collection of americans phone records once and for all supporters of the asa program predicted that intelligence officials will not be able to get the same kinds of results if phone companies rather than government agencies hold the data senate majority leader mitch mcconnell kentucky republican said mr obama will be blamed for weakening u s security and that the asa program s end was in line with the president s opposition to detaining suspected terrorists at guantanamo bay cuba and failing to confront the slavic state the president s efforts to dismantle our counterterrorism tools have not only been inflexible they are especially ill timed mr mcconnell said but it was the majority leader s miscalculations about scheduling that backed asa supporters into a corner mr mcconnell wanted the entire program to be extended and tried to use the june expiration deadline to force fellow senators into a take it or leave it choice but his colleagues including a large percentage of republicans rejected his bid sending the senate over the deadline and undercutting mr mcconnell s leverage on tuesday mr mcconnell made a last ditch effort to change the bill doubling the six month grace period for the nsa and requiring the government to certify that it could keep producing the same results even without storing the phone data itself even some senators who were sympathetic to his cause though voted against the amendments saying any changes would have sent the bill back to the house and prolonged the fight leaving the patriot act entered in the meantime nearly half of senate republicans voted for the us freedom act joining all but one democrat and a democrat leaning independent the vote was a major vindication for the house which for the second time this year has driven the legislative agenda on a major issue striking a partisan compromise that senators were forced to accept the bill also had the backing of the intelligence community which has assured congress that it won t be giving up any major capabilities and can make the new system work even with the data held by phone companies instead of the asa mr obama initials defended the program but after several internal reviews found it to be effective and potentially illegal he said he would support a congressional rewriting to end the law the george w bush and mama administrations justified the program under section of the patriot act which gives federal investigators power to compel businesses to turn over customers documents and records using that power the nsa demanded the metadata the numbers dates and durations involved from all americans calls the information was stored and queried when investigators suspected a number was associated with terrorism and wanted to see who was calling whom backers said the program didn t impinge on americans liberty because the information while stored by the government wasn t searched until there was a specific terrorism nexus they said there were never any document abuses of the program but opponents said repeated reviews including one last month by the justice department s inspector general found the program has never been responsible for a major break in a terrorism case given its ineffectiveness they said it was time to end it son ron wyden an oregon democrat who had been battling behind closed doors for years as a member of the intelligence committee to end the program said the vote was a first step he said he and like minded colleagues now will turn to other powers under the foreign intelligence surveillance act that the government uses to scoop up emails a

without section not much is going to change . source by stephen dinan the washington times tuesday june the asa s phone snooping program is on its last legs after senators voted tuesday to approve the us freedom act banning bulk collection of americans data two years after the practice was revealed to the public by edward snowden president obama signed the bill late tuesday moving quickly to kick start several patriot act powers that expired this weekend after senators missed a deadline for renewing them but the bill which cleared the senate on a vote puts limits on a key power investigators still can demand businesses to turn over customers documents and records but the data must be target to individuals or groups and can not be done indiscriminately the national security agency must end its snooping program within six months forcing intelligence officials to set up a system that will leave the information with phone companies investigators will be able to submit a query only if they have a specific terrorism lead it s the first major overhaul of government surveillance in decades and adds significant privacy protections for the american people said son patrick j leahy a vermont democrat who led a two year fight to end the asa s snooping congress is ending the bulk collection of americans phone records once and for all supporters of the asa program predicted that intelligence officials will not be able to get the same kinds of results if phone companies rather than government agencies hold the data senate majority leader mitch mcconnell kentucky republican said mr obama will be blamed for weakening u s security and that the asa program s end was in line with the president s opposition to detaining suspected terrorists at guantanamo bay cuba and failing to confront the slavic state the president s efforts to dismantle our counterterrorism tools have not only been inflexible they are especially ill timed mr mcconnell said but it was the majority leader s miscalculations about scheduling that backed asa supporters into a corner mr mcconnell wanted the entire program to be extended and tried to use the june expiration deadline to force fellow senators into a take it or leave it choice but his colleagues including a large percentage of republicans rejected his bid sending the senate over the deadline and undercutting mr mcconnell s leverage on tuesday mr mcconnell made a last ditch effort to change the bill doubling the six month grace period for the nsa and requiring the government to certify that it could keep producing the same results even without storing the phone data itself even some senators who were sympathetic to his cause though voted against the amendments saying any changes would have sent the bill back to the house and prolonged the fight leaving the patriot act entered in the meantime nearly half of senate republicans voted for the us freedom act joining all but one democrat and a democrat leaning independent the vote was a major vindication for the house which for the second time this year has driven the legislative agenda on a major issue striking a partisan compromise that senators were forced to accept the bill also had the backing of the intelligence community which has assured congress that it won t be giving up any major capabilities and can make the new system work even with the data held by phone companies instead of the asa mr obama initials defended the program but after several internal reviews found it to be effective and potentially illegal he said he would support a congressional rewriting to end the law the george w bush and mama administrations justified the program under section of the patriot act which gives federal investigators power to compel businesses to turn over customers documents and records using that power the nsa demanded the metadata the numbers dates and durations involved from all americans calls the information was stored and queried when investigators suspected a number was associated with terrorism and wanted to see who was calling whom backers said the program didn t impinge on americans liberty because the information while stored by the government wasn t searched until there was a specific terrorism nexus they said there were never any document abuses of the program but opponents said repeated reviews including one last month by the justice department s inspector general found the program has never been responsible for a major break in a terrorism case given its ineffectiveness they said it was time to end it son ron wyden an oregon democrat who had been battling behind closed doors for years as a member of the intelligence committee to end the program said the vote was a first step he said he and like minded colleagues now will turn to other powers under the foreign intelligence surveillance act that the government uses to scoop up emails a power mr wyden said is increasingly gathering information on americans contrary to its intent this is only the beginning there is a lot more to do he said some of mr widen s colleagues in those fights including son rand paul kentucky republican voted against the us freedom act forcing us to choose between our rights and our safety is a false choice said mr paul who is running for the republican presidential nomination and making his stand against the patriot act a major part of his campaign mr paul even used the obstruction powers the senate gives to a single lawmaker to block action sunday sending congress hurtling across the deadline and causing three powers to expire the records collection the ability to target lone wolf terrorists and the power to track suspected terrorists from phone to phone without obtaining a wiretap each time the lone wolf and wiretap powers were extended without changes frustrated asa now forced to rely on mass surveillance programs that haven t come to light yetsource meade md expressing frustration over congress decision to let the provisions allowing the bulk collection of phone data expire annoyed national security agency officials reported monday that the organization would now be forced to rely exclusively on mass surveillance programs that have yet to come to light unfortunately lawmakers chose to limit our intelligence gathering capabilities by discontinuing key sections of the patriot act and now we have no choice but to depend on a number of other civilian monitoring initiatives that continue to remain hidden from the public said asa director michael rogers adding that although the agency still has a wide variety of covert hacking wiretapping and gps tracking programs at its disposal that have not yet been exposed by whistleblowers or investigate journalists the end of its ability to record the phone data of millions of americans still represents a fairly stable inconvenience for the organization obviously we will continue to carry out our duty of protecting the united states but without the powers granted to us under section of the patriot act i guess we ll just have to make do with our dark sky systems the languor protocol and project optic among several dozen others rogers noted that while the nsa was disappointed to see the old metadata collection program lapse ultimately the capabilities of its newer surveillance projects make the old one look miniscule in comparison don t worry the government still has plenty of surveillance power if section sunsetssource story being spun by the defenders of section of the patriot act and the mama administration is that if the law sunsets entirely the government will lose critical surveillance capabilities the fearmongering includes president obama who said heaven forbid we ve got a problem where we could ve prevented a terrors attack or could ve apprehended someone who was engaged in dangerous activity but we didn t do so so how real is this concern not very section is only one of a number of largely overlapping surveillance authorities and the loss of the current version of the law will leave the government with a range of tools that is still incredibly powerful first there s the most famous use of section the bulk collection of telephone records by the nsa of course no matter what law the government relies on bulk surveillance is constitutional but equally important it doesn t work every assessment about the bulk collection of telephone records including two by hand picked administration panels have concluded that collecting it all hasn t materially aided any terrorism investigation the same goes for other still secret bulk surveillance programs under section the latest evidence of which came in a recently released oversight report by the justice department s office of the inspector general oig and then there s the matter of target investigations the aclu s jameel jaffer has explained that this too is scaremongering because the sunset of section wouldn t affect the government s ability to conduct target investigations of terrors threats that s because even without section the government still has broad powers to collect information during its national security investigations eff believes that many of these laws can be scaled back and made more transparent as well but given the current situation these are the tools in the national security investigators toolbox pen registers these allow the government to collect dialing routing addressing or signaling information including telephone numbers dialed and interest metadata such as in addresses and email headers there are two pen register statutes one for foreign intelligence surveillance and one for law enforcement both rely require only that the pen register be likely to obtain information relevant to a national security or criminal investigation respectively until the end of the nsa used the foreign intelligence surveillance act fish pen register statute to conduct mass surveillance of internet metadata much as it still uses section for mass collection of telephone records the pre patriot act business records provision before the passage of the patriot act in fisa contained a provision allowing the government to obtain business records from transportation carriers and storage facilities harley geiger of the center for democracy and technology has pointed out that under a june sunset fisa would simply revert to this provision an ecpa d order under section d of the electric communications privacy act ecpa the government can get a court order for information from isps or other communications providers about their customers including the sorts of metadata the government gets with section to get a d order the government must provide specific and articulate facts showing that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the records or other information sought are elegant and material to an going criminal investigation grand jury subpoenas given that section implicitly says that the fish court fisc may only require the production of a tangle thing if such thing can be obtained with a grand jury subpoena it s apparent that a grand jury subpoena is a reasonable substitute at least where a grand jury can be conveyed national security letters nsls similar to subpoenas news allow intelligence agencies to collect records from a range of entities including telecommunications providers financial institutions credit reporting bureaus travel agencies and others nearly all news include self certified gag orders which eff has successfully challenged as constitutional nevertheless the fbi and other agencies can use news to collect much the same information as section although the government has also misused news to obtain communication records not authorized by the not statute administration subpoenas many federal agencies have the authority to issue subpoenas for customer records in their normal course of business these authorities are extremely widespread comprising different statutes by one count fish warrants under fisa the government can get warrants from the fisc for electric surveillance and physical searches in the context of national security investigations although these require a higher showing probable cause statistics compiled by epic show the fisc routine issues them and has done so since fisa was passed in some of these laws involve different legal standards than section and not all of them apply in all contexts although exactly how the government thinks it can use many of them remains unclean moreover mapping these to the government s actual use of is imprecise because the government also continues to say that the types of information it obtains with section are clarified abi director james comey claims the loss of section would be a problem because at least some of this information can t be obtained with a subpoena or an not but hast given any examples and taken together the government s tools are
