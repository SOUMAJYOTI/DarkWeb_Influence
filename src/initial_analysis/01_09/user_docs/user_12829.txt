wrong they will be required to compensate the buyer multi sig has nothing to do with this process the buyer has just as much say so in as multi sig there is no need for the buyer to be part of the multi sig process since it is done quickly between the vendor and hansa on the rare cases where there is an issue hansa will step in and take into account both parties sides i hope this helps ultimately the individuals holding the keys needed to release the funds in escrow hold the power multi sig has everything to do with the process considering its the integral part of the transaction which takes the power away from the market admins to execute an exit scam and puts the power back into the hands of the other parties involved except in the system the buyer should be part of the multi sig process instead of the transaction being done quickly between the vendor and the market i find it strange that you take the view to omit the buyer from the transaction process simply because on many occasions a buyer will forget to finalize an order your words not mine in relation to buyers taking too long to finalize their orders you could simply create a time lock transaction signed and broadcast by the market where the buyer has say a max of days domestic order to finalize the order otherwise the funds will be released to the appropriate party on the set date . quote from quantumrl

a useless system where the generated keys are held by the vendor and the market only not the buyer as you see in a market using a multisig system where the market the vendor and the buyer each hold a key only two of the three keys are required to release the funds held in crow why any market would employ a multisig escrow system is beyond me a system where each party involved has a say in how the transaction is finalized is a much better and fairer system than one where the vendor and the market have all the power in deciding who gets paid in the event of a dispute . me and the rest of the official meth thread users running everything because of our meth induced intelligence and because we would be able to avoid sleep and already have impossible ideas when we are high its coming wait for it please put on your tin foil so the ciaz dont intercept my keystrokes via mind control . quote from jaxx on december pmthe buyer isnt necessary to successfully complete the transaction most buyers want to make there purchase and be done with the transaction makes this process as simple as possible while maintaining the security of multi sig if a buyer does have a complaint hansa will handle it accordingly there is no risk of an exit scam because the funds are never in the hands of the vendor nor hansa i do understand your want for buyers to have a part of the finalization process but it just isnt needed hansa feels is the smoothed way to complete a transaction thank you for your input though cheers mate youre entitled to your opinion however well just have to agree to disagree im afraid i would like to point out that the vast majority of dnms current on line who employ a multi sig escrow option have chosen to go with the much preferred option rather than the amplified version as you like to think of it as excluding the buyer from the multi sig process is not what we as a dn community should be trying to encourage as it rascally allows the buyer to take the easy option and not have to worry about learning how it all works which is what a lot of buyers these days do each party with a stake in the transaction the market for its commission from the sale the vendor for the cost of the goods bought by the buyer minus the commission and the buyer for paying for the cost of the goods they bought from the vendor should all be allowed to participate in the transaction process buyers like to see where their money went and this would enable them to see for themselves as well as it being the fairest option to all involved current available you have your view and i have mine so lets just leave it at that thanks . quote from jaxx on december pmthank you for your vote of confidence in sure hansa appreciates your loyalty also hans uses not multisig which is less haste there is no need for multisig if the site is ever compromise there is a kill switch built in that will automatically sign the transactions it is easier to just cut out the middleman while still giving the security of multisig many times a buyer will forget to release funds on escrow sites so helps alleviate that issue hope this information helps in sure they are grateful for your business enjoy the site cheers multisig where only the market and the vendor hold a key is not the best option what say would a buyer have in a dispute regardless of what evidence they provide to support their case they dont have possession of one of the keys unlike the other two parties and therefore virtual have no say whatsoever in any outcome reached while in sure there are some buyers who finalize their orders late or let them auto finalize however to suggest this is one of the reasons why a escrow system was used on hans instead of a system is just ludicrous imo it a two way street and both the buyer and vendor should always strive to make the other person happy at least thats what i try to do it has worked well for me thus far rather than screwing the other party over in some way or another each party involved in the transaction should have an equal say in how things are resolved any escrow system where the buyer is the only party without one of the generated keys is simply not a fair system if in paying my hard earned money for a product on a dnm then i expect to have an equal share of responsibility in how the transaction is finalized just like the vendor and to a lesser extent the market would expect to have . me and the rest of the official meth thread users running everything because of our meth induced intelligence and because we would be able to avoid

also the site is set very similar to agora which i love i will be doing most of my business there from now on and i urge you to move if you dont want to worry about the exit scams anymore they need a few more vendors over there so please spread the word you can use my voucher if you like is not a phishing site please verify this is the correct site address with deepdotweb before using my referral also im not an employee or shill for that site i just would love all my vendors to move there too . hey guys check this site out its called hansa and its the future of dark net markets no scam possible no way the site can shut down and take off with your money it uses a decentralized wallet when i initiate a purchase im given a unique address to deposit the money into that you and i both can have access to when the transaction is complete it requires of keys to release funds the site admins have the buyer has and the seller has so if the buyer and seller agree they release like normal

you for your vote of confidence in sure hansa appreciates your loyalty also hans uses not multisig which is less haste there is no need for multisig if the site is ever compromise there is a kill switch built in that will automatically sign the transactions it is easier to just cut out the middleman while still giving the security of multisig many times a buyer will forget to release funds on escrow sites so helps alleviate that issue hope this information helps in sure they are grateful for your business enjoy the site cheers multisig where only the market and the vendor hold a key is not the best option what say would a buyer have in a dispute regardless of what evidence they provide to support their case they dont have possession of one of the keys unlike the other two parties and therefore virtual have no say whatsoever in any outcome reached while in sure there are some buyers who finalize their orders late or let them auto finalize however to suggest this is one of the reasons why a escrow system was used on hans instead of a system is just ludicrous imo it a two way street and both the buyer and vendor should always strive to make the other person happy at least thats what i try to do it has worked well for me thus far rather than screwing the other party over in some way or another each party involved in the transaction should have an equal say in how things are resolved any escrow system where the buyer is the only party without one of the generated keys is simply not a fair system if in paying my hard earned money for a product on a dnm then i expect to have an equal share of responsibility in how the transaction is finalized just like the vendor and to a lesser extent the market would expect to have . quote from jaxx on december pmwith a dispute the support staff will take into consideration both parties if the vendor is found to be wrong they will be required to compensate the buyer multi sig has nothing to do with this process the buyer has just as much say so in as multi sig there is no need for the buyer to be part of the multi sig process since it is done quickly between the vendor and hansa on the rare cases where there is an issue hansa will step in and take into account both parties sides i hope this helps ultimately the individuals holding the keys needed to release the funds in escrow hold the power multi sig has everything to do with the process considering its the integral part of the transaction which takes the power away from the market admins to execute an exit scam and puts the power back into the hands of the other parties involved except in the system the buyer should be part of the multi sig process instead of the transaction being done quickly between the vendor and the market i find it strange that you take the view to omit the buyer from the transaction process simply because on many occasions a buyer will forget to finalize an order your words not mine in relation to buyers taking too long to finalize their orders you could simply create a time lock transaction signed and broadcast by the market where the buyer has say a max of days domestic order to finalize the order otherwise the funds will be released to the appropriate party on the set date . quote from jaxx on december pmthe buyer isnt necessary to successfully complete the transaction most buyers want to make there purchase and be done with the transaction makes this process as simple as possible while maintaining the security of multi sig if a buyer does have a complaint hansa will handle it accordingly there is no risk of an exit scam because the funds are never in the hands of the vendor nor hansa i do understand your want for buyers to have a part of the finalization process but it just isnt needed hansa feels is the smoothed way to complete a transaction thank you for your input though cheers mate youre entitled to your opinion however well just have to agree to disagree im afraid i would like to point out that the vast majority of dnms current on line who employ a multi sig escrow option have chosen to go with the much preferred option rather than the amplified version as you like to think of it as excluding the buyer from the multi sig process is not what we as a dn community should be trying to encourage as it rascally allows the buyer to take the easy option and not have to worry about learning how it all works which is what a lot of buyers these days do each party with a stake in the transaction the market for its commission from the sale the vendor for the cost of the goods bought by the buyer minus the commission and the buyer for paying for the cost of the goods they bought from the vendor should all be allowed to participate in the transaction process buyers like to see where their money went and this would enable them to see for themselves as well as it being the fairest option to all involved current available you have your view and i have mine so lets just leave it at that thanks . hey guys check this site out its called hansa and its the future of dark net markets no scam possible no way the site can shut down and take off with your money it uses a

though it is an option most buyers choose to go through escrow of finale early as it is more simple to them many people are confused by multisig we are hoping promotes people using multisig and makes people more comfortable with its design you have to learn how to walk before you can run cheers as i said before hansa should be applauded for using mufti sig and encouraging people to use it theres a better option out there but i dont own or operate hansa so that nothing to do with me thats a decision for you and you alone time wil tell us all if it was the right one or not you seem to think that most buyers dont have the smarts to use mufti sig and are happy to just fe for vendors instead there are plenty of vendors out there who dont like it want to use it or have the ability to use it either by your way of thinking eliminating the less intelligent buyers from the process will allow the more intelligent vendors and market admins that are involved in a transaction to get it all sorted and finalize it i mean thats the gist of what youre implying here mate because to use your words buyers have to learn how to walk before we can run the markets are responsible for allowing this fe bullshit to perpetuate into what it has become today in sure the majority of buyers out there would much prefer to use a centralized escrow option system on a market in preference to fe and paying the vendor before their order is even shipped that leave the door open for the admins to exit scam but it would at least cut down the amount of vendors doing it and getting away with it especially the ones who are good at detective scamming its going to take some time to turn this all around its a similar situation to what happened during the big pgp drive back on sr which eventually got users left right and centre learning how to use pgp to encrypt their shipping info buyers will eventually learn the importance of using mufti sig and the benefits it brings to a market and to their experience as a marketplace buyer its starting to gain some traction now but will need to be heavily promoted and community members encouraged to participate in its use for a long time to come the benefits of a multi sig system will come to light in due course when the exit scams by both vendors and market admins stop occurring i am not saying buyers rent smart enough to use mufti sig i am saying that just like pgp in people just are not used to it multi sir allows users to get a feel of what multi sig is really about without having to just in head first in order to learn it hansa is all about the buyer and the vendors that is why it is exit swam proof as well as they do not allow finalizing early hansa has everyone best intrest in mind as give already stated jaxx its great to see a marketplace like hansa thats leading by example and listening to the needs of all users vendors and buyers and making changes where required having a no fe policy is an excellent move and one that should encourage buyers even those a little sceptical after previously being ripped off by a vendor back into the market again knowing their coins will be safely stored away off site and exempt from the possibility of theft i can understand your way of thinking where a multi sig system is a good way to promote its use and get people especially new users into the game and comfortable using it however the people who really need to be heavily involved with using it and familiarizing themselves with how it all works are the very same people who are left out of the process and in particular finalizing the transaction the best way for anyone to learn is to get them involved in the process from start to finish so they can get their hands dirty and begin the learning process this will take some time to gather momentum but once it does and the benefits can be seen by all it will eventually become the new modern day standard for all dim transactions nevertheless jaxx props to you for taking the lead

but if you look at the markets out there that offer multisig as an option almost no one uses it incorrect there are current markets in operation including vendor shops as well with of those markets multi sir ready we need to get the market participation rate well over the current mark but at least its a start the markets below all support multi sir transactions acropolis market alphabay market valhalla market east india company outlaw market python market therealdeal market oasis market new also marketplace bloomsfield markethansa is the only market at this stage who chose to implement a multi sig option instead of the more favoured option used by all of the other markets offering mufti sir transactions i have nothing whatsoever against hansa and applaud them for at least incorporating a multi sig escrow system into their market however hansa is the only market at this stage with a system in operation the integration of multi sir transaction into dnms is taking way longer than most of us had hoped or expected it would take it seems as though the ball is now rolling again and the topic of mufti sig escrow is being discussed and debated more than ever on lots of dnm forums quote the fact is that practically speaking it gives the customer no better control using of or of because if the vendor and market choose to collude they can take the coins either way so in your eyes not involving the buyer at all in the process of finalizing the transaction gives them the same control over a transaction where the buyer is holding of the generated keys where of the are needed to release the funds held in crow many factors contribute towards the outcome of a transaction dispute and as an integral part of the transaction a buyer should be included by not including the buyer who exactly is it making it easier for dnm admins exit scamming is a huge problem but theres also the issue of vendors being allowed to pull off some rather large exit scam as well vendors exit scamming can be addressed in many other ways besides the use of multi sig however all parties who have a vested interest in the outcome of each transaction should be involved in it i also realize there are some really ship buyers out there too who are always looking for new ways to scam vendors and get themselves some free drugs so please done think this is a slur against just vendors and market admit staff cause i assure you its not if you want to get buying customers over the hump into the multi sir world lets get them involved in the process in time the benefits of multi sig escrow will be there for all to see but for now promoting and encouraging its use by all in the dnm community is whats needed we dont need to make it any easier than it already is and just like pgp was back in the day the initials take up of multi sir might be a little slow to begin with but over time it will continue to gain traction as more and more people begin to accept it as the new maximum standard and see for themselves just how beneficial and less stressful it really is for everyone involved . i think what angel eyes meant by most do not use multisig is that even though it is an option most

mufti sig and are happy to just fe for vendors instead there are plenty of vendors out there who dont like it want to use it or have the ability to use it either by your way of thinking eliminating the less intelligent buyers from the process will allow the more intelligent vendors and market admins that are involved in a transaction to get it all sorted and finalize it i mean thats the gist of what youre implying here mate because to use your words buyers have to learn how to walk before we can run the markets are responsible for allowing this fe bullshit to perpetuate into what it has become today in sure the majority of buyers out there would much prefer to use a centralized escrow option system on a market in preference to fe and paying the vendor before their order is even shipped that leave the door open for the admins to exit scam but it would at least cut down the amount of vendors doing it and getting away with it especially the ones who are good at detective scamming its going to take some time to turn this all around its a similar situation to what happened during the big pgp drive back on sr which eventually got users left right and centre learning how to use pgp to encrypt their shipping info buyers will eventually learn the importance of using mufti sig and the benefits it brings to a market and to their experience as a marketplace buyer its starting to gain some traction now but will need to be heavily promoted and community members encouraged to participate in its use for a long time to come the benefits of a multi sig system will come

markets out there that offer multisig as an option almost no one uses it i think hans by taking the simpler approach and enforcing it may just help us to get the customer over the hump into the multisig world where we all want to be and while i understand the urge to have the customer involved in finalizing the transaction the fact is that practically speaking it gives the customer no better control using of or of because if the vendor and market choose to collude they can take the coins either way multisig does the primary job we need it to do which is to stop markets from stealing everyones coins theyd need to collude with a large proportion of vendors individually to steal a significant amount of escrow funds and thats really not a practical scam cheers and happy holidays to everyone angel eyes quote the jigsaw puzzle i also understand your opinion but if you look at the markets out there that offer multisig as an option almost no one uses it incorrect there are current markets in operation including vendor shops as well with of those markets multi sir ready we need to get the market participation rate well over the current mark but at least its a start the markets below all support multi sir transactions acropolis market alphabay market valhalla market east india company outlaw market python market therealdeal market oasis market new also marketplace bloomsfield markethansa is the only market at this stage who chose to implement a multi sig option instead of the more favoured option used by all of the other markets offering mufti sir transactions i have nothing whatsoever against hansa and applaud them for at least incorporating a multi sig escrow system into their market however hansa is the only market at this stage with a system in operation the integration of multi sir transaction into dnms is taking way longer than most of us had hoped or expected it would take it seems as though the ball is now rolling again and the topic of mufti sig escrow is being discussed and debated more than ever on lots of dnm forums quote the fact is that practically speaking it gives the customer no better control using of or of because if the vendor and market choose to collude they can take the coins either way so in your eyes not involving the buyer at all in the process of finalizing the transaction gives them the same control over a transaction where the buyer is holding of the generated keys where of the are needed to release the funds held in crow many factors contribute towards the outcome of a transaction dispute and as an integral part of the transaction a buyer should be included by not including the buyer who exactly is it making it easier for dnm admins exit scamming is a huge problem but theres also the issue of vendors being allowed to pull off some rather large exit scam as well vendors exit scamming can be addressed in many other ways besides the use of multi sig however all parties who have a vested interest in the outcome of each transaction should be involved in it i also realize there are some really ship buyers out there too who are always looking for new ways to scam vendors and get themselves some free drugs so please done think this is a slur against just vendors and market admit staff cause i assure you its not if you want to get buying customers over the hump into the multi sir world lets get them involved in the process in time the benefits of multi sig escrow will be there for all to see but for now promoting and encouraging its use by all in the dnm community is whats needed we dont need to make it any easier than it already is and just like pgp was back in the day the initials take up of multi sir might be a little slow to begin with but over time it will continue to gain traction as more and more people begin to accept it as the new maximum standard and see for themselves just how beneficial and less stressful it really is for everyone involved . quote from
