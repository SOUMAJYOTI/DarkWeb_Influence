silk roads members giving back to a world that disdains they calcium date society doesnt always get along but when it does its bad the majority of todays society has been taught and convinced that drugs and their users are a useless part of our society and should be persecuted with government law and public opinion but what do drug users do that make them receive such a bad reputation and low standing in the publics eye does the reputation gained by a small percentage of drug abusers through doing harm to themselves and others outweigh that gained by users who use drugs wisely and safely to better their lives and lives around them the problem is that the media and government dont like to share the fact that some illegal drugs do help people and keep their research in the dark as much as they can while exploiting the fact that a few weeks ago a man ate his sons eyeballs while high on pcp as members of the drug community we need to do our part to affirm our reputation when it outshines that of the drug abuser we need to spread the news about the good works the drug community commits to and accomplishes and a great example of how drug users are helping society and not holding it back can be found in the prestigious underground market the silk road only days before christmas a silk road member by the name of deathowl posted a new thread on the silk road forums entitled childrens hostile charity thread for those who dont know a childrens hospice is where young people who are not expected to reach adulthood live here the young patient will receive therapy and medicine dwell in a calming environment and be given proper hygienic care what caused this thread to be created by deathowl in the first place was the fact that he wanted to donate at least half of his dollar winnings won on a silk road contest to the facility and wanted to receive his winnings as soon as possible from dread pirate roberts to do so sadly the contest fell through due to issues with the silk road website around christmas time and deathowl not only never received his money but the childrens hospice in germany he wanted to donate to never received its money either for the next days there was banter and various rumors presented on the childrens hospice charity thread about the lost winnings and how deathful s treatment from dpr on the matter was unfair and uncalled for the thread would undergo a dramatic change in its attitude and purpose only a few hours after a notorious retired troll by the name of painless had posted his opinion which was ripe with dread and despair in response to the situation surprisingly to all deathowl posted on his thread that he had received a generous amount of btc from a respected member of the silk road family named cornelius this act of charity was completely cornelius s own idea says deathowl cornelius s part from that point on seems to have struck a spark that ignited the hearts of many other members of silk road to give to the charity one of the first donations to be given after cornelius s was from a member called unfounded his name is not listed specially on the donation roster that displays who donated what amount to the total deathowl made so we will assume he donated to the anonymous btc wallet that deathowl had set up for people who wanted to be unknown or didn want to be embarrassed by meager amounts given even though any amount was looked on with respect the next two people to donate were members painless and charliesheen who collectively donated btc the person to give after them to the childrens hospice charity thread was the well known and loved by all mary whose donation was a nice sum of lithonius was next in line to the donation party giving forth a grand total of btc the next charity act was a group effort that involved the silk road moderators chemcat and v along with calcium and their combined total given was etc topping the last individual donation made by lithonius smokeshisbroccoli put forward btc for the children a member named staind made his contribution soon after and this was a generous sum of btc after these various donations had been made the available funds to give up by the silk road community seemed to dry up a bit so far the donations gathered all together was about btc which is no amount to scoff at a few days later the imputable vendor hiniguel posted a shocking proposition on the childrens hospice charity thread stating he would match the final donation amount and urged the people of silk road to start donating again miss donate after hiniguel had made his explosive offer and she put the money towards the anonymous fund which was slowly growing even after the incentive offered by hinguel was given though the rate of donations once again went into a depression the total donations received was now btc only etc more than two weeks prior to every problem there is a solution and the respected vendor xanax king is back was the childrens hospice charity threads solution the vendor donated a hetty btc pushing the donation pots amount not only past the btc mark but all the way to btc this amount would be added to soon after by the great endor blueskiesredeyes who donated btc finally boxofshapes a hero member donate btc these were the last two donations made when deathowl cut off the fundraising the final amount that had been collected when the charity drive closed was a little under btc that wasnt it though because hiniguel still had a deal to settle with the silk road community hingiuel kept to his word and doubled the donation pot adding the huge amount of btc to it this made the grand total for the childrens hospice charity thread a stellar amount of btc about dollars thus ends the childrens hospice charity thread adventure the events which occurred in this thread reflected many good attributes of the people involved and how they care about one another and others around them everyone who donated and encouraged donation was a drug user and or drug vendor and they shared more benefit to society in their actions than a lot of us have seen from most non drug users so why do we let drug abusers reputations outshine drug users reputations we know that drug users are just as beneficial to society as the drug physic sect of people are and that the world is blind to this knowledge so lets do something about it get involved and spread the news about cures found in illegal drugs how psychedelic experiences changed your life for the better that pot saves cancer patients how led can spare patients from suffering
