potential globe passive adversary such as the combined intelligence agencies of the five eyes countries and assuming you live in one of the five eyes countries would be to vpn to some place like russia and run cover traffic like bittorrent the server you connect to should not be owned or operated by a company headquarters in the five eyes countries or have any employees with citizenship in the five eyes countries you should also set a max bandwidth for your vpon connection so that clicks in the tor browser cant be trivially identified as bursts above the bittorrent bandwidth from there

specific providers on a public forum but you can search around for vpn providers with servers in russia or eastern europe check the contact information and make sure they are actually headquarters in a country outside of five eyes or even western europe a lot of times youl find a provider with russian servers but their contact info is in london or nyc you can also rent a vps and set up your own openvpn server i like to chain vpon connections for example from my computer to a vpn server in my country from that server to another country and finally from that server to a russian eastern european server then i set entrynodes xx where xx is the same country as the last vpn server from there you can run bittorrent or i p and help that anonymity network in the process or bittorrent over
