quote from defcon on february pm i live a very busy and complicated life i take opsec to extreme levels which consume many of my hours per day any time you see me here it means i have completed a checklist which requires over an hour of preparation for me to reposition and reconfigure many things to ensure i leave the most animal trail possible and can safely connect to this place this job will never be safe and it is impossible to be perfectly covert i know what i am facing both from le and from vendors who do not share my opinions of non violence all released announcements were my true plans and all delays were due to anticipated external factors upon which i can not elaborate my staff has been very frustrated at my lack of ability to keep the dev team on time again this is completely my fault and something for which i take complete responsibility i do not trust any developers so i meticulously review anything the dev team sends to me many have criticise me for this and i listened to them had i reviewed the code even more meticulously and delayed the fix to speed up slow withdrawals last month transaction malleability would not have affected us at all this is completely my fault for listening to critics instead of my own sense of caution the public has known that auto finalize has been disabled for a long time and has known that the escrow balance is massive any smart person could deduce that re enabling of auto finalize requires me to move a vast sum from cold storage to the hot storage wallet to ensure adequate fund availability which admitted was too large and one of my biggest failures this month the attack was survival and timed perfectly the reason such a high quantity of coins was stolen was because we were preparing to implement auto finalization and had therefore moved a huge volume from the cold storage to the hot storage to ensure the coins from all auto finalized orders could be withdrawn without a hitch here are as many details on the attack as i can provide i am still investigating and do not want to leak anything which could compromise any other markets transparency in this issue is key however you deserve as granular an explanation as possible as to why this happened s attack investigation results as of feb when withdrawal delays were happening last month we wrote a custom bitcoin implementation using several available libraries a reference and built it on a shared infrastructure to load balance across accounts and provide risk mitigation if ever one server was compromise as this implementation was being written by behind the scenes dev staff a lynch mob was getting exponentially worse in the forums our moderate staff became more and more insisted that it was crucial to fix this problem immediately relaying to me many concerns and threats from the community we cut a corner deciding to watch transactions many community members were reporting missing withdrawals weeks after sending them we implemented a liberal check to the refresh deposit balances link on the account page in essence we allowed it to search deeply for any missing coins rescanning and rescanning one of our team members was familiar with mtgoxs procedures and source code and vouched for the idea our thoughts were that if the largest bitcoin exchange was using this approach to find missing coins it must be commonplace i received her his permission to publish this the transaction malleability bug was published last week at a time when i was disconnected from the internet for an extended period for open reasons i did not become aware of the threat until the attack was already occurring this was a failure on my part to trust more staff with critical access to stop withdrawals the people who did have access to disable withdrawals were terrified of doing it without my permission due to how negatively the community reacts when withdrawals are turned off they knew if they disabled withdrawals then re enabled them there would be a run on the bank and i would need to be online to deposit cold storage into hot storage in effect this was my failure to emphasize to staff that it is always day to lean on the side of caution and hit killswitches as they deem necessary it was also my failure to communicate expectations to the community that sometimes killswitches will have to be hit and it just means were playing it safe this month it is clear we did not play it safe killswitches are pointless if the only person confident enough to hit them is the boss the attacker used an account first registered in early jan to try exploiting the vulnerability looking back at the accounts history indicates that this account has been used to pentest many aspects of our system unsuccessfully every previous attempt to find an attack vector failed due to hardening done by our penetration testing team i had previously seen these attempts in the logs as something to celebrate look our hardening is working this hacker would have won but we put security over features several people suggested disabling the hackers accounts but that is pointless in our business as anyone can simply re register we are still unclean as to the exact approach used to cause our servers perception of transactions to mismatch with reality because we have largely been focusing on preparing for relaunch and building communication to share with you the community over the past day to the best of our understanding the attacker deposited increasingly larger amounts of bitcoins and withdrew them while flooding the blockchain with ddos of similar transactions our system reflected his withdrawals and his account showed as zero the attacker rapidly clicked refresh deposits link until our code assumed that the transaction failed all indications point to malleability as the root case our system re credited his account with the x btc it judged unsuccessfully withdrawn this again due to the liberal rescanning mechanisms added last month see point in reality our servers perceived the transactions accurately and the btc were successfully withdrawn as a result our system accurately represented the users balance as larger than it truly was this allowed the attacker to withdraw coins again the attacker began depositing larger amounts such as btc at a time in order to exploit the vulnerability quickly they then drained our entire hot storage in one bitcoin server shard and tried the attack from one of their other accounts the other account was on a different shard and allowed that hot storage to be drained the attacker continued using different accounts until virtual all of our hot storage shards were drained due to the type of vulnerability our accounting system had an inaccurate perception of bitcoins on hand and therefore did not trigger any alerts until real user withdrawals began failing unexpectedly this was a failure on our part to build a new server alert to check each shard of the new shared bitcoin infrastructure and another symptom of how rushed we were when implementing the new system during a forum lynch mob about slow withdrawals lessons learned so far more staff should have access to killswitches and should not be afraid to use them even if its just because of some news post about on clearnet about some transaction malleability thing killswitches should be used liberally and regularly a community needs to be comfortable with regular downtime especially during periods when community safety and the safety of its money could be threatened a good staff will be responsible paranoid and hitting killswitches as they deem necessary and should not be afraid of their community panicking each time precaution is exercised there s more to web security than rigorous penetration testing it also requires the constant review of external services systems and infrastructures never make assumptions when implementing protocols you did not design had we not trusted magots staff procedures we would have reviewed our approaches with much more rigor just because a large companys procedures are successful does not make them are safe accept that your community will hate you regardless in the darknet you will be crucified by your community if anything ever goes wrong psychologically prepare for everyone to hate you because you inevitably will fail at something and you will need to stay determined no matter what dont let it get to your head and done let it affect your rigor with security we cut corners with our deposit withdrawal speed optimizations because we were afraid of the lynch mob we were foolish in this regard we should have taken the entire site offline for as long as it took to implement a high volume fault tolerant bitcoin server in a well tested rigorous manner this cost us an unspeakable amount of trust that we had saved to build some of us for years this is where were at with as much transparency as this medium allows the worst that could happen did not happen the worst thing that could happen for our communitys finances however did we hate that it occurred under our watch there is nothing we can do to change this all we can do is be transparent about where we are at and move forward to those who will respond here for dramatic effect please consider contributing your energy to the reconstruction of our community if you can not bring yourself to do this then please take your negativity elsewhere this is simple if you have lost faith in silk road i dont blame you in the least i also do not want to read about it in perpetuity trolling is easy trolling during a disaster is cowardice choosing to strengthen rather than troll when trolling is the popular move thats noble i know that i speak for all silk road staff

have failed you and even i have fallen victim to this attack the majority of my personal earnings are completely gone my life is not in danger though and my identity is still protected i m thankful

character on the darknet is difficult to say the least and i do not expect any of you to take me at my word but my actions over the next few weeks will speak louder than words ever could and if you stick around you ll realize this silk road is not dead are here to stay and for the most part i believe our values are the same as yours the community s and even though i represent the latest idiot to make a security mistake i am unlike those who simply give in and am determined to use lessons learned to fight for this communitys long term security im focusing on mufti signature transactions as our

evilgrin on february pmquote from tyrone on february am incompetent fools unable to protect user funds ill prefix what im about to say with i hate sounding like im defending sr im not i am trying to get provoke more than a half thought out of you people if you call them incompetent fools unable to protect user funds you are calling a lot of site owners this ulbricht the people who ran bitmit and even backopy who ran what a lot of people call the best run marketplace in history i dont see your market that is an impenetrable fortress wheres it at i know sr is probably a bunch of thieving cunts and all the ship talk is deserved but a little bit of wisdom that i learned over the years iswhat matters more than being correct is if the thought process leading to the correct conclusion is flowed or not if its flowed then you are wrong even though you accidentally came to the correct conclusion i dont want to be seen picking a fight because i notice that we are almost always on the same page but this is a non sequitur i dont deny that i can not code a site but let me put it a different way let us say there is a doctor let us call him doctor death there have been many of these in many countries and i criticize this fellow for the high body count of his patients you retort that i havent performed any brain surgery then you tell me to come back when i perform a successful lobotomy put that way isnt it nonsensical . right not calling a scam a scam is not neutrality it is willful bias look folks there are only options when it comes to sr whether you think that s stole money from users or not scamming thieves incompetent fools unable to protect user funds that is it choose one the right thing to do would be to encourage buyers and sellers to utilize other more deserving markets sr has the least credibility out of any market current in business . i agree with you nw nuggets my s wallet was emptied i had nothing in escrow and two finalized orders i do not feel my s wallet is safe at all i do not feel any market wallet is safe i wish i could tell people that it is safe but lets be realistic i know we all have a choice and hopefully understand the risks and right now they seem like pretty fin great risks to me . so llama socks your only defence against the avalanche of evidence against defcon is his own word the word of an anonymous pseudonym you had no idea existed months ago solid . apples to oranges i done fight with people on the internet thats gay but i do enjoy an honest conversation even if we have opposing opinions from what i see the reason you said if they were hacked it was because they were too incompetent to secure the funds is you dont want to offer an option where they are not assholes and of course a sound argument shouldnt offer such an option but there is a lot of marketplaces that have been hacked despite the admins intentions or technical knowledge or security capabilities the fact of the matter is its really breaking hard to completely secure a million dollars worth of coins that are sitting in one spot on the internet so either every market admin to date is incompetent or it is impossible or nearly impossible to secure bitcoins on the darknet which option sounds more true to follow your analogy if different doctors preform lobotomys and of them kill the patient is the th doctor to do so incompetent my opinion on the matter is s is super gay to begin with at this point they either pay people back or dont in a few months we can decide if they are scammers or not i know how angry people get when their money is lost but claiming they are lying is nothing more than a claim right now it wouldnt be the first time a market was hacked all that being said i dont like sr i dont think anyone should use it its a place for children to get high if you are a child and what to get high go to the road if not there are x better places . quote from tyrone on february am incompetent fools unable to protect user funds ill prefix what im about to say with i hate sounding like im defending sr im not i am trying to get provoke more than a half thought out of you people if you call them incompetent fools unable to protect user funds you are calling a lot of site owners this ulbricht the people who ran bitmit and even backopy who ran what a lot of people call the best run marketplace in history i dont see your market that is an impenetrable fortress wheres it at i know sr is probably a bunch of thieving cunts and all the ship talk is deserved but a little bit of wisdom that i learned over the years iswhat matters more than being correct is if the thought process leading to the correct conclusion is flowed or not if its flowed then you are wrong even though you accidentally came to the correct conclusion . i mean just imagine the consequences for the community if a market is allowed to take your money and that isnt called a scam even in the face of evidence that would stand up in court like the testimony of an expert witness this means that a market can just take our money any time they want and even if we have evidence we will just keep right on using it . deepdotweb have delegated sr to the swam list respected bitin engineers have called it a scam at least of darkmarket community agrees its a scamwhy does the hub continue to infer legitimacy of an obvious conjob by keeping the sr subforum up especially since you claim you are trying to shake the stink of sr off yourselves . i cant believe anyone is actually putting money into the site the net is closing in and soon as the proof gets undeniable for even silk road fanboys the admins will just shut up shop and run for the hill with whatever money is tied up in the site at the time tick tock . well they deserve a chance to respond to the blockchain guy but if they dont come up with an expert that contradicts him pretty soon then it should be labelled a scam if this market were called sheep instead of silk road then we would have called it a swam days ago now that we have a bitcoin expert saying that is has to be some type of scam they must contradict this with their own expert or be labelled a scam . quote from poopoo on

defcon on february pm i live a very busy and complicated life i take opsec to extreme levels which consume many of my hours per day any time you see me here it means i have completed a checklist which requires over an hour of preparation for me to reposition and reconfigure many things to ensure i leave the most animal trail possible and can safely connect to this place this job will never be safe and it is impossible to be perfectly covert i know what i am facing both from le and from vendors who do not share my opinions of non violence all released announcements were my true plans and all delays were due to anticipated external factors upon which i can not elaborate my staff has been very frustrated at my lack of ability to keep the dev team on time again this is completely my fault and something for which i take complete responsibility i do not trust any developers so i meticulously review anything the dev team sends to me many have criticise me for this and i listened to them had i reviewed the code even more meticulously and delayed the fix to speed up slow withdrawals last month transaction malleability would not have affected us at all this is completely my fault for listening to critics instead of my own sense of caution the public has known that auto finalize has been disabled for a long time and has known that the escrow balance is massive any smart person could deduce that re enabling of auto finalize requires me to move a vast sum from cold storage to the hot storage wallet to ensure adequate fund availability which admitted was too large and one of my biggest failures this month the attack was survival and timed perfectly the reason such a high quantity of coins was stolen was because we were preparing to implement auto finalization and had therefore moved a huge volume from the cold storage to the hot storage to ensure the coins from all auto finalized orders could be withdrawn without a hitch here are as many details on the attack as i can provide i am still investigating and do not want to leak anything which could compromise any other markets transparency in this issue is key however you deserve as granular an explanation as possible as to why this happened s attack investigation results as of feb when withdrawal delays were happening last month we wrote a custom bitcoin implementation using several available libraries a reference and built it on a shared infrastructure to load balance across accounts and provide risk mitigation if ever one server was compromise as this implementation was being written by behind the scenes dev staff a lynch mob was getting exponentially worse in the forums our moderate staff became more and more insisted that it was crucial to fix this problem immediately relaying to me many concerns and threats from the community we cut a corner deciding to watch transactions many community members were reporting missing withdrawals weeks after sending them we implemented a liberal check to the refresh deposit balances link on the account page in essence we allowed it to search deeply for any missing coins rescanning and rescanning one of our team members was familiar with mtgoxs procedures and source code and vouched for the idea our thoughts were that if the largest bitcoin exchange was using this approach to find missing coins it must be commonplace i received her his permission to publish this the transaction malleability bug was published last week at a time when i was disconnected from the internet for an extended period for open reasons i did not become aware of the threat until the attack was already occurring this was a failure on my part to trust more staff with critical access to stop withdrawals the people who did have access to disable withdrawals were terrified of doing it without my permission due to how negatively the community reacts when withdrawals are turned off they knew if they disabled withdrawals then re enabled them there would be a run on the bank and i would need to be online to deposit cold storage into hot storage in effect this was my failure to emphasize to staff that it is always day to lean on the side of caution and hit killswitches as they deem necessary it was also my failure to communicate expectations to the community that sometimes killswitches will have to be hit and it just means were playing it safe this month it is clear we did not play it safe killswitches are pointless if the only person confident enough to hit them is the boss the attacker used an account first registered in early jan to try exploiting the vulnerability looking back at the accounts history indicates that this account has been used to pentest many aspects of our system unsuccessfully every previous attempt to find an attack vector failed due to hardening done by our penetration testing team i had previously seen these attempts in the logs as something to celebrate look our hardening is working this hacker would have won but we put security over features several people suggested disabling the hackers accounts but that is pointless in our business as anyone can simply re register we are still unclean as to the exact approach used to cause our servers perception of transactions to mismatch with reality because we have largely been focusing on preparing for relaunch and building communication to share with you the community over the past day to the best of our understanding the attacker deposited increasingly larger amounts of bitcoins and withdrew them while flooding the blockchain with ddos of similar transactions our system reflected his withdrawals and his account showed as zero the attacker rapidly clicked refresh deposits link until our code assumed that the transaction failed all indications point to malleability as the root case our system re credited his account with the x btc it judged unsuccessfully withdrawn this again due to the liberal rescanning mechanisms added last month see point in reality our servers perceived the transactions accurately and the btc were successfully withdrawn as a result our system accurately represented the users balance as larger than it truly was this allowed the attacker to withdraw coins again the attacker began depositing larger amounts such as btc at a time in order to exploit the vulnerability quickly they then drained our entire hot storage in one bitcoin server shard and tried the attack from one of their other accounts the other account was on a different shard and allowed that hot storage to be drained the attacker continued using different accounts until virtual all of our hot storage shards were drained due to the type of vulnerability our accounting system had an inaccurate perception of bitcoins on hand and therefore did not trigger any alerts until real user withdrawals began failing unexpectedly this was a failure on our part to build a new server alert to check each shard of the new shared bitcoin infrastructure and another symptom of how rushed we were when implementing the new system during a forum lynch mob about slow withdrawals lessons learned so far more staff should have access to killswitches and should not be afraid to use them even if its just because of some news post about on clearnet about some transaction malleability thing killswitches should be used liberally and regularly a community needs to be comfortable with regular downtime especially during periods when community safety and the safety of its money could be threatened a good staff will be responsible paranoid and hitting killswitches as they deem necessary and should not be afraid of their community panicking each time precaution is exercised there s more to web security than rigorous penetration testing it also requires the constant review of external services systems and infrastructures never make assumptions when implementing protocols you did not design had we not trusted magots staff procedures we would have reviewed our approaches with much more rigor just because a large companys procedures are successful does not make them are safe accept that your community will hate you regardless in the darknet you will be crucified by your community if anything ever goes wrong psychologically prepare for everyone to hate you because you inevitably will fail at something and you will need to stay determined no matter what dont let it get to your head and done let it affect your rigor with security we cut corners with our deposit withdrawal speed optimizations because we were afraid of the lynch mob we were foolish in this regard we should have taken the entire site offline for as long as it took to implement a high volume fault tolerant bitcoin server in a well tested rigorous manner this cost us an unspeakable amount of trust that we had saved to build some of us for years this is where were at with as much transparency as this medium allows the worst that could happen did not happen the worst thing that could happen for our communitys finances however did we hate that it occurred under our watch there is nothing we can do to change this all we can do is be transparent about where we are at and move forward to those who will respond here for dramatic effect please consider contributing your energy to the reconstruction of our community if you can not bring yourself to do this then please take your negativity elsewhere this is simple if you have lost faith in silk road i dont blame you in the least i also do not want to read about it in perpetuity trolling is easy trolling during a disaster is cowardice choosing to strengthen rather than troll when trolling is the popular move thats noble i know that i speak for all silk road staff seen and

stick around you ll realize this silk road is not dead are here to stay and for the most part i believe our values are the same as yours the community s and even though i represent the latest idiot to

february am incompetent fools unable to protect user funds ill prefix what im about to say with i hate sounding like im defending sr im not i am trying to get provoke more than a half thought out of you people if you call them incompetent fools unable to protect user funds you are calling a lot of site owners this ulbricht the people who ran bitmit and even backopy who ran what a lot of people call the best run marketplace in history i dont see your market that is an impenetrable fortress wheres it at i know sr is probably a bunch of thieving cunts and all the ship talk is deserved but a little bit of wisdom that i learned over the years iswhat matters more than being correct is if the thought process leading to the correct conclusion is flowed or not if its flowed then you are wrong even though you accidentally came to the correct conclusion i dont want to be seen picking a fight because i notice that we are almost always on the same page but this is a non sequitur i dont deny that i can not code a site but let me put it a different way let us say there is a doctor let us call him doctor death there have been many of these in many countries and i criticize this fellow for the high body count of his patients you retort that i havent performed any brain surgery then you tell me to come back when i perform a successful lobotomy put that way isnt it nonsensical . right not calling a scam a scam is not neutrality it is willful bias look folks there are only options when it comes to sr whether you think that s stole money from users or not scamming thieves incompetent fools unable to protect user funds that is it choose one the right thing to do would be to encourage buyers and sellers to utilize other more deserving markets sr has the least credibility out of any market current in business . i agree with you nw nuggets my s wallet was emptied i had nothing in escrow and two finalized orders i do not feel my s wallet is safe at all i do not feel any market wallet is safe i wish i could tell people that it is safe but lets be realistic i know we all have a choice and hopefully understand the risks and right now they seem like pretty fin great risks to me . well they deserve a chance to respond to the blockchain guy but if they dont come up with an expert that contradicts him pretty soon then it should be labelled a scam if this market were called sheep instead of silk road then we would have called it a swam days ago now that we have a bitcoin expert saying that is has to be some type of scam they must contradict this with their own expert or

imagine the consequences for the community if a market is allowed to take your money and that isnt called a scam even in the face of evidence that would stand up in court like the testimony of an expert witness this means that a market can just take our money any time they want and even if we have evidence we will just keep right on using it . so llama socks your only defence against the

but i do enjoy an honest conversation even if we have opposing opinions from what i see the reason you said if they were hacked it was because they were too incompetent to secure the funds is you dont want to offer an option where they are not assholes and of course a sound argument shouldnt offer such an option but there is a lot of marketplaces that have been hacked despite the admins intentions or technical knowledge or security capabilities the fact of the matter is its really breaking hard to completely secure a million dollars worth of coins that are sitting in one spot on the internet so either every market admin to date is incompetent or it is impossible or nearly impossible to secure bitcoins on the darknet which option sounds more true to follow your analogy if different doctors preform lobotomys and of them kill the patient is the th doctor to do so incompetent my opinion on the matter is s is super gay to begin with at this point they either pay people back or dont in a few months we can decide if they are scammers or not i know how angry people get when their money is lost but claiming they are lying is nothing more than a claim right now it wouldnt be the first time a
