hello guys does anyone ever tried whonix it is an anonymous system for computers like tails some friends who know more than me about computers and operation systems told that it is pretty good so in going to test it today if i have time if someone use it please give me your opinion if you never heard about whonix you can have a look in the official jebusite onion link for the same site me know what you think . ive used whonix from time to time it has a little more of a learning curve than tails does but if your familiar with linux than you shouldnt have any issues with it you will want to
