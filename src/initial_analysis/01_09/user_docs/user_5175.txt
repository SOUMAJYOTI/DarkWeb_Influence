market back in november and gained some popularity since then by implementing multisig and promoting itself mostly on reddit as an exit scam proof market while still enabling regular escrow deposits and having only minor amount of its users using the multisig option as reported by several vendors for now the market is unreachable for the past hours without any word from the admins while some
