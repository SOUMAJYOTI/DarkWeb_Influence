other places of this forum and furthermore how the hell do you manage to interpret be patient and keep trying or connectivity is spotty right now keep trying and get what you need done asap to be

entirely possible that agora is about to run off with all our money sure it is is it also possible they waited for the escrow wallet to hit some predetermined value before cutting and running hell yes it is nonetheless given that time and again they have returned and the fact that withdraws are still being professed live when you can get access i highly doubt it this is not a question wether its possible as its possible with every market out there not offerring some form of or p p transaction in the event of an unforeseen issue in case of a hack or scam but i wonder where in my post did i say they were scamming or planned to my post was clearly to highlight agoras poor opsec and warn people to proceed with caution if at all or why they should avoid it also live withdrawals might not necessarily be a good idea as you then have coins lost to hacks or shady admins claim them stolen through transaction malleability as weve seen with different markets so as much as you might want to twist the topic and sidetrack by blaming the users themselves which is only a part of the larger issue at hand while overlooking agoras lacklustre opsec or by claiming them to not to be scamming which again is not the point of the topic but instead their existing opsec so yes youve still got a long way to go to convince me that youre not a shill and good luck trying . i dont think this is fed

right for all involved when s shutdown i shipped almost k worth of free products when smp was hacked turned scam i shipped around k in free merch when sr and tm started firing ddos cannons at each other i got the fuck out of dodge and decided to start a new as i wanted no part of that bs now we come to the current me i vend on four markets now of those four agora was the rd i signed up with but they are more active than all the rest and generate more business than any other market i participate in no other market current operating has both come back from this many major hurdles with everyones money where it should be and has the level of traffic that agora is handling yes sr and pandora both generate more traffic right now but both of those markets have lost peoples money failed to address major down times and have a more than questionable standing in the darknet sure i have been posting a lot about agora lately but the reason for that is simply there is more going on it the agora forum than other places of this forum and furthermore how the hell do you manage to interpret be patient and keep trying or connectivity is spotty right now keep trying and get what you need done asap to be infallibly supporting any market is it entirely possible that agora is about to run off with all our money sure it is is it also possible they waited for the escrow wallet to hit some predetermined value before cutting and running hell yes it is nonetheless given that time and again they have returned and the fact that withdraws are still being professed live when you can get access i highly doubt it now if you still think im some fucking shill in the pocket of any market i ask you to politely shut your fucking mouth and learn your role . quote from rc every ne on march amquote from checking on march amquote from rc every ne on march pmi just got done looking over the into looks like a wad of fud to me but i call bs on this i read through some your last few posts and you have done nothing besides posting agra praises on every post you make despite all their obvious opsec failures that makes me wonder how much they pay their shills that said i must add i misinterpreted that it was their db that was hacked into whereas a more likely scenario the dictionary attack and them brute forcing usernames is more likely the case which gave them access to vendor accounts from where theyve retrieved user addresses etc and details which were not encrusted first and most important point of failure is why at all was dictionary attack was allowed agra clearly didn take their users accounts seriously with having missed something as simple as a captcha which should have prevented this compromise in the first place their lack of foresight in it shows their open coudnt be any worse also any user who does not use pgp in dnm deserves nothing better in the past weeks their total online time has been down to a few hours collectively and for those who can eventually login and get past the captcha problem dont get anything useful done and get timed out or site unavoidable past that their lack of support and now reports of them deleting such posts on the forum says it all maybe you might want to chime in with what your shall duties are like in be more interested in that now mistake you just made was to insult my integrity good job quoting me out of context and taking my support for a thriving market to mean i must be in their pocket just to let you know its proper english to insert an ellipsis when you decide to omit a part of the original text now on to the real topic you claim i am in agoras pocket you could not be further from the truth you point out their open failures and its true they are not perfect however these failings do not matter as anyone with care for their own opsec would not have to trifle with such insignificant failings i care about by my own integrity more than i care about my life i maintain over pip keys to ensure that my private customers market customers suppliers sensitive data and account information can not be compromise as a batch every time a major market falls that i am doing business on i ship my last orders close up shop on all active markets reinvent myself replace all of my pgp keys and start from scratch again every time i take a financial loss through no fault of my customers or myself

comprised on there as well because he had a similar password dumb fuck prob had the same password but any how hes a weed dealer here in australia i think this is for real just my cents . quote from rc every ne on march pmnow on to the real topic you claim i am in azores pocket no the real topic is the opsec of agora which is apalling and that now endangered and compromise their userbase quote from

start a new as i wanted no part of that bs i dont care what you did as a vendor if any off what you claim is true then kudos to you and thats not the point of my discussion quote from rc every ne on

you manage to interpret be patient and keep trying or connectivity is spotty right now keep trying and get what you need done asap to be infallibly supporting any market precisely my point pushing for a market which clearly doesnt care for its users security doesnt read too well in my book quote from rc every ne on march pmis it entirely possible that agora is about to run off with all our money sure it is is it also possible they waited for the escrow wallet to hit some predetermined value before cutting and running hell yes it is nonetheless given that time and again they have returned and the fact that withdraws are still being professed live when you can get access i highly doubt it this is not a question wether its possible as its possible with every market out there not offerring some form of or p p transaction in the event of an unforeseen issue in case of a hack or scam but i wonder where in my post did i say they were scamming or planned to my post was clearly to highlight agoras poor opsec and warn people to proceed with caution if at all or why they should avoid it also live withdrawals might not necessarily be a good idea as you then have coins lost to hacks or shady admins claim them stolen through transaction malleability as weve seen with different markets so as much as you might want to twist the topic and sidetrack by blaming the users themselves which is only a part of the larger issue at hand while overlooking agoras lacklustre opsec or by claiming them to not to be scamming which again is not the point of the topic but instead their existing opsec so yes youve still got a long way to go to convince me that youre not a shill and good luck trying . quote from rc every ne on march amquote from checking on march amquote from rc every ne on march
