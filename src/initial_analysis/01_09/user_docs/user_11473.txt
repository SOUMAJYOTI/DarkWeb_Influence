smaller marketplaces is that the majority of them hell probably the totality of them either do not have any security at all or their opsec is amateur at best i am sure many behind the projects are well intentioned and are not planning to scam although undoubtedly many others have planned it from the start and are just waiting for the right time but they just dont have the knowledge and

crow markets guys stick with sr you are safe there kill yourself . quote from brahman on february pmi find the modus operandi of agra quite strange to be honest a market that pays its users to spread referrals is a market that is looking to get too big too fast i do not know how they implement this policy of distributing commissions for referrals lucky guy that had his referred link on a random google search i did couple months back but it seems fishy to me the matter of fact is that any market that becomes the main player in the scene also becomes the main target for scams and hacks and so far the only other time sr came down its successor turned out to be a sheep all that spamming in sr forums is way to stinky for my sensitive nose i agree with defcon in one main point do not trust any centralized escrow system in the darkweb at this point i rather use only trusted vendors and deal directly with them having the forums and the community as our main hedge against being slammed but
