backing it up ship sucks start over . greetings you can try this put the card inside of plastic ziplock baggiesput them into a freezer as cold as you can get leave it for hourstake out and immediately try and to see if you can get the card to read chances of it working are maybe but really thats the only way to fix a fixed state drive short of spending a fuckton of money and sending it off to a data recovery center but you dont want them getting access to any of that data . greetings you can try this put the card inside of plastic ziplock baggiesput them into a freezer as cold as you can get

might sound really stupid but have you tried buying a new s card slot adapter into which the micro sd is inserted i only ask because give been in a similar situation where the microsd card could no longer be detected and it was because the sd adapter was damaged these suckers seen to be very frail and vulnerable to defects another problem can a flies read write switch as i noticed merely inserting the s card into the port could result in the switch flicking over to read only instead of using s cards i recommend you use a us flash drive they tend to be far more robust also consider creating several partitions on the card flash drive where you can make backups as defects on the storage device can sometimes be isolate to a single partition . quote from triplecoin on september pmis
