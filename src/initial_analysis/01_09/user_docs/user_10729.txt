in the black hat arsenal capable of delivering thousands of fresh victims into a hackers clutches within minutes now the technique is being adopted by a different kind of a hacker the kind with a badge for the last two years the fbi has been quietly experimenting with drive by hacks as a solution to one of law enforcement s knottiest internet problems how to identify and prosecute users of criminal websites hiding behind the powerful tor anonymity system the approach has borne fruit over a dozen alleged users of tor based child porn sites are now headed for trial as a result but it s also engendering controversy with charges that the justice department has glossed over the bulk hacking technique when describing it to judges while concealing its use from defendants critics also worry about mission creep the weakening of a technology relied on by human rights workers and activists and the potential for innocent parties to wind up infected with government malware because they visited the wrong website this is such a big leap there should have been congressional hearings about this says all technologist chris soghoian an expert on law enforcement s use of hacking tools if congress decides this is a technique that s perfectly appropriate maybe that s ok but let s have an informed debate about it the fbi s use of malware is not new the bureau calls the method an nit for network investigate technique and the fbi has been using it since at least in cases ranging from computer hacking to bomb threats child born to extortion depending on the deployment an nit can be a bulky full featured backdoor program that gives the government access to your files location web history and webcam for a month at a time or a slim fleeting wisp of code that sends the fbi your computer s name and address and then evaporates what s changed is the way the abi uses its malware capability deploying it as a driftnet instead of a fishing line and the shift is a direct response to tor the powerful anonymity system endured by edward snowden and the state department alike tor is free open source software that lets you surf the web anonymously it achieves that by accepting connections from the public internet the clearnet encrypting the traffic and bouncing it through a winding series of computers before dumping it back on the web through any of over exit nodes the system also supports so called hidden services special websites with addresses ending in onion whose physical locations are theoretically untraceable peaceable only over the tor network hidden services are used by organizations that want to evade surveillance or protect users privacy to an extraordinary degree some users of such service have legitimate and even noble purposes including human rights groups and journalists but hidden services are also a mainstay of the nefarious activities carried out on the so called dark net the home of drug markets child born murder for hire and a site that does nothing but stream pirated my little pony episodes law enforcement and intelligence agencies have a love hate relationship with tor they use it themselves but when their targets hide behind the system it poses a serious obstacle last month russia s government offered a bounty for a method to crack tor the fbi debuted its own solution in in an investigation rubbed operation torpedo whose contours are only now becoming visible through court filings operation torpedo began with an investigation in the netherlands in august agents at the national high tech crime unit of the netherlands national police force had decided to crack down on online child porn according to an abi affidavit to that end they wrote a web crawler that scoured the dark net collecting all the tor onion addresses it could find the notch agents systematically visited each of the sites and made a list of those dedicated to child pornography then armed with a search warrant from the court of rotterdam the agents set out to determine where the sites were locked that in theory is a daunting task tor hidden services mask their locations behind layers of routing but when the agents got to a site called pedoboard they discovered that the owner had foolishly left the administration account open with no password they logged in and began poking around eventually finding the server s real internet ip address in believe nebraska they provided the information to the fbi who traced the ip address to year old aaron mcgrath it turned out mcgrath was hosting not one but two child born sites at the server farm where he worked and a third one at home instead of going for the easy bust the abi spent a solid year surveilling mcgrath while working with justice department lawyers on the legal framework for what would become operation torpedo finally on november the feds swooped in on mcgrath seized his servers and spirited them away to an abi office in omaha a federal magistrate signed three separate search warrants one for each of the three hidden services the warrants authorized the fbi to modify the code on the servers to deliver the nit to any computers that accessed the sites the judge also allowed the fbi to delay notification to the targets for days cont . security experts call it a drive by download a hacker infiltrates a high traffic website and then subverts it to
