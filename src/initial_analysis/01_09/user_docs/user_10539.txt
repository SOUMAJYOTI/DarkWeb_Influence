playground good info thanks the more give seen about bitmessage the more i like it it seems they are trying to do the right things to provide a truly private decentralized and anonymous messaging

not know about tor pgp etc . quote from playground on march pmhello siblings until the security audit has been performed it is perhaps a good ideato send any sensitive messages via bitmessage

personally i cant imagine most people using pgp with bitmessage give done it and so have the people ive corresponded with quote from feeble on march pmsomething that just works is what most people want where just works means total anonymity and privacy without doing anything special if bitmessage pans out maybe they will get their wish nor not until then a yawning chasm exists between what they want and what theyre going to get unfortunately for the most part ease of use is antithetical to security in recent years we have seen some sad examples hushmail and haystacks to name just two i suspect that there are a not inconsiderable number of people who have done or are doing hard time due to the fact that they trusted hushmails fatally flowed security model those people paid a very dear price for ease of use quote from feeble on march pmim not speaking for myself im a software developer and have no problem using the current tools but when you try to explain them to normals their eyes glaze over my only response to these people would be a harsh one id tell them to get their heads out of their asses to wake up and smell the coffee there is a word which precisely describes people who refuse to learn how to do things properly they are called prisoners or convicts axolotl . quote from axa on march pmbefore making claims that bitmessage is a resource hog you should download the client and try it out for yourself not true point taken axolotl . axolotl i realize anything new will need to prove itself over time personally i cant imagine most people using pgp with

bitmessage org it looks interesting it uses bitcoin like principles to hide the sender receiver and everyone gets all the messages to make it impossible for anyone watching to tell whats going on in theory bitmessage is too new it sounds good but whether it holds up in the long run remains to be seen use it if you want but if i were you id take a belt and suspenders approach encrypt the underlying messages with pgp if for no other reason than as a precaution quote from feeble on march amyou can send messages to a specific address or to those who subscribe to a sailing list it uses the proof of work concept like bitcoin to help prevent spam is anyone on here using it if so what do you think easier than pip email i havent used the actual client which i understand is a terrible resource hog i have however used the bitmessage to email gateway bitmessage e mail gateway logic security analysis of bitmessage n b i did not write this bitmessage security analysis while the security afforded by bitmessage may be excellent youre still taking a chance with it both parties communicating must use pgp to protect their message traffic axolotlbefore making claims that bitmessage is a resource hog you should download the client and try it out for yourself not true . quote from axolotl on march pmquote from axa on march pmbefore making claims that bitmessage is a resource hog you should download the client and try it out for yourself not true point taken axolotlsince it sends two days worth of all messages in the system to everyone and you need to try to decode each message to see if it is for you you could certainly argue that is horribly inefficient but that is the price for privacy and is a good way to achieve it . axolotl i realize anything new
