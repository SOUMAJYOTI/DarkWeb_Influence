verifies if a given btc address really belongs to an onionshop vendor this site is locked on a different server than os and is not connected to it in any way it is highly unlikely that both onionshop and os btc check server ever get compromise simultaneously especially since os btc check only serves one function hence not much room for hackers to take advantage of we have placed a notice and link to it next to pending orders cheersos . this post should be delete the poll as well onion shop got hacked so did cr and sr and home depot target most major banks health care gov and apple just to name

breath . hope the small user base and the few vendors there did not get hurt too bad darknet is experiencing turbulent times onionshop are you going to reopen or maybe being due to the fact that after months after launch the site is slow where its not worth the effort and possible jail time involved you will shut down operations to the hand full of users on onion stay safe . thx ecc heres our

hack we noticed and shut the site down hours later we moved to a complete new server without data loss changed everything up closed the hole and reopened for vendors another hours later shops have opened with changed policy mpk only which enables us to implement more security checks in hours we release a special website on a different server where customers can enter their assigned btc address and check if it is legit this should make it very unlikely that something like this happens again . thx for caring for the community and staff and asking the real questions here is our official statement btw our database got hacked first off everything is under control for now we know what it caused and have fixed the issue the momentary damage is very low fortunately a hacker has misused the image unload script to inject malicious code into os we had a similar problem a few months ago and have replaced the whole script by another one at the time from which we thought was more secure or secure enough to prevent this happen to be not as bulletproof as we thought the hacker gained access to our database and replaced all btc in the pool he did this very carefully and didn replace those that had a hardcoded extra security check on them thus the orders of swissshop for example werent affected the hacker didnt change the files containing the extra security check or any files so we think that he had only writeaccess to the database and not to the files we noticed very quickly so only orders are affected man farmer and thebestcannabis with a total of about the orders of farmer and tbc are very suspicious though we suspect that one of them or both were placed by the hacker so we will investigate on this and of course repay the stolen funds all shipping information and passwords are encrusted in the database it cant hurt if you change your password anyway though our first reaction was to put the site offline and move everything to a new server we changed up filenames passwords settings ports rascally everything and temporarily removed the imageupload scripts of avatar and items as a consequence we get rid of the btc pool as a whole from now on only electric wallets can be hooked up to onionshop with their mpk we will release a short guide on how to set it up and on what to pay attention before you set it up inexperienced please wait for our guide to make sure it runs through tor with mpks there is no pool that can be altered even if a hacker aquires do access for each order there is a etc address generated on the spot and it narrows down possible vulnerabilities we implement a mechanism that doublechecks if btcaddresses in orders are really from the mpk also we will set up another independent site where users can doublecheck if the shown address is let for now only the vendors area is accessible the main site will remain in maintenance mode for another few hours we are very sorry that this happened and hope we can make it up somehow by handling this worst case scenario as professional and fast as possible if there are any questions please contact us through the messaging system or on the hub os . thx ecc heres our latest
