following this since ho was my main vendor for a long time actually chatted a bit with him from time to time nothing sensitive just shooting the shit and sad to see he was caught top bloke in my book always friendly he was arrested th of december apparently an officer happened to see a suspicious transaction between men where bags were put in cars one of the bags supposed contained kill s of speed a team apparently already had an eye on him for a while and when the police officer reported it dots were connected they raided his house in amsterdam after his arrest and found a ton of drugs kilo of mdma kilo s worth of pills led sheets k our in cash and coins somehow this led them to albertheijn who was a separate person they also found a man who supplied both of them amsterdamunited ah and au are apparently and years old ho is in his s they caught ah and au in march behind their computers coins and some expensive cars were confiscated bit dumb if you ask me if your mate gets caught and you still sit behind your pc with drugs and cash in the house but hey the first appearance in court was st of september according to the public prosecutor not sure what it s called in english ho was one of the biggest vendors on the darknet so they might be going after him hard also got him for money laundering and things like that funnily enough they re also going after him for heroin but i ve never

an account that sold pills only in benelux germany i think something like that perhaps it wasn t ho after all his lawyer is running the defense that the police legally searched the car ho did not give permission for this and the lawyer is saying you can t just search someone s car because it looked suspicious good point i d say but let s not pretend that ll stop the government from getting someone ho asked to be released while he awaits his trial to take care of his ill wife quoting dutch newspapers here but the judge didn t allow it probably thinks he s going to run off with some hidden money
