i posted this at the outlaw market subreddit yet thought it was worthwhile posting here as well give been ordering recreation meds through the dark web for a couple of years now and give probably tried most of the major markets during that time silk road silk road sheep bmr agora and most recently outlaw my experiences have varied wildly overlay my experience with silk road was good and feel dr operated a bone fide market but we all know how that ended up mr sheep sr all ended up being scams ive been using agora a lot recently but lately have had difficulty with getting a response and cant even log in today deja vu the net result is that i lost my escrow funds on my last and final order for each of these markets i kinda figured that this was just a cost of doing business on the dark web and resigned myself to the fact that while a market may appear legit in the end i was always going to lose some btc either through le action or more likely scammer ops i recently got stung by the whole mt gox fiasco which imo was the largest scam of all perpetrated by that fat little frenchman in cahoots with some big crime sydicates but i digress i think outlaw is different although it is a little early to tell for sure theyve been around for a few months and have built a pretty impressive platform im a software engineer in my day job sure the web site design could use some work but the security and functionality of the backend is impressive this took some investment to build and wasnt some quick bitwasp site quickly thrown together for the purposes of running off with users escrow funds its custom software and a solid marketplace platform the other thing that is giving me some good vibes is great customer support i placed my first order with a vendor turtletime i used on another site and got my goods in a few days im based in the us so doing business with a us based vendor cuts out the risk and delays of customs from international vendors there is a dedicated us admin
