going to reference this comic . quote from thedude on march amquote from rounded on march pmi have a character strong password and full disk encryption you need at least to be strong dude while i realize that your intent was to be humorous you nevertheless raise an excellent question even if only by inference just how many characters do you need to be secure the subject of passwords and passphrases has been discussed in considerable detail over the last two decades let me attempt to boil things down as it were one of the most fundamental concepts in information theory is that of order versus randomness in order for a message to be meaningful it must contain some information meaning that it has both structure as well as content for example it is a beautiful day today the sky is blue the birds are singing the above string sentence has structure it has both order and meaning usmgjtins xv ll ozp axmwz utcsb u t jlcm j k eowi a pxov glwin contrast this string has no structure it has neither order nor meaning it is essentially random noise the object of cryptography is to take the first string of characters english sentence and using some method usually based on a mathematical function transform it into something resembling the second random string of characters in order to keep the information out of the hands of authorized persons over the centuries a variety of methods have been devised to accomplish this one of the more common in use today is the cipher a cipher is a method usually based on mathematical principles or functions for transforming data into apparent gibberish some of the most common ciphers in use today in pgp are aes the advanced encryption standard triple des often abbreviated as des cast and idea the strength of ciphers and passphrases are frequently expressed in bits thus we have variants on the aes cipher aes aes and aes where the keys used in these ciphers are bits bits and bits respectively other ciphers used in pgp are also bit idea and cast an exception is des at bits ciphers of bits or more are considered unspeakable by brute force attack here is an interesting note from pgps jon callas describing the difficulty of cracking modern bit ciphers quotemodern cryptographic systems are essentially unspeakable particularly if an adversary is restricted to intercepts we have argued for designed and built systems with bits of security precisely because they are essentially unspeakable it is very easy to underestimate the power of exponentials is a very big number burt kaliski first came up with this characterization and if he had a nickel for every time i tell it he could buy a latte or three imagine a computer that is the size of a grain of sand that can test keys against some encrusted data also imagine that it can test a key in the amount of time it takes light to cross it then consider a cluster of these computers so many that if you covered the earth with them they would cover the whole planet to the height of meter the cluster of computers would crack a bit key on average in years if you want to brute force a key it literally takes a planet ful of computers and of course there are always bit keys if you worry about the possibility that government has a spare planet that they want to devote to key cracking so a passphrase with bits or more of entropy would appear to be ideal now we have to deal with the question of how do we determine how much entropy is in a passphrase of a certain length thankfully the calculations on this are pretty straightforward one of the most frequently misleading assertions about passwords is that they must include special characters this may or may not be necessary depending on the length of the password were discussing as a general rule the strength of a password depends on two factors the length of the password and the search space or the number of characters comprising the set used in the password or passphrase the greater the search space the shorter your password has to be to afford the same security if your password allows only lowercase the search space is if your password allows lower uppercase the search space is i e if your password allows lower uppercase numerals the search space is i e there are special characters that are sometimes permitted in passwords these are if your password allows lower uppercase numerals special characters the search space is i e in situations where we are restricted to short passwords e g characters the use of special characters in addition to uppercase lowercase and numerals is highly recommended due to the short password lengths let me illustrate by some examples the typical automatic teller machine atm allows for a might pin number this gives us a search space of from through although this is acceptable for a atm it would be laughable as a computer password any password cracking software would break this within seconds lets assume that now we are using a system with an character password limitation such systems still exist believe it or not one such is pobox lets see how it stacks up upper or lowercase only x or about billion combinations bits of entry upper lowercase only x or about billion combinations bits of entry upper lowercase numerals x or about billion combinations bits of entry upper lowercase numberals special x or about million billion combinations bits of entropy you can see from the numbers that the addition of special characters increases the complexity considerably but we are still constrained by the much too short password length the major problem wiht the above example torbox is that the allowable password length is simply too short more reasonable systems will allow passwords in the character limit as a little aside you may find it of interest to learn that the feb federal security bureau the russian states successor to the society kgb recommended to their agents that they use a character password on their computers lets do the math shall we characters lowercase only x this works out to bits of entropy or just slightly less than the bits afforded by some of the ciphers in pgp this is times as strong as the des cipher at bits this should be proof positive that you do not have to have mixed case numerics or special characters if the password is long enough lets now look at two more recent examples tormail which had a character password limit and mailtor which has a character limit tormail char limit upper lowercase numerals x which works out to bits of entropy mailtor char limit upper lowercase numerals x which works out to bits of entry both of these are well in excess of the bits that we set as a goal now lets consider the original posters characters chars lowercase only x which works out to bits of entropy chars mixed case x which works out to bits of entropy chars mixed case numerals x which works out to bits of entropy chars mixed case numerals special x which works out to bits of entropy any way you slice it the original posters character password is more than sufficiently strong to thwart a brute force attack as a final note id like to excerpt some information from jon callas presentation on cracking pgp which he made at at the defcon conference note the last reference about hypotheticals per second thats about x or billion password guesses per second also remember that these remarks were made in i think we can assume that the government is considerably better at it by now some years later so to sum up in order to thwart dictionary attacks and or brute forcing passwords have to be random with about bits of entry quotestart hacking the passphrase use some cracker call specialists in this access data etc major governments have their own clusters to do this use psychological modeling based upon browser caches searches of plaintext can generate over hypotheticals per secondzaphod . quote from rounded on april amas for full disk encryption from

imagine a computer that is the size of a grain of sand that can test keys against some encrusted data also imagine that it can test a key in the amount of time it takes light to cross it then consider a cluster of these computers so many that if you covered the earth with them they would cover the whole planet to the height of meter the cluster of computers would crack a bit key on average in years if you want to brute force a key it literally takes a planet ful of computers and of course there are always bit keys if you worry about the possibility that government has a spare planet that they want to devote to key cracking so a passphrase with bits or more of entropy would appear to be ideal now we have to deal with the question of how do we determine how much entropy is in a passphrase of a certain length thankfully the calculations on this are pretty straightforward one of the most frequently misleading assertions about passwords is that they must include special characters this may or may not be necessary depending on the length of the password were discussing as a general rule the strength of a password depends on two factors the length of the password and the search space or the number of characters comprising the set used in the password or passphrase the greater the search space the shorter your password has to be to afford the same security if your password allows only lowercase the search space is if your password allows lower uppercase the search space is i e if your password allows lower uppercase numerals the search space is i e there are special characters that are sometimes permitted in passwords these are if your password allows lower uppercase numerals special characters the search space is i e in situations where we are restricted to short passwords e g characters the use of special characters in addition to uppercase lowercase and numerals is highly recommended due to the short password lengths let me illustrate by some examples the typical automatic teller machine atm allows for a might pin number this gives us a search space of from through although this is acceptable for a atm it would be laughable as a computer password any password cracking software would break this within seconds lets assume that now we are using a system with an character password limitation such systems still exist believe it or not one such is pobox lets see how it stacks up upper or lowercase only x or about billion combinations bits of entry upper lowercase only x or about billion combinations bits of entry upper lowercase numerals x or about billion combinations bits of entry upper lowercase numberals special x or about million billion combinations bits of entropy you can see from the numbers that the addition of special characters increases the complexity considerably but we are still constrained by the much too short password length the major problem wiht the above example torbox is that the allowable password length is simply too short more reasonable systems will allow passwords in the character limit as a little aside you may find it of interest to learn that the feb federal security bureau the russian states successor to the society kgb recommended to their agents that they use a character password on their computers lets do the math shall we characters lowercase only x this works out to bits of entropy or just slightly less than the bits afforded by some of the ciphers in pgp this is times as strong as the des cipher at bits this should be proof positive that you do not have to have mixed case numerics or special characters if the password is long enough lets now look at two more recent examples tormail which had a character password limit and mailtor which has a character limit tormail char limit upper lowercase numerals x which works out to bits of entropy mailtor char limit upper lowercase numerals x which works out to bits of entry both of these are well in excess of the bits that we set as a

thwart a brute force attack as a final note id like to excerpt some information from jon callas presentation on cracking pgp which he made at at the defcon conference note the last reference about hypotheticals per second thats about x or billion password guesses per second also remember that these remarks were made in i think we can assume that the government is considerably better at it by now some years later so to sum up in order to thwart dictionary attacks and or brute forcing passwords have to be random with about bits of entry quotestart hacking the passphrase use some cracker

several encrusted drive seized by brazilian police the brazilian authorities were unable to make any headway on the encrusted drives after months of effort so they enlisted the help of the fbi the fbi
