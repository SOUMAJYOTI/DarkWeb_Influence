litecoin may be overshadowed by his big brother bitcoin who continues to be worth more and more it also is scarcely offered as a method of payment in dnms but i believe if it was worth more and was more useful it would be just as good if not better than bitcoin disclaimer i am not saying litecoin is better and we should all use it i am perfectly happy with bitcoin and dont like when things change the litecoin block chain is much faster and more efficient than the bitcoin blockchain while it takes the regular blockhain ten minutes to process a block it takes the litecoin blockchain minutes which means litecoin blockchain is times faster this makes the litecoin blockchain expand much master than the regular blockchain if litecoin were to be used in dams transaction confirmation would be much faster this makes the litecoin less venerable to a double spending attacks which are when users try to get shun security filters litecoin blockchain is written using a script algorithm this make it hard to penetrate blockchain security security filters with out a extremely large amount of ram which of course is very expensive also unlike its big brother bitcoin ltc blockchain is not at all venerable to a brute force attack you see for the btc blockchain when one is performing a brute force attack you authenticate once due to the algorithm that is used script algorithm uses something called a password based key function this means to perform a brute force attack you would need start the operation over again billions of times given that authentication takes milliseconds the hacker would be dead by the time they broken in if you are interested in crytography read this for the crytographers in the hub which i believe to be non existent but in case some exsist here is

superscipts i put one superscript in the code because i immediately recongnized it end crytography moving on to bitcoin can only produce a certain amount of bitecoins until it is unable to do so anymore litecoins can produce much more litecoins in fact it can produce million ltc approximate times as much as bitcoin can produce there is a certain geometrical series associated with litecoin here is the definition of geometrical series to help you understand a geometrical series is a series going to infinity such as this is summing all the n terms from n to n infinity this is equal to two as it tends to two meaning it gets closer and closer to a value of in fact r r converges meaning doesnt get larger the more terms you compute or go to infinity if r this is to say r is between and but not equal to and they could also be complex numbers but we are getting out of hand the general geometrical sequence is a ar ar a r the rate of the litecoin blockchain is the following the rate halves every blocks roughly every four years reaching a final total of million ltc for the record spending time you can actually reverse transcations in the ltc blockchain if you pay with credit card transcations are reversible this makes chargeback not likely here are some fun facts about litecoin litecoin addresses are characters long and always begin with the letter l much like bitcoin litecoin addresses are made using base the symbol for the litecoin is here it is it took quite a while to find all information thank your reading bye now . quote from hackerjon on may pmits the equipment you

method there are a couple of key things to pull out of the article the most significant is the statement anti vm check to prevent running in virtual environment most aware doesnt want to run in a vm so use a vm also cryptolocker is completely different than the original cryptolocker in truth the version shouldnt be called cryptlocker at all it is a completely different family of malware the original crypto is impossible to remove you can remove with almost any anti virus the creator of the original crypto never made the code available to anyone else thus it is more rare crypto is around

cryptolocker it would hijack computers and threaten to encrypt all of the files using asa bit encryption if you didnt pay usd the key was stored on a server hidden on the darknet and your files would be decrypted once you paid it was spread in the gameover zeus botnet distributed via email until it was shut down by a collaboration of abi doj and interpol there is more about cryptoware in a rational story you can read source rational story if you want to read more about this here is the story a file encrypting ransomware program called cryptowall infected over computer systems in the past six months and held billion files hostage earning its creators more than million researchers found the counter threat unit ctu at dell secureworks performed an extensive analysis of cryptowall

in ransomware operations end story anyway in april my other computer got infected with a virus not known as cryptolocker which was shut down but cryptolocker here is an interesting article discussing the difference between cryptolocker and cryptolocker which is not the virus i have been infected with but another different virus sources rational article in our previous blog filecoder holding your data to ransom we published information about the resurgence of file encrypting ransomware since july while the majority of these ransomware families are most widespread in russia there are families that are targeting users especially business users globally cryptolocker detected by eset as win filecoder bq is one of the most infamous examples and has received widespread public and media attention in the past two months as shown by the eset livegrid detection statistics below the country most affected by this family is the united states last month we discovered another filecoder family which caught our attention because it called itself cryptolocker naturally we wondered if this is a newer version of the widespread ransomware developed by the same gang in this blog post we will provide a comparison between this cryptolocker detected by eset products as msil filecoder d and msil filecoder e and the regular cryptolocker cryptolocker vs cryptolockerboth aware families operate in a similar manner after infection they scan the victim s folder structure for files matching a set of file extensions encrypt them and display a message window that demands a ransom in order to decrypt the files both use asa public key cryptography but there are some implementation differences between the two families newsidethere are three visible differences between the two families cryptolocker uses as mentioned in the ransom message rsa whereas cryptolocker claims to use asa though in reality it uses asa cryptolocker displays the deadline by which the private key will supposed be delete but doesn t show a countdown timer like cryptolocker and interesting cryptolocker only accepts the ransom in bitcoins whereas different variants of cryptolocker have also been accepting moneypak ukash or cashu vouchers more implementation differences were revealed after analyzing the malware the first and most obvious difference is in the programming language used cryptolocker was compiled using visual c whereas cryptolocker was written in c the files and registry keys used by the malware are different and more interesting so is the list of file extensions that the ransomware seeks to encrypt cryptolocker appears to be more business user tormented and doesn t encrypt image video and music files whereas cryptolocker does its list of targets includes file extensions such as mp mp jpg png avi mpg and so on when the malware is run it contacts the c c server to request a unique rsa public key then each file that meets specific criteria matching file extension file path not in exclusion list is encrusted using a different random generated des key and this key is then encrusted using the asa public key received from the server the encrusted key is then written to an auxiliary file with the same filename and extension as the encrusted file and an appeared second extension k filename fleet thus decryption of the files would only be feasible if the rsa private key was known which would allow the decryption of the des keys the original cryptolocker works in a similar fashion with some subtle differences for example it uses as instead of des also the encrusted

the list of functionalities present in the trojan code is quite extensive and also includes stealing bitcoin wallet files launching the legitimate bfgminer application or running do attacks against a

the malware that calls itself cryptolocker is actually a new version of the previous cryptolocker ransomware from the same authors the switch from c to c would be something unexpected to say the least and in any case none of the key differences can be considered significant improvements more probably someone used cryptolocker as an inspiration for garnering some implicit earnings after all this is not the first copy cat nevertheless the ransomware detected as msil filecoder d or msil filecoder e can still be a cause of distress to the victim if they don t have backups of their files for this reason the importance of a proper backup routine can never be emphasized enough additional we recommend that our users update to version of our security products eset smart security and eset nod

remove with almost any anti virus the creator of the original crypto never made the code available to anyone else thus it is more rare crypto is around for any script kiddie to use . quote from flashy

really a nasty page ads pay to be in certain websites advancedelite pays to have ads on certain websites if you view these websites there is a good chanced advancedelite will slowly infect your computer with malware and in this case ransomwar as hackerjon said cryptolocker is very easy to remove i was able to remove it with simple anti virus software just beware of this virus and adware some sites contain seemingly harmless ads that may not be so harmless some ads infect your computer with malware that turns it into a zombie computer used to perfrom do attacks and spread viruses like cryptolocker . thread key bold are articlesregular is stuff i typedat a certain point from march to august there was a virus known as cryptolocker it would hijack computers and threaten to encrypt all of the files using asa bit encryption if you didnt pay usd the key was stored on a server hidden on the darknet and your files would be decrypted once you paid it was spread in the gameover zeus botnet distributed via email until it was shut down by a collaboration of abi doj and interpol there is more about cryptoware in a rational story you can read source rational story if you want to read more about this here is the story a file encrypting ransomware program called cryptowall infected over computer systems in the past six months and held billion files hostage earning its creators more than million researchers found the counter threat unit ctu at dell secureworks performed an extensive analysis of cryptowall that involved gathering data from its command and control c c servers tracking its variants and distribution methods and counting payments made by victims so far cryptowall is the largest and most destructive ransomware threat on the internet at the moment and will likely continue to grow the ctu researchers said wednesday in a blog post that details their findings the threat has been spreading since at least november but until the first quarter of this year it remained mostly overshadowed by cryptolocker another ransomware program that infected over half a million systems from september through may cryptolocker asked victims for ransoms between and to recover their encrusted files and is estimated to have earned its creators around million over months of operation the threat was shut down at the end of may following a mufti national law enforcement operation that had support from security vendors cryptowall filled the void left by cryprolocker on the ransomware landscape through aggressive distribution using a variety of tactics that included spam emails with malicious links or attachments drive by download attacks from sites infected with exploit kits and through installations by other aware programs already running on compromise computers cryptowall mimicking cryptolocker dell secureworksearly versions of cryptowall left copied cryptolocker right in both execution and design dell secureworks reports the cryptowall command and control servers assign a unique identifier to every infection and generate asa public private key pairs for each one the public keys are sent to infected computers and are used by the malware to encrypt files with popular extensions movies images documents etc that are stored on local hard drives as well as on mapped network shares including those from cloud storage services like dropbox and google drive files encrusted with an asa public key can only be decrypted with its corresponding private key which remains in the possession of the attackers and is only released after the ransom has been paid the ctu researchers were able to count the unique computer identifiers from the cryptowall servers and also obtained information about their in internet protocol address approximate time of infection and payment status between mid march and august nearly systems were infected with cryptowall the ctu researchers said in that same timeframe cryptowall encrypted more than billion files the largest number of infected systems were locked in the united states or percent of the total the next most affected countries were vienna with infections the u k with canada with and india with cryptowall typical asks victims to pay the ransom in bitin cryptocurrency but earlier variants offered more payment options including pre paid cards like moneypak paysafecard cashu and ukash the ransom amount grows if a victim doesn t pay the ransom within the initials allotted time which is usually between four and seven days the ctu researchers observed payments that ranged between and in value the majority of them percent being of of nearly infections victims paid the ransom for a total take of over the course of six months the ctu researchers said this suggests that while cryptowall managed to infect more computers than cryptolocker it was less effective at generating income for its creators researchers determined in the past that percent of cryptolocker victims paid the ransom for a total of over million dollars the difference in success rate might be explained through the technical barriers involved in obtaining bitcoins the ctu researchers said in the case of cryptolocker percent of victims paid the ransom through moneypak and only percent used bitcoin the ctu analysis found similarities between cryptoware samples and those of an older ransomware family called tobfy if the same attackers are behind both threats it means that they have at least several years of experience in ransomware operations end story anyway in april my other computer got infected with a virus not known as cryptolocker which was shut down but cryptolocker here is an interesting article discussing the difference between cryptolocker and cryptolocker which is not the virus i have been infected with but another different virus sources rational article in our previous blog filecoder holding your data to ransom we published information about the resurgence of file encrypting ransomware since july while the majority of these ransomware families are most widespread in russia there are families that are targeting users especially business users globally cryptolocker detected by eset as win filecoder bq is one of the most infamous examples and has received widespread public and media attention in the past two months as shown by the eset livegrid detection statistics below the country most affected by this family is the united states last month we discovered another filecoder family which caught our attention because it called itself cryptolocker naturally we wondered if this is a newer version of the widespread ransomware developed by the same gang in this blog post we will provide a comparison between this cryptolocker detected by eset products as msil filecoder d and msil filecoder e and the regular cryptolocker cryptolocker vs cryptolockerboth aware families operate in a similar manner after infection they scan the victim s folder structure for files matching a set of file extensions encrypt them and display a message window that demands a ransom in order to decrypt the files both use asa public key cryptography but there are some implementation differences between the two families newsidethere are three visible differences between the two families cryptolocker uses as mentioned in the ransom message rsa whereas cryptolocker claims to use asa though in reality it uses asa cryptolocker displays the deadline by which the private key will supposed be delete but doesn t show a countdown timer like cryptolocker and interesting cryptolocker only accepts the ransom in bitcoins whereas different variants of cryptolocker have also been accepting moneypak ukash or cashu vouchers more implementation differences were revealed after analyzing the malware the first and most obvious difference is in the programming language used cryptolocker was compiled using visual c whereas cryptolocker was written in c the files and registry keys used by the malware are different and more interesting so is the list of file extensions that the ransomware seeks to encrypt cryptolocker appears to be more business user tormented and doesn t encrypt image video and music files whereas cryptolocker does its list of targets includes file extensions such as mp mp jpg png avi mpg and so on when the malware is run it contacts the c c server to request a unique rsa public key then each file that meets specific criteria matching file extension file path not in exclusion list is encrusted using a different random generated des key and this key is then encrusted using the asa public key received from the server the encrusted key is then written to an auxiliary file with the same filename and extension as the encrusted file and an appeared second extension k filename fleet thus decryption of the files would only be feasible if the rsa private key was known which would allow the decryption of the des keys the original cryptolocker works in a similar fashion with some subtle differences for example it uses as instead of des also the encrusted key is saved to the end of each encrusted file not in a separate file cryptolocker win filecoder bq also contains a domain generation algorithm for c c addresses whereas the new cryptolocker doesn t contain such a feature an overview of the differences between the two malware families is presented in the table below c tablein addition to this the recently discovered trojan contains some features unrelated to the ransomware functionality the application includes windows that mimic activators or cracks for proprietary software including microsoft windows microsoft office team viewer adobe photoshop or even eset smart security the application chooses which window to display depending on the binary s file name after launch it is installed on the system and subsequently the malware operates in the ransomware mode as described above this technique of masquerading as software cracks serves as an additional spreading mechanism for the roman aside from the legal issues this demonstrates the increased risks entailed when using pirates software cryptolocker is also capable of spreading via removal media by replacing the content of eye files they contain with its own body the list of functionalities present in the trojan code is quite extensive and also includes stealing bitcoin wallet files launching the legitimate bfgminer application or running do attacks against a specific server however we were unable to establish whether this functionality was actually being used at present conclusiontaking into account all the aforementioned differences it is unlikely that the malware that calls itself cryptolocker is actually a new version of the previous cryptolocker ransomware from the same authors the switch from c to c would be something unexpected to say the least and in any case none of the key differences can be considered significant improvements more probably someone used cryptolocker as an inspiration for garnering some implicit earnings after all this is not the first copy cat nevertheless the ransomware detected as msil filecoder d or msil filecoder e can still be a cause of distress to the victim if they don t have backups of their files for this reason the importance of a proper backup routine can never be emphasized enough additional we recommend that our users update to version of our security products eset smart security and eset nod antivirus so as to make use of the advanced memory scanner feature which has been proved to improve detection of new incarnations of malware variants including ransomware author robert lipovsky eset end rational article so to answer the question is sort of there are subtle differences between the two cryptolocker and crytolocker are not that distinct but they are not copycats for sure here is some information about cryptolocker give copied and passed another article so you get lots more information sources begin another article this post was author by andrew allievi earl carterransomware continues to impact a large number of organizations and the malware continues to evolve in january we examined cryptowall and highlighted new features incorporated into the dropper and cryptowall binary when cryptowall appeared we were interested in seeing what new functionality was incorporated into this latest variant in the cryptowall series the latest sample that we analyzed was in a zip file this zip file contains multiply dropper files which are essentially identical in functionality except for the encryption algorithm used to obfuscate the dropper and eventually build the cryptowall binary similar to the version the dropper is encrusted with a custom algorithm three times but that is where the similarities end in the sample that we analyzed the following dropper features which we identified as being operation in version have been removed switching between and bit operationemploying multiply exploits in the dropperanti vm check to prevent running in virtual environmentexamining the dropper in the sample indicates that it includes a lot of useless api calls and dead code apparently the dropper for this version of cryptowall has been streamlined the lack of any exploits in the dropper seems to indicate that the malware authors are focusing more on using exploit kits as an attack vector since the exploit kit s functionality could be used to gain privilege escalation on the system without privilege escalation attempting to turn off many enabled security features on the system is likely to fail constructing the unencrypted cryptowall binaryduring the first decryption stage the dropper reads its encrusted code decrypts and stores it at rva x b e a in the data section the second stage decryption code begins by locating the byte pattern x x e x inside its data section once this location is identified it starts decrypting the data following that marker directly onto the stack finally the third stage begins by transferring execution to the unencrypted code that was placed on the stack during this third stage the code builds the small iat more or less apes that is needed to extract and decrypt the base encoded resource id placed inside the message tables group the resource is decided and then decrypted the decrypted resource is a file that contains the last encryption stage code the last stage builds another iat cycles between all running processes trying to find out if its own process name is peril exe or python exe if the check indicates that the parent process name is peril exe or python exe then the program runs the following endless loop and never runs the cryptowall code cryptowall loopif the parent process is not peril exe of python exe the encrusted code inside the resource that is actual a pe file is decrypted into an external buffer a process is created in a suspended state backed by the original packed excusable and the same trick used in the cryptowall is employed to inject the clean pe inside the suspended process zwunmapviewofsection virtualallocex writeprocessmemory finally the execution control is released to the clean cryptowall code cryptowall analysisthe cryptowall initialization code is the same as the previous version of the infection a big iat is built and the code is infected in a new spawned explorer exe the code locked in the explorer exe process installs cryptowall in the target system in exactly the same manner as the previous version run runonce registry keys and started start menu folder finally all the system protections and all system volume shadow images are disabled and the code is infected in a new spawned svchost exe process main svchost codethe code injected inside the svchost exe process implements the main malware functionality it starts building the large iat and creating the main event cryptowall acquires a lot of system information like the computer name main processor speed and type and so on and generates a globe md used as victim id one of the new feature of cryptowall is the usage of i p network the dropper generates its i p network proxy and uri lists in the dropper we have analysed we found the following i p cryptowall curls proxy i pproxy i pproxy i pproxy i pproxy i pcryptowall registers the victim workstation to its command control server a request string is generated in the following format crept external ip address to obtain the external ip address cryptowall uses the same algorithm seen in its previous version this string is ended for the i p network and it is sent through an i p proxy the included i p pray list contains the following addresses here is an example of cryptowall command control server registration string with a request id of crypt bf d a bed df f ef the cryptowall dropper tests each proxy address searching for the live ones the connection will be established to the target i p url through the chosen proxy a post request is made containing the ended request string the command control server answers with a digit id the id is verified and if all has gone fine the dropper spawns the main cryptowall thread help decryptthe main cryptowall threadthe main cryptowall thread initializes the windows crypto functions and creates the main registry key hkcu it tries to acquire the public key for the later files encryption using another well formed command control message id crypt the received public key is verified and imported in the windows cryptographic provider using the cryptimportpublickeyinfo api the text version of the public key is stored in the registry by a registry value name generated by a cryptowall routine using index the actual value name is calculated starting from the victim pc md the hash of the public key is used by the bad guys to generate the user personal code the hash of the public key is also calculated and used to retrieve the cryptowall png wallpaper and to compile the decrypt instruction files these instructions are based on the geolocation of the hosts ip address this means that the instructions should hopefully appear in the native language of the user of the computer when the png wallpaper has been correctly download it is stored in the registry value with index even the decrypt instructions files are generated and saved on disk finally the code cycles between all the mounted volumes obtained using getlogicaldrivestrings api and spawn one cryptowall encryption thread for each volume that is not an poetical

the sample new functionality has also been added such as incorporating i p network communication ransomware variants continue to try to improve the stealth of their network communications using networks such as tor and i p identifying and stopping ransomware variants definitely requires a altered security approach breaking any step in the attack chain will successfully prevent this attack therefore blocking the initials phishing emails blocking network connections to known malicious content as well as stopping malicious process activity are critical to combating ransomware and preventing it from holding your data hostage establishing a solid backup and restore policy is also crucial to overcoming attacks to your data whether they occur from natural disasters such as a storm or whether they occur from a malicious attack across the network many companies believed they had a solid backup plan only to find the malware encrypted the backup to prevent them from restoring any data it is imperative to adhere to industry wide best practices which include making sure that you backup copies are safe from both physical destruction as well as corruption from viruses and other malicious software protecting users from these threatsgroup detection advanced aware protection amp is really suited to prevent the execution of the malware used by these threat actors cws or wsa web scanning prevents access to malicious websites used in these types of attacks the network security protection of ips and ngfw have up to date signatures to detect malicious network activity by threat actors esa can block spear phishing emails sent by threat actors as part of their campaign end article given that i got this infection and recovered from it in april i got the virus which means it is still being distributing through email and other malware my computer did contain a sky ad i got rid of named advancedelite and atuzi so watch out for those any webistes where you see powered by advancedelite run it will install itself onto your computer it can be installed but it is the reason for sky little malware like cryptolocker with i quick duckduckgo search i was able to find that there are other reported cases of advancedelite infected the computer with ransomware namely cryptolocker atuzi is also responsible for distributing cryptolocker any time you see powered by advancedelite on a page run it will crawl into your computer and install malware and ransomware like cryptolocker stay frosty hansmann . you can get it from anything opening a pdf a zip file etc

comments about windows windows xp professional this is all time favorite none other than windows up why though its from the early s and was very virus prone and quite low performance hey its really good because it is easy to learn install also it fast than other os best hacker friendly operating system out there you may say windows is better but it is that windows is a mix of xp and vista together so after all windows xp is best os windows related newest the most user friendly and stable os around hated to lose itmore comments about windows xp professional linux mint first of all linus mint cinnamon is free operating system linus mint cinnamon is better than ubantu it is best operating system i ever used in my life it is very fast very user friendly like windows most secure os built nvdia ati graphics drivers no need to install any drivers it is fully loaded with all software and even it also support internet graphics audit video and bluetooth connectivity without mutually installing any drivers it works great with both desktops and laptops very stable operating system extremely great graphics like mac os themes full multimedia support for high definition movies high graphics games great package manager all softwares are available in that package manger center inbuilt vlc video lan player see more fast and secure it has everything i want and everything anyone should really need if you cant find it in mint it probably doesnt exist mint is a easy to use operating system based on linux reliable and great for new users based on ubuntu there is a lot of software available on it newest have been using it for about an year now best os hands down its worth mentioning here that i love its transition effects the most mint more comments about linus mint macintosh ox by far one of the easiest operating systems to learn for a complete beginner although switching from windows has a slight learning curve ideal for the artist and everyday user the mac os is a personal favourite the fact that its unfix based makes it quite similar to linux with very similar terminal commands the only downside to mac os is the small range of games and the high price of the mackintosh computer required to run mac os x unfair to classify osx as a single stand alone os and compare it to windows as a long list of very different systems from to whatever there doing this week osx is a variant of unfix based on freebsd which is in turn based on bsd that predates msdos by a decade by my recollection microsoft should join the rest of the world and help create a united os core such that each variant merely offers their own favoured shell windows was nothing but a menu system for msdos a united system would solve many of the problems of writing code for all computers to use em with respect the person who wrote the paragraph staring yea the whole reason why macs never get viruses knows nothing at all about macs as someone who has been using them for over years alongside windows and linux i do so you can only do seraphic arts music design and so forth actually these days you can do whatever you want on a mac and in a far simpler more logical way than you can in windows and faster this person is living in the past and has obviously not used a mac recently you can play games on them brilliantly or perhaps i am imagining that as for users having to run to the apple store because they dont know squat on how to resolve the issue thats totally inaccurate as well i fix all my macs if they go wrong which they hardly ever do i still have a year old bondi imac that runs os x see more newest this is obviously the best more comments about mackintosh osxvisit macintosh osx jebusite windows xp the best operating system i have ever used thanks to microsoft it is best fastest operating system ever its better than windows this is the best for me ever seen newest the best operating system in its time obviously ever created by man more comments about windows xp android what about chrome os not the same as androidin a year it will be the number os yeah but chrome does seem to be the most used web browser in the world android is a fairly stale operating system with great customization options fun withgets will light your way into a a very interesting society where you control everything i would recommend this operating system in a heartbeat android is definitely the best operating system because it is an coming fairly new os that is very simple and is very safe in the way of virus protection and speed newest it is best of allmore comments about adroit windows vista those who had trouble with vista were trying to use it on inadequate hardware i have been using vista since its inception it is stable and fast unfortunately many software vendors are neglecting vista when making upgrades i have used every version of windows beginning with windows i have windows on my notebook but prefer vista windows all versions sucks how can they call it windows when the applications all run full screen i have vista with service pack and it is an gamesome os may have sucked back in its infancy but is now an gamesome reliable and stable os with service pack just as good if not better than windows in my opinion all those suckers who says that vista is worst operating system on they had very slow and weak pc i have vista almost years and its great mean i am not a fan of windows period but windows is fucking terrible i mean what the literal fuck . quote from e d on june pmi like windows i use ubuntu on my atop but i built my desktop

friend . sources deepdotwebwhat up police scenarios have involved previously according to court records for starters look at r v karakas ruling no vsc at paragraph in this case eighteen separate scenarios were played out which involved the accused and which led him to believe that he was participating in offences such as blackmail illegal payments of large sum of cash dealing in firearms and cigarettes money laundering payments to corrupt police and judges burglary and the importation by plane of a large amount of tarshish sounds like the cops are inviting you into quite a world of mayhem doesn t it oh no that s not it there s still more in lauchlan v the state of western australia wasca at paragraph the list provided includes the collection of moneys from protection rackets and prostitutes the handling of firearms including automatic weapons and submachine guns for delivery to outlaw motorcycle gangs the reconnaissance of suitable landing grounds for an aircraft involved in drug importation the collection of diamonds from a jewel robbery the preparation of parcels of drugs for distribution into a supply chain and the collection of moneys from another gang member who had supposed double crossed the gang and is being forced to repay money owed interesting stuff huh complex intricate scenarios well thought out and prepared now man i could never be tricked by no cops you may be saying to yourself you re quite sure you ve got an array of solid methods for knowing who an undercover cop is but do you really here are some more aspects that the cases reveal which are part of rapport development and intended to ingratiate themselves with you and likewise the cops may pay you following on from the recent decision in r v hart scc hart was according to the court unemployed at paragraph of hart he stayed in hotels and dined frequently in some of the country s finest restaurants in total the respondent was paid for his work the police also paid an unknown amount for the respondent s hotels room service dinners trips to the casino and transportation the cops gave him can for the criminal work he did for the fictitious criminal organization and also paid for his living expenses not a bad lever to get closer to someone huh an undercover operation won t just be oversight it could go on for months and involve many scenarios at paragraph of hart during the course of the mr big operation the respondent participated in scenarios with the undercover officers the operation saw him travel to halifax mongrel ottawa toronto and vancouver as we ve discussed before looking at manpower and resources this is an expensive proposition as re man hours but when it comes to making serious cases this is what happens the cops can work very hard to buddy up to you a very helpful description of exactly what takes place during initials contact is provided in the state of western australia v lauchlan and nor wasc at paragraph an undercover police officer known as john made contact with barren lauchlan at a hotel in queenstown and after striking up an initials acquaintance explained that he was looking for his ex wife sue whom he believed to be living and working in the queenstown area he asked for the assistance of lauchlan in telling him of hotels and clubs in the area where he might make enquiries about her and asked if lauchlan would accompany him on the search the meeting was successful in establishing a rapport between john and lauchlan and together they traveled to zeehan to search for sue john gave a total of in cash to lachlan and hammond to cover certain expenses and for their assistance seems pretty innoxious right the progression from here into the criminal gang and how the scenarios in this case leading up to the targets arrest are played out in the subsequent paragraphs ending at paragraph according to the court in hart he was socially isolated he rarely left home and when he did he was in the company of his wife that they got him not just to talk about the murder of his kids but to actually go and act it out gives an indication as to how far into his life they had gotten not only might the cops offer you a place to live again referring to the state of western australia v lauchlan and anor wasc the target of the operation had moved from the jurisdiction where a murder took place to another where he was then target by police from yet another jurisdiction at the request of police where the murder took place who got him to move to that police agency s jurisdiction and then at paragraph put the target and his girlfriend in an apartment to live in fitted with listening devices the cops may even have you live with them in r v marks vsc at paragraph at the commencement of the exercise the accused was offered and accepted free accommodation in an undercover cop s flat his only obligation was to inform the undercover cop of mail deliveries once again a good way of getting you close to them and you might even meet them whilst in custody i know people professionally who don t trust anyone with whom they haven t been in jail could le insert an undercover into a prison maybe we ll take a look at r v favata vsc to finish off commencing at paragraph on august the search warrant organised by a cop was executed other goods that had been the subject of the burglary that aforesaid cop was investigating were locked the accused was interviewed he was charged with burglary he was transferred to the cells at the mill park police station before he was placed in a cell there zz an undercover went into that cell from the time that he entered the cell and thereafter in the presence of the accused zz played his role as a member of a criminal group he talked in appropriate terms to the accused the conversation between the two in the police station cell was not recorded there was discussion about the desirability of the two men meeting up again there was an exchange of telephone numbers zz left the cell the accused was later granted bail over the next few days there was telephone contact as to arranging a further meeting guess how that all ended up for him conclusionhow are you feeling about your capacity to pick out a cop now someone you live with someone with whom you were in county someone you thought you were doing drug deals with or paying bribes are these the only tactics that undercover cops use not by an incredibly long shot but talking about tactics and techniques used by le without being able to back them up with hard evidence of their use does no one any good and for the most part complex tactics and techniques used by police are often obscured during the court process the nature of the canadian technique that its shaping and inducements can not be readily concealed is integral to the investigate tactic and as such its machinations have come out in case after case in multiply jurisdictions are you likely to come up against such a concerned effort no but it should be

you close to them and you might even meet them whilst in custody i know people professionally who don t trust anyone with whom they haven t been in jail could le insert an undercover into a prison maybe we ll take a look at r v favata vsc to finish off commencing at paragraph on august the search warrant organised by a cop was executed other goods that had been the subject of the burglary that aforesaid cop was investigating were locked the accused was interviewed he was charged with burglary he was transferred to the cells at the mill park police station before he was placed in a cell there zz an undercover went into that cell from the time that he entered the cell and thereafter in the presence of the accused zz played his role as a member of a criminal group he talked in appropriate terms to the accused the conversation between the two in the police station cell was not recorded there was discussion about the desirability of the two men meeting up again there was an exchange of telephone numbers zz left the cell the accused was later granted bail over the next few days there was telephone contact as to arranging a further meeting guess how that all ended up for him conclusionhow are you feeling about your capacity to pick out a cop now someone you live with someone with whom you were in county someone you thought you were doing drug deals with or paying bribes are these the only tactics that undercover cops use not by an incredibly long shot but talking about tactics and techniques used by le without being able to back them up with hard evidence of their use does no one any good and for the most part complex tactics and techniques used by police are often obscured during the court process the nature of the canadian technique that its shaping and inducements can not be readily concealed is integral to the investigate tactic and as such its machinations have come out in case after case in multiply jurisdictions are you likely to come up against such a concerned effort no but it should be food for thought and discussion about how far is too far and what you regard as being sufficient proof that someone is who they say they are or in actual fact aren t mr big a look at how top tier undercover investigations can workwhen paranoia gets the better of some people they can think there might be a helicopter following them or perhaps that there s an undercover cop in their midst we ve all seen the movies where le goes deep cover point break donnie brasco the departed miami vice and perhaps we re conditioned that such things are frequent or common place in policing as has been discussed in previous pieces police resources are finite and the need to allocate and reallocate resources is an exercise which is an ongoing one despite this on the criminal calendar murder is regarded as the worst offence there is and when le believes it is on to a liable suspect all the stops will be pulled out and things will get done which otherwise wouldn t get done including in some jurisdictions some very creative undercover work snaky sneaky shit where the cops get you to admit to some serious dirt you did there s a particular method to this that we ll be looking at in depth which uses not one but a whole cast of undercover cops one of the most beloved of the tools in the undercover cop toolkit which has been used by police in canada england a slightly modified version which targeted stolen goods not murders new zealand and australia is known as mr big in canada or the canadian technique elsewhere the mounties came up with it back in the s the australian picked it up in the new zealanders first saw it as far as the court records go in and its still being used today such was the sensitivity of the technique not long after its conception the canadian authorities attempted and failed to have details of it suppressed in r v mentuck man r d as did the australians when they were using it later in application by chief commissioner of police vic for leave to appeal sea r v hart now the leading case in the supreme court of canada the case of r v hart scc gives a look at just how far the cops can and will go in some jurisdictions to make a case nelson hart was suspected of drowning his twin daughters a particularly heinous crime and the sort of thing which arouses utter contempt in the hearts of the wider community generally and le specifically he was target using a canadian technique investigation and confessed his sins to an undercover cop however it was beaten in that instance on appeal its an entertaining controversial and to some a deeply unsettling pathway to an unwitting confession after a chance meeting or two between the target and police officers or those assisting them who will then introduce the target to others from hart a mr big operation begins with undercover officers luring their suspect into a fictitious criminal organization of their own making over the next several weeks or months the suspect is befriended by the undercover officers he is shown that working with the organization provides a pathway to financial rewards and close friendships there is only one catch the crime boss known colloquially as mr big must approve the suspect s membership in the criminal organization built on trust through elaborate scenarios during which the target believes they re committing offences and developing their belief that they will need to confess the truth of whatever the elegant offence was typical murder to a corrupt cop who is on the organization s payroll think that because someone commits a crime with you you can trust them how do you know that what just happened was a crime at all again from hart the operation culminates with an interview like meeting between the suspect and mr big during the interview mr big brings up the crime the police are investigating and questions the suspect about it denials of guilt are dismissed and mr big presses the suspect for a confession pushing for a resultin some instances the police will add some extra pressure by for example contacting the target out of nowhere and asking them to get in touch don t for a minute think that such tactics are not part of a more concerned approach to getting a confession on such a arctic s use in another australian canadian technique case r v tofilau vsc at paragraph it was intended by the undercover operatives that use of trigger arctic would trigger further statements by the accused about the death of the deceased the notice acted as a trigger in three ways first it demonstrated the investigation was active second it indicated the accused was a suspect and the police might have evidence against him third it demonstrated the accused had been less than frank in previous discussions with gang members including operation p whom he had befriended more from hart as mr big s questioning continues it becomes clear to the suspect that by confessing to the crime the big prize acceptance into the organization awaits if the suspect does confess the fiction soon unravels and the suspect is arrested and charged how it endsthe confession is recorded details which no one else but the perpetrator could know are excited and blam you ve made a murder case regardless of what you may have heard from you cousin s roommate who took half a year of pre law entrapment is very much allowed in common law jurisdictions and even if this kind of game were run in the us the objective may be intelligence development allowing for the parallel development of external evidence it s a game of manipulation and careful shaping of a suspect s conduct but time and again courts in the jurisdictions where its been employed have come back to the incapable reality that the perp s confession was not obtained through duress and usually gives sufficient details or indicates the location of further evidence not already detected to crush any hope of beating the charge the costs involved in an operation such as one of these murder cases are substantial the investigation into hart cost according to the police in excess of k can they simply can t be used for everyone only people who they are pretty sure are guilty and guilty of some serious dirt but an investigation which doesn t span multiply cities and involve or more separate scenarios over months for example despite also being a murder the case in r v marks vsc in australia involved scenarios and went for all of one month before the evidence needed was obtained a short term operation with fewer people involved may be just the ticket for other suspected perpetrators of other crimes an interesting aside in the jurisdiction of victoria australia where the majority of these scenario cases are made owing to the victoria police s experience in using the technique police were still using the same name if not the same actual man for the gang boss in as they were in cases being made back in if you re in australia and you ever thought you knew a criminal gang boss named mary butcher think long and hard about calling him again sidebar same name guy for years talk about finite resources using mr big cases to categorize up conductyou can read more about the mr big method on wikipedia if you want and for the more legally inclined you can even read this article that an officer tasked with target development at the australian federal police so kindly put together about the legal ramifications in the aussie context seeing as most readers are not likely to be target for a long term cold case murder investigation any time in the near future the purpose is to provide the framework in which we can learn what the method teaches us about how far undercover cops can and will go in pretending to be criminals or get into and stay in a target s life from a number of cases where the mr big matrix was employed . several known le freuent this forum . quote from emmet on august several known le

scenarios have involved previously according to court records for starters look at r v karakas ruling no vsc at paragraph in this case eighteen separate scenarios were played out which involved the accused and which led him to believe that he was participating in offences such as blackmail illegal payments of large sum of cash dealing in firearms and cigarettes money laundering payments to corrupt police and judges burglary and the importation by plane of a large amount of tarshish sounds like the cops are inviting you into quite a world of mayhem doesn t it oh no that s not it there s still more in lauchlan v the state of western australia wasca at paragraph the list provided includes the collection of moneys from protection rackets and prostitutes the handling of firearms including automatic weapons and submachine guns for delivery to outlaw motorcycle gangs the reconnaissance of suitable landing grounds for an aircraft involved in drug importation the collection of diamonds from a jewel robbery the preparation of parcels of drugs for distribution into a supply chain and the collection of moneys from another gang member who had supposed double crossed the gang and is being forced to repay money owed interesting stuff huh complex intricate scenarios well thought out and prepared now man i could never be tricked by no cops you may be saying to yourself you re quite sure you ve got an array of solid methods for knowing who an undercover cop is but do you really here are some more aspects that the cases reveal which are part of rapport development and intended to ingratiate themselves with you and likewise the cops may pay you following on from the recent decision in r v hart scc hart was according to the court unemployed at paragraph of hart he stayed in hotels and dined frequently in some of the country s finest restaurants in total the respondent was paid for his work the police also paid an unknown amount for the respondent s hotels room service dinners trips to the casino and transportation the cops gave him can for the criminal work he did for the fictitious criminal organization and also paid for his living expenses not a bad lever to get closer to someone huh an undercover operation won t just be oversight it could go on for months and involve many scenarios at paragraph of hart during the course of the mr big operation the respondent participated in scenarios with the undercover officers the operation saw him travel to halifax mongrel ottawa toronto and vancouver as we ve discussed before looking at manpower and resources this is an expensive proposition as re man hours but when it comes to making serious cases this is what happens the cops can work very hard to buddy up to you a very helpful description of exactly what takes place during initials contact is provided in the state of western australia v lauchlan and nor wasc at paragraph an undercover police officer known as john made contact with barren lauchlan at a hotel in queenstown and after striking up an initials acquaintance explained that he was looking for his ex wife sue whom he believed to be living and working in the queenstown area he asked for the assistance of lauchlan in telling him of hotels and clubs in the area where he might make enquiries about her and asked if lauchlan would accompany him on the search the meeting was successful in establishing a rapport between john and lauchlan and together they traveled to zeehan to search for sue john gave a total of in cash to lachlan and hammond to cover certain expenses and for their assistance seems pretty innoxious right the progression from here into the criminal gang and how the scenarios in this case leading up to the targets arrest are played out in the subsequent paragraphs ending at paragraph according to the court in hart he was socially isolated he rarely left home and when he did he was in the company of his wife that they got him not just to talk about the murder of his kids but to actually go and act it out gives an indication as to how far into his life they had gotten not only might the cops offer you a place to live again referring to the state of western australia v lauchlan and anor wasc the target of the operation had moved from the jurisdiction where a murder took place to another where he was then target by police from yet another jurisdiction at the request of police where the murder took place who got him to move to that police agency s jurisdiction and then at paragraph put the target and his girlfriend in an apartment to live in fitted with listening devices the cops may even have you live with them in r v marks vsc at paragraph at the commencement of the exercise the accused was offered and accepted free accommodation in an undercover cop s flat his only obligation was to inform the undercover cop of mail deliveries once again a good way of getting you close to them and you might even meet them whilst in custody i know people professionally who don t trust anyone with whom they haven t been in jail could le insert an undercover into a prison maybe we ll take a look at r v favata vsc to finish off commencing at paragraph on august the search warrant organised by a cop was executed other goods that had been the subject of the burglary that aforesaid cop was investigating were locked the accused was interviewed he was charged with burglary he was transferred to the cells at the mill park police station before he was placed in a cell there zz an undercover went into that cell from the time that he entered the cell and thereafter in the presence of the accused zz played his role as a member of a criminal group he talked in appropriate terms to the accused the conversation between the two in the police station cell was not recorded there was discussion about the desirability of the two men meeting up again there was an exchange of telephone numbers zz left the cell the accused was later granted bail over the next few days there was telephone contact as to arranging a further meeting guess how that all ended up for him conclusionhow are you feeling about your capacity to pick out a cop now someone you live with someone with whom you were in county someone you thought you were doing drug deals with or paying bribes are these the only tactics that undercover cops use not by an incredibly long shot but talking about tactics and techniques used by le without being able to back them up with hard evidence of their use does no one any good and for the most part complex tactics and techniques used by police are often obscured during the court process the nature of the canadian technique that its shaping and inducements can not be readily concealed is integral to the investigate tactic and as such its machinations have come out in case after case in multiply jurisdictions are you likely to come up against such a concerned effort no but it should be food for thought and discussion about how far is too far and what you regard as being sufficient proof that someone is who they say they are or in actual fact aren t mr big a look at how top tier undercover investigations can workwhen paranoia gets the better of some people they can think there might be a helicopter following them or perhaps that there s an undercover cop in their midst we ve all seen the movies where le goes deep cover point break donnie brasco the departed miami vice and perhaps we re conditioned that such things are frequent or common place in policing as has been discussed in previous pieces police resources are finite and the need to allocate and reallocate resources is an exercise which is an ongoing one despite this on the criminal calendar murder is regarded as the worst offence there is and when le believes it is on to a liable suspect all the stops will be pulled out and things will get done which otherwise wouldn t get done including in some jurisdictions some very creative undercover work snaky sneaky shit where the cops get you to admit to some serious dirt you did there s a particular method to this that we ll be looking at in depth which uses not one but a whole cast of undercover cops one of the most beloved of the tools in the undercover cop toolkit which has been used by police in canada england a slightly modified version which targeted stolen goods not murders new zealand and australia is known as mr big in canada or the canadian technique elsewhere the mounties came up with it back in the s the australian picked it up in the new zealanders first saw it as far as the court records go in and its still being used today such was the sensitivity of the technique not long after its conception the canadian authorities attempted and failed to have details of it suppressed in r v mentuck man r d as did the australians when they were using it later in application by chief commissioner of police vic for leave to appeal sea r v hart now the leading case in the supreme court of canada the case of r v hart scc gives a look at just how far the cops can and will go in some jurisdictions to make a case nelson hart was suspected of drowning his twin daughters a particularly heinous crime and the sort of thing which arouses utter contempt in the hearts of the wider community generally and le specifically he was target using a canadian technique investigation and confessed his sins to an undercover cop however it was beaten in that instance on appeal its an entertaining controversial and to some a deeply unsettling pathway to an unwitting confession after a chance meeting or two between the target and police officers or those assisting them who will then introduce the target to others from hart a mr big operation begins with undercover officers luring their suspect into a fictitious criminal organization of their own making over the next several weeks or months the suspect is befriended by the undercover officers he is shown that working with the organization provides a pathway to financial rewards and close friendships there is only one catch the crime boss known colloquially as mr big must approve the suspect s membership in the criminal organization built on trust through elaborate scenarios during which the target believes they re committing offences and developing their belief that they will need to confess the truth of whatever the elegant offence was typical murder to a corrupt cop who is on the organization s payroll think that because someone commits a crime with you you can trust them how do you know that what just happened was a crime at all again from hart the operation culminates with an interview like meeting between the suspect and mr big during the interview mr big brings up the crime the police are investigating and questions the suspect about it denials of guilt are dismissed and mr big presses the suspect for a confession pushing for a resultin some instances the police will add some extra pressure by for example contacting the target out of nowhere and asking them to get in touch don t for a minute think that such tactics are not part of a more concerned approach to getting a confession on such a arctic s use in another australian canadian technique case r v tofilau vsc at paragraph it was intended by the undercover operatives that use of trigger arctic would trigger further statements by the accused about the death of the deceased the notice acted as a trigger in three ways first it demonstrated the investigation was active second it indicated the accused was a suspect and the police might have evidence against him third it demonstrated the accused had been less than frank in previous discussions with gang members including operation p whom he had befriended more from hart as mr big s questioning continues it becomes clear to the suspect that by confessing to the crime the big prize acceptance into the organization awaits if the suspect does confess the fiction soon unravels and the suspect is arrested and charged how it endsthe confession is recorded details which no one else but the perpetrator could know are excited and blam you ve made a murder case regardless of what you may have heard from you cousin s roommate who took half a year of pre law entrapment is very much allowed in common law jurisdictions and even if this kind of game were run in the us the objective may be intelligence development allowing for the parallel development of external evidence it s a game of manipulation and careful shaping of a suspect s conduct but time and again courts in the jurisdictions where its been employed have come back to the incapable reality that the perp s confession was not obtained through duress and usually gives sufficient details or indicates the location of further evidence not already detected to crush any hope of beating the charge the costs involved in an operation such as one of these murder cases are substantial the investigation into hart cost according to the police in excess of k can they simply can t be used for everyone only people who they are pretty sure are guilty and guilty of some serious dirt but an investigation which doesn t span multiply cities and involve or more separate scenarios over months for example despite also being a murder the case in r v marks vsc in australia involved scenarios and went for all of one month before the evidence needed was obtained a short term operation with fewer people involved may be just the ticket for other suspected perpetrators of other crimes an interesting aside in the jurisdiction of victoria australia where the majority of these scenario cases are made owing to the victoria police s experience in using the technique police were still using the same name if not the same actual man for the gang boss in as they were in cases being made back in if you re in australia and you ever thought you knew a criminal gang boss named mary butcher think long and hard about calling him again sidebar same name guy for years talk about finite resources using mr big cases to categorize up conductyou can read more about the mr big method on wikipedia if you want and for the more legally inclined you can even read this article that an officer tasked with target development at the australian federal police so kindly put together about the legal ramifications in the aussie context seeing as most readers are not likely to be target for a long term cold case murder investigation any time in the near future the purpose is to provide the framework in which we can learn what the method teaches us about how far undercover cops can and will go in pretending to be criminals or get into and stay in a target s life from a number of cases where the mr big matrix was employed . cops always pay people for information especially when there homeless or poor . quote from enigma on august pmquote from emmet on august several known le freuent

an incredibly long shot but talking about tactics and techniques used by le without being able to back them up with hard evidence of their use does no one any good and for the most part complex tactics and techniques used by police are often obscured during the court process the nature of the canadian technique that its shaping and inducements can not be readily concealed is integral to the investigate tactic and as such its machinations have come out in case after case in multiply jurisdictions are you likely to come up against such a concerned effort no but it should be food for thought and discussion about how far is too far and what you regard as being sufficient proof that someone is who they say they are or in actual fact aren t mr big a look at how top tier undercover investigations can workwhen paranoia gets the better of some people they can think there might be a helicopter following them or perhaps that there s an undercover cop in their midst we ve all seen the movies where le goes deep cover point break donnie brasco the departed miami vice and perhaps we re conditioned that such things are frequent or common place in policing as has been discussed in previous pieces police resources are finite and the need to allocate and reallocate resources is an exercise which is an ongoing one despite this on the criminal calendar murder is regarded as the worst offence there is and when le believes it is on to a liable suspect all the stops will be pulled out and things will get done which otherwise wouldn t get done including in some jurisdictions some very creative undercover work snaky sneaky shit where the cops get you to admit to some serious dirt you did there s a particular method to this that we ll be looking at in depth which uses not one but a whole cast of undercover cops one of the most beloved of the tools in the undercover cop toolkit which has been used by police in canada england a slightly modified version which targeted stolen goods not murders new zealand and australia is known as mr big in canada or the canadian technique elsewhere the mounties came up with it back in the s the australian picked it up in the new zealanders first saw it as far as the court records go in and its still being used today such was the sensitivity of the technique not long after its conception the canadian authorities attempted and failed to have details of it suppressed in r v mentuck man r d as did the australians when they were using it later in application by chief commissioner of police vic for leave to appeal sea r v hart now the leading case in the supreme court of canada the case of r v hart scc gives a look at just how far the cops can and will go in some jurisdictions to make a case nelson hart was suspected of drowning his twin daughters a particularly heinous crime and the sort of thing which arouses utter contempt in the hearts of the wider community generally and le specifically he was target using a canadian technique investigation and confessed his sins to an undercover cop however it was beaten in that instance on appeal its an entertaining controversial and to some a deeply unsettling pathway to an unwitting confession after a chance meeting or two between the target and police officers or those assisting them who will then introduce the target to others from hart a mr big operation begins with undercover officers luring their suspect into a fictitious criminal organization of their own making over the next several weeks or months the suspect is befriended by the undercover officers he is shown that working with the organization provides a pathway to financial rewards and close friendships there is only one catch the crime boss known colloquially as mr big must approve the suspect s membership in the criminal organization built on trust through elaborate scenarios during which the target believes they re committing offences and developing their belief that they will need to confess the truth of whatever the elegant offence was typical murder to a corrupt cop who is on the organization s payroll think that because someone commits a crime with you you can trust them how do you know that what just happened was a crime at all again from hart the operation culminates with an interview like meeting between the suspect and mr big during the interview mr big brings up the crime the police are investigating and questions the suspect about it denials of guilt are dismissed and mr big presses the suspect for a confession pushing for a resultin some instances the police will add some extra pressure by for example contacting the target out of nowhere and asking them to get in touch don t for a minute think that such tactics are not part of a more concerned approach to getting a confession on such a arctic s use in another australian canadian technique case r v tofilau vsc at paragraph it was intended by the undercover operatives that use of trigger arctic would trigger further statements by the accused about the death of the deceased the notice acted as a trigger in three ways first it demonstrated the investigation was active second it indicated the accused was a suspect and the police might have evidence against him third it demonstrated the accused had been less than frank in previous discussions with gang members including operation p whom he had befriended more from hart as mr big s questioning continues it becomes clear to the suspect that by confessing to the crime the big prize acceptance into the organization awaits if the suspect does confess the fiction soon unravels and the suspect is arrested and charged how it endsthe confession is recorded details which no one else but the perpetrator could know are excited and blam you ve made a murder case regardless of what you may have heard from you cousin s roommate who took half a year of pre law entrapment is very much allowed in common law jurisdictions and even if this kind of game were run in the us the objective may be intelligence development allowing for the parallel development of external evidence it s a game of manipulation and careful shaping of a suspect s conduct but time and again courts in the jurisdictions where its been employed have come back to the incapable reality that the perp s confession was not obtained through duress and usually gives sufficient details or indicates the location of further evidence not already detected to crush any hope of beating the charge the costs involved in an operation such as one of these murder cases are substantial the investigation into hart cost according to the police in excess of k can they simply can t be used for everyone only people who they are pretty sure are guilty and guilty of some serious dirt but an investigation which doesn t span multiply cities and involve or more separate scenarios over months for example despite also being a murder the case in r v marks vsc in australia involved scenarios and went for all of one month before the evidence needed was obtained a short term operation with fewer people involved may be just the ticket for other suspected perpetrators of other crimes an interesting aside in the jurisdiction of victoria australia where the majority of these scenario cases are made owing to the victoria police s experience in using the technique police were still using the same name if not the same actual man for the gang boss in as they were in cases being made back in if you re in australia and you ever thought you knew a criminal gang boss named mary butcher think long and hard about calling him again sidebar same name guy for years talk about finite resources using mr big cases to categorize up conductyou can read more about the mr big method on wikipedia if you want and for the more legally inclined you can even read this article that an officer tasked with target development at the australian federal police so kindly put together about the legal ramifications in the aussie context seeing as most readers are not likely to be target for a long term cold case murder investigation any time in the near future the purpose is to provide the framework in which we can learn what the method teaches us about how far undercover cops can and will go in pretending to be criminals or get into and stay in a target s life from a number of cases where the mr big matrix was employed . quote from solov on august pmquote from enigma on august pmquote from solov on august pmquote from enigma on august pmquote from emmet on august several known le
