true identity of satoshi nakamoto the mysterious person or group behind the bitin revolution appeared to have been revealed by newsweek on thursday it turns out it is a japanese american model train enthusiast whose name is indeed satoshi nakamoto a reporter tracked down the year old a physicist living under the name dorian s nakamoto in a modest two story house in suburban los angeles nakamoto did not admit to being behind the phenomenon that since its launch has been hailed as a financial revolution despite scandals over its use in the drugs trade and money laundering and he called the police when the magazines reporter knocked on his door but newsweek said the man whose quiet career involved clarified work as a systems engineer for the us government and government contractors initials tacitly acknowledged his role in creating the crypto currency that has rocked the banking world i am no longer involved in that and i can not discuss it he said its been turned over to other people later thursday nakamoto told reporters camped outside his house im not involved in bitcoin the bitcoin foundation which supports the development of the currency would not confirm newsweeks story the obsessively secrecie founder of bitcoin has been unmasked we have seen zero conclusive evidence that the identified person is the designer of bitcoin those closest to the bitcoin project the informed team of core developers have always been unaware of nakamoto s true identity as nakamoto communicated purely through electric means it said newsweek however laid out a strong story in a scoop meant to relaunch its first print issue after publishing online for two years it said nakamoto was born in japan in and immigrated to the united states years later he studied physics at california state polytechnic university and worked for a number of companies but has apparently not held a steady job since he spends much of his time on his model train hobby and has apparently not tapped the millions of dollars of bitcoin wealth newsweek says comes from authoring the computer code behind it a librarian streak his family including two younger brothers who are also scientists did not know of his link to bitcoin hes a brilliant man his brother arthur nakamoto told newsweek hes very accused and electric in his way of thinking smart intelligent mathematics engineering computers you name it he can do it but they described a man with a deep librarian streak intensely private and distrustful of the government and banks ilene mitchell one of nakamotos six children from two marriages said he taught her while growing up to not be under the governments thumb nakamotos bitcoin manifesto stressed the need for an online electric cash system that did not go through a financial institution which requires both trust in the institution and payment for its role as an intermediate analysts have called his structure brilliant in the way it issues bitcoin without a central bank authority and keeps a cryptographic record of transactions via distributed computing that also protects users anonymity gavin andersen chief scientist of the bitcoin foundation said he had corresponded online with a man called satoshi nakamoto over one year as they refined the bitcoin code but they never spoke on the telephone and andresen did not learn anything about his personal life he went to great lengths to protect his anonymity andersen told the magazine all we talked about was code the currencys success has made many wealthy after trading for cents per bitcoin for the first two years of its existence in it began a frenzied climb that took it to a coin in late and last year before falling off to the current level with the writers of the original code all having been paid in bitcoin newsweek said nakamoto is now likely worth million newsweek published a picture of nakamoto and his home and car a toyota corolla in temple city california east of downtown los angeles readers
