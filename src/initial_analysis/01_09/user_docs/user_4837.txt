the current version of gpg win will not generate a key larger that it has been recommended that everyone should use the same bit key length for maximum anonymity use this very easy and you can encrypt the whole flash drive with truecrytp . it is better not to use gog win here is what nightcrawler at the silkroad forum had to say quote from are also deprecated cleopatra generates rsa keys without an encryption sub key dual rsa keys with one rsa key for signing and the other exclusively for encryption have been standard since the fall of gpa will not generate keys over bits in length gpg usb or gnu privacy tray gnupt are recommended as they are easy to use standards complianti have found gpg usb to be much simpler and easier to use . thank you so much i was having this problem earlier and could not figure out how to fix it or find a better pgp client great job . you can anonymize recipients by putting throw keyid in your gpg conf unfortunately some pgp clients are scrappy and wont test all the private keys in their key chain so they will fail to decrypt anonymized pgp messages . ppgp is also a good portable cross platform solution its in java so it even runs on osx its very basin and simple good solution for buyers . i only have a pgp key do i have necessarily to make a one . quote from crypto on february amyou can anonymize recipients by putting throw keyid in your gpg conf unfortunately some pgp clients are scrappy and wont test all the private keys in their key chain so they will fail to decrypt anonymized pgp messages kgpg on linux allows you to create bit keys it also has the option to remove the key id without editing the gpg conf file so you can select to remove it only for certain messages seahorse allows you to edit the key email and such so you can make a bit key without an email like i did . quote from mr viking on april pmppgp is also a good portable cross platform solution its in java so it even runs on osx its very basin and simple good solution for buyers one in their right mind should be caught dead using that piece of crap software for starters it generates dangerously secure keys by default including bit encryption sub keys hobbyists were breaking keys that small years ago on spare equipment they had lying around i wouldnt be caught dead using that piece of junk software . quote from nagis on february pmit is better not to use gog win here is what nightcrawler at the silkroad forum had to say quote from are also deprecated cleopatra generates rsa keys without an encryption sub key dual rsa keys with one rsa key for signing and the other exclusively for encryption have been standard since the fall of gpa will not generate keys over bits in length gpg usb or gnu privacy tray gnupt are recommended as they are easy to use standards complianti have found gpg usb to be much simpler and easier to use who exactly is this nightcrawler character anyway thanks spitfire . hey spitfire you seem to be up to speed somewhat on security related things anyway nightcrawler is was a highly respected hacker who wrote some pretty extensive docs on security look around you might find his papers its a shame sr forums are no longer accessible all the wonderful reviews discourses and treasure trove of knowledge gone well nothing that was lost can not be made anew moving on thankgiving blessings to all . quote from h pylori on april ami only have a pgp key do i have necessarily to make a one in general a bit key is to be preferred bit keys are expected to be safe until about or thereabouts bit keys are expected to be safe for another years after that that said i expect that rsa keys will be chased out over the next years they will be replaced by ecc keys which are based on ecliptick curves ecc keys will be significantly smaller and are believed more secure than asa keys spitfire .
