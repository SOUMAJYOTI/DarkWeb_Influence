pictures and messages in it can someone please let know asap thank you i think i can help the good news first the police are still building their case against you snd have nothing more to gain or atleast nothing of high importance to gain from other sources they essentially want to see how you react if you have a warrant out you will be pulled over the next time a cop runs your plate and arrested the officer will give a fake reason and will have pulled you over because when he ran your plate the vehicle that its registered too has an active warrant the police essentially seem to have no other leads but want to get you talking police normally dont engage in federal matters and if the fbi was looking for you theyd have already found you the bad news you are on their radar and may be monitor phone tapped depending on what youve been doing they actively want to talk too you this means youre a suspect in a criminal investigation or simply a key witness for another investigation my

can not turn against you the lawyer will be able to talk with the police on your behalf without the police being able to build their case this is critical as the slightest body communication can give them enough confidence to arrest you whereas a lawyer could easily defend you or gather information with no impact on you then if its serious your lawyer would recommend you to turn yourself in or he be able to determine if the police are fishing for information and therefore legally harrassing you either way done run thats the worst thing you can do you have to keep in mind that its ultimately up to the judge to determine what happens and if the prosecutor goes to apply for a warrant based on a premise of we believe this is our guy he evades all attempts to discuss the subject we can not move
