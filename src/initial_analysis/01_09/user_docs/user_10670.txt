you mean tipping point tipping over into what the proliferation of marketplaces isnt some kind of inertia machine its an example of supply and demand at work your right as long as there are customers there will be pol ready to sell but this isnt a dw specific phenomenon law enforcement still prioritizes street trafficking and international smuggling because those represent a much higher vollume of drug transactions than what happens on dw at this point anyway at any rate whats your point i thought you were trying to say that the prey cant flourish without the predator which is true but i dont think that dw marketplaces need le in order to thrive i think its more a point of le being an external pressure source that influences the evolution of dw marketplaces weve seen very much the same thing with the development of anonymity tools back in the day the original remailer was the penet remailer run by julf helsingius it was brought down due to legal pressure so the loss of this service led to the development of cypherpunk type i remailers and the shortcomings in the cypherpunk type i remailers led to the development of mixmaster type ii remailers zaphod . quote from droz on june amquote from cleansober on june pmhave we reached the point where any actions by leo are finger in the like solutions unable to really stop the flow of illegal online drugs unless leo finds a foolproof easy way to charge the thousands of online drug buyers have we reached a tipping point in the online drug markets take down one market and ten others pop up going after buyers seems pointless given that online dealers are selling to hundreds of buyers i wonder if leo looks at the drug market place as a training excersize for there interest enforcement teams go work on this or that market for a few days or weeks and let us know what you find after they spin their wheels for a time they then can put them in more important things like terrors discovery work no doubt they are working on some new fool proof way to discover online dealers and bigger buyers to put the fear of god into anyone who might think about illegal actions online obviously they will never give up but where are their priorities when it comes to prosecution small time canaris users or large h dealers or everyone who knows you know in the end you are right who knows well from what give just seen over the years whenever they pop small time users they always make a huge deal about it and it turns into a show for the publiclike for example even recently the whole blackshades takedown they popped

sure what your point is what do you mean tipping point tipping over into what the proliferation of marketplaces isnt some kind of inertia machine its an example of supply and demand at work your right as long as there are customers there will be pol ready to sell but this isnt a dw specific phenomenon law enforcement still prioritizes street trafficking and international smuggling because those represent a much higher vollume of drug transactions than what happens on dw at this point anyway at any rate whats your point i thought you were trying to say that the prey cant flourish without the predator which is true but i dont think that dw marketplaces need le in order to thrive i think its more a point of le being an external pressure source that influences the evolution of dw marketplaces weve seen very much the same thing with the development of anonymity tools back in the day the original remailer was the penet remailer run by julf helsingius it was brought down due to legal pressure so the loss of this service led to the development of cypherpunk type i remailers and the shortcomings in the cypherpunk type i remailers led to the development of mixmaster type ii remailers zaphod . quote from cleansober on june pmhave we reached the point where any actions by leo are finger in the like solutions unable to really stop the flow of illegal online drugs unless leo finds a foolproof easy way to charge the thousands of online drug buyers have we reached a tipping point in the online drug markets take down one market and ten others pop up going after buyers seems pointless given that online dealers are selling to hundreds of buyers i wonder if leo looks at the drug market place as a training excersize for there interest enforcement teams go work on this or that market for a few days or weeks and let us know what you find after they spin their wheels for a time they then can put them in more important things like terrors discovery work no doubt they are working on some new fool proof way to discover online dealers and bigger buyers to put the fear of god into anyone who might think about illegal actions online obviously they will never give up but where are their priorities when it comes to prosecution small time canaris users or large h dealers or everyone who knows you know in the end you are right who knows . quote from cleansober on june
