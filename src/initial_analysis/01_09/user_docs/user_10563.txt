within the firmware of the device this is not that supirsing thanks ep ill look into it any thoughts on the use of bleachbit and the still utility on wiping unused areas of in use ssds cant hurt security wise but wont help disk longevity and we wouldnt rely on it the disk firmware prevents you from accessing user specific nand addresses so you never really know where on the physical disk memory your data is being written to in theory your overwriting may never actually hit the nand cell holding your data recovery of such data typical involves removing the controller board and accessing and directly assuming knowledge of the firmware stored keys so isn exactly trivial but we wouldnt trust manufacturers not to provide a backdoor allowing those who know to use the firmware directly through undisclosed publicly undocumented controller commands hardware de opal and software encryption used together but independent of each other are the best bet obviously with different pass phrase probably one of the most simple strategies is to literally fill up the disk with crap actually fill it so that all sectors are allotted then all the wear balancing in the world isnt going to prevent all memory being overwritten standard wipe tools done do this thet progressive move through the sectors overwriting one sector at a time which isnt very effective for ssds . hdparm i dev

hack tor liars who rip off authoritarian governments maybe they arent so bad after all straight from the tor blog teh heh good news is that they dont appear to have any exploit on tor or on tor browser the other good news is that their proposed attack doesnt scale well they need to put malicious hardware on the local network of their target user which requires choosing their target locating her and then arranging for the hardware to arrive in the right place so its not really practical to launch the attack on many tor users at once but they actually dont need an exploit on tor or tor browser heres the proposed attack in a nutshell pick a target user say you figure out how you connect to the internet and install their attacking hardware on your local network e g inside your is wait for you to browse the web without tor browser i e with some other browser like firefox or chrome or safari and then insert some sort of exploit into one of the web pages you receive maybe the flash day we learned about from the same documents or maybe some other exploit once they taken control of your computer they configure your tor browser to use a socks proxy on a remote computer that they control in effect rather than using the tor client thats part of tor browser youll be using their remote tor client so they get to intercept and watch your traffic before it enters the tor network you have to stop them at step two because once they broken into your computer they have many options for attacking you from there their proposed attack requires hacking team or your government to already have you in their sights this is not mass surveillance this is very target surveillance another answer is to run a system like tails which avoids interacting with any local resources in this case there should be no opportunity to insert an exploit from the local network but thats still not a complete solution some coffeeshops hotels etc will demand that you interact with their local login page before you can access the internet tails includes what they call their unsafe browser for these situations and youre at risk during that brief period when you use it ultimately security here comes down to having safer browsers we continue to work on ways to make tor browser more resilient against attacks but the key point here is that theyll go after the weakest link on your system and at least in the scenarios they describe tor browser isnt the weakest link as a final point note that this is just a powerpoint deck probably a funding pitch and weve found no indication yet that they ever followed through on their idea well plate you with more information if we learn anything further stay safe out there . quote from sldk on july amquote from e d on july amur just jelly that theyre l t

of what is happening unless it reflectively enters the password and at that time it is too late the bug is simple and evident its a just a matter of programming skill further readingdea us army bought m worth of hacking tools in recent yearsremote access malware either already has or will soon turn up in local cops kits beyond apparent programming abilities vincenzetti was also interested in the small ascent community of people working on public key encryption and pretty good privacy pgp pgp debated in and in another sent post dated september vincenzetti was pleased to announce that he was hosting the latest version of pgp on his italian university s server at the time vincenzettis e mail signature identified him as a system administator sir and c programmer at the university of milans computer science department he was just years old within two years he was listed as the official italian mirror contact for all pip public keys decades later one of the newly leaned hacking team e mails included the following gem dated june vincenzetti sent a note to a colleague named philippe vinci hi philippe we might use pgp but i sceptical sic about encrusted communications with potential partners we don t have anything to hide sanfilippo verified this aspect of the italian ceos background yes vincenzetti was very strong on cryptography protocols and techniques he wrote one of the first implementations of a secure shell available when everybody was using just telnet he said he required everybody in the company to be aware of cryptography when we met in and i was supposed to return in a couple of months after summertime to work with them he handed me a copy of applied cryptography and told me to read it all which i did as another example the then year old italian computer science student posted a now ironic rant to the sci crept sent group in february he described a new unfix program that he was working on an anti tampering program or atp the program first scans the files we want to be tampering protected records their attributes like st size st mtime and size then calculates a checksum then all the file records are deciphered and saved using des in cbc mode if a file changes some way you can detect the changes when you decode the records database and compare the records with the real file attributes there are lots of options and facilities to make the checking process easy and fast further readinghacking team leak releases potent flash day into the wildwindows and adroit phones may be affected by other leaned exploits vincenzetti went on to complain that the md hash was unacceptable slow for this purpose at that point this hashing algorithm was just months old but he eventually released the program on his university s public ftp server describing it as a program to make file tampering and nasty hacking effective atp snapshots the critical files and you can examine them later to discover if something has changed he later described atp in fuller detail within a academy paper the weakest linkaccording to vincenzetti s linkedin profile by he became a partner in a young milan based company called cryptonet soon the security professional went on to cofound the computer emergency response team italiano cert it that company advertised italian itself as one of the first italian companies to nearly exclusively deal with information security with particular attention to the safety problems related to the internet and to the unfix world security can be understood both in a defensive manner preventing authorized use of company it resources and in an offensive manner using security technologies from firewalls to encryption to build systems for electric commerce enlargearchive orgcryptonet claimed to protect companies with annual turnover in the trillions in italian lira roughly in the billions in us dollars from the archives the january version of that company s jebusite contains a particularly prescient italian language explanation of network analysis the starting point for the analysis of the network consists in pinpointing the sensitive of the network it is of nodes systems and apparatuses that because of the information they hosted or managed by them can constitute the target for an attack that could severely damage the company the points are typical sensitive servers or systems that contain sensitive data the result of the activities most critical to business success the sensitive points are all those systems that contain important data disclosure or loss of which would constitute a significant loss for the company the description holds true now more than ever . thanks flashy i hope people done see this and think all humans must turn evil as they age the change here hapens when he hits the top income group . needless to say that scumbag had some thoughts on bitin economy as well hacking team e mails also reveal that vincenzetti himself was quite sceptical on the entire concept of bitcoin even before his company s introduction of money module he wrote a currency offering close to total anonymity is obviously the currency of choice for ransoms of all kinds this is just one of the reasons for bitcoin should never become a momentary standard in february he also told his e mail list bitcoin as it is now has no future but this does not imply that virtual currencies don t have a future that is a modification of the actual bitcoiin sir something different fully traceable and supported by clearing houses and the globe financial system as a whole might have a future in may after ross ulbricht was sentenced to life in prison as a result of being convicted of running silk road vincenzetti again opined on bitcoin an exemplary punishment this is just this is the justice we need the darknet is used for all kinds of illegal criminal activities bitcoin and its evolutions are key to darknet s anonymity regardless some investors and a few irresponsible entrepreneurs are
