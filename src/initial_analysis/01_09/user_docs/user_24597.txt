truecrypt and veracrypt are rascally the same software veracrypt is just newer and more secure version of truecrypt you should use veracrypt its open source so code was reviewed by many people and it was confirmed theres no backdoor contributed in using it too and it works perfectly . good morning at the outset i apologize in advance for my bad wrong expression in the english language i have been working for some time with the question of which programs can be trusted offering a secure encryption the most popular and famous programs are in my eyes true and veracrypt since i am an absolute beginner in this field i would be interested in peoples opinions on this forum are any of these programs recommended or can it be assumed that malicious code were introduced by various intelligence agencies like the asa mi mi mossad gchq if the latter is the case there are alternatives and if so what would they be about interesting and helpful answers i would be happy thank you very much . good

know truecrypt was the ubiquitous encryption program everyone used to use until the devs pulled the pin with very little explanation veracrypt is the natural successor to truecrypt as is looks and feels the same as truecrypt and it is based upon the same code base albeit with some auditing and fixes whether or not veracrypt is safe to use well the general consensus of opinion is that it is and there have been no issues discovered through auditing of the code so far i use veracrypt it works well and i am happy with it but i have a wagging doubt about it which isnt based upon anything specific its just my gut feeling which probably comes from the way the truecrypt devs dropped it like a hot brick and veracrypt shares the same codebase . as you probably know truecrypt was the

help gets out of here before offending the entire darknet people and getting beaten up with stones sounds like youre relapsing that aside i am glad we have a place where faggot was allowed to be said and fuck safe space it was a useless comment and achieved only animosity but seriously you should get that bottle problem checked out and aside cicada is fascinating and if you have to be a need faggot to be a part of something like that im as gay as they come count me in boys . good morning dear hub community a few years ago a photo of the group cicada raised the mindfulness of many people on the internet thousands around the world have been trying to solve this mystery blog entries have been posted videos uploaded discussed on various websites and even universities to this day i do not personally known anyone who could solve it on was much discussion about who might be behind it theories such as intelligence services who want to recruit in this way people members of so called secret societies rosicrucians freemasons templars and others who want to specifically disseminate knowledge of the occult people with excellent computer skills that are looking for new members the technological crypto logical and mathematical knowledge of this group is of course excellent but what has fascinated me personally is that belief system of these people and how technological knowledge is connected with occultism especially of plaister crowley and helena petrovna blavatsky to cite a few examples with which i agree there is no inherent meaning in anything and all is empty and meaningless the existence of an emergent god like globe brain made up of all living things and technology as described by cyberneticist francis heylighen there is no need for salvation because there is nothing from which we must be saved there is no real reality and what we perceive as reality may be a simulation all things are one there is no polarity no right or wrong no disharmony but only identity all is one and that one is love light light love the infinite creator we are not here to learn anything new but to remember what we already know physical reality is an illusion one can not understand one thing unless he or she understands its opposite good and evil do not exist as absolutes but can exist in a different context and for different reasons these were taken from the book conversations with god by beale donald walsch cicada wikipedia entry and the a material i would be happy to see new information and interesting opinions of the forum members because my computer skills are not sufficient to solve this mystery who is in your opinion behind this group and what are their goals i would appreciate answers and thank you in advance sources . quote from ladyvengeance on

you ive looked at your post in another thread some mentioned sites are known to me but not all for that i thank you i have my thread deliberately written here and not on those who deal in large part with occultism and spirituality this group focuses in my opinion on data security cryptography steganography and much more in this area i do not have enough knowledge so i chose the hub i was hoping that members who have technical knowledge can tell me us something interesting about it i myself am working for several months with various areas in the occult try to learn more about myself and gain new knowledge through meditation yoga fasting raw food diet and psychedelics especially banisteriopsis camp ayahuasca dmt and ibogaine it would be really great if more people would find the need to

who were able to restore phone messages on signal from a year ago because according to signal and that security audit that is impossible if the messages had really been delete that fellow zdziarski is supposed to be a phone forensics geek fire hes the guy the cops go to when theyre stumped if he says virtual nothing is found on there then thats a pretty decent endorsement imo now as far as dhs goes and their alleged recovery of data from a phone that used signal id like some more information on that as it stands right now we dont have any information to be able to confirm the claims that have been made i e regarding signals alleged vulnerability vs wickrs alleged invulnerability if i were a paranoid man i might begin to wonder whether this tale re signals alleged vulnerability was just a piece of disinformation aimed at convincing people to move from a secure platform signal to one that was vulnerable to the authorities wickr zaphodthats what i was thinking in regards to the

bootiusmaximus on march pmwhat about secure encryption programs when communicating with your phone theres been some discussion about wicker signal over in the dhl forums never use a phone for anything sensitive however if you just want to thwart the efforts of state level surveillance the only apps i would consider reasonably safe are signal and silent circle both use true end to end encryption and are open source software that is the ideal way to conduct business i think i would go with silent circle based on bulkxtc s experience . quote from zaphod on march pmquote from bootiusmaximus on march
