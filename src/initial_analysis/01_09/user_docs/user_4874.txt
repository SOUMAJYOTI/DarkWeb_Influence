vendor you plan on ordering from . with your current open youre current most likely better off than over half the buyers on the darknet use tails pip sensitive info use trusted vender and you will be a day plus led is super easy to stealth safe tripping my friend good vibes . oksoim new to this very new current im only using tor but am getting vb and tails rn i use pgp as much as a i can and i have a disk to be used for pgp and such once give got ve now give read jollys thread on security but im a bit worried still i feel like theres more to use other than tor and vb and tails see in wanting to order some lsd not much of it but give heard this guy is very stealthy even so i fear cops coming to my door with the letter package give never given out personal info on tor actually used my email on igolder or something for pgp a long time ago haha stupid i know i threw that out hard and got a new email but other than that give made many different usernames passwords and nicknames for myself i worry that somehow there going to just know whats in the letter package i dunno its kind of stupid but ahava i just would like to be safe i dont plan on ordering lots at a time and i dont know if ill even ever order again sorry for being such a big noob . quote from pleroma on november everyone gets worried nervous paranoid at first once your pack finally arrives you may still be
