for some reason lately i can not get any obfs or obfs bridges to tor network to work at all in tails bridge mode give collected alot of bridge addresses i boot tails in bridge mode and enter them one at a time from here on the directions say they should allow access to tor but no addresses are working and give tried over or so any tips . for some reason lately i can not get any obfs or obfs

hosting obfs bridges im looking into that too if anyone has tips for that . the strength of tors anonynomity would increase greatly if many more opsec minded interested people started hosting obfs

fixed just had to set my system clock to utc which tails uses gamesome . not in bridge mode it only allows you to connect via bridges but if i boot tails normally i can connect without issue it says something about the system clock not in sync in the messages . if u open tails up on your main os and go into the bootloader files sorry cant point to it right now you can add the bridge word to the startup options so it will automatically boot into bridge mode im not sure how to get it to remember the bridge settings though . not in bridge mode it only allows you to connect via bridges but if i boot tails normally i can connect without issue it says something about the system clock not in sync in the messages . hello hub many of you may be interested in hiding the use of tor from your isp some isps are already under federal orders to maintain databases of ip addresses connecting to tor nodes and at this point you should expect the n s a to be collecting that data there is a nice solution other than vpn services which can prove to not be helpful depending on how you configure your pathway into tor or if you choose a bad vpn service called pluggable transports that give you a bridge to connect to tor bridge ip address that connects you to tor possibly unknown as a tor bridge using these will hide that you are using a known tor node obfs bridge bridge that has data packets disguised as normal data hides on the surface that you are using tor vulnerable to dpi deep packet inspection a capability of the fbi or asa roughly exist so understand using them can pool you into a smaller group solution host your own on a vps or the tor cloud serviceobfs resistent to dpi ultimately the safest bridge as it completely masks your data packets the only problem is that they are few in number thus pooling you into yet a smaller group the more people host the infinitely stronger tor becomes so go to torproject and look up some bridges obfs and obfs bridges the more you have the better so now boot tails in bridge mode wait til the menu for live or live failsafe comes up hit tab and then hit spacebar and enter the word bridge which will launch tails in bridge mode from here set the system clock to sync with etc up time the menu for adding bridges will open automatically with an attached or some other number do not delete this as it is necessary for bridge mode to run add your bridges one at a time and hit the button connect to tor a bit more safely tails is working on implenting support for flashproxy the next huge tool in tor anynomity once that is deplored for tails i would heavily consider implementing that technology there is a special pluggable transports tor browser bundle that is configured to run bridges automatically which supports flashproxy so it is a matter of time the tor cloud service is a great way to host a free private obfs bridge if you want to strengthen tor think about hosting a public bridge or obfs bridge be safe lovies spaceh rse . if u

and mutually coniure bridges just because i appreciate the amnesic feautures of tails tails live dvds are read only and are amnesic ny default also upon login of tails you must hit the more options button set an admin password so you may have admit permission to reset the system clock export pgp keys or do anything in the command terminal that requires admit permisson . sub . sub . i think you
