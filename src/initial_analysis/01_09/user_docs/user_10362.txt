nice place to be given the layout is somewhat primitive looking and they have been under do attack recently id still say proudly that right now agora is the new market pandora has been around longer and they have had higher volume of traffic until about a month ago i suspect that it has hit its plateau and will likely stand in the position moving forward as it has since the fall of s smp and bmr
