should think again do not hire him to do anything or you will regret that decision he is dangerous to the entire community ask him for proof of his claims if he cant provide it then hes a proven liar

said for a week you keep assuming because i started with high level attacks against your shifty vps server that is all i had i did that for a strategic reason because i wanted to demoralize you i would do something very easy it would take you a day to figure out a solution and i would already have the next attack coded and ready to launch once you issued a fix i did this for a week after that i just straight knocked over your cheap vps which is why it has been office after claiming you had fixed everything you stupidly moved your forums over to it which only made it easier and allowed me

yourself if i do have them or not you are out of your depth i have out played you at every turn get out while you can save what money you have left you are done here i gave copies of your css to other market admins to scavenge already too since that part was obviously the most part you invested the most time and therefore is the most valuable my story has not changed throughout these events while fidel and co have lied and lied and were backed into a corner where they were forced to admit it he has only proved to be juvenile incompetent and trustworthy here is the full story with details on all the attacks i used to push over their cheap vps excluding the more recent ones since they are still current effective well to begin with i started working with them when i realized i could load mb of data into their search without logging in and submit it crashing their system because they left out max client body size from their nine config abusing this i got them to pay me btc to tell them to add that very basin line to their nine config i told them i had many more issues found on their system and they said they had no money to afford bug bounties so we negotiated and equity deal at i asked for a simple contract with my reddit name my pgp fingerprint and signed with their market key fidel being the asshole that he is he deliberately fucks that up puts my name wrong leaves out the fingerprint and uses a key he just made to sign it meanwhile i already agreed to start working with their incompetent programmer i told him him a list of things to fix including that he needed to add rate limiting because it was too easy to submit countless requests to his system he immediately says he doesnt know how and if i knew any guides on rate limiting he googles and copies the first thing he finds into his nine config and goes to bed the code he copied was for rate limiting by ip address which anyone who knows how hidden services work knows that is the stupid possible thing you could have done every request comes from and he essentially dosd his own site i had to explain to him he needed to rate limit by cookies not ip address he also admitted to logging into the server directly instead of through an onion address which was a massive red flag to me at that point i realized they were morons and scammers i told them i would prefer not to work with them i didn want equity in a sinking ship that would be caught by le i wanted btc for the first list of things i gave and my time walking him through fixing them and they stopped communicating with me over bitmessage so i started to dos them first i started with just creating orders because they had zero rate limiting and their session system was completely stupid you could maintain several sessions on the same account which is really bad design for any secure system this allowed me to create orders and then just issue the sign all command a few times and it would crash their server next i noticed their messaging system was poorly oded they had been using user passwords to symmetrically encrypt and decrypt the messages they had used a very bad symmetry encryption for the password that allowed them to do this they openly admitted to this on reddit bragging about it like it was some sort of way to protect against le reading messages unfortunately the system required the plain text version of the password to stay in memory for a very long time which on a site without fa was criminal stupid i was able to create messages and just look at the index it caused their server to crash from the load i did this for days before they realized anything throughout the whole period they never cleaned up the database or delete my user accounts i strongly believe they dont know sal very well any competent admin would have popped into sql and just started wiping out all the crap data i was loading into their system it also was a clear sign they were not reading the logs i started with very simple attacks and as they tried to sluggishly fix them i would already have the next attack precoded and ready to go when they issued their fix this drove them nuts and kept their server offline for a week using basin shit their only option was to put captchas everywhere which i kept bypassing anyways then they went into invite only mode but forgot to delete all my users from the db so my attack continued they finally took down their site and cleaned out all my users they thought they fixed everything made an announcement how i was using lame attacks and went out of invite only mode so i immediately loaded their database with users and they went back into invite only mode so then i went for a more low level attack that i would rather not discuss because i may use it again on them and took their site offline for several days it is still office weather they took their site down or not i dont care because if it comes back i will use the same attack or a more sophisticated attack to do it again if you want more details about their cheap vps server what their map handles were or anything else i will do my best to answer them fidel will probably try to come in and lie but he has already been caught red handed lying and creating shall accounts on reddit to manipulate discussion after being caught he then admitted to lying about everything i said for a week during that time my story never changed i have no reason to lie people may not like me but that is not my concern my worth to administrators is i have information that could be used to harden their system havana absolem the exact same website

invite only mode but forgot to delete all my users from the db so my attack continued they finally took down their site and cleaned out all my users they thought they fixed everything made an announcement how i was using lame attacks and went out of invite only mode so i immediately loaded their database with users and they went back into invite only mode so then i went for a more low level attack that i would rather not discuss because i may use it again on them and took their site offline for several days it is still office weather they took their site down or not i dont care because if it comes back i will use the same attack or a more sophisticated attack to do it again if you want more details about their cheap vps server what their map handles were or anything else i will do my best to answer them fidel will probably try to come in and lie but he has already been caught red handed lying and creating shall accounts on reddit to manipulate discussion after being caught he then admitted to lying about everything i said for a week during that time my story never changed i have no reason to lie people may not like me but that is not my concern my worth to administrators is i have information that could be used to harden their system havana absolem the exact same website is being made an example of if you try to cheat me when i hand over bugs exploits then i destroy your market with the bugs exploits i found . quote from spendingtime on may pmsmells like reddit in here definitely fancied doritos and flat mountain dew . quote from fidelcastro on may amquote from ava on may pmquote from hacksforcrack on may ami was simply offering to provide this community with more information if it was desired to ask questions and you started making personal attacks nice sanctuary you have here in love to hear more about how shifty their backend is no seriously i would he doesnt know a thing about our backend because he never penetrated our server all of his claims of having our private keys and ip addresses have been proved false by his failure to produce any evidence ir he had access to our backend and the onion keys he would be able to take over our hidden service and replace our market with his own page he has not done that and can not do that because he is a liar and a fraud absolem havana owes him nothing at all he knows how to run scripts that overload the cpu by spamming messages and similar activities he has now resorted to ddosing the server that is not a hard feat to accomplish with a hidden service due to bottlenecks in the tor architecture this will be our only response to hacks cracks on this forum so done expect any more replies it just encourages him our advice is that anyone who thinks he is truly a security consultant should think again do not hire him to do anything or you will regret that decision he is dangerous to the entire community ask him for proof of his claims if he cant provide it then hes a proven liar fidel exceped as a buyer account running scripts toconsidering you are a known liar i dont think your word on the matter means much you got caught shilling then admitted to lying about everything i said for a week you keep assuming because i started with high level attacks against your shifty vps server that is all i had i did that for a strategic reason because i wanted to demoralize you i would do something very easy it would take you a day to figure out a solution and i would already have the next attack coded and ready to launch once you issued a fix i did this for a week after that i just straight knocked over your cheap vps which is why it has been office after claiming you had fixed everything you stupidly moved your forums over to it which only made it easier and allowed me to damage you easier i can tell you everything about their ship operation from the os they are running the php version they are using and how they improperly connect to their server feel free to ask any question you want about their ship operation i hope the vultures start stealing your css and at least other markets with competent admins will benefit from your work . quote from spendingtime on

from fidelcastro on may amyou said you had the private keys you dont its that simple why would i let you bait me into giving up a possible vector to attack to you for free anyone with two functioning brain cells would hold onto that information in the case you insist on trying to operate you describe an attack i could do with it yourself why would i give away the opportunity to use that attack eventually when you have already proved countless times to be secure trustworthy and unable to maintain a stable market and easy to take down with attacks that dont require me to rent a server and expose potential attack surface i think ill just hold onto those to embarrass you later since you seem ensure yourself if i do have them or not you are out of your depth i have out played you at every turn get out while you can save what money you have left you are done here i gave copies of your css to other market admins to scavenge already too since that part was obviously the most part you invested the most time and therefore is the most valuable my story has not changed throughout these events while fidel and co have lied and lied and were backed into a corner where they were forced to admit it he has only proved to be juvenile incompetent and trustworthy here is the full story with details on all the attacks i used to push over their cheap vps excluding the more recent ones since they are still current effective well to begin with i started working with them when i realized i could load mb of data into their search without logging in and submit it crashing their system because they left out max client body size from their nine config abusing this i got them to pay me btc to tell them to add that very basin line to their nine config i told them i had many more issues found on their system and they said they had no money to afford bug bounties so we negotiated and equity deal at i asked for a simple contract with my reddit name my pgp fingerprint and signed with their market key fidel being the asshole that he is he deliberately fucks that up puts my name wrong leaves out the fingerprint and uses a key he just made to sign it meanwhile i already agreed to start working with their incompetent programmer i told him him a list of things to fix including that he needed to add rate limiting because it was too easy to submit countless requests to his system he immediately says he doesnt know how and if i knew any guides on rate limiting he googles and copies the first thing he finds into his nine config and goes to bed the code he copied was for rate limiting by ip address which anyone who knows how hidden services work knows that is the stupid possible thing you could have done every request comes from and he essentially dosd his own site i had to explain to him he needed to rate limit by cookies not ip address he also admitted to logging into the server directly instead of through an onion address which was a massive red flag to me at that point i realized they were morons and scammers i told them i would prefer not to work with them i didn want equity in a sinking ship that would be caught by le i wanted btc for the first list of things i gave and my time walking him through fixing them and they stopped communicating with me over bitmessage so i started to dos them first i started with just creating orders because they had zero rate limiting and their session system was completely stupid you could maintain several sessions on the same account which is really bad design for any secure system this allowed me to create orders and then just issue the sign all command a few times and it would crash their server next i noticed their messaging system was poorly oded they had been using user passwords to symmetrically encrypt and decrypt the messages they had used a very bad symmetry encryption for the password that allowed them to do this they openly admitted to this on reddit bragging about it like it was some sort of way to protect against le reading messages unfortunately the system required the plain text version of the password to stay in memory for a very long time which on a site without fa was criminal stupid i was able to create messages and just look at the index it caused their server to crash from the load i did this for days before they realized anything throughout the whole period they never cleaned up the database or delete my user accounts i strongly believe they dont know sal very well any competent admin would have popped into sql and just started wiping out all the crap data i was loading into their system it also was a clear sign they were not reading the logs i started with very simple attacks and as they tried to sluggishly fix them i would already have the next attack precoded and ready to go when they issued their fix this drove them nuts and kept their server offline for a week using basin shit their only option was to put captchas everywhere which i kept
