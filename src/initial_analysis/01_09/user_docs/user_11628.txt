response is that they deliberately prioritized withdrawals over deposits until the backlog clears the new estimate is hours more wait until things resolve to put some perspective on that estimate previously they said and hours give worked in software development and i know processes can incur overruns but to be re estimating this often is not a good sign in fact its a reliable indicator that the devs dont really have much idea about the nature of the problem or its solution you arent consistently off by a factor of times in a row if you know whats up in any case i disagree with the base strategy i assume theyre prioritizing withdrawals so as to satisfy vendors but all there going to achieve with this strategy is a bank run theyre shooting themselves in the foot both ways the vendors are sucking all their btc out and probably going elsewhere while buyers are unable to put in new orders thus freezing the market for many days there is incentive for both buyers and vendors to pull out and move elsewhere the vendors withdraw everything and quit the buyers follow its a sure fire road to ruin its also a lot of work to do all the manual override stuff compare that scenario with the sensible option process all transactions in order by simply replaying the blockchain this scenario gives first in first out just as if a pause button had been released buyers can continue to buy and vendors can continue to sell and in fact everyone wins a little bit because btc is incidentally worth more now than it was days ago even though trade is backlogged a few days the wheels of the market still turn orders still flow in everyone is confident that things will be as they were the market lives this is economics their strategy is a perfect what not to do if you want to avoid panic and a run on the bank scenario so whether agora is planning it or not theyre going to end up with an empty market there is a huge incentive to do an exit scam but agora is not accepting any depostis from buyers they are clearly saying hold on to your money or spend it elsewhere those that have already deposited sorry but we are working on it most vendors if they cant withdraw they will not take send new orders so in other words what good is your money if you can make an order the vendor has it in his account but he wont be shipping your order until withdraws start in my opinion both agora and evo

ready for heyday tomorrow if my btc eventually lands on agora then happy days but i have a very big doubtful feeling of that happening . just starting to annoy me now because i though minor delays would mean a day two maximum yet here i am still in the place with my balance the same as it was post last order i made heyday tomorrow any way so i think il just accept the loss and move over to evo or see if the vendor i use on there is happy to deal with me off market because i trust them enough to send the stuff if i were to send them btc directly cant even deposit money on the market to buy stuff so what am i expected to do setting an evo account up now ready for heyday tomorrow if my btc eventually lands on agora then happy days but i have a very big doubtful feeling of that happening . quote from fruits on november amara admins response is that they deliberately prioritized withdrawals over deposits until the backlog clears the new estimate is hours more wait until things resolve to put some perspective on that estimate previously they said and hours give worked in software development and i know processes can incur overruns but to be re estimating this often is not a good sign in fact its a reliable indicator that the devs dont really have much idea about the nature of the problem or its solution you arent consistently off by a factor of times in a row if you know whats up in any case i disagree with the base strategy i assume theyre prioritizing withdrawals so as to satisfy vendors but all there going to achieve with this strategy is a bank run theyre shooting themselves in the foot both ways the vendors are sucking all their btc out and probably going elsewhere while buyers are unable to put in new orders thus freezing the market for many days there is incentive for both buyers and vendors to pull out and move elsewhere the vendors withdraw everything and quit the buyers follow its a sure fire road to ruin its also a lot of work to do all the manual override stuff compare that scenario with the sensible option process all transactions in order by simply replaying the blockchain this scenario gives first in first out just as if a pause button had been released buyers can continue to buy and vendors can continue to sell and in fact everyone wins a little bit because btc is incidentally worth more now than it was days ago even though trade is backlogged a few days the wheels of the market still turn orders still flow in everyone is confident that things will be as they were the market lives this is economics their strategy is a perfect what not to do if you want to avoid panic and a run on the bank scenario so whether agora is planning it or not theyre going to end up with an empty market there is a huge incentive to do an exit scam but agora is not accepting any depostis from buyers they are clearly saying hold on to your money or spend it elsewhere those that have already deposited sorry but we are working on it most vendors if they cant withdraw they will not take send new orders so in other words what good is your money if you can make an order the vendor has it in his account but he wont be shipping your order until withdraws start in my opinion both agora and evo are fucking bad ass i am an sr refugee so maybe that why but i know agora for long time i believe in that team . i will bet btc that agora will return you name the stakes i will bet the btc . i will bet btc that agora will return you name the stakes i will bet the btc . i will bet btc that agora will return you name the stakes i will bet the btc . i
