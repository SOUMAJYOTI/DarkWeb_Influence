link to the post here text there has been an influx of heated discussions regarding scamming activity and slow market support and understandably so as staff we are just as eager as the rest of our community to see the back of these issues and although all information regarding the situation can already be found in official announcements and staff comments throughout the forums i thought it might be helpful to collect a few of the most elegant points together and publish them here to help you all understand the situation more clearly lets start from the beginning and work our way through hopefully this will serve to build a bit of a picture for those of you who still feel confused hard done by and in the dark recently a lot of staff disappeared for various reasons youre all aware of more forum staff have been added however none of the missing staff with the market access have yet been replaced meaning all marketplace admin and support is right now being run by a skeleton crew the bare maximum therefore absolutely essential tasks such as site operation and security are taking absolute priority over anything else to clarify this there have been no cuts made to the manpower being invested into fundamental site operations and security however this is taking practically all of the time our skeleton crew has in other words almost of market admins time is being taken dealing with the fundamental tasks needed to keep silk road operation and secure any excess time the skeleton crew does have that doesnt fall into essential site operations is being invested equally across improving market performance implementing market updates training new market staff and securely handling support requests this animal amount of excess time available to the skeleton crew means that updates are taking longer than planned performance is from time to time inconsistent market support is still understaffed and the queue for market support is growing faster than it is being handled oh and traffic has doubled since early decemberthink about it like this imagine youre the manager of a busy mcdonalds imagine now that half of your staff have just quit but that the number of customers coming in has just doubled lets go one step further and imagine that youre the only staff member with the ability to tackle the core functionality of the restaurant in other words youre a one man band and youre serving a queue that goes out of the door and around the corner but youre not just serving no youre taking orders manning the drive thu cooking the burgers pouring the coffees cashing the tills training new staff dealing with shoplifters and taking complaints all at the same time your customers are hungry and angry but will shutting the shop make them happier no so you continue as we speak a system is being developed to allow many more staff members secure access to market functionality to start handling support once this is in place and more staff can deal with requests such as banning scammers resetting pin numbers unlocking locked accounts mediating disputes and more the support queue will vanish but until this system is in place unfortunately we have to accept that theres the equivalent of a one man band running the restaurant to reiterate one of the most important points above traffic to the site has more than doubled yet staff with market access has more than halvedthis will be solved in due course but until then the fact remains that we can expect an amount of turbulence to occur just because banning a scammer might be as easy as visiting a profile verifying reports and hitting ban doesnt mean the skeleton crew can drop their essential tasks and deal with every instance immediately but scammers have been banned support requests have been handled its all being dealt with systematically and in an ordered queue its just slow your support requests are being dealt with in the order they arrive reporting them several times will not speed the process up it will only clog the queue instead of finding five minutes free and banning a genuine scammer in the order that scammer was reported admin are finding five minutes free and using it to delete all duplicate requests from the same person of a scamper thats now been dealt with and no progress is being made help our admin to make the most of every five minute window they get if you have an issue if you found a scammer if you need help please do make us aware but please do not continue making us aware it will be sorted but it will take longer than youre used to during these tough

are monumental but considering all the setbacks theyve had in generally pleased with how things have gone so far as far as the scamming i dont think the admins should take a leading role in alerting

makes a commission and every scam vendor account is still a profit i dont agree that they dont want to sort things out they have shown plenty of integrity since things went pear shaped around christmas and i cant see why they would actively throw that away for the what will be in the grand scheme of things a fairly small amount of commission your idea for stopping scamming is a good one but again it is something that will take time to implement and as v states in his post they have a very limited amount of time available to bring out new features personally i think it is good that they are focusing on the sites security despite the flack they are getting over the market support and scammers not being banned they could easily ignore site security and focus on the things that people see to stop all the negative comments and bad press but surely its better to have a secure site with scammers for now than the other way round . best practice imho is to just stick to the established vendors and only deal with them is that really so difficult i do worry sometimes though that they may have been caught and are being forced to work with le to catch maybe the customers of your larger orders hasnt this happened before . quote from highspeedflying on january amif you enacted these simple measures im willing to bet the scams would drop dramatically in fact most of the

facilitating transactions and selling vendor accounts if you get slammed by a vendor on ebay you get your money back sr obviously doesnt have the resources to compensate buyers that were slammed but they do have the power to enact certain rules and procedures that minimize the likelihood of getting slammed if someone is slammed and you helped facilitate the scam by failing refusing to regulate your own business properly and then proceed to make a profit from that swam youre complicit in the scam itself while im aware of the irony of talking about legal ethics on a website dedicated to

the admin that allows such practice its very simple to prevent fe scams increase the time necessary and number of successful transactions something like transactions required before a vendor is given

you get your money back sr obviously doesnt have the resources to compensate buyers that were slammed but they do have the power to enact certain rules and procedures that minimize the likelihood of getting slammed if someone is slammed and you helped facilitate the scam by failing refusing to regulate your own business properly and then proceed to make a profit from that swam youre complicit in the scam itself while im aware of the irony of talking about legal ethics on a website dedicated to flaunting the law it remains at the very least a poor reflection on a business that does nothing to prevent their clientele from being maliciously ripped off personally i worry about the integrity of the admin that allows such practice its very simple to prevent fe scams increase the time necessary and number of successful transactions something like transactions required before a vendor is given trusted status and permitted to request fe this will immediately slow the pace of scams as every scammer will be required to spend longer rebuilding trust in new accounts require each successful transaction toward the goal of trusted to be made from the drugs category this will prevent scammers from getting a bunch of successful transactions from miscellaneous listings if a vendor gets multiply reports of scamming in a certain time frame activate an automatic withdrawal freeze of his wallet this will allow him to keep operating normally and if hes cleared of wrongdoing can withdraw his funds but if he she is confirmed as a scammer any buyers that fed after the reports will get their money back if you enacted these simple measures im willing to bet the scams would drop dramatically in fact most of the scammers would probably move on to other dark markets if s really wanted to stop scams they could do it overnight they just dont want to because every scam still makes a commission and every scam vendor account is still a profit i see that youve really put some thought into those ideas and i think this is a great forum to discuss how we can help protect customers from scamming venders i agree with cornelius that its taking it a bit far to suggest that s staff does nothing to prevent the clientele from being ripped off i think they have a pile of monumental tasks to complete and not enough manpower to get it all done as fast as wed all like comparing this market to ebay is a bit of a stretch as venders essentially are subcontractors who have their own set of rules and practices the general operating template gives general guidance but the customer has the ultimate choice of whether or not to do business with a vender after reading their profile page although i think your suggestions are good intentioned i think enacting the entire list of restrictions like you propose would put new venders so deep in the hole that the market would collapse if you take a look around the all the darkweb markets venders have lost millions due to escrow seizure scams freezing and lack of auto finalize asking venders to run transactions before being allowed to ask for fe in a market where the history has proved that escrow funds are often seized stolen go missing or are for whatever reason unavoidable and this keeps us from re upping and staying in business its not a simple black and white issue there are a lot of factors to consider on both sides there is only so much venders can be asked to donate to le and thieves in order for this market to stay functions i know as a buyer most people dont ever experience that side of things but its worth considering . quote

quote from trolltergeist on march pm some of us are smarter than we appear to be ll dude did you really just leave that hanging out there aha oh man i could have so much fun with that line a lone i wont though since you are lord of trolls and all . the original text is below the link is here of all sorry but i didn t had to much for choice if i didn t wanted to close pandora market and hope at least some of you will understand situation but i know i am going to burn and lost all of my karma but there is whole truth with my plan what happened last week pandora market got shaved of large portions of btc by vendors used to be small time scammers they were able to steal about of btc pandora total holdings rascally everything that was not on cold storage they found the leak in system i stopped all withdrawals found leak and fix the bug in system and also were checking any single money operation programming that is the reason why everyone withdrawals were stopped for about hours what were my options back then when i found bitcoin lost i could make market to disapear and just close it down everyone will think then i scammed oll of you i will apply solution to cover losses and continue operations i choose number why i didn t told truth before that would probably lead only to instant panic and market closure week before that day all money would be probably lost all vendors and customers money i didn t informed and pandora were able to make withdrawals of more than btc since steal of bitcoins discovered to vendors all of that would not be possible if i would not take this frantic measurements all my actions was made to safe pandora market and continue operation time will tell if that was good move only what i am sure about is if i didn t made this frantic measurements i can only close down the market and be remembered as scamper current situation i partly covered loss from my profits this is probably very stupid move from me as everybody will probably blame me i should closed market i think now i covered about of losses from my own money hard desicion for me market and almost all btc will be recovered during this week by aplying very high tax on all transactions actions made current only max pandora holdings are held on main server so possible loss is limited to of total pandora holdings many security updates to the system leak fixed if pandora will survive that in future if that ever happen again loss is limited to of btc holdings facts pandora market processing withdrawals for vendors and over btc were sent to vendors during last week all transaction must be taxed with scheme below to complete recovery pandora will start processing withdrawal for all users by withdrawal fee for customers will aply from that day until days pandora will be recovered in less than days from now for those thinking about closing shops at pandora i really do understand that but think about this small market might i mean person behind the market might not be ready for inflow of money and he might scam you anyway think again how much you made with pandora market existence and how much you are going to make in future and without this market you would may not be able to make money that you did there i didn t had many ptions to safe market and this loss is temporary and will be repaid back recovery scheme buyback for save pandora market i had to make very frantic measurements commision operating tax of during commision paid from all transaction scheme by recovery tax if your item have add commision to item instead of deduct recovery tax if your item have add commision to item instead of deduct from until if you have option to add commision to item price as vendor you are not charged full but customer pay commision of and after you are charged reason to accept that truth is that you have no choice and if you want be able to withdraw for all send order consider it as repaid tax will explain later take it as necessary evil to continue bussiness on pandora market i understand some of you will not all commisions paid are in database and i know who paid what amount of commisions above expected example escrow release for vendor name on order amount comm that is helf for every single transaction these allow me to calculate exact commision paid by that day easily and from all affected vendors probably all will have overpaid commision calculated overpaid commision ill be put to special database all vendors will later pay only of standard commision and will be calculated back to repay tax back to vendors of future commisions will be paid back to vendors after total amount of overpaid money is proportion might change to pay back vendors quick as possible worst case scenario is i will sell of pandora earnings and pay from that debt to vendors to repay them overtax each will earn portion of pandora profits paid daily about me what i think i must be completely stupid to be honest in this bussines because for me were such easier to exit i don t expect nobody to understand even if i wrote that post i think many of you will think this is beginning of scam because it does make sence but if i am going to scam i am not going to allow withdrawals of more than etc right so that play for that is truth i must be very stupid as i put even my all money back just for everybody will blaming me but that is risk i am taking now if somebody think i am taking that profits now that is not true it is much more easier just to close all withdrawals and run away with money which i didn t do big truth is now i am not making any money out of pandora every single satoshi now go back to repay back loss i don t want to sound like i almos save your money i will be blamed of course many will think this is start of scam or i took money by myselft but none on that is truth facts if this is going to be swam which is not i am not going to allow withdrawals recovery of all loss is by end of month pandora will be back in normal by end ot the month recovered from me i am now working for free pandora will survive i believe that personaly i still didn t steal single bitcoins from customer or vendor understand in this anonymous place it is not easy to believe nothing super short version pandora loss of btc holdings frantic tax is needed to recover paid by all vendors tax paid by vendors will be paid back in form of or less commission pay in future normal operation will start again approve update all vendor customer balances are not touched in any way and after recovery will be fully available customers can still order from any vendor and vendors don t have any issues with withdrawals from day because i recovered cold storage and used my money to pay vendors there are enough btc to cover all withdrawals i calculated balances on all vendor accounts and pandora have multiply time balance for withdrawal then is available balance on vendor accounts vendors don t have issues wit withdrawals from day except hour withdrawal stop before few days update inflow of btc into pandora market is unchanged in comparsion to last week buyers are still buying in stable rate in compare to the last week others will try to make panic and take advantage of this issue so if you can please don t try to create more panic but protect pandora if possible if you want as vendor limit your loss you can change item to add price instead of deduct then from commision will aply and will be paid by you and by customer best what vendor can do now to limit loss is probably change all their items to add commision to price that way commision is added to total price to be paid by customer and from tax is going to be so endor is paying just splitting it with customer that tax should not probably burn most of vendors as margins on items sold here are usually high and every vendor should survive that temporary loss to be paid back when back in normal so if pandora is going to survive that and at least half of people will understand why it is how it is now pandora will be here for normal operations within now everybody say me fuck off and that i am idiot and scammer for those who will stay calm i promise you i will repay commisions back in time even for those who will not stay calm never thought it is going happen to pandora i always think these steal are always made by owners i thought pandora is stronghold that can not be beaten but i learned from this and i believe pandora is not going down that s it don t know what to say more . the original text is below the link is here of all sorry but i didn t had to much for choice if i didn t wanted to close pandora market and hope at least some of you will understand situation but i know i am going to burn and lost all of my karma but there is whole truth with my plan what happened last week pandora market got shaved of large portions of btc by vendors used to be small time scammers they were able to steal about of btc pandora total holdings rascally everything that was not on cold storage they found the leak in system i stopped all withdrawals found leak and fix the bug in system and also were checking any single money operation programming that is the reason why everyone withdrawals were stopped for about hours what were my options back then when i found bitcoin lost i could make market to disapear and just close it down everyone will think then i scammed oll of you i will apply solution to cover losses and continue operations i choose number why i didn t told truth before that would probably lead only to instant panic and market closure week before that day all money would be probably lost all vendors and customers money i didn t informed and pandora were able to make withdrawals of more than btc since steal of bitcoins discovered to vendors all of that would not be possible if i would not take this frantic measurements all my actions was made to safe pandora market and continue operation time will tell
