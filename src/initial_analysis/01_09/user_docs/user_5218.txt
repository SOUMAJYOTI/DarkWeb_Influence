it is a way to encrypt your messages and emails you can look up pip info on the clearnet and many people use it in business and the like it stand for pretty good privacy good places to start is wiki will need a good pgp program and there are several different builds some are better for different platforms on some platforms it may take a while to figure out the program on mac for example using gngtools will install a few programs that you dont actually see the programs in applications and will have to go into your system settings to turn on a few options to be able to use it there are plenty of tutorials all over the clearweb you just need to work the search engines i would recomend not actually trying to buy anything illegal from anyone until you take the time to learn about privacy and encryption in might take a couple weeks to get the tools under your belt but it can protect you a lot more just remember you are never totally safe but you can do a lot of things to minimize being detected there are quite a few hacking sites and forums but some of them are going to require you to figure out a few other programs to get access to as well day for example has a hacking forum but you need to figure out jabber to be able to register . sorry if it sounds stupid but what is pip i really appreciate your help one more thing i was wondering where i can find like a site that talks about hacking or an underground hacking place or forum or something thanks again . you could try right here on the majestic garden go check the vendor section i think we have a few people selling canaris make sure you know pip nothing is safe stuff can always get intercepted bad vendor lost mail etc all your other questions i cant help you with other markets to try nucleus earth
