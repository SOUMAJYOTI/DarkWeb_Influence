losing money due to this or im just a dumb basementdwelling troll with nothing else to do you decide . it was widely discussed after the break how he ran off with the keys to escrow and their plan to

back i think the current admins were covering the sites ass to not cause more panic just my speculation . drclu recently posted a signed message from dpr after the newsweek article something about him
