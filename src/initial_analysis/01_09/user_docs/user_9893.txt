you because my english is so bad but i want to try because your words are gold for me so sorry in advance for some grammatical mistake you talk about magic and science nothing upon philosophy why i think that philosophy can be a real army in this war why i can talk of war because there is a war between who knows and who doesn t know plato s myth of the cave between the rich and the poor between who has a lot of time to enjoy his life and who spend his life like a slave of people more or less for analysts in general if i understand myself i can improve at the same time my knowledge of world and its laws knowledge is a weapon if lsd can help me to find the answers sorry but my english is so poor lsd is a weapon which is the way to use this weapons i don t know because the probability to fail or to get opposite effectes is very high in particular with lsd and with psycjedelics in general maybe it s maybe the same old story of revolutions in general and it s necessary to learn from past revolutions to avoid to do the same mistakes my tonight problem is this how to share my ideas how to share my experiences how to share my dreams how to share my lsd and why here in the tmg there are rivers of potential knowledge but is it enough i share because i think that sharing can help other people to face my same problems have we the same problems i don t know maybe yes but i m not sure the point is it s only a funny trip or my trip can change myself and then the existing it s only fun or it can be one of the greater chance to increase the speed of changes that you listed the real question is a real true rascally revolution of the existing it s necessary yes or not for me the answer is yes i would to know where my maestros failed my ideas are so old many people died following this ideas tonight i met a boy he s looking for some good lsd for years maybe i can help him he told me the story of his last trip violence money knives great fun hallucinations guns hate go crazy like an horse shit shit ship i am not sure now to share my dreams with him the question is clear haman shares his knowledge with his comunity to do good things freemason it s only an example share his knowledge with a few people for power i want to share my dreams because i think that a revolution is possible am i crazy am i crazy if i think that now we have a second chance to play our cards sorry for my bad englis i feel free to correct something thank you in advance for your patience fuck panopticon p s a nation s purpose is not to conquer other nations by military force war is not glorious war is not glorious but it exists today for someone war is glorious yet animals are sentiment creatures and should not be tortured for entertainmentthey are not tortured for entertainment what about

to you because my english is so bad but i want to try because your words are gold for me so sorry in advance for some grammatical mistake you talk about magic and science nothing upon philosophy why i think that philosophy can be a real army in this war why i can talk of war because there is a war between who knows and who doesnt know plates myth of the cave between the rich and the poor between who has a lot of time to enjoy his life and who spend his life like a slave of people more or less for analysts in general if i understand myself i can improve at the same time my knowledge of world and its laws knowledge is a weapon if lsd can help me to find the answers sorry but my english is so poor lsd is a weapon which is the way to use this weapons i done know because the probability to fail or to get opposite effectes is very high in particular with lsd and with psycjedelics in general maybe its maybe the same old story of revolutions in general and its necessary to learn from past revolutions to avoid to do the same mistakes my tonight problem is this how to share my ideas how to share my experiences how to share my dreams how to share my lsd and why here in the tmg there are rivers of potential knowledge but is it enough i share because i think that sharing can help other people to face my same problems have we the same problems i done know maybe yes but im not sure the point is its only a funny trip or my trip can change myself and then the existing its only fun or it can be one of the greater chance to increase the speed of changes that you listed the real question is a real true rascally revolution of the existing its necessary yes or not for me the answer is yes i would to know where my maestros failed my ideas are so old many people died following this ideas tonight i met a boy hes looking for some good lsd for years maybe i can help him he told me the story of his last trip violence money knives great fun hallucinations guns hate go crazy like an horse shit shit ship i am not sure now to share my dreams with him the question is clear haman shares his knowledge with his comunity to do good things freemason its only an example share his knowledge with a few people for power i want to share my dreams because i think that a revolution is possible am i crazy am i crazy if i think that now we have a second chance to play our cards sorry for my bad englis i feel free to correct something thank you in advance for your patience fuck panopticon p s a nations purpose is not to conquer other nations by military force war is not glorious war is not glorious but it exists today for someone war is glorious yet animals are sentiment creatures and should not be tortured for entertainmentthey are not tortured for entertainment what about circus and zoo is not a torture maybe but they are tortured for sure for medical reasons for example i see so many dogs in chains for all their life long is it not torture women and children are individuals in their own right and not possessionsslaves in general i think about china and asia in general are a possession of their masters censorship and restriction of information should be kept to a minimumis this maximum enough sorry but i play for the maximum mutually acceptable relationships between people should not be criminalised pollution and degradation of the environment are everyones problemim not sure about it or better in my country the things are different like it or not we are responsible for caring for the planets larger species we no longer live on earth we live in the solar system

our fora thank you i look forward to more posts from you . quote from one man show on august amyou talk about magic and science nothing upon philosophy why at an early age i was seduced by diogenes

to change the system in order to change the people i thought it was necessary to change the people in order to change the system we did not argue or disagree we talked about the different ways we saw the world we were on different paths travelling in the same direction perhaps towards the same imaginary destination when younger there were times when i threw myself into the fray i wore my chickens liberation badge with pride oblivious of the potential danger of flashbacks sometimes i relapse my priorites confused worrying about the battery hens slaughtered in the last three weeks instead of the people slaughtered in gaza but now i am a poor warrior in the fight against injustice before donning my armour picking up my weapons and joining the battle i hesitate reluctant doubtful wanting

greenbud on july pm of course we really only have to change one mind to stop a war it is the opposite of the comic bomb in this sense it takes one hit to save millions while the bomb takes them away interesting comparison also lsd was first synthesized by hoffman in november and he took his famous bicycle ride in april unclean fission was first performed in and the first fission chain reaction happened in december just a few months before the first bicycle day coincidence or part of a larger plan idk but food for thought anyhow anyhow i have the feeling lately that some serious shit might be going down soon not a world war but maybe weve passed an environment tipping point which will lead to economic downturn and rational resource wars as far as lsd and the unclean bomb go i think the years were a golden age of material sciences and the synthesis of lsd was heavily influenced by the invention of column chromatography hofmann wrote that the equipment was very new and advanced for the time this is not dissimilar from how the comic centrifuge precise explosive fuses and reactors culminated into the a bomb with graphene carbon nanotubes d printing and other advances in material science today one could argue that we are well into another golden age now what dreams may come to fruition i hope more constructive and peaceful things things that use nature and less scarce resources to achieve what we current think is impossible cheap solar cells fusion generators bioremediation clean seasteading custom biomass fermentation space mining etc i think you are right that without man made scarcity there is no need for war to the future . quote from strangeangels on july pmquote from greenbud on july pm of course we really only have to change one mind to stop a war it
