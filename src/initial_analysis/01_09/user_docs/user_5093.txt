lets not forget our captain who was lost at sea . it looks like ross will be in florida fed with white bulger who btw is doing less time than ross whitey bulger was the inspiration for jack nicholson s character in the departed only he had two abi agents on his payroll giving him intel on every gangster and criminal op in boston and beyond in addition to tipping him off murdering rivals etc whitey was convicted of killing something like people and is strongly suspected to have ordered the murders of over human beings this is in addition to drug smuggling racketeering gambling prostitution human trafficking extortion kidnapping etc he was on the run for years and was second only to bin laden on the fbis most wanted for a while just to put what ross did in perspective he made a web site earned some bitcoin and lived like a hipster at a very meager tech startup the neighborhood in sf where he lived is scale but not lavish middle class type of turban area ross is a hero and soon a few years maybe when dozens of markets have come and gone when the people of the us get sick of locking up decent people for life he will be free until then he should be an example of what the state does to the individual if ross had incorporated and ran sr like backpage is run he would be doing right now but as an individual his rights are less than a corporation this is ross main cause individual liberty from coersion and violence either directly or indirectly the use of violence is the sole exclusive power of the government everything else can be corporatized if you want to live in a world where you live in company dorms have company cops in your company town and buy at the company store well i sure as hell don t supporting bitcoin and legal reform as well as limiting the powers of corporations is one option for freeing ross or moving in that direction at least up until the late s in the us corporations had to have their charters with the government renewed and when they did they had to provide they were supplying goods and services necessary and in accordance with the welfare of the people and public good if they did not they could lose their charter and be subject to disincorporation or heavy fines with assets sold at auction it is time we start giving rights back to individual citizens instead of taking them away bit by bit free ross end the drug war down with prisons up with people that was fun to say thank you don t forget to march on guy fawkes night . lets not forget our captain who was lost at sea . wow thats just fucked . it looks like ross will be in
