for those who want to sign transactions but dont have bitin core or the top electrum plugin i have a new multi platform signing solution right now its a very rough first draft but it is capable of signing tx that are well formed so i figured i should release it now and deal with the nice stuff id like to have later initials release is very basin capable of signing transactions only it can take the json normally given to the tmp electrum plugin it will prompt for the private key this can be in any form pybitcointools supports and will output the raw hex of the signed transaction it will also ensure that the signatures are in correct order and enough are found for the transaction to be considered complete otherwise it will simply show you the half signed transaction if you supplied a valid signature but the other sig wasnt supplied or invalid in some way it cant push to the blockchain copy paste into a site like to actually submit it to the network please submit any bug reports on the github site so i can track them or tell me if it works for you here if you dont use the windows binary you have to install pybitcointools from or download the release version at that has it included note that there are no installation scripts for the program if youre not using windows its designed to be unbarred and run in place windows users can download only and run the installer it should work i have given this very limited testing on windows all i know is that it seems to compile and it was able to sign a few test transactions i had for it the problem is that i had a full gtk and python installation already on the machine id be very interested in knowing how install work on machines that dont have python gtk or the visual c redistributable components that i install at the end of the

to a web browser my initials push is to get the following to work works by untarring no installation on tails just run the file binary installer for windows with no additional installs of any software outside of the vs redistributables which will be packages in the installer it can sign a transaction with one input that is from a p sh address that needs a signature it can create a new transaction with one input to a number of outputs needing only the address and redeemscript it can automatically create new public keys for use with multi sig in a deterministic fashion based on bip it can automatically find the correct key when signing given that it knows the correct bip master key account number and the number of total keys that have been used in the chain user data is securely stored in a way that a malicious party is not able to get any information about the keys being used by the user nor can they modify the configuration file in any way without the tampering being discovered as long as the password for the file is kept secure storage of redeemscripts for p sh adresses if this is easy to implement right now im being a bit blocked by trying to get penal to work on windows if i dont get it working soon ill have to choose another way to secure the config life which will set me back a fair bit once that is working the rest of the features should come together quickly . looks good owock well done on getting it functions and published have you considered a web gui version using something like pyjamas to give a local browser based interface a la dark wallet also what stage

it will save your settings automatically sign any transaction that has one of those keys in it your keys and settings are protected with nacl and your password which is uses a bit salt along with pbkdf to derive your key i have also put in extra testing on the windows binary installer i have tested it against a fresh from the disc copy of windows it should install with no issues also i have included a compiled binary tarball for tails just untar the it somewhere and run the pymultisigtool py file download the windows binary or the tails tarball at can also leave any issues you want on
