when you step back and look at it the vendor should be the one you trust you are ingesting his drugs so you better have some sort of trust about the person the site hosting the escrow is the same shadowy figure you have never met as any vendor is but the difference is that you can build a trusting working relationship with a vendor and narrow down the risks substantially where as with an escrow host you simply can not i think this never fe motto is a way for buyers and noobs to be lazy in their reseaarch and not do their due diligence as far as finding vendors almost every buyer i

payment system to increase security and make tracing btc more difficult we apologize for any delays resulting from this we also had one batch of payments run two instances simultaneously several days ago which is what you most likely noticed in the form of a double payment sent to you that was a one time issue and will not happen again and all accounts have been balanced after that just for reference we consider user and bitin safety to be our highest priority and having a delayed and completely detached payment system keeps our system protected from a number of potential attacks that other markets have experienced so io bsm continues to have the best support in the biz day good to hear they are constantly making security updates it really gives me positive vibes not only that the site is secure and very anonymous but that they wouldnt spend so much time on coding if they were gon a just grab and run really gives me a feeling of stability remember sr never made any notable
