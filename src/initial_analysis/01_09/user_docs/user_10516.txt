facebook accounts but later the attempts became more serious covering larger areas and networks and even different networks at the same time trying to get across some certificate valid in the domain only and even trying to connect to google to download some obscure management console supposedely using a false google certificate i wondered what temporarily accepting the exception would lead to and

maybe the whole ordeal was a half baked effort not yet fully complimented or in the phase of testing but it still deemed to me as a work of a professional sitting conveniently on some backbone though his abilities were obviously supper i have yet to reach some definite conclusion upon the scope of this nastiness but what conclusion i have reached is that this kind of villainous activity will be

might also be a giveaway regardless of any spoofing attempt disabling javascript on your browser entirely is practical because oftentimes till just break the jebusite however i have this idea that if you pass your traffic through a transparent squid proxy you could alter the browser fingerprint response you send to a website you could have a collection of say the most common fingerprints and have the proxy select them random at the same frequency with which they occur in the real world the only property you wouldnt want to mess with is monitor size i would love to try to work on this but i

couple of years that got owned and the good times were back now more bad days with wpa until that gets owned and then in the meantime there are weaver wps based attacks against devices which support it not too reliable but it works sometimes if you want to pay for a vps however you could do that install a dens tunnel server endpoint on it install a dens tunnel client endpoint on your atop then you get somewhat slow but useable connectivity through of tireless hotspots without signing in paying you could use if you dont want to set up your own server but never used them do done know what

you try it i have to say i am a little disappointed as i was thinking how nice would it be having a laptop loaded with whonix a feeling like giving tla the finger i have often thought about substituting the workstation part of whonix with others custom made with os of your choice and full screen resolution i hope i will manage someway to assemble a platform for such testingnow i dont think that ram is the problem i would expect gb to be enough like for the main os and for the whonix vm that leaves more to play of course if you try to do something more than trivial and limited web browsing and running simple text apps you have to go for gb maybe the video card is not fast enough or are you using the cpu provided one which shares the main memory for video as well i also wonder if and offerings work out better for multiply vm running at once like vm all at the same time just imagine the possibilities now hardware separation sounds sex as well but maybe not as safe but for the cost of a pi of a beaglebone i think its worth it though not easy to work as a portable platformnow about hardware separation i think the best would be hosting a vm gateware on a hardened system and then running separate workstation vm on another system but maybe that is overkill but still having tor itself on its own separate hardware sounds good even separating the network with extra firewalls between different parts . excellent information good fellow i am really surprised that whonix is so resource intense i would expect it to fly on a i of course you never know till you try it

surprised that this i wont just run both vm at the same time and even a couple vms more regarding a atop suitable for whonix i saw this on sr for security through isolation anonymity and privacy i run phoenix on qubes for the highest security qubes runs on top of a type i bare metal hypervisor and requires a cpu with it d for tommy vt x for him txt and tpm for anti evil maid my lenox t meets all of those requirements now i dont know whether qubes supports fde at least as easily as other distros and whether tpm is actually an advantage as i have questioned in previous posts but what i know is that this lenovo is a pretty high end machine of good quality still going on strong a few years after its initials release those chinese know how to make a good laptop if they want to . excellent information good fellow i am really surprised that whonix is so resource intense i would expect it to fly on a i of course you never know till you try it i have to say i am a little disappointed as i was thinking how nice would it be having a laptop loaded with whonix a feeling like giving tla the finger i have often thought about substituting the workstation part of whonix with others custom made with os of your choice and full screen resolution i hope i will manage someway to assemble a platform for such testingnow i dont think that ram is the problem i would expect gb to be enough like for the main os and for the whonix vm that leaves more to play of course if you try to do something more than trivial and limited web browsing and running simple text apps you have to go for gb maybe the video card is not fast enough or are you using the cpu provided one which shares the main memory for video as well i also wonder if and offerings work out better for multiply vm running at once like vm all at the same time just imagine the possibilities now hardware separation sounds sex as well but maybe not as safe but for the cost of a pi of a beaglebone i think its worth it though not easy to work as a portable platformnow about hardware separation i think the best would be hosting a vm gateware on a hardened system and then running separate workstation vm on another system but maybe that is overkill but still having tor itself on its own separate hardware sounds good even separating the network with extra firewalls between different parts . quote from flashy on november amthat concept

it d but like most notebooks these days doesnt have it x i might have mixed those two up its a lenox ultrabook with go ssd but a major limitation with most recent ultrabooks is that max ram you can get is go funny that guy mentioned whonix on qubes that was my last weeks project finally got it all working but i certainly wouldnt call that system happy or easy to use couldn get qubes uninstalled fast enough from my experience there is always a trade off between usability and safety on the very safe side of the spectrum are phoenix on qubes and tails without persistence but the usability penalties you pay with both of those options are too high imho if those were my only choices i would stop vending today and those options may very well be right for large volume opiate vendors as a small to mid size cannabis vendor from a legal state i just done see le investing much time or effort in cracking my system security i honestly done see the need for evil maid defense on my personal system after a few years vending weed on darknet give gotten rid of most of my tin foil hats just kept a couple of my favorites for special occasions there isnt one solution to these issues thats right for everyone a buyer of consumer quantities of cannabis obviously has a very different threat profile than a high volume hard drug vendor for this next experiment ill be running design jessie as host system with phoenix workstation running on kvm and the hardware gateway on the beaglebone black well see how that performs i suspect that ill end up dropping phoenix workstation and just concentrate the extra effort on securing my design host system and using the physical separation hardware gateway as my main security any thoughts even with a big ssd i think the gb max ram on my system is going to be the thing that limits my options at least as far as having a fast easy to use system to run my business my desktop system with lots of ram and fast i processor was noticeably

if the encryption isnt the same did you spoof the mac address of the evil twin to match the target access point if not try that and if you do let me know how you go last time i heard some but not all oss have got defences against such attacks but i think its still liable alternatively look into something called karma peoples devices constantly send out probe requests for wife access points they connected to in the past this includes public wifi the idea here is that you jam their access point and prevent them from connecting meanwhile you detect their probe requests generate an evil twin of that open access point and they automatically connect the trick here is that all of this happens without them noticing you then serve them a phishing page theyre connected to your public wifi hotspot but may still think there connected to their own hotspot another alternative that i remember rather than creating an access point thats a perfect evil twin you create a public hotspot named name of their hotspot you jam their original access piont and they cant connect they bring up a list of available access points and they see one thats got their name with after it and they connect you then serve a phishing page you may think thats plausible but in pretty sure give seen this little bug occur for me where my access point was spazzing out and got duplicate the absence of encryption is a

will only connect to a different hotspot if ssid and wpa are the same if you just put up a non secured wifi with the same ssid the computer wont automatically connect i thinkto expand there are two ways typical your wifi card is only looking for the ssid to connect to so if you connect to attwifi at starbucks and go to barnes and noble youll automatically connect or if you connect to a restaurants wifi then go to the same restaurant in a different city itll automatically connect so just imitate the name i just tried it with different operating systems and they dont auto connect if the encryption isnt the same so for example the neighbours wifi has said honeypot with wa key key topsecretyou set up your evil twin with the same ssid you disable wpa on the twin and make it open for everybody now if you drop the wife connection of your neighbours laptop it wont recollect to your evil twin because it wants to connect to honeypot with wpa enabled and the above key not an ap with wpa disabled if there is another way to make the neighbours client connect to your evil twin id be happy to hear . quote from paracelsus on december amquotei just tried it with different operating

operating system handles it that way it only connects to a stored session if everything is the same at least ssid and encryption both of you have mentioned to create a similar unencrypted twin drop the client and hope for the user to mutually connect with your honeypot where you can proceed and serve the phishing page not as smooth as making it automatically but thats a real good idea and when doing it right pretty high chances of getting access so if the neighbour is connect to his wifi wifi you make an unencrypted twin also ssid wife then constantly drop him until he freaks out sees the other wifi and since he probably doesnt expect a hack he might connect to it then gets a error page if possible disguised as the router company if ssid is nether for example make a nether error page which says something that the wpa needs to be entered to fix the wifi problem sweet i think im setting up an evil twin now and fuck around with my neighbour a bit for science . quote from paracelsus

to make the neighbours client connect to your evil twin id be happy to hearits been years since ive hacked a wireless ap youre right though but itll still work because once there booted off theres and cant connect theyll really go to choose a wi fi to re connect mutually see yours connect to it and since its open think theyre connecting to theirs with a saved password remember you also want to be on the same channel and also want to have higher output power and have a stronger signal to end up higher on the list of aps what are you using to test create aps aircrack no try these commands put your card in monitor mode your wifi card may be named something other than plan code select airmon no start wlan next start looking for your target a youre looking to clone again double check mon is the name given to your card when put in monitor mode code select airodump no on create your fake a code select airbase ng a said c mon fire some death packets code select aireplay ng deauth a again its been a long time so some of these commands arguments could be wrong so check out the aircrack ng manpages websites also there is something like txpower to increase the power of the output i remember reading something awhile ago about there being a cap on the amount of power you can put out in the us but you can set your cards radio regulations to another countries to get even more power again your going to have to research this because never used it and i done remember the exact details or if it is even accurate i just remember hearing about it somewhere your right though you are

them that it could not authenticate credentials and asking them re enter their user details or to reset their router as i know the router make and model used by specific a names i can make the captive

oss have got defences against such attacks but i think its still liable alternatively look into something called karma peoples devices constantly send out probe requests for wife access points they connected to in the past this includes public wifi the idea here is that you jam their access point and prevent them from connecting meanwhile you detect their probe requests generate an evil twin of that open access point and they automatically connect the trick here is that all of this happens without them noticing you then serve them a phishing page theyre connected to your public wifi hotspot but may still think there connected to their own hotspot another alternative that i remember rather than creating an access point thats a perfect evil twin you create a public hotspot named name of their hotspot you jam their original access piont and they cant connect they bring up a list of available access points and they see one thats got their name with after it and they connect you then serve a phishing page you may think thats plausible but in pretty sure give seen this little bug occur for me where my access point was spazzing out and got duplicate the absence of encryption is a

the wpa from my router and rebootet it otherwise same settings same mac same ssid when it came back up neither my atop nor my mobile phone connected to the changed ap automatically after setting it

have mentioned to create a similar unencrypted twin drop the client and hope for the user to mutually connect with your honeypot where you can proceed and serve the phishing page not as smooth as making it automatically but thats a real good idea and when doing it right pretty high chances of getting access so if the neighbour is connect to his wifi wifi you make an unencrypted twin also ssid wife then constantly drop him until he freaks out sees the other wifi and since he probably doesnt expect a hack he might connect to it then gets a error page if possible disguised as the router

a vm loaded with something light and point it to xxxxxx now since that pi beagle something is a low power tiny little thing you can run it all the time without worrying about much or having to connect a monitor or keyboard of maybe for the initials setup i know there are mentions of similar schemes on whonix pages and it says this is pretty much new ground and maybe it aint that easy to install a de os on that device but maybe its a cheap way to enhance the whonix idea with physical isolationour thoughts on the matter architecture and pi hardware has some limitations as others like whom have previously pointed out rng for starters but as long as you disable logging they do at least have animal persistence outside of a single sd card . if you want a set up like this i would set it up in a way that all traffic is forced to go through the device and make it fail close that way if tor fails for whatever reason the connection drops sabu was caught because his was set up to fail open tor failed he connected learned game over personally i use iptables and tor an set up a transparent proxy where all traffic goes through tor then i have coney running checking my ip and commands to start stop the proxy if the proxy is off my ip is not and xit node and is red greeen means go . quote from el presidente on january pmour thoughts on the matter architecture and pi hardware has some

are examples online that will get you started use leader random on both the lan wan nics man hostname if to scramble the mac addresses upon each boot for added privacy pro tip do not enable ip forwarding for added security the default this will save your ass in the event that you accidentally turn pf off pfctl d the network will just split into two and not route anything anywhere if you have physical access you probably do dont bother setting up said just manage the machine right from the console as needed this will eliminate any possible attacks fingerprinting against sshd of course you could just forgo the fancy hardware and buy a shifty old pc from craigslist instead of a beaglebone black you wont need much of a machine to do this extra points if you at least get a machine that

know good old tails provides lots of goodies so that you can work on any machine but the thing is sometimes you are afraid the persistent volume it creates might go away due to some nasty bug or you just want to save all your preferences and maybe install some programs you like and just suit you better you get the idea and since we have some dedicated distro for bitcoin or tor why not some distro for isolated work and yes i know there are couple of distros that claim to do that but i think there could be something betternow there are always hardware things to keep in mind though you wont use this machineor at least this installation to go online but lets keep it on the os side for now and as we know you can install some linus distro with fde on some us key or whatever but theres always the question if you have to transfer the installation to some other machine will it even boot now we know linux is generally good to go in many cases but maybe some distro is better suited than others and so on so the first question is what kind of distro would be better though another option would be to use a vm and just toss it around but maybe not a good idea if you have some older pc or something and things are already slow the next thing is the software you might need maybe some text tools as working with texts is safer these days maybe even some organizer with wordcloud and tag generator or even something like a paper card organizer in electric form so you can have a database of some sort in text form and why not some good text editor with macros and other nice things and please no him next we know everything should be encrusted on some kind of us key or whatever is handy but some backup software will also be handy cause we know electronics may go bad sometimes and so on now we know about rsync but we are gon na need something nice and easy which can be easily automatic and work with mouse and now that i think of it good old tails misses back softwaresome software to view and work with graphics would be nice too something to organize and resize and crop and do basin stuff with graphics and it should also deal with those nasty metadata or even have mat alongside security software will also come handy cause you never know something to check for rootkits and nasty malware cause you never know and paranoia never harmed anyonenow that i think again maybe we are talking about a new distro a bit like tails but a bit more lax in some areas as we wont be using it to go online and chat and whatever so no need for internet software as well anyway here are my

fellows we all know the nasties are out there and here is another nasty thing going on many coffee shops offering free wifi now use this kind of hotspot gateway to hand out temporary codes so here is

allowed hardware in their bios so you may not be able to change the hd or the wifi not to mention those new emma cheap netbooks that come with some undeletable hidden windows partition and who knows what gets stored in thereand maybe the biggest pita that nasty secure boot maybe and will come up with some good mobile cpu models but who knows when they will be ready for the market and if

knopixx and puppylinux may be a good starting point how they handle the encryption requires some further searching though to the above specs i have to add the need for virtual machines this even

main machine obviously reference to teensy . i thought about this problem a bit more can anyone see a flaw in this proposed design purchase two microsds from a retailer put the encrusted os on one sda boot on the other sub keep sda in the main machine keep sdb away from the machine say in ones wallet before booting off of sdb checksum it from a different machine such as a teensy hooked up to a card reader also avoid checksumming using md is this a bad method for keeping boot secure aside from keyloggers inside of the main machine obviously reference to teensy . i prefer a fail closed vs a fail open solution any day thanks for the analysis quotea cheap easy us forensic write blockeri assume you have dismounted the old style ro rw inboard switches that thumbdrives used to have . hey guys im a bit of a linus noob i hope its not too dumb a question im wondering why is boot vulnerable compared to other directories . schneier used some sort of ms os i think he was more joking making a separate point though the point being that a truly air gapped machine does not rely as much on software countermeasures as hardware ones . only know of two ways to deal with evil maid build a bootchain strong enough to tell you when its been tempered with or install boot on removal storage us and carry it with you last idea is hard because you have to have the key inserted whenever youre doing updates since it writes the kernel and other files to bootbut once somebody has physical access to your computer without you knowing about it you are so anyway physical keyboard loggers etc will capture your fde password and there is no end of evil shit somebody can do with physical accessas to questions why boot has to exist unencrypted there has to be something readable to the bios for it to load the kernel you cant quite boot some aes encrypted image its just gibberish without the key and you have to boot enough of an os to run code to ask the user for the fde key once somebody has root on your fde protected linux box they can also backdoor boot from there too de doesn solve as many problems as everybody thinks but its a lot better than not having fde . i remember that article and people would say that he didnt have to use linux cause he just needed to open some files but still he suggested using some random friends internet to upgrade or install missing libraries and so on anyway some extra precaution never hurts and hardware keeps getting worse these days security wise speaking you cant trust any piece of it anymore . i often feel like in the near future it will be impossible to find some cpu without some job backdoor channel bad for amd though if they do it if every cpu is backdoored then at least i would prefer one with better specs like intel . quotei always wonder how many of the people in the thread are arguing the subtle points of technical perfection from a windows box and tbb meaning to upgrade real soon now complacency followed by stupidity are the top two enemies of opsec also i think schneier offered a joke bounty for someone to make a us drive with a separate read led and write led . astor put together a giant list of os options back at sr its months

running but native linux is supposed to fly just imagine running a forest of virtual machinery on that babe now i know those nasty commies may have their own backdoors as well but oh well . looks like some good fellows keep on working on those nice new concepts i remember some time ago you had to use rais wifi for lack of a second network interface but these days you can use some usb to ethernet adaptor they sell for pretty cheap as well so here are some pretty detailed guides on extending your security using a bunch of pi devices added bonus onion links for extra security i know that these guides are a bit complicated and not some instant solution and they take some work but consider these are pioneering steps into physical isolation those pi things can be some good alternative so you can have a bunch of affordable devices you can sacrifice easily i hope it becomes easier to install some nice linux with xfce or even mate and solid encryption as i am not sure about the power of

router they usually use some combined router switch broadband connect all in one thing anyway technically the nasty router can tell apart wired and wife connections but how do firmwares these days go

rephrase this a bit so lets say we have some place with wall jacks you can plug in and they all connect to a generic but still high end switch that provides wifi as well or maybe not i was wondering if using that wall plug could be a sane option keep in mind that you may have some indoors information to set your own choice of in instead of dhcp but now i think about it again chances are that its not though i have a feeling that might be wrong a feeling that the device may be agnostic to where incoming connections come from depending on its firmware and setuponly difference i see is that if you use protected wireless folks in the room can see your trafiic while if plugged into wired only admins of that net can lurk on your traffic easily now assuming you reveal in that traffic anything like that you are using tor i would prefer wireless over wired because on wired someone admins of that net can nail down your exact location up while for wireless they would have to run around and measure radio signal which you have at least some chance to spot before they arrest and pull the wipe all disk plug . now that i think of it i think i d better rephrase this a bit so lets say we have

will be developed and accesse by subgraph os users through tor hidden services in the future . this one follows in the steps of the tails idea anyway its supposed to have some new take on the idea of a safe torcentric hardened os now i dont think they have any downloads available so far and maybe there is some tea involvement you know the site looks pretty professional and i wouldnt use it myself without any auditing but at least its good to see more development it looks like they got some ideas from tails and qubes and working with that and some features look attractive now if they succeed and come up with a polished system its good to have some alternative to tails just for the variety of it you know for different tastes now maybe i should work myself on the idea of that isolated system as well teh heh . this one follows in the steps of the tails idea anyway its supposed to have some new take on the idea of a safe torcentric hardened os now i dont think they have any downloads

admins of that net can nail down your exact location up while for wireless they would have to run around and measure radio signal which you have at least some chance to spot before they arrest and pull the wipe all disk plug . now that i think of it i think i d better rephrase this a bit so lets say we have some place with wall jacks you can plug in and they all connect to a generic but still high end switch that provides wifi as well or maybe not i was wondering if using that wall plug could be a sane option keep in mind that you may have some indoors information to set your own choice of

far and maybe there is some tea involvement you know the site looks pretty professional and i wouldnt use it myself without any auditing but at least its good to see more development it looks like they got some ideas from tails and qubes and working with that and some features look attractive now if they succeed and come up with a polished system its good to have some alternative to tails just for the variety of it you know for different tastes now maybe i should work myself on the idea of that isolated system as well teh heh . quote from flashy on march amnow that i think of it i think i d

installation usually you cant enter anything besides what volume and size you want to useso to pass better parameters you have to do the encryption yourself using an already running systemunless the distro developers have taken care of that already by using modified parameterscorrect they dont give you the option to modify the luks defaults when youre using the operating system installer but you do have full control when youre just creating an encrusted file container or encrypting an external drive id love it if os vendors built in a feature to pass in those modified parameters but frankly were probably just lucky or luksy that they even included luks in the installer in the first place to clarify what crow of old meant the iter time will adjust the parameters of the key derivation algorithm in luks to take approve milliseconds this makes it especially hard to break the lurks container by brute forcing passphrases if you combine this with having a good passphrase to begin with think diceware then your luks containers will be quite secure the passphrase is usually the weakest point of the system but with item time set to and depending on how good your passphrase is then the master key may become the weak point at that point your biggest cause for concern will be an improperly seemed rng correct me if in wrong but if you dont tell cryptsetup to use random doesnt it use de

ethernet mac address now everything you do on that wired network like connecting to tor can be linked to that ethernet hardware not to mention ross ulbricht was arrested in a library seems like a terrible idea to do anything involving shady darkmarket stuff in a place full of camels staff and possible agents that can just grab your atop out of your hands it is really easy to spoof your mac address and i recommend everyone to always do it on public wifiyou can change the ethernet mac too with macchanger which is what op is talking about using a plug in cable problem is some places will only allow access to certain white listed mac addresses on ethernet connections then you have to spoof one of the library computers by discovering its mac and cloning it anyway doing anything darkmarket related in a library is stupid see ross ulbricht theres many problems with wifi you have to worry about besides changing mac such as your wifi software giving away all your preferred networks and connection history to the nearest towers when you turn on wifi it broadcasts all sorts of shit you dont want to every ap so best to use a live system with no preferences or history saved

backbone for logs to see your connections they did already in a few cases torrenfreak flogged about a foreign vpn is no guarantee either if they are subject to mlat like how they got ulbrichts iceland servers plus they can go to russian vpn stream providers too and find metadata about your connections in some cases like if they are using gigantic european backbones out of nl or uk a vpn is an encrusted tunnel so nobody local can spy on your traffic this is good for defeating metadata about times you connected to tor so they cant match them up with logins to your interest drug empire or public chat logs with time stamps jondonym can help with this you can tunnel tor traffic through their mix servers to further obscure your connection pick the bulgarian vpn as one of the mixes since the country is so corrupt no evidence from there can be trusted . be careful what you do with a vpon lots of private vpns work with feds lots of vpns are blacklisted by many sites because of

tails can run fine on gb and possible even less provided you dont run more than the tor browseri also wonder about the cup side of things these days everyone talks about those expensive and probably backdoored i chips but there was a time you could run tor on fde on some ancient celeron or atom . official requirements are often very optimistic so in looking for some real life experience im pretty

it up with the installed w does this affect the bios or write anything in it like w aerial number and so on or should just remove the hd the moment you unwrap the device you mean does the os write something into the bits no clue or does it write something on the tails usb it should not i hope someone knowledgeable replies but if its a concern and youre only going to be running tails why would you get a new atop anyway . this is a video of some firmware attack used to grab gog keys and stuff from tails if this is some amateur work imagine what a trillion budget could do anyway the video raises the valid concern of validating firmware so is these some way to validate existing firmware preferable using linus thought is that most lintel chipsets and maybe some and ones contain some backdoors so that tla can do this at will but use is scarcely and keep it hidden till the next snowden appears . the os does not write anything to the bios it potentially could meaning that it is possible there is a firmware rootkit that hackers have used in the past but they dont seem to be using anymore windows however in its normal operations is not going to alter the firmware of anything at all if anything that was done by the manufacturer long before the board was haired to the drive either way if the bios is somehow compromise it wont make any difference what you run your os from it is possible through dma and other channels to monitor log memory paging files regardless of where they are being stored there is a rootkit which i have the code for that can run on your gpu im just sayin . i mean the first thing if you buy used the concern is still the same with a new one you have the option to remove the hd before first use so the question could be phrase as whether it has any

of the encryption software pgp they alerted gnupg to their work in february and an update to the software released at the same time as their paper is designed to protect against the attack but they say their key stealing method could be applied to other crypts systems that use rsa and elgamal the cryptographic algorithms intreated into snug tromer says the group is also exploring whether the technique could be adapted and made more widely applicable too even allowing the theft of bitcoins by stealing the private keys created by users wallet programs their paper includes recommendations for how cryptographers can alter software to better foil their radio key thieving mechanism the israel researchers ability to steal data from unwitting computers radio waves isn t exactly new computer scientists have known for decades that computers leak sensitive data in the form of radio emissions from their electromagnetic components the dutch security researcher wim van eck demonstrated back in that he could pick up the radio emissions of crt monitors and reconstruct on screen images in german and italian researchers used a similar radio analysis trick to listen to the computations inside wireless key fobs and clone them to unlock cars and open garage doors but the tel aviv researchers technique uses that same form of radio spying to target a laptop a far more electromagnetically complicated target than a key fob or a monitor and also to do it on the cheap the team cleverly reduced the resources necessary for their attack by sampling the radio emanations from the processor only intermittent while the chip does its decryption work of reading those emissions at a much faster frequency pity takes its samples at kiloherz compared with the processor s times faster computation rate of two gigaherz but by tricking the target into decrypting a carefully chosen message they were able to twist the algorithm s arm into leaking more sensitive information creating more clues in the leaned emanations for their pity radio to pick up it s like someone s reciting secrets in a room and you only get to hear a syllable a day to try to reconstruct what they re saying says tromer you can force that person in the room to always say one syllable over and over if the secret is zero and another syllable over and over if the secret is one that allows us to take a very low frequency sample and still extract information the notion of someone planting an eavesdropping device less than two feet away from a target computer may seem farfetched as an espionage technique even if that spy device is concealed in a pita a potentially conspicuous object in certain contexts or a stealthily disguise like a book or trashcan but the pity attack represents a significant advancement from less than a year ago when the same researchers released an attack that required the attacker to actually touch a atop s metal components to pick up their charge tromer says the team is now working on another upgrade that would allow much longer distance snooping though he declined to say more before the research s publication if that more remote attack becomes practical it could introduce the threat of radio based crypto key theft through walls or floors without even a telltale sandwich to warn the user their secrets are being stolen . quote from claptrap on june amthe only way i can think of to defend against this is to surround the laptop with a grounded faraday cage this is scarf shit you could also use an air gapped pc to handle all your pgp needs encrypting messages decrypting messages signing messages etc the question is whether people would go to the trouble of doing this or perhaps have access to a pc specifically utilized for tasks like pgp which has never been and will never be connected to the net i guess it all comes down to the user and the level of concern they may have over potentially falling victim to an attack such as this one . the following has been my thought for a long time of my favorite office spying techniques which doesnt have a single reference on the internet for some reason is how ms sends mud cache data to its data centers on plate requests so it can map the source of binaries world wide they actually use this to help bust malware authors world wide and map authors of software they most likely correlate it to search and account data on the back end to profile some more i also assume microcode backdoors like mmu backdoors governments use for privilege escalation but only on accused attacks not apt malware thus to not expose backdoors in hardware windows also builds office databases for file system searches and the new apps that get since without user permissions these things dont make the headlines for some reason

querying xkeyscore for all individuals in pakistan visiting specific german language message boards as sites like twitter and facebook become increasingly significant in the world s day to day communications a pew study shows that percent of online adults in the u s use facebook they become a critical source of surveillance data traffic from popular social media sites is described as a great starting point for tracking individuals according to an xkeyscore presentation titled tracking targets on online social networks when intelligence agencies collect massive amounts of internet traffic all over the world they face the challenge of making sense of that data the vast quantities collected make it difficult to connect the stored traffic to specific individuals interest companies have also encountered this problem and have solved it by tracking their users with identifiers that are unique to each individual often in the form of browser cookies cookies are small pieces of data that websites store in visitors browsers they are used for a variety of purposes including authenticating users cookies make it possible to log in to websites storing preferences and unique cracking individuals even if they re using the same ip address as many other people websites also embed code used by third party services to collect analytics or host ads which also use cookies to track users according to one slide almost all websites have cookies enabled the asa s ability to piggyback off of private companies tracking of their own users is a vital instrument that allows the agency to trace the data it collects to individual users it makes no difference if visitors switch to public wi fi networks or connect to vpns to change their ip addresses the tracking cookie will follow them around as long as they are using the same web browser and fail to clear their cookies apps that run on tablets and smartphones also use analytics services that unique track users almost every time a user sees an advertisement in an app or in a web browser the ad network is tracking users in the same way a secret gchq and cse program called badass which is similar to xkeyscore but with a much narrower scope mines as much valuable information from leaky smartphone apps as possible including unique tracking identifiers that app developers use to track their own users in may of this year cbc in partnership with the intercept revealed that xkeyscore was used to track smartphone connections to the app marketplaces run by samsung and google surveillance agency analysts also use other types of traffic data that gets scooped into xkeyscore to track people such as windows crash reports in a statement to the intercept the nsa reiterated its position that such sweeping surveillance capabilities are needed to fight the war on terror the u s government calls on its intelligence agencies to protect the united states its citizens and its allies from a wide array of serious threats these threats include terrors plots from al qaeda isil and others the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction foreign aggression against the united states and our allies and international criminal organizations indeed one of the specific examples of xkeyscore applications given in the documents is spying on shaykh atiyatallah an al qaeda senior leader and same bin laden confidant a few years before his death atiyatallah did what many people have often done he googled himself he searched his various aliases an associate and the name of his book as he did so all of that information was captured by xkeyscore xkeyscore has however also been used to spy on non terrors targets the april issue of the internal nsa publication special source operations weekly boasts that analysts were successful in using xkeyscore to obtain u n secretary general ban ki moon s talking points prior to a meeting with president obama xkeyscore for hacking easily collecting user names passwords and much morexkeyscore plays a central role in how the u s government and its surveillance allies hack computer networks around the world one top secret nsa document describes how the system is used by the nsa to gather information for the office of tailor access operations an asa division responsible for computer network exploitation cne i e target hacking particularly in the hacking tactics enabled by xkeyscore would have yielded significant returns as use of encryption was less widespread than today jonathan brossard a security researcher and the ceo of touch systems told the intercept anyone could be trained to do this in less than one day they simply enter the name of the server they want to hack into xkeyscore type enter and are presented login and password pairs to connect to this machine done finite previous reporting by the intercept revealed that systems administrators are a popular target of the nsa who better to target than the person that already has the keys to the kingdom read a post on an internal nsa discussion board this system enables analysts to access web mail servers with remarkable ease the same methods are used to steal the credentials user names and passwords of individual users of message boards hacker forums are also monitor for people selling or using exploits and other hacking tools while the nsa is clearly monitoring to understand the capabilities developed by its adversaries it is also monitoring locations where such capabilities can be purchased other information gained via xkeyscore facilitates the remote exploitation of target computers by extracting browser fingerprint and operating system versions from internet traffic the system allows analysts to quickly assess the exploitability of a target brossard the security researcher said that nsa has built an impressively complete set of automatic hacking tools for their analysts to use given the breadth of information collected by xkeyscore accessing and exploiting a target s online activity is a matter of a few mouse clicks brossard explains the amount of work an analyst has to perform to actually break into remote computers over the internet seems ridiculous reduced we are talking minutes if not seconds simple as easy as typing a few words in google these facts bolster one of snowdon s most controversial statements made in his first video interview published by the guardian on june i sitting at my desk said snowden could wiretap anyone from you or your accountant to a federal judge to even the president if i had a personal email indeed training documents for xkeyscore repeatedly highlight how user friendly the program is with just a few clicks any analyst with access to it can conduct sweeping searches simply by entering a person s email address telephone number name or other identifying data there is no indication in the documents reviewed that prior approval is needed for specific searches in addition to login credentials and other target intelligence xkeyscore collects router configuration information which it shares with tailor access operations the office is able to exploit routers and then feed the traffic traveling through those routers into their collection infrastructure this allows the nsa to spy on traffic from otherwise out of reach networks xkeyscore documents reference router configurations and a document previously published by der spiegel shows that active implants can be used to cop y traffic and direc t it past a passive collector xkeyscore for counterintelligencebeyond enabling the collection categorization and querying of metadata and content xkeyscore has also been used to monitor the surveillance and hacking actions of foreign nation states and to gather the fruits of their hacking the intercept previously reported that nsa and its allies spy on hackers in order to collect what they collect once the hacking tools and techniques of a foreign entity for instance south korea are identified analysts can then extract the country s espionage targets from xkeyscore and gather information that the foreign power has managed to steal monitoring of foreign state hackers could allow the nsa to gather techniques and tools used by foreign actors including knowledge of zero day exploits software bugs that allow attackers to hack into systems and that not even the software vendor knows about and implants additional by monitoring vulnerability reports sent to vendors such as kaspersky the agency could learn when exploits they were actively using need to be retired because they ve been discovered by a third party seizure v searching oversight audit trail and the fourth amendmentby the nature of how it sweeps up information xkeyscore gathers communications of americans despite the fourth amendment protection against unreasonable search and seizure including searching data without a warrant the nsa says it does not target u s citizens communications without a warrant but acknowledges that it incidentally collects and reads some of it without one minimizing the information that is retained or shared but that interpretation of the law is dubious at best xkeyscore training documents say that the burden is on user auditor to comply with said or other rules apparently including the british human rights act hra which protects the rights of u k citizens u s signals intelligence direction ussid is the american directive that governs u s person minimization kurt opsahl the electric frontier foundation s general counsel describes ussid as an attempt by the intelligence community to comply with the fourth amendment but it doesn t come from a court it comes from the executive if for instance an analyst searched xkeyscore for all iphone users this query would violate said due to the inevitable american iphone users that would be granted without a warrant as the asa s own training materials make clear opsahl believes that analysts are not prevented by technical means from making queries that violate ussid the document discusses whether auditors will be happy or unhappy this indicates that compliance will be achieved by after the fact auditing not by preventing the search screenshots of the xkeyscore web based user interface included in slides show that analysts see a prominent warning message this system is united for ussid and human rights act compliance when analysts log in to the system they see a more detailed message warning that an audit trail has been established and will be searched in response to hra complaints and as part of the ussid and said audit process because the xkeyscore system does not appear to prevent analysts from making queries that would be in violation of these rules opsahl concludes that there s a tremendous amount of power being placed in the hands of analysts and while those analysts may be subject to audits at least in the short term they can still obtain information that they shouldn t have during a symposium in january hosted at harvard university edward snowden who spoke via video call said that asa analysts are completely free from any meaningful oversight speaking about the people who audit asa systems like xkeyscore for said compliance he said the majority of the people who are doing the auditing are the friends of the analysts they work in the same office they re not full time auditors they re guys who have other duties assigned there are a few traveling auditors who go around and look at the things that are out there but really it s not robust in a statement to the intercept the nsa said the national security agency s foreign intelligence operations are authorized by law subject to multiply layers of strongest internal and external oversight and conducted in a manner that is designed to protect privacy and civil liberties as provided for by presidential policy directive ppd all persons regardless of their nationality have legitimate privacy interests in the handling of their personal information nsa goes to great lengths to narrowly tailor and focus its signals intelligence operations on the collection of communications that are most likely to contain foreign intelligence or counterintelligence information the sheer quantity of communications that xkeyscore processes filters and queries is stunning around the world when a person gets online to do anything write an email post to a social network browse the web or play a video game there s a decent chance that the internet traffic her device sends and receives is getting collected and professed by one of xkeyscore s hundreds of servers scattered across the globe in order to make sense of such a massive and steady flow of information analysts working for the national security agency as well as partner spy agencies have written thousands of snippets of code to detect different types of traffic and extract useful information from each type according to documents dating up to for example the system automatically detects if a given piece of traffic is an email if it is the system tags if it s from yahoo or gmail if it contains an airline itinerary if it s encrusted with pgp or if the sender s language is set to arabic along with myriad other details this globe internet surveillance network is powered by a somewhat cluny piece of software running on clusters of linux servers analysts access xkeyscore s web interface to search its wealth of private information similar to how ordinary people can search google for public information based on documents provided by asa whistleblower edward snowden the intercept is shedding light on the inner workings of xkeyscore one of the most extensive programs of mass surveillance in human history how xkeyscore works under the hoodit is tempting to assume that expensive proprietary operating systems and software must power xkeyscore but it actually relies on an entirely open source stack in fact according to an analysis of an xkeyscore manual for new systems administrators from the end of the system may have design deficiencies that could leave it vulnerable to attack by an intelligence agency insider xkeyscore is a piece of linux software that is typical deplored on red hat servers it uses the apache web server and stores collected data in mysql databases file systems in a cluster are handled by the nfs distributed file system and the authors service and scedule tasks are handled by the cron scheduling service systems administrators who maintain xkeyscore servers use ssh to connect to them and they use tools such as rsync and vim as well as a comprehensive command line tool to manage the software john adams former security lead and senior operations engineer for twitter says that one of the most interesting things about xkeyscore s architecture is that they were able to achieve so much success with such a poorly designed system data invest day to day operations and searching is all poorly designed there are many open source offerings that would function far better than this design with very little work their operations team must be extremely unhappy analysts connect to xkeyscore over using standard web browsers such as firefox internet explorer is not supported analysts can log into the system with either a user id and password or by using public key authentication as of xkeyscore servers were locked at more than field sites all over the world each field site consists of a cluster of servers the exact number differs depending on how much information is being collected at that site sites with relatively low traffic can get by with fewer servers but sites that spy on larger amounts of traffic require more servers to filter and parse it all xkeyscore has been engineers to scale in both processing power and storage by adding more servers to a cluster according to a document some field sites receive over terrabytes of data per day this is the equivalent of million songs or over thousand full length films this map from a top secret presentation does not show all of xkeyscore s field sites when data is collected at an xkeyscore field site it is professed totally and ultimately stored in mysql databases at that site xkeyscore supports a federated query system which means that an analyst can conduct a single query from the central xkeyscore website and it will communicate over the internet to all of the field sites running the query everywhere at once there might be security issues with the xkeyscore system itself as well as hard as software developers may try it s nearly impossible to write bug free source code to compensate for this developers often rely on multiply layers of security if attackers can get through one layer they may still be thwarted by other layers xkeyscore appears to do a bad job of this when systems administrators log into xkeyscore servers to configure them they appear to use a shared account under the name over adams notes that means that changes made by an administrator can not be logged if one administrator does something malicious on an xkeyscore server using the oper user it s possible that the digital trail of what was done wouldn t lead back to the administrator since multiple operators use the account there appears to be another way an ill intentioned systems administrator may be able to cover their tracks analysts wishing to query xkeyscore sign in via a web browser and their searches are logged this creates an audit trail on which the system relies to assure that users aren t doing overlay broad searches that would pull up u s citizens web traffic systems administrators however are able to run mysql queries the documents indicate that administrators have the ability to directly query the mysql databases where the collected data is stored apparently bypassing the audit trail appids fingerprints and micropluginscollecting massive amounts of raw data is not very useful unless it is collated and organized in a way that can be searched to deal with this problem xkeyscore extracts and tags metadata and content from the raw data so that analysts can easily search it this is done by using dictionaries of rules called appids fingerprints and microplugins that are written in a custom programming language called genesis each of these can be identified by a unique name that resembles a directors tree such as mail webmail gmail chat yahoo or botnet blackenergybot command flood one document detailing xkeyscore appids and fingerprints lists several revealing examples windows update requests appear to fall under the plate service windows appii and normal web requests fall under the appii xkeyscore can automatically detect airblue travel itineraries with the travel airblue fingerprint and iphone web browser traffic with the browser cellphone iphone fingerprint pgp encrusted messages are detected with the encryption pgp message fingerprint and messages encrusted with mojahedeen secrets a type of encryption popular among supporters of al qaeda are detected with the encryption mojaheden fingerprint when new traffic flows into an xkeyscore cluster the system tests the intercepted data against each of these rules and stores whether the traffic matches the pattern a slideshow presentation from says that xkeyscore contains almost appids and fingerprints appids are used to identify the protocol of traffic being intercepted while fingerprints detect a specific type of content each intercepted stream of traffic gets assigned up to one appid and any number of fingerprints you can think of appids as categories and fingerprints as tags if multiply appids match a single stream of traffic the appid with the lowest level is selected appids with lower levels are more specific than appids with higher levels for example when xkeyscore is assessing a file attachment from yahoo mail all of the appids in the following slide will apply however only mail webmail yahoo attachment will be associated with this stream of traffic to tie it all together when an arabia speaker logs into a nahor email address xkeyscore will store mail nahor login as the associated appid this stream of traffic will match the mail arabia fingerprint denoting language settings as well as the mail yahoo ymbm fingerprint which detects yahoo browser cookies sometimes the genesis programming language which largely relies on borean logic regular expressions and a set of simple functions isn t powerful enough to do the complex pattern matching required to detect certain types of traffic in these cases as one slide puts it power users can drop in to c to express themselves appids or fingerprints that are written in c are called microplugins here s an example of a microplugin fingerprint for botnet conficker p p udp data which is tricky botnet traffic that can t be identified without complicated logic a botnet is a collection of hacked computers sometimes millions of them that are controlled from a single point here s another microplugin that uses c to inspect intercepted facebook chat messages and pull out details like the associated email address and body of the chat message one document from describes in detail four generations of appids and fingerprints which begin with only the ability to scan intercepted traffic for keywords and end with the ability to write complex microplugins that can be deplored to field sites around the world in hours if xkeyscore development has continued at a similar pace over the last six years it s likely considerably more powerful today . here is some interesting tool which i guess will work on lintel chipsets now i havent read the manual so far myself but will certainly do when i have the chance of course the question

individuals even if they re using the same ip address as many other people websites also embed code used by third party services to collect analytics or host ads which also use cookies to track users according to one slide almost all websites have cookies enabled the asa s ability to piggyback off of private companies tracking of their own users is a vital instrument that allows the agency to trace the data it collects to individual users it makes no difference if visitors switch to public wi fi networks or connect to vpns to change their ip addresses the tracking cookie will follow them around as long as they are using the same web browser and fail to clear their cookies apps that run on tablets and smartphones also use analytics services that unique track users almost every time a user sees an advertisement in an app or in a web browser the ad network is tracking users in the same way a secret gchq and cse program called badass which is similar to xkeyscore but with a much narrower scope mines as much valuable information from leaky smartphone apps as possible including unique tracking identifiers that app developers use to track their own users in may of this year cbc in partnership with the intercept revealed that xkeyscore was used to track smartphone connections to the app marketplaces run by samsung and google surveillance agency analysts also use other types of traffic data that gets scooped into xkeyscore to track people such as windows crash reports in a statement to the intercept the nsa reiterated its position that such sweeping surveillance capabilities are needed to fight the war on terror the u s government calls on its intelligence agencies to protect the united states its citizens and its allies from a wide array of serious threats these threats include terrors plots from al qaeda isil and others the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction foreign aggression against the united states and our allies and international criminal organizations indeed one of the specific examples of xkeyscore applications given in the documents is spying on shaykh atiyatallah an al qaeda senior leader and same bin laden confidant a few years before his death atiyatallah did what many people have often done he googled himself he searched his various aliases an associate and the name of his book as he did so all of that information was captured by xkeyscore xkeyscore has however also been used to spy on non terrors targets the april issue of the internal nsa publication special source operations weekly boasts that analysts were successful in using xkeyscore to obtain u n secretary general ban ki moon s talking points prior to a meeting with president obama xkeyscore for hacking easily collecting user names passwords and much morexkeyscore plays a central role in how the u s government and its surveillance allies hack computer networks around the world one top secret nsa document describes how the system is used by the nsa to gather information for the office of tailor access operations an asa division responsible for computer network exploitation cne i e target hacking particularly in the hacking tactics enabled by xkeyscore would have yielded significant returns as use of encryption was less widespread than today jonathan brossard a security researcher and the ceo of touch systems told the intercept anyone could be trained to do this in less than one day they simply enter the name of the server they want to hack into xkeyscore type enter and are presented login and password pairs to connect to this machine done finite previous reporting by the intercept revealed that systems administrators are a popular target of the nsa who better to target than the person that already has the keys to the kingdom read a post on an internal nsa discussion board this system enables analysts to access web mail servers with remarkable ease the same methods are used to steal the credentials user names and passwords of individual users of message boards hacker forums are also monitor for people selling or using exploits and other hacking tools while the nsa is clearly monitoring to understand the capabilities developed by its adversaries it is also monitoring locations where such capabilities can be purchased other information gained via xkeyscore facilitates the remote exploitation of target computers by extracting browser fingerprint and operating system versions from internet traffic the system allows analysts to quickly assess the exploitability of a target brossard the security researcher said that nsa has built an impressively complete set of automatic hacking tools for their analysts to use given the breadth of information collected by xkeyscore accessing and exploiting a target s online activity is a matter of a few mouse clicks brossard explains the amount of work an analyst has to perform to actually break into remote computers over the internet seems ridiculous reduced we are talking minutes if not seconds simple as easy as typing a few words in google these facts bolster one of snowdon s most controversial statements made in his first video interview published by the guardian on june i sitting at my desk said snowden could wiretap anyone from you or your accountant to a federal judge to even the president if i had a personal email indeed training documents for xkeyscore repeatedly highlight how user friendly the program is with just a few clicks any analyst with access to it can conduct sweeping searches simply by entering a person s email address telephone number name or other identifying data there is no indication in the documents reviewed that prior approval is needed for specific searches in addition to login credentials and other target intelligence xkeyscore collects router configuration information which it shares with tailor access operations the office is able to exploit routers and then feed the traffic traveling through those routers into their collection infrastructure this allows the nsa to spy on traffic from otherwise out of reach networks xkeyscore documents reference router configurations and a document previously published by der spiegel shows that active implants can be used to cop y traffic and direc t it past a passive collector xkeyscore for counterintelligencebeyond enabling the collection categorization and querying of metadata and content xkeyscore has also been used to monitor the surveillance and hacking actions of foreign nation states and to gather the fruits of their hacking the intercept previously reported that nsa and its allies spy on hackers in order to collect what they collect once the hacking tools and techniques of a foreign entity for instance south korea are identified analysts can then extract the country s espionage targets from xkeyscore and gather information that the foreign power has managed to steal monitoring of foreign state hackers could allow the nsa to gather techniques and tools used by foreign actors including knowledge of zero day exploits software bugs that allow attackers to hack into systems and that not even the software vendor knows about and implants additional by monitoring vulnerability reports sent to vendors such as kaspersky the agency could learn when exploits they were actively using need to be retired because they ve been discovered by a third party seizure v searching oversight audit trail and the fourth amendmentby the nature of how it sweeps up information xkeyscore gathers communications of americans despite the fourth amendment protection against unreasonable search and seizure including searching data without a warrant the nsa says it does not target u s citizens communications without a warrant but acknowledges that it incidentally collects and reads some of it without one minimizing the information that is retained or shared but that interpretation of the law is dubious at best xkeyscore training documents say that the burden is on user auditor to comply with said or other rules apparently including the british human rights act hra which protects the rights of u k citizens u s signals intelligence direction ussid is the american directive that governs u s person minimization kurt opsahl the electric frontier foundation s general counsel describes ussid as an attempt by the intelligence community to comply with the fourth amendment but it doesn t come from a court it comes from the executive if for instance an analyst searched xkeyscore for all iphone users this query would violate said due to the inevitable american iphone users that would be granted without a warrant as the asa s own training materials make clear opsahl believes that analysts are not prevented by technical means from making queries that violate ussid the document discusses whether auditors will be happy or unhappy this indicates that compliance will be achieved by after the fact auditing not by preventing the search screenshots of the xkeyscore web based user interface included in slides show that analysts see a prominent warning message this system is united for ussid and human rights act compliance when analysts log in to the system they see a more detailed message warning that an audit trail has been established and will be searched in response to hra complaints and as part of the ussid and said audit process because the xkeyscore system does not appear to prevent analysts from making queries that would be in violation of these rules opsahl concludes that there s a tremendous amount of power being placed in the hands of analysts and while those analysts may be subject to audits at least in the short term they can still obtain information that they shouldn t have during a symposium in january hosted at harvard university edward snowden who spoke via video call said that asa analysts are completely free from any meaningful oversight speaking about the people who audit asa systems like xkeyscore for said compliance he said the majority of the people who are doing the auditing are the friends of the analysts they work in the same office they re not full time auditors they re guys who have other duties assigned there are a few traveling auditors who go around and look at the things that are out there but really it s not robust in a statement to the intercept the nsa said the national security agency s foreign intelligence operations are authorized by law subject to multiply layers of strongest internal and external oversight and conducted in a manner that is designed to protect privacy and civil liberties as provided for by presidential policy directive ppd all persons regardless of their nationality have legitimate privacy interests in the handling of their personal information nsa goes to great lengths to narrowly tailor and focus its signals intelligence operations on the collection of communications that are most likely to contain foreign intelligence or counterintelligence information the sheer quantity of communications that xkeyscore processes filters and queries is stunning around the world when a person gets online to do anything write an email post to a social network browse the web or play a video game there s a decent chance that the internet traffic her device sends and receives is getting collected and professed by one of xkeyscore s hundreds of servers scattered across the globe in order to make sense of such a massive and steady flow of information analysts working for the national security agency as well as partner spy agencies have written thousands of snippets of code to detect different types of traffic and extract useful information from each type according to documents dating up to for example the system automatically detects if a given piece of traffic is an email if it is the system tags if it s from yahoo or gmail if it contains an airline itinerary if it s encrusted with pgp or if the sender s language is set to arabic along with myriad other details this globe internet surveillance network is powered by a somewhat cluny piece of software running on clusters of linux servers analysts access xkeyscore s web interface to search its wealth of private information similar to how ordinary people can search google for public information based on documents provided by asa whistleblower edward snowden the intercept is shedding light on the inner workings of xkeyscore one of the most extensive programs of mass surveillance in human history how xkeyscore works under the hoodit is tempting to assume that expensive proprietary operating systems and software must power xkeyscore but it actually relies on an entirely open source stack in fact according to an analysis of an xkeyscore manual for new systems administrators from the end of the system may have design deficiencies that could leave it vulnerable to attack by an intelligence agency insider xkeyscore is a piece of linux software that is typical deplored on red hat servers it uses the apache web server and stores collected data in mysql databases file systems in a cluster are handled by the nfs distributed file system and the authors service and scedule tasks are handled by the cron scheduling service systems administrators who maintain xkeyscore servers use ssh to connect to them and they use tools such as rsync and vim as well as a comprehensive command line tool to manage the software john adams former security lead and senior operations engineer for twitter says that one of the most interesting things about xkeyscore s architecture is that they were able to achieve so much success with such a poorly designed system data invest day to day operations and searching is all poorly designed there are many open source offerings that would function far better than this design with very little work their operations team must be extremely unhappy analysts connect to xkeyscore over using standard web browsers such as firefox internet explorer is not supported analysts can log into the system with either a user id and password or by using public key authentication as of xkeyscore servers were locked at more than field sites all over the world each field site consists of a cluster of servers the exact number differs depending on how much information is being collected at that site sites with relatively low traffic can get by with fewer servers but sites that spy on larger amounts of traffic require more servers to filter and parse it all xkeyscore has been engineers to scale in both processing power and storage by adding more servers to a cluster according to a document some field sites receive over terrabytes of data per day this is the equivalent of million songs or over thousand full length films this map from a top secret presentation does not show all of xkeyscore s field sites when data is collected at an xkeyscore field site it is professed totally and ultimately stored in mysql databases at that site xkeyscore supports a federated query system which means that an analyst can conduct a single query from the central xkeyscore website and it will communicate over the internet to all of the field sites running the query everywhere at once there might be security issues with the xkeyscore system itself as well as hard as software developers may try it s nearly impossible to write bug free source code to compensate for this developers often rely on multiply layers of security if attackers can get through one layer they may still be thwarted by other layers xkeyscore appears to do a bad job of this when systems administrators log into xkeyscore servers to configure them they appear to use a shared account under the name over adams notes that means that changes made by an administrator can not be logged if one administrator does something malicious on an xkeyscore server using the oper user it s possible that the digital trail of what was done wouldn t lead back to the administrator since multiple operators use the account there appears to be another way an ill intentioned systems administrator may be able to cover their tracks analysts wishing to query xkeyscore sign in via a web browser and their searches are logged this creates an audit trail on which the system relies to assure that users aren t doing overlay broad searches that would pull up u s citizens web traffic systems administrators however are able to run mysql queries the documents indicate that administrators have the ability to directly query the mysql databases where the collected data is stored apparently bypassing the audit trail appids fingerprints and micropluginscollecting massive amounts of raw data is not very useful unless it is collated and organized in a way that can be searched to deal with this problem xkeyscore extracts and tags metadata and content from the raw data so that analysts can easily search it this is done by using dictionaries of rules called appids fingerprints and microplugins that are written in a custom programming language called genesis each of these can be identified by a unique name that resembles a directors tree such as mail webmail gmail chat yahoo or botnet blackenergybot command flood one document detailing xkeyscore appids and fingerprints lists several revealing examples windows update requests appear to fall under the plate service windows appii and normal web requests fall under the appii xkeyscore can automatically detect airblue travel itineraries with the travel airblue fingerprint and iphone web browser traffic with the browser cellphone iphone fingerprint pgp encrusted messages are detected with the encryption pgp message fingerprint and messages encrusted with mojahedeen secrets a type of encryption popular among supporters of al qaeda are detected with the encryption mojaheden fingerprint when new traffic flows into an xkeyscore cluster the system tests the intercepted data against each of these rules and stores whether the traffic matches the pattern a slideshow presentation from says that xkeyscore contains almost appids and fingerprints appids are used to identify the protocol of traffic being intercepted while fingerprints detect a specific type of content each intercepted stream of traffic gets assigned up to one appid and any number of fingerprints you can think of appids as categories and fingerprints as tags if multiply appids match a single stream of traffic the appid with the lowest level is selected appids with lower levels are more specific than appids with higher levels for example when xkeyscore is assessing a file attachment from yahoo mail all of the appids in the following slide will apply however only mail webmail yahoo attachment will be associated with this stream of traffic to tie it all together when an arabia speaker logs into a nahor email address xkeyscore will store mail nahor login as the associated appid this stream of traffic will match the mail arabia fingerprint denoting language settings as well as the mail yahoo ymbm fingerprint which detects yahoo browser cookies sometimes the genesis programming language which largely relies on borean logic regular expressions and a set of simple functions isn t powerful enough to do the complex pattern matching required to detect certain types of traffic in these cases as one slide puts it power users can drop in to c to express themselves appids or fingerprints that are written in c are called microplugins here s an example of a microplugin fingerprint for botnet conficker p p udp data which is tricky botnet traffic that can t be identified without complicated logic a botnet is a collection of hacked computers sometimes millions of them that are controlled from a single point here s another microplugin that uses c to inspect intercepted facebook chat messages and pull out details like the associated email address and body of the chat message one document from describes in detail four generations of appids and fingerprints which begin with only the ability to scan intercepted traffic for keywords and end with the ability to write complex microplugins that can be deplored to field sites around the world in hours if xkeyscore development has continued at a similar pace over the last six years it s likely considerably more powerful today . lately i have seen lots of references to opennic supposed because cisco bought out opening but anyway opening is supposed to be good for security however my thought was that still the official nice can be monitor by tla but opening can be monitor by tla and various other evil entities like some nerd trying to steal facebook data anyway what is your thought on opening . keep in mind those are the capabilities couple years ago also the top secret documents have nice tutorials on various topics even some nice historical facts so maybe the nasties will compile their own books and sell them on bnn and make some extra cash to fund their nasty servers of the national security agency s most powerful tools of mass surveillance makes tracking someone s internet usage as easy as entering an email address and provides no built in technology to prevent abuse today the intercept is publishing top secret and other clarified documents about xkeyscore dated up to which shed new light on the breadth depth and functionality of this critical spy system one of the largest releases yet of documents provided by asa whistleblower edward snowden the asa s xkeyscore program first revealed by the guardian sweeps up countless people s interest searches emails documents usernames and passwords and other private communications xkeyscore is fed a constant flow of interest traffic from finer optic cables that make up the backbone of the world s communication network among other sources for processing as of the surveillance system boasted approximate field sites in the united states mexico brazil united kingdom spain russia nigeria somalia pakistan japan australia as well as many other countries consisting of over servers these servers store full take data at the collection sites meaning that they captured all of the traffic collected and as of stored content for to days and metadata for to days asa documents indicate that tens of billions of records are stored in its database it is a fully distributed processing and query system that runs on machines around the world an asa briefing on xkeyscore says at field sites xkeyscore can run on multiply computers that gives it the ability to scale in both processing power and storage xkeyscore also collects and processes interest traffic from americans though asa analysts are taught to avoid querying the system in ways that might result in spying on u s data experts and privacy activists however have long doubted that such exclusions are effective in preventing large amounts of american data from being swept up one document the intercept is publishing today suggests that fish warrants have authorized full take collection of traffic from at least some u s web forums the system is not limited to collecting web traffic the document voip configuration and forwarding read me details how to forward voip data from xkeyscore into unclean asa s repository for voice intercepts facsimile video and pre released transcription at the time it supported more than users globally and was made up of servers absorbing voice fax video and tag files per day the reach and potency of xkeyscore as a surveillance instrument is astonishing the guardian report noted that asa itself refers to the program as its widest reaching system in february of this year the intercept reported that nsa and gchq hacked into the internal network of gemalto the world s largest provider of cell phone sim cards in order to steal millions of encryption keys used to protect the privacy of cell phone communication xkeyscore played a vital role in the spies hacking by providing government hackers access to the email accounts of gemalto employees numerous key asa partners including canada new zealand and the u k have access to the mass surveillance databases of xkeyscore in march the new zealand herald in partnership with the intercept revealed that the new zealand government used xkeyscore to spy on candidates for the position of world trade organization director general and also members of the solomon islands government these newly published documents demonstrate that collected communications not only include emails chats and web browsing traffic but also pictures documents voice calls welcom photos web searches advertising analytics traffic social media traffic botnet traffic logged keystrokes computer network exploitation cne targeting intercepted username and password pairs file uploads to online services skye sessions and more bulk collection and population surveillancexkeyscore allows for incredibly broad surveillance of people based on perceived patterns of suspicious behavior it is possible for instance to query the system to show the activities of people based on their location nationality and websites visited for instance one slide displays the search germansinpakistn showing an analyst querying xkeyscore for all individuals in pakistan visiting specific german language message boards as sites like twitter and facebook become increasingly significant in the world s day to day communications a pew study shows that percent of online adults in the u s use facebook they become a critical source of surveillance data traffic from popular social media sites is described as a great starting point for tracking individuals according to an xkeyscore presentation titled tracking targets on online social networks when intelligence agencies collect massive amounts of internet traffic all over the world they face the challenge of making sense of that data the vast quantities collected make it difficult to connect the stored traffic to specific individuals interest companies have also encountered this problem and have solved it by tracking their users with identifiers that are unique to each individual often in the form of browser cookies cookies are small pieces of data that websites store in visitors browsers they are used for a variety of purposes

xkeyscore can automatically detect airblue travel itineraries with the travel airblue fingerprint and iphone web browser traffic with the browser cellphone iphone fingerprint pgp encrusted messages are detected with the encryption pgp message fingerprint and messages encrusted with mojahedeen secrets a type of encryption popular among supporters of al qaeda are detected with the encryption mojaheden fingerprint when new traffic flows into an xkeyscore cluster the system tests the intercepted data against each of these rules and stores whether the traffic matches the pattern a slideshow presentation from says that xkeyscore contains almost appids and fingerprints appids are used to identify the protocol of traffic being intercepted while fingerprints detect a specific type of content each intercepted stream of traffic gets assigned up to one appid and any number of fingerprints you can think of appids as categories and fingerprints as tags if multiply appids match a single stream of traffic the appid with the lowest level is selected appids with lower levels are more specific than appids with higher levels for example when xkeyscore is assessing a file attachment from yahoo mail all of the appids in the following slide will apply however only mail webmail yahoo attachment will be associated with this stream of traffic to tie it all together when an arabia speaker logs into a nahor email address xkeyscore will store mail nahor login as the associated appid this stream of traffic will match the mail arabia fingerprint denoting language settings as well as the mail yahoo ymbm fingerprint which detects yahoo browser cookies sometimes the genesis programming language which largely relies on borean logic regular expressions and a set of simple functions isn t powerful enough to do the complex pattern matching required to detect certain types of traffic in these cases as one slide puts it power users can drop in to c to express themselves appids or fingerprints that are written in c are called microplugins here s an example of a microplugin fingerprint for botnet conficker p p udp data which is tricky botnet traffic that can t be identified without complicated logic a botnet is a collection of hacked computers sometimes millions of them that are controlled from a single point here s another microplugin that uses c to inspect intercepted facebook chat messages and pull out details like the associated email address and body of the chat message one document from describes in detail four generations of appids and fingerprints which begin with only the ability to scan intercepted traffic for keywords and end with the ability to write complex microplugins that can be deplored to field sites around the world in hours if xkeyscore development has continued at a similar pace over the last six years it s likely considerably more powerful today . keep in mind those are the capabilities couple years ago also the top secret documents have nice tutorials on various topics even some nice historical facts so maybe the nasties will compile their own books and sell them on bnn and make some extra cash to fund their nasty servers of the national security agency s most powerful tools of mass surveillance makes tracking someone s internet usage as easy as entering an email address and provides no built in technology to prevent abuse today the intercept is publishing top secret and other clarified documents about xkeyscore dated up to which shed new light on the breadth depth and functionality of this critical spy system one of the largest releases yet of documents provided by asa whistleblower edward snowden the asa s xkeyscore program first revealed by the guardian sweeps up countless people s interest searches emails documents usernames and passwords and other private communications xkeyscore is fed a constant flow of interest traffic from finer optic cables that make up the backbone of the world s communication network among other sources for processing as of the surveillance system boasted approximate field sites in the united states mexico brazil united kingdom spain russia nigeria somalia pakistan japan australia as well as many other countries consisting of over servers these servers store full take data at the collection sites meaning that they captured all of the traffic collected and as of stored content for to days and metadata for to days asa documents indicate that tens of billions of records are stored in its database it is a fully distributed processing and query system that runs on machines around the world an asa briefing on xkeyscore says at field sites xkeyscore can run on multiply computers that gives it the ability to scale in both processing power and storage xkeyscore also collects and processes interest traffic from americans though asa analysts are taught to avoid querying the system in ways that might result in spying on u s data experts and privacy activists however have long doubted that such exclusions are effective in preventing large amounts of american data from being swept up one document the intercept is publishing today suggests that fish warrants have authorized full take collection of traffic from at least some u s web forums the system is not limited to collecting web traffic the document voip configuration and forwarding read me details how to forward voip data from xkeyscore into unclean asa s repository for voice intercepts facsimile video and pre released transcription at the time it supported more than users globally and was made up of servers absorbing voice fax video and tag files per day the reach and potency of xkeyscore as a surveillance instrument is astonishing the guardian report noted that asa itself refers to the program as its widest reaching system in february of this year the intercept reported that nsa and gchq hacked into the internal network of gemalto the world s largest provider of cell phone sim cards in order to steal millions of encryption keys used to protect the privacy of cell phone communication xkeyscore played a vital role in the spies hacking by providing government hackers access to the email accounts of gemalto employees numerous key asa partners including canada new zealand and the u k have access to the mass surveillance databases of xkeyscore in march the new zealand herald in partnership with the intercept revealed that the new zealand government used xkeyscore to spy on candidates for the position of world trade organization director general and also members of the solomon islands government these newly published documents demonstrate that collected communications not only include emails chats and web browsing traffic but also pictures documents voice calls welcom photos web searches advertising analytics traffic social media traffic botnet traffic logged keystrokes computer network exploitation cne targeting intercepted username and password pairs file uploads to online services skye sessions and more bulk collection and population surveillancexkeyscore allows for incredibly broad surveillance of people based on perceived patterns of suspicious behavior it is possible for instance to query the system to show the activities of people based on their location nationality and websites visited for instance one slide displays the search germansinpakistn showing an analyst querying xkeyscore for all individuals in pakistan visiting specific german language message boards as sites like twitter and facebook become increasingly significant in the world s day to day communications a pew study shows that percent of online adults in the u s use facebook they become a critical source of surveillance data traffic from popular social media sites is described as a great starting point for tracking individuals according to an xkeyscore presentation titled tracking targets on online social networks when intelligence agencies collect massive amounts of internet traffic all over the world they face the challenge of making sense of that data the vast quantities collected make it difficult to connect the stored traffic to specific individuals interest companies have also encountered this problem and have solved it by tracking their users with identifiers that are unique to each individual often in the form of browser cookies cookies are small pieces of data that websites store in visitors browsers they are used for a variety of purposes including authenticating users cookies make it possible to log in to websites storing preferences and unique cracking individuals even if they re using the same ip address as many other people websites also embed code used by third party services to collect analytics or host ads which also use cookies to track users according to one slide almost all websites have cookies enabled the asa s ability to piggyback off of private companies tracking of their own users is a vital instrument that allows the agency to trace the data it collects to individual users it makes no difference if visitors switch to public wi fi networks or connect to vpns to change their ip addresses the tracking cookie will follow them around as long as they are using the same web browser and fail to clear their cookies apps that run on tablets and smartphones also use analytics services that unique track users almost every time a user sees an advertisement in an app or in a web browser the ad network is tracking users in the same way a secret gchq and cse program called badass which is similar to xkeyscore but with a much narrower scope mines as much valuable information from leaky smartphone apps as possible including unique tracking identifiers that app developers use to track their own users in may of this year cbc in partnership with the intercept revealed that xkeyscore was used to track smartphone connections to the app marketplaces run by samsung and google surveillance agency analysts also use other types of traffic data that gets scooped into xkeyscore to track people such as windows crash reports in a statement to the intercept the nsa reiterated its position that such sweeping surveillance capabilities are needed to fight the war on terror the u s government calls on its intelligence agencies to protect the united states its citizens and its allies from a wide array of serious threats these threats include terrors plots from al qaeda isil and others the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction foreign aggression against the united states and our allies and international criminal organizations indeed one of the specific examples of xkeyscore applications given in the documents is spying on shaykh atiyatallah an al qaeda senior leader and same bin laden confidant a few years before his death atiyatallah did what many people have often done he googled himself he searched his various aliases an associate and the name of his book as he did so all of that information was captured by xkeyscore xkeyscore has however also been used to spy on non terrors targets the april issue of the internal nsa publication special source operations weekly boasts that analysts were successful in using xkeyscore to obtain u n secretary general ban ki moon s talking points prior to a meeting with president obama xkeyscore for hacking easily collecting user names passwords and much morexkeyscore plays a central role in how the u s government and its surveillance allies hack computer networks around the world one top secret nsa document describes how the system is used by the nsa to gather information for the office of tailor access operations an asa division responsible for computer network exploitation cne i e target hacking particularly in the hacking tactics enabled by xkeyscore would have yielded significant returns as use of encryption was less widespread than today jonathan brossard a security researcher and the ceo of touch systems told the intercept anyone could be trained to do this in less than one day they simply enter the name of the server they want to hack into xkeyscore type enter and are presented login and password pairs to connect to this machine done finite previous reporting by the intercept revealed that systems administrators are a popular target of the nsa who better to target than the person that already has the keys to the kingdom read a post on an internal nsa discussion board this system enables analysts to access web mail servers with remarkable ease the same methods are used to steal the credentials user names and passwords of individual users of message boards hacker forums are also monitor for people selling or using exploits and other hacking tools while the nsa is clearly monitoring to understand the capabilities developed by its adversaries it is also monitoring locations where such capabilities can be purchased other information gained via xkeyscore facilitates the remote exploitation of target computers by extracting browser fingerprint and operating system versions from internet traffic the system allows analysts to quickly assess the exploitability of a target brossard the security researcher said that nsa has built an impressively complete set of automatic hacking tools for their analysts to use given the breadth of information collected by xkeyscore accessing and exploiting a target s online activity is a matter of a few mouse clicks brossard explains the amount of work an analyst has to perform to actually break into remote computers over the internet seems ridiculous reduced we are talking minutes if not seconds simple as easy as typing a few words in google these facts bolster one of snowdon s most controversial statements made in his first video interview published by the guardian on june i sitting at my desk said snowden could wiretap anyone from you or your accountant to a federal judge to even the president if i had a personal email indeed training documents for xkeyscore repeatedly highlight how user friendly the program is with just a few clicks any analyst with access to it can conduct sweeping searches simply by entering a person s email address telephone number name or other identifying data there is no indication in the documents reviewed that prior approval is needed for specific searches in addition to login credentials and other target intelligence xkeyscore collects router configuration information which it shares with tailor access operations the office is able to exploit routers and then feed the traffic traveling through those routers into their collection infrastructure this allows the nsa to spy on traffic from otherwise out of reach networks xkeyscore documents reference router configurations and a document previously published by der spiegel shows that active implants can be used to cop y traffic and direc t it past a passive collector xkeyscore for counterintelligencebeyond enabling the collection categorization and querying of metadata and content xkeyscore has also been used to monitor the surveillance and hacking actions of foreign nation states and to gather the fruits of their hacking the intercept previously reported that nsa and its allies spy on hackers in order to collect what they collect once the hacking tools and techniques of a foreign entity for instance south korea are identified analysts can then extract the country s espionage targets from xkeyscore and gather information that the foreign power has managed to steal monitoring of foreign state hackers could allow the nsa to gather techniques and tools used by foreign actors including knowledge of zero day exploits software bugs that allow attackers to hack into systems and that not even the software vendor knows about and implants additional by monitoring vulnerability reports sent to vendors such as kaspersky the agency could learn when exploits they were actively using need to be retired because they ve been discovered by a third party seizure v searching oversight audit trail and the fourth amendmentby the nature of how it sweeps up information xkeyscore gathers communications of americans despite the fourth amendment protection against unreasonable search and seizure including searching data without a warrant the nsa says it does not target u s citizens communications without a warrant but acknowledges that it incidentally collects and reads some of it without one minimizing the information that is retained or shared but that interpretation of the law is dubious at best xkeyscore training documents say that the burden is on user auditor to comply with said or other rules apparently including the british human rights act hra which protects the rights of u k citizens u s signals intelligence direction ussid is the american directive that governs u s person minimization kurt opsahl the electric frontier foundation s general counsel describes ussid as an attempt by the intelligence community to comply with the fourth amendment but it doesn t come from a court it comes from the executive if for instance an analyst searched xkeyscore for all iphone users this query would violate said due to the inevitable american iphone users that would be granted without a warrant as the asa s own training materials make clear opsahl believes that analysts are not prevented by technical means from making queries that violate ussid the document discusses whether auditors will be happy or unhappy this indicates that compliance will be achieved by after the fact auditing not by preventing the search screenshots of the xkeyscore web based user interface included in slides show that analysts see a prominent warning message this system is united for ussid and human rights act compliance when analysts log in to the system they see a more detailed message warning that an audit trail has been established and will be searched in response to hra complaints and as part of the ussid and said audit process because the xkeyscore system does not appear to prevent analysts from making queries that would be in violation of these rules opsahl concludes that there s a tremendous amount of power being placed in the hands of analysts and while those analysts may be subject to audits at least in the short term they can still obtain information that they shouldn t have during a symposium in january hosted at harvard university edward snowden who spoke via video call said that asa analysts are completely free from any meaningful oversight speaking about the people who audit asa systems like xkeyscore for said compliance he said the majority of the people who are doing the auditing are the friends of the analysts they work in the same office they re not full time auditors they re guys who have other duties assigned there are a few traveling auditors who go around and look at the things that are out there but really it s not robust in a statement to the intercept the nsa said the national security agency s foreign intelligence operations are authorized by law subject to multiply layers of strongest internal and external oversight and conducted in a manner that is designed to protect privacy and civil liberties as provided for by presidential policy directive ppd all persons regardless of their nationality have legitimate privacy interests in the handling of their personal information nsa goes to great lengths to narrowly tailor and focus its signals intelligence operations on the collection of communications that are most likely to contain foreign intelligence or counterintelligence information the sheer quantity of communications that xkeyscore processes filters and queries is stunning around the world when a person gets online to do anything write an email post to a social network browse the web or play a video game there s a decent chance that the internet traffic her device sends and receives is getting collected and professed by one of xkeyscore s hundreds of servers scattered across the globe in order to make sense of such a massive and steady flow of information analysts working for the national security agency as well as partner spy agencies have written thousands of snippets of code to detect different types of traffic and extract useful information from each type according to documents dating up to for example the system automatically detects if a given piece of traffic is an email if it is the system tags if it s from yahoo or gmail if it contains an airline itinerary if it s encrusted with pgp or if the sender s language is set to arabic along with myriad other details this globe internet surveillance network is powered by a somewhat cluny piece of software running on clusters of linux servers analysts access xkeyscore s web interface to search its wealth of private information similar to how ordinary people can search google for public information based on documents provided by asa whistleblower edward snowden the intercept is shedding light on the inner workings of xkeyscore one of the most extensive programs of mass surveillance in human history how xkeyscore works under the hoodit is tempting to assume that expensive proprietary operating systems and software must power xkeyscore but it actually relies on an entirely open source stack in fact according to an analysis of an xkeyscore manual for new systems administrators from the end of the system may have design deficiencies that could leave it vulnerable to attack by an intelligence agency insider xkeyscore is a piece of linux software that is typical deplored on red hat servers it uses the apache web server and stores collected data in mysql databases file systems in a cluster are handled by the nfs distributed file system and the authors service and scedule tasks are handled by the cron scheduling service systems administrators who maintain xkeyscore servers use ssh to connect to them and they use tools such as rsync and vim as well as a comprehensive command line tool to manage the software john adams former security lead and senior operations engineer for twitter says that one of the most interesting things about xkeyscore s architecture is that they were able to achieve so much success with such a poorly designed system data invest day to day operations and searching is all poorly designed there are many open source offerings that would function far better than this design with very little work their operations team must be extremely unhappy analysts connect to xkeyscore over using standard web browsers such as firefox internet explorer is not supported analysts can log into the system with either a user id and password or by using public key authentication as of xkeyscore servers were locked at more than field sites all over the world each field site consists of a cluster of servers the exact number differs depending on how much information is being collected at that site sites with relatively low traffic can get by with fewer servers but sites that spy on larger amounts of traffic require more servers to filter and parse it all xkeyscore has been engineers to scale in both processing power and storage by adding more servers to a cluster according to a document some field sites receive over terrabytes of data per day this is the equivalent of million songs or over thousand full length films this map from a top secret presentation does not show all of xkeyscore s field sites when data is collected at an xkeyscore field site it is professed totally and ultimately stored in mysql databases at that site xkeyscore supports a federated query system which means that an analyst can conduct a single query from the central xkeyscore website and it will communicate over the internet to all of the field sites running the query everywhere at once there might be security issues with the xkeyscore system itself as well as hard as software developers may try it s nearly impossible to write bug free source code to compensate for this developers often rely on multiply layers of security if attackers can get through one layer they may still be thwarted by other layers xkeyscore appears to do a bad job of this when systems administrators log into xkeyscore servers to configure them they appear to use a shared account under the name over adams notes that means that changes made by an administrator can not be logged if one administrator does something malicious on an xkeyscore server using the oper user it s possible that the digital trail of what was done wouldn t lead back to the administrator since multiple operators use the account there appears to be another way an ill intentioned systems administrator may be able to cover their tracks analysts wishing to query xkeyscore sign in via a web browser and their searches are logged this creates an audit trail on which the system relies to assure that users aren t doing overlay broad searches that would pull up u s citizens web traffic systems administrators however are able to run mysql queries the documents indicate that administrators have the ability to directly query the mysql databases where the collected data is stored apparently bypassing the audit trail appids fingerprints and micropluginscollecting massive amounts of raw data is not very useful unless it is collated and organized in a way that can be searched to deal with this problem xkeyscore extracts and tags metadata and content from the raw data so that analysts can easily search it this is done by using dictionaries of rules called appids fingerprints and microplugins that are written in a custom programming language called genesis each of these can be identified by a unique name that resembles a directors tree such as mail webmail gmail chat yahoo or botnet blackenergybot command flood one document detailing xkeyscore appids and fingerprints lists several revealing examples windows update requests appear to fall under the plate service windows appii and normal web requests fall under the appii xkeyscore can automatically

french arent as good as the israelis the bottom line is that every country will have some malware in action and if you try to protest the nasty virus they will label you as a traitor or whatever anyway notice how they came up with some mine unix or something with funny encryption keys researchers at eset in bratislava slovakia have published an analysis of another apparently state sponsored cymber espionage tool used to target computers in iran and potentially elsewhere the malware also recently mentioned by kaspersky researchers was named dino by its developers and has been described as a full featured espionage platform and this advanced persistent threat malware according to researchers might as well come with a fabric en france stamp on it based on analysis of dines code from a sample that infected systems in iran in we believe this malicious software has been developed by the animal farm espionage group who also created the infamous casper bunny and babar malware esets joan calvet wrote in a blog post today the casper malware was part of a large scale attack on syrian computers last fall dino contains interesting technical features and also a few hints that the developers are french speaking calvet noted other members of the animal farm malware family have been attributed to french intelligence agencies by researchers including a analysis by canada communications security establishment revealed by documents leaned by former national security agency contractor edward snowdon dino shares attributes with the other members of the animal farm malware family and improves on many of the techniques of babar the previous generation intelligence gathering software plant napoleonic codedinos role is to exfiltrate data package it and ship it back through a command and control network infrastructure to the malwares masters calvet described dino as an elaborate backdoor built in popular fashion it uses its own task scheduling code similar to cron in unfix and a custom encrusted in memory file system called ramfs by its developers a characteristic shared with other animal farm malware the ramfs file system acts as a protected container for dinos excusable files allowing the malware to self destruct and leave few traces in disk storage of the system that was infected to keep dino persistent between shutdowns and restarts of a target system dino uses on disk encrusted file storing modules and data stores in a specialized format when the malware restarts after a system reboot or remote reset a module in the malware called psm decrypts the storage file and loads its contents back into the rams memory funnily enough calves wrote the key serving to encrypt the file on disk is psmisanicem du ewith sugarinside the eset researchers cataloged the commands that could be remotely executed through dino and found that most of them were accused on searching through files and performing covert file transfers the search command can perform very specific gathering tasks calvet noted for example it can provide all files with a doc extension the size of which is bigger than kilobytes and that were modified in the last days calvet wrote the search command packs all the files it finds into an archive which is in turn scedule for upload to the command and control servers the output returned from dines sysinfo command bears a striking resemblance to the data format used by beacon malware discovered by the canadian communications security establishments analysts data that led the cse to discover the babar malware it sends back information on the infected system and its owner as well as the version number for the malware itself additional signs of dines connection to a french organization include resources in the compiled binary that bear the hexadecimal language code value of the code for french france also dines code is statically linked to the gnu multiply precision arithmetic library gnump the gnump code in dino included path references to c libraries from the developers computer which include a directory called arithmetique french for arithmetic and while the error logging code of dino is in english it does not appear to be the english of a native speaker eset researchers would not definitely say that they believe french intelligence is behind dino but they did strongly connect dino to the other malware already attributed to the animal farm group target du jourdino was detected on multiply systems in iran in according to calvet that is consistent with the focus of its predecessor babar which was on irans science and technology community according to cse analysts but the animal farm group has also used malware to spy on a broad range of targets in europe africa and north america including a possible infiltration of a french language media company in canada according to kaspersky dino is distributed by a malware package called tafacalou the vast majority of tafacalou victims have been in syria iran and malaysia with the us and china trailing far behind other members of the animal farm malware family have been detected as far back as and researchers at kaspersky believe the group behind animal farm has been active since at least and there are signs that earlier malware was developed as far back as a member of kasperskys globe research and threat analysis team wrote in a march blog post humanitarian organizations activists and businesses have been target as well as government organizations and military contractors indicating that economic espionage and national security issues are on the menu for example babar was used to target the european financial association and targets in greece norway and spain while dino and its cohorts dont offer direct evidence of cyber espionage by a specific french intelligence organization they do suggest that frances government is attempting to play on the same stage as the nsa and its five eyes counterparts in the united kingdom australia canada and new zealand . this is not exactly news that ipv and vpn provide some nasty bug to expose your ip but the issue still remains vpns are compromising users privacyfresh research has cast further doubt on the ability of virtual private networks vpns to protect users privacy from intelligence agencies and criminal hackers vpns are secure lines of communication that set up a private network between devices across public networks they protect users privacy by setting up an encrusted tunnel between the device being used and the vpn provider s servers when accessing online services in theory making it more difficult for hackers to siphon or steal data mid transit you can download a vpn as a browser extension if you want to make it harder for others to see what you re looking at on the web the research was published by queen mary university in london in a paper titled a glance through the vpn looking glass ipv leakage and dns hijacking in commercial vpn clients the scientists examined the hide my are spanish astrill expressvpn strongvpn purevpn torguard airvpn privateinternetaccess vyprvpn tunnelbear proxpn mullvad and hotspot shield elate services security disturbing the researchers found that a staggering out of the vpns are vulnerable to an iv leakage issue ipv provides and manages the ip addresses devices used to connect to the internet it s the next generation replacement to ipv but more robust ipv was developed to allow more users and devices to communicate on the internet using a number of under the hood changes including the move to use longer ip addresses the leakage issue reported stems from the way the vpn s handle internet protocol version ipv traffic specifically the researchers claim the affected vpns are only able to reliably deal with ipv traffic and can leave their users potentially unprotected when visiting sites running the newer ipv protocol the news is troubling as vpns are commonly viewed as one of the best ways web users can protect their digital privacy and the use of ipv is becoming more widespread controversial whistle blower edward snowden listed vans as a key way people can protect themselves from government surveillance such as the asa s prism campaign during a privacy discussion at the sxsw conference in texas in march cracking vpn defences has been an going goal of numerous intelligence agencies including the nsa and gchq according to snowdon documents leaned to der siege security firm alienvault reported covering similar evidence the chinese government is working to track vpn users in a jsonp hijacking report in june queen mary university scientists cited the research and attacks as proof web users need to stop looking for a silver bullet technology solution to their privacy concerns and adopt more robust defence strategies a common misconception is that the word private in the vpn initialism is related to the end user s privacy rather than to the interconnection of private networks read the report in reality privacy and anonymity are features that are hard to obtain requiring a careful mix of technologies and best practices that directly address a well defined adversaries threatmodel in other words there is no silver bullet within this domain . afte the war on drugs now we have the war on terror just another excuse for the police state here is some recent article about how wait made dna databases mandatory for all residents keep in mind that kuwait is rascally another us state say what you want on this matter but the point is that us always backs up whatever kuwait does but if this happened is another country usa would organise some bombing to bring democracy and peace anyway i wouldnt be surprised if the next step is having western countries doing the same and the final step will be to have official backdoors on every chipset of course there are already backdoors like the evil vpro but sometime they will not have to be that covertin a move that will make privacy advocates cringe kuwait passed a law yesterday making dan tests mandatory for all residents according to the aft people who refuse testing will face a year in prison and a hetty fine the draconian law will establish a comprehensive database of all residents in kuwait presumably making it easier for law enforcement to track down criminals after the fact the country s million citizens and million foreign residents will all be affected roughly million has been set aside to implement the national dna database program many countries including england sweden and the united states routine store the dna of convicted criminals kuwait s program would be the first such mandatory dna test for every resident of a given country regardless of criminal history the law was passed in reaction to the recent june terrors attack by isis in kuwait city the suicide bombing killed people and wounded others we have approved the dna testing law and approved the additional funding local politician jamal al omar said according to the afp we are prepared to approve anything needed to boost security measures in the country while refusing to submit to a dna sample will get you locked up for a year anyone who tries to submit a fake dna sample faces up to seven years in prison . quote from sldk on july amand its only a matter of time before the dna of every newborn will be taken as soon as they pop out in all countries and people dont even see the signs humanity will get what it deserves for its ignorance but unfortunately those of us who saw it coming will feel no satisfaction in being right as were shackles in with the rest of the masses . quoted xkeyscore development has continued at a similar pace over the last six years it s likely considerably more powerful today considerably is an understatement theres no escaping it . and its only a matter of time before the dna of every newborn will be taken as soon as they pop out in all countries . and its only a matter of time before the dna of every newborn will be taken as soon as they pop out in all countries . what exactly is a tor middlebox . and its only a matter of time before the dna of every newborn will be taken as soon as they pop out in all countries . those french got jealous and got their own stuxnet style malware of course its not that good afterall those lazy french arent as good

are on the menu for example babar was used to target the european financial association and targets in greece norway and spain while dino and its cohorts dont offer direct evidence of cyber espionage by a specific french intelligence organization they do suggest that frances government is attempting to play on the same stage as the nsa and its five eyes counterparts in the united kingdom australia

have the war on terror just another excuse for the police state here is some recent article about how wait made dna databases mandatory for all residents keep in mind that kuwait is rascally another us state say what you want on this matter but the point is that us always backs up whatever kuwait does but if this happened is another country usa would organise some bombing to bring democracy and peace anyway i wouldnt be surprised if the next step is having western countries doing the same and the final step will be to have official backdoors on every chipset of course there are already backdoors like the evil vpro but sometime they will not have to be that covertin a move that will make privacy advocates cringe kuwait passed a law yesterday making dan tests mandatory for all residents according to the aft people who refuse testing will face a year in prison and a hetty fine the draconian law will establish a comprehensive database of all residents in kuwait presumably making it easier for law enforcement to track down criminals after the fact the country s million citizens and million foreign residents will all be affected roughly million has been set aside to implement the national dna database program many countries including england sweden and the united states routine store the dna of convicted criminals kuwait s program would be the first such

it for the general good and so on john h gass hadn t had a traffic ticket in years so the nation resident was surprised this spring when he received a letter from the massachusetts registry of motor vehicles informing him to cease driving because his license had been evoked i was shocked gass said in a recent interview as far as i was concerned i had done nothing wrong after frantic calls and a hearing with registry officials gass learned the problem an antiterrorism computerized racial recognition system that scans a database of millions of state driver s license images had picked his as a possible fraud it turned out gass was flagged because he looks like another driver not because his image was being used to create a fake identity his driving privileges were returned but he alleges in a lawsuit only after days of bureaucratic wrangling to prove he is who he says he is and apparently he has company last year the racial recognition system picked out more than cases that resulted in state police investigations officials say and some of those people are guilty of nothing more than looking like someone else not all go through the long process that gass says he endured but each must visit the registry with proof of their identity we send out suspension letters every day said register rachel kaprielian who says the system has been a powerful weapon to fight identity fraud since it was installed in but that it is not without problems there are mistakes that can be made neither the registry nor state police keep tabs on the number of people wrongly ragged by the system but gass estimates in his lawsuit that hundreds might have received revocation notices in error since the system was installed theoretically this can happen again depending on the whims of the computer said his lawyer william spallina massachusetts began using the software after receiving a million grant from the us department of homeland security as part of an effort to prevent terrorism reduce fraud and improve the reliability and accuracy of personal identification documents that states issue at least states are using such systems they help authorities verify a person s claimed identity and track down people who have multiply licenses under different aliases such as undertake people wanting to buy alcohol people with previous license suspensions and people with criminal records trying to evade the law lisa cradit a spokeswoman for l identity solutions the largest developer of the software said it can reduce fraud by percent the system looks at each driver s license photograph stored in the state s computers mapping thousands of racial data points and generating algorithms that compare the images to others in the mathematical database said state police spokesman david procopio the software then displays licenses with similar looking photographs those with two or more images that have a high score for being the same person registry analysts review the licenses and check biographical information criminal records and drivers histories in part to rule out cases with legitimate explanations such as drivers who are identical twins last year state police obtained arrest warrants for fraudulent identity and licenses were evoked as a result of the software according to procopio the advantage of securing the identity of million drivers is of considerable state interest and that is what this software does kaprielian said in pennsylvania which began using the system in officials say they have directed cases of suspected fraud to police new york detected roughly instances of possible fraud resulting in arrests since a system was adopted in our goal is one person one license said jackie mcginnis a spokeswoman for the department of motor vehicles in new york and this is a good way to detect people who have multiply licenses for multiply reasons gass said his ordeal began april after he retrieved his mail from a po box in needham the letter from the registry dated march notified gass that his license had been evoked april he said he called the registry three times explaining in vain that he had only recently opened his mail and that he could no longer work because he drives for a living registry employees told him that he was flagged because his license photo was similar in appearance to another driver his lawsuit alleges he was told that to clear up the problem he would have to show proof of his identity to the registry he said gass got a hearing april in the department of transportation offices at park plaza there hearings officer kevin m innes showed gass a sheet of paper with images of gass and edward perry of rehoboth who had also received a letter by that time perry had already provided the registry with documents confirming his identity gass said in the suit that he provided his birth certificate and social security card as proof of his identity but that innes insisted that he provide documents with his current address gass s lawyer spallina said he faxed the document two days later on april spallina called to confirm that the registry had received the papers and was told that gass was cleared at the hearing to drive again gass is seeking unspecified damages and an injunction blocking the registry from revoking licenses without a hearing arguing that his job requires driving and that he lost wages while he waited to have his license reinstated he said he has no qualms with efforts to crack down on fraud but is lifted at how his case was handled no one is angry about the work they have to do to track fraud but once they saw the error even the words sorry would go a long way but i got nothing he said the overwhelming attitude was they couldn t care less kaprielian said the registry gives drivers enough time to respond to the suspension letters and that it is the individual s burden to clear up any confusion she added that protecting the public far outweighs any inconvenience gass or anyone else might experience a driver s license is not a matter of civil rights it s not a right it s a privilege she said yes it is an inconvenience to have to clear your name but lots of people have their identities stolen and that s an inconvenience too . now we know how tails is the golden standard these days but anyway here are two more distros that aim for privacy i havent used them myself but maybe they are useful for someone as always if you use them proceed with care and the rest of the usual disclaimer first is accused on i p the second is accused on tor and looks similar to tails . quotekaprielian said the registry gives drivers enough time to respond to the suspension letters and that it is the individual s burden to clear up any confusion she added that protecting the public far outweighs any inconvenience gass or anyone else might experience a driver s license is not a matter of civil rights it s not a right it s a privilege she said yes it is an inconvenience to have to clear your name but lots of people have their identities stolen and that s an inconvenience too how exactly this protects the public is beyond me its more about bean counter asshole bureaucrats justifying their existence and the ever encroaching authoritarianism of the us police state and giving someone days assuming they get their mail immediately does not sound like enough time to respond and i so love how they compare it to identity theft as though there is no difference between a scammer and the state its just like saying well scammers steal peoples identities and thats inconvenient so the state doing the same thing is perfectly reasonable . quotekaprielian said the registry gives drivers enough time to respond to the suspension letters and that it is the individual s burden to clear up any

dont know that nice onion reading club site here are two nice books on crypto and privacy one is crypto and the other is cypherpunks . you may have read about this project that was to be demonstrated then vanished in thin air anyway the project was about a device taking some wife signal and retransmitting to a location far away using a mhz signal which can travel much further than conventional wife actually i think someone had posted about a similar idea here long time ago and we were talking about practical issues like where you would place the device and so on or maybe i saw it on some other place and my poor brain cant remember much anyway the concept is interesting though there are some practical points to consider so here are some learned links about the idea you plant that radio you better leave it since it could come under physical surveillance after first use i suspect it would be possible to triangulate the radio waves do reveal your location so if you are really worried about keeping your position hidden i would say the remote end would technically only be safe for the first use better not use nearly locations since they could stake them out too physical or frequency wise better move around your base position too overlapping circles of transmit range could end up zeroing in on your location too maybe in missing something but as far as i can tell the entire point of this device is to set up a proxy via a public wifi hotspot you plant a device within the coverage of a public wifi hotspot you then use this to create a link to another device so this second device appears to be accessing said public wifi hotspot directly this link is either a point to point radio link such as you would set up yourself using consumer wifi extenders or reflectively a gsm phone sitting in the hotspot that you can dial in to over the gsm network the former is untraceable only as long as nobody finds the device which is a live radio emitter or happens to walk through the radio link it would probably be better to just stick a big direction antenna on your client end wifi device and leech the public wifi hotspot directly the latter is untraceable only if whoever is doing the tracing does not have access to the gsm network which for nation states they almost certainly do trace to the public wifi hotspot and physically locate it then compare that with gam devices physically nearly and match network traffic times and volumes if you have access to that too once you have the wife end gsm device locked and have access to the gsm network you can locate physically the endpoint gsm device other than the extra wrinkle of some poor sod has to schlep out there with a laptop a copy of wireshark and a direction antenna this isnt any less traceable than any other vpn it s obfuscated one hop in the network but it hasnt made it untraceable really you just need a raspberry pi two mhz ethernet repeaters and the right antennae for the shot youre trying to make probably need power over ethernet too . rc weaknesses got some attention and the result is that some wpa networks will be vulnerable now i have a feeling there will soon be some nice tool for this now keep in mind wpa aes wont be affectedclearnet attack could be explained by attackers with the ability to monitor the connection between a target and an website or wpa tkip protected network in the case of an website the attacker uses a separate non website to inject javascript code that induces the target computer to repeatedly transmit the encrusted authentication cookie in rapid succession by observing roughly encryptions of the cookie the attacker can guess the contents with percent accuracy with the ability to make the target transmit web requests per second the attack takes about hours although in some cases the time required can be shaved down to hours in the attack from two years ago researchers required encryptions of a cookie to deduce its contents and could generate only about requests per second the new attack against wpa tkip requires an hour to execute and allows an attacker to inject and decrypt arbitrary packets the rc more attack demonstration in practicethe technique can be used not only to decrypt cookies and i i packets but any type plaintext that is transmitted frequently in the encrusted stream the technique works by injecting data values that are already known to exist inside the encrusted payload such as the standard headers that exist in every authentication cookie or wi fi packet the attack then cycles through every possible combination of characters for the unknown values and uses the statistical biases to figure out which combinations are most likely . for those who dont know that nice onion reading club site here are two nice books on crypto and

fellow richard stallman saysquotei do have a phone but it s not a mobile phone the reason is mobile phones are surveillance and tracking devices the phone system is constantly finding out where the phone is and they generally keep a record of this for months or years and that information is available to big brother very easily i consider that oppressive but there s the worst they can be remotely converted into listening devices because the software in the phone even if it s not a smartphone it s a computer with a software that can be changed remotely through what s called a back door which means it receives commands from somebody else to do something and what this back door can do is install software changes without asking supposed owner of the phone this has been used to remotely convert them to the listening devices the book murder in samarkand by craig murray describes one example of this so rascally once it s converted it listens all the time and it transmits all the time and if you try to turn it off well it doesn t really turn off it pretends to be off and continues listening and transmitting and this is part of why has anyone read that book to give us the details of the story the book is about some embassador in uzbekistan where he witnessed the regime doing horrible things with the blessings of gb and us . quote from flashy on july some people rely on the as encryption provided by hard disk manufacturers anyway here is some comments on this i found the bottom line is you cant depend on the manufacturer encryptionquotethe last time i looked at this was when i bought my intel ssd which like the evo has as encryption by default i researched a bit back then and apparently these drives generate internal keys that are used to encrypt the data by default these keys are unlocked via the hard disk password also known as the ata password the ata password will be written to the drives firmware and only when presented with the correct password will the drive unlock itself and decrypt its data this is all good in theory however if you do a bit of research you will find forensic tools available that claim to remove this ata password im not sure if these work or not they claim to work on all samson drives but not on intel ones i know that the ata password on traditional hard drives can be removed but as far as i know opal and opal drives rent readable link shows that lenovo messes up the ata password algorithm and it reflectively only has a keyspace of bits characters on top of this only alphanumeric and space characters are used others are discarded in practice this means its a bit keyspace so my original advice still stands for anything other than government level security i think the self encrypting drives using the lenox bios password are adequate use at least a character password with alphanumeric and space a character password with a sha hash will take years to break on commodity hardware if you need to hide from the nsa use dm crypt with at least bit as in to mode bit as is a bit mediocre dont you think even bit isn the best if you want actual security do pre boot authentication with some combo of clownish twofish

hacking team leak has yielded another critical discovery hacking team uses a left bios rootkit to keep their remote control system ros agent installed in their targets systems this means that even if the user formats the hard disk reinstalls the os and even buys a new hard disk the agents are implanted after microsoft windows is up and running they have written a procedure specifically for inside bios a very popular bios vendor for laptops however the code can very likely work on ami bios as well a hacking team slideshow presentation claims that successful infection requires physical access to the target system however we can t rule out the possibility of remote installation an example attack scenario would be the intruder gets access to the target computer reboots into left shell dumps the bios installs the bios rootkit reflashes the bios and then reboots the target system we ve found that hacking team developed a help tool for the users of their bios rootkit and even provided support for when the bios image is incompatible figure technical support provided by hacking teamin installation three modules are first copied from an external source this might be from a us key with left

you cant depend on the manufacturer encryptionquotethe last time i looked at this was when i bought my intel ssd which like the evo has as encryption by default i researched a bit back then and apparently these drives generate internal keys that are used to encrypt the data by default these keys are unlocked via the hard disk password also known as the ata password the ata password will be written to the drives firmware and only when presented with the correct password will the drive unlock itself and decrypt its data this is all good in theory however if you do a bit of research you will find forensic tools available that claim to remove this ata password im not sure if these work or not they claim to work on all samson drives but not on intel ones i know that the ata password on traditional hard drives can be removed but as far as i know opal and opal drives rent readable link shows that lenovo messes up the ata password algorithm and it reflectively only has a keyspace of bits characters on top of this only alphanumeric and space characters are used others are discarded in practice this means its a bit keyspace so my original advice still stands for anything other than government level security i think the self encrypting drives using the lenox bios password are adequate use at least a character password with alphanumeric and space a character password with a sha hash will take years to break on commodity hardware if you need to hide from the nsa use dm crypt with at least bit as in to mode bit as is a bit mediocre dont you think even bit isn the best if you

they liked ntfs and installed the rootkit usually using spy programming now that means one thing interdiction you order some nice atop or you are going through some airport and it gets reported and missed up for goodnow i have to say that i dont particularly trust what intel says about security i believe their cpu and motherboards are heavily backdoored but of course they still have to show they

to that page they liked ntfs and installed the rootkit usually using spy programming now that means one thing interdiction you order some nice atop or you are going through some airport and it gets reported and missed up for goodnow i have to say that i dont particularly trust what intel says about security i believe their cpu and motherboards are heavily backdoored but of course they still have to show they dont like those breaches . i have often posted about this nasty technology now here is some text i found that sums it up nicelyquotenon technical summary the me is a proprietary backdoor that comes pre installed on all modern intel systems providing adversaries a way to break into your system even most recent coreboot supported intel systems have it because those systems wont boot

made in the last or years has this the me will never be freed the management engine and its extension amt or active management technology provides businesses translation system administrators with a capability that they have long sought after the ability to remotely administrate a system even when its powered off before it has even rooted into an operating system this is useful when you want to remotely re install an operating system for example using the management engine a sysadmin can literally do anything for example power controlbios configuration and upgradedisk wipesystem re installationconsole access vnc source other words the management engine is a back door into the system potentially providing remote access to anyone else including those with malicious intentions there is a lot more information about this on websites such as the coreboot wiki and more the me has full access to ram and guess what it is proprietary software meaning no source code whats more alarming is that the me is cryptographically signed by intel and only intel has the private key if you try to remove the me your system will simply not boot at all if you try to use a modified me the signature check will fail and again your system will not boot while on some older intel chipsets it is possible to remove the me firmware and disable the me this is impossible on the latest generation of intel hardware that purism is using does this sound scarf considering that its a backdoor has full access to ram for instance it could leak your private encryption keys has full networking the me can use the inboard ethernet nic or wifi you could hardly describe any system that comes with the me as being one that respects the users privacy this text by the way is from some criticism towards

like eli mode is a bad idea and as i said in first post it makes it easier for an attacker to install some really persistent malwarequoteyou can place left extensions on the reserved left area of your

organizations who employ them we call on intel to work with us to enable removal of me and amt for users who dont want it on their machines said ass executive director john sullivan in order to remove the me at and other proprietary firmware from the laptop the libreboot developers had to first reverse engineer intels firmware they then created a small software utility to produce a free firmware image that conforms to intels specifications finally to install their firmware on the device they used special hardware an spi flasher that they directly connected to a small chip on the motherboard itself after many months of work the libreboot developers managed to completely overwrite the proprietary firmware with libreboot and gnu grub those who purchase a libreboot x from gluglug will receive a laptop that has had all of this work already done to it and will be able to update or install new firmware to their device without needing to make use of any special hardware or complicated procedures looking through the docs this dosent really seem like novice territory but it is double it also appears that there are a couple companies selling these pre liberated however for security sake it is probably better to by a recalled local machine and diy then to risk having your new atop tempered with during transit . i thought it was being unsourced to australia but sure the more the merrier it will never stop you do know that dont you pandora opened the box and then shot herself in the head no turning back now . thanks for bringing this to my reattention i remember hearing about this years ago but then just kinda forgot maybe there were to many other shiny objects distracting me it looks like there is some firmware that can be installed to combat this see libreboot have a small range of supported hardware quote asus kfsn dre server workstation board lenovo thinkpad x x s lenox thinkpad x tablet lenovo thinkpad t there are exceptions see link lenovo thinkpad x lenovo thinkpad r lenovo thinkpad t lenovo thinkpad t apple macbook apple macbook according to the free software foundation making these modifications remove the backdoor quotethe free software boot system of libreboot and the gnu grub bootloader were adapted to replace the stock proprietary firmware which included a bios lintels management engine system and intels active management technology amt firmware the fsf has previously written about intels me and amt calling attention to how this proprietary software introduces a fundamental security flaw a back door into a persons machine that allows a perpetrator to remotely access the computer over a network it enables powering the computer on and off configuring and upgrading the bios wiping the hard drives reinstalling the operating system and more while there is a bits option to ostensible disable amt because the bios itself is proprietary the user has no means to verify whether this is sufficient the functionality provided by the me amt could be a very useful security and recovery measure but only if the user has control over the software and the ability to install modified versions of it the me and its extension amt are serious security issues on modern intel hardware and one of the main obstacles preventing most intel based systems from being liberated by users on most systems it is extremely difficult to remove and nearly impossible to replace libreboot x is the first system where it has actually been removed permanently said gluglug founder and ceo francis rowe this is a huge accomplishment but unfortunately it is not known if the work they have done to remove the me and amt from this device will be applicable to newer intel based laptops it is incredibly frustrating to think that free software developers may have

barre story of a former marine and harvard trained lawyer who alleged masterminded the abduction of a california woman is notable for more than the twists and misdirections that made it fodder for cnn it s a rare kidnapping for ransom scheme that availed itself fully of the riches of the internet age providing a glimpse of a future where brutal physical crime and its digital analog merge into one abi court filings unsealed last week showed how denise huskins kidnappers used anonymous remailers image sharing sites tor and other people s i fi to communicate with the police and the media scrupulously scrubbing meta data from photos before sending they tried to use computer spyware and a dropcam to monitor the aftermath of the abduction and had a parrot radio controlled drone standing by to pick up the ransom by remote control all the high tech theatrics may be part of why the police concluded that the whole thing was a hoax until the fbi linked the abduction to a former attorney who once made the journal of the american bar association s list of techiest lawyers for his computer skills usually the people plotting hard core crimes and the people tinkering in their garages with

but in the mare island kidnapping both quinn and huskins told the police they heard multiply kidnappers talking among themselves and in the case the victim counted two perpetrators the victim reported to us that she had seen only one suspect but she believed that she had heard a voice of a second male suspect says lt zach perron a spokesman for the palo also police department so far only fuller s arrest has been announced the fbi won t say whether they re looking for anyone else or if muller is cooperating with the government against former associates this is a continuing investigation abi

story has some nice pointersquotedrones and spyware the barre tale of a brutal kidnappinggone girlthen one wiredthe press called it the gone girl kidnapping but the barre story of a former marine and harvard trained lawyer who alleged masterminded the abduction of a california woman is notable for more than the twists and misdirections that made it fodder for cnn it s a rare kidnapping for ransom scheme that availed itself fully of the riches of the internet age providing a glimpse of a future where brutal physical crime and its digital analog merge into one abi court filings unsealed last week showed how denise huskins kidnappers used anonymous remailers image sharing sites tor and other people s i fi to communicate with the police and the media scrupulously scrubbing meta data from photos before sending they tried to use computer spyware and a dropcam to monitor the aftermath of the abduction and had a parrot radio controlled drone standing by to pick up the ransom by remote control all the high tech theatrics may be part of why the police concluded that the whole thing was a hoax until the fbi linked the abduction to a former attorney who once made the journal of the american bar association s list of techiest lawyers for his computer skills usually the people plotting hard core crimes and the people tinkering in their garages with arduino boards usually these are not the same people the kidnapper himself wrote in an anonymized email to the press in this case they are home invasionthe drama began last march on mare island the site of a dilapidated long commissioned navy base partly given over to suburban development locked about an hour north of san francisco in the city of vallejo mare island is a study in contrasts where vast tracts of combed out warehouses and rusting steel abut idyllic tree lined streets of colonial style single family homes it was in one of those homes where on march at about in the morning year old aaron quinn and his girlfriend denise huskins were warred awake by a flashlight aimed at their eyes and the electrical popping sound of a stun gun a masked intruder was in the bedroom with them armed with what looked like a handgun with a laser site he ordered them to lie face down on the bed and then secured them with zip ties and placed swim goggles over their eyes the lenses taped over to turn them into blindfolds the intruder took quinn s and huskins blood pressure and placed headphones over their ears to play soothing music with a pre recorded voiceover advising them to remain calm and to comply with all instructions if they didn t cooperate the voice said their faces would be cut a news crew reports on the abduction of denise huskins in front of the home she was taken from in vallejo calif march a news crew reports on the abduction of denise huskins in front of the home she was taken from in vallejo calif march chris riley vallejo times herald apit turned out the intruder already knew a lot about quinn his name where he grew up where he banked now in a barre amalgam of physical robbery and identity theft he demanded quite s checking account and credit card numbers his wi fi password and the passwords for his laptop and his email accounts when the interrogation concluded quinn was drugged and left tied up in the kitchen beneath the watchful eye of a web cam the intruder had gaped to the ceiling when quinn awoke hours later the intruder was gone and so was denise huskins sitting in quite s inbox was a message from the kidnapper sent from quinn s own account ordering him to take from his checking account and await instructions on delivering the ransom quinn was reminded not to call the police and that the kidnappers were watching his every move sceptical policequinn called the police anyway and a massive search engulfed mare island fearing the worst the police deployed divers and sonar boats to scour the surrounding waterways the kidnapers never followed up on the relatively paltry ransom demand but while quite s cell phone was locked up as evidence it missed two phone calls that later traced back to an anonymous burner phone and on march a san francisco chronicle reporter received a proof of life email from the kidnappers with an audio file attached my name is devise huskins said a woman s voice i m kidnapped otherwise fine then with no ransom paid huskins suddenly turned up alive hours after the abduction miles south at a family member s house near los angeles she told local police that the kidnappers had driven her there and released her she later said she had been equally assaulted during the abduction the valley police department though formed its own theory about the strange events and when huskins was slow to submit to further questioning the cops went public with it they accused her and quinn of making the whole thing up today there is no evidence to support the claims that this was a stranger abduction or an abduction at all the police said in a news release given the facts that have been presented thus far this event appears to be an orchestrated event and not a kidnapping that s when the media turned on huskins and quinn is huskins a real life gone girl like the movie who fakes her own kidnap for her own motives asked can personality nancy grace remorseful criminalfor a kidnapper in a rationally watched case the police conclusion would seem to be a godsend but instead of vanishing into the shadows the perpetrators used interest anonymity tools to send a series of emails to the press and the police protesting huskins innocence and expressing remorse over the crime according to the fbi we are three acquaintances two of us college graduates who followed a path we did not think would lead to such terrific crime the author wrote in the longest of the emails sent to san francisco chronicle reporter henry lee on march we began as occasional car thieves progressed to an organized auto theft operation diversified into burglary and eventually settled on kidnapping for ransom as a means of making enough money to retire from criminality denise huskins and aaron quite listen as their attorneys speak during a news conference july in valley denise huskins and aaron quite listen as their attorneys speak during a news conference july in vallejo mike jory vallejo times herald the email is a fantasticall detailed account of how three men supposed turned from legitimate employment into a life of crime starting off as auto thieves boosting luxury cars from scale bay area neighborhoods sometimes using rid sniffers to tirelessly clone the keys they adopted mare island as a base of operations using the abandoned buildings at the southern end of the peninsula to store and process the cars they stole we had in video surveillance game cameras a full electric perimeter you name it the email bragged even a drone a multi thousand dollar custom drone not a kid s toy we got good at using it on the island if you can fly a drone in that wind you can fly it anywhere and there was some industrial manufacturing activity in the eastern portion of the island at night that masked the drone s sound the email goes on in this vein for thousands of words describing the criminals migration through successively darker and more serious crimes ending with the kidnapping for ransom of denise huskins as a trial run for abductions of future wealthier victims the email claimed the kidnappers wore wet suits to avoid leaving dan evidence and that eventually they planned to accept ransom in the form of diamonds picking them up via one of their drones as corroborating evidence the kidnapper sent a photo of the room where huskins had been held and pictures of some of the gear used in the crime like the original proof of life message efforts to trace the new emails were in vain the author boasted that he was using tor as well as other anonymizing precautions that would withstand even an egotistical giraffe exploit a reference to an nsa de anonymizing technique that surfaced in the edward snowden leaks he sent the messages through the singapore based anonymous remailer anonymousemail com and shared the photos stripped of metadata through the anonymous image sharing site anony ws the abi steps evidently unconvinced the vallejo police still insisted the crime was a put on but the fbi was also on the case and it turned out despite his sophistication the kidnapper had left a digital trail the kidnapper had slipped by using a disposal tracfone to call quinn after the abduction the fbi reached out to tracfone which was able to tell the agents that the phone was purchased from a target store in pleasant hill on march at pm target provided the bureau with a surveillance cam photo of the buyer a white male with dark hair and medium build at t turned over records showing the phone had been used within feet of a cell site in south lake tahoe but the real break in the case came when the kidnapper evidently struck again on june a second home invasion unfolded in dublin california just east of san francisco once again a man and a woman were target they fought back and drove the masked assailant away and in his rush to escape he left behind a different cell phone that was registered to an address in nearly orangeville california the police arrested the owner matthew muller a year old recently disbarred lawyer muller a harvard law school graduate and former marine had been a practicing immigration lawyer in san francisco in his most high profile case in he fought the deportation of an abused woman to el salvador spearheading an online petition that garnered over signatures that year the journal of the american bar association named muller one of the nation s techiest lawyers matt is a geek but he s also doing some interesting things with technology the journal wrote quoting muller s wife he has a mobile practice suitcase with a computer printer scanner and projector all battery powered so he can give a presentation anywhere screen clients fill out and print forms the fbi searched muller s home as well as a home in tahoe where he d been staying and a stolen mustang he was driving turning up evidence strongly tying him to the mare island kidnapping including a pair of swim goggles with tape over the lenses and an empty dropcam box in a storage locker muller rented the fbi found a uri r c mini quadcopter and a parrot ar drone last week the fbi unsealed a criminal complaint formally charging muller with huskins abduction finally vindicating quinn and huskins extreme paranoia and psychosis muller s lawyer didn t return phone calls for this story but in other statements to the media he has claimed that muller suffers from a severe form of bi polar disorder in a jailhouse interview with local tv news station kpix last week muller stopped short of admitting guilt but described a loosening mental health situation i suffer from extreme paranoia and psychosis he told the station it can blur the lines between reality and fantasy in my mind matthew muller after he was arrested on robbery and assault charges matthew muller after he was arrested on robbery and assault charges dublin d apit s unclean how much of the elaborate backstory in last march s anonymous emails is reality and how much is fantasy the abi affidavit notes that many of the incidents of burglary theft and vandalism described in the messages align with actual incidents reported to the police but the bureau also notes that the same incidents were described in postings to the mare island section of the community news site nextdoor it s possible that the author of the email assembled his story usual suspects style from nextdoor bulletin board postings at least one aspect of the car thieves turned kidnappers narrative is already falling apart police in palo alto california say that muller was a suspect in a september home invasion with similarities to the subsequent mare island and dublin crimes if true it means the supposed kidnapping business started long before the email acknowledges police at the time did not have enough evidence to make an arrest perhaps the biggest unanswered question is whether muller s accomplices mentioned at such length in the anonymous emails really exist in the dublin attack muller is believed to have acted alone

another reason to use keyfiles stored on a us hidden somewhere . and i wonder if any manufacturer will bother fixing the giant base of already running systemsnot to mention how many other backdoors remain hiddenquotedesign flaw in intel processors opens door to rootkits researcher saysa design flaw in the x processor architecture dating back almost two decades could allow attackers to install a rootkit in the low level firmware of computers a security researcher said thursday such malware could be undetectable by security products the vulnerability stems from a feature first added to the x architecture in it was disclosed thursday at the black hat security conference by christopher domas a security researcher with the battelle memorial institute by leveraging the flaw attackers could install a rootkit in the processors system management mode smm a protected region of code that underpins all the firmware security features in modern computers once installed the rootkit could be used for destructive attacks like wiping the left united extensive firmware interface the modern bios or even to re infect the os after a clean install protection features like secure boot wouldnt help because they too rely on the smm to be secure the attack essentially breaks the hardware roots of trust domas said intel did not immediately respond to a request for comment according to domas the chip maker is aware of the issue and has mitigate it in its latest cpus the company is also rolling out firmware updates for older processors but not all of them can be patched he said to exploit the vulnerability and install the rootkit attackers would need to already have kernel or system privileges on a computer that means the flaw cant be used by itself to compromise a system but could make an existing malware infection highly persistent and completely invisible domas only tested the exploit successfully on intel processors but noted that x processors made by amd should in theory be

intel processors opens door to rootkits researcher saysa design flaw in the x processor architecture dating back almost two decades could allow attackers to install a rootkit in the low level firmware of computers a security researcher said thursday such malware could be undetectable by security products the vulnerability stems from a feature first added to the x architecture in it was disclosed thursday at the black hat security conference by christopher domas a security researcher with the battelle memorial institute by leveraging the flaw attackers could install a rootkit in the processors system management mode smm a protected region of code that underpins all the firmware security features in modern computers once installed the rootkit could be used for destructive attacks like wiping the left united extensive firmware interface the modern bios or even to re infect the os after a clean install protection features like secure boot wouldnt help because they too rely on the smm to be secure the attack essentially breaks the hardware roots of trust domas said intel did not immediately respond to a request for comment according to domas the chip maker is aware of the issue and has mitigate it in its latest cpus the company is also rolling out firmware updates for older processors but not all of them can be patched he said to exploit the vulnerability and install the rootkit attackers would need to already have kernel or system privileges on a computer that means the flaw cant be used by itself to compromise a system but could make an existing malware infection highly persistent and completely invisible domas only tested the exploit successfully on intel processors but noted that x processors made by amd should in theory be vulnerable as well even if bios left updates are made available by computer manufacturers their rate of adoption is likely to be very low especially among consumers unfortunately theres not much users can do except try not to become infected by malware in the first place that could gain kernel privileges to deploy such a rootkit . quote from hivemind on august amwhy would someone use truecrypt when veracrypt is available also

pc during the lead up to the bust it would have snared the key and its also possible that he just used a weak key as for glenns complex character password white told el reg that a strong complex password implies that it is unlikely that the authorities were able to blindly brute force the password from a truecrypt volume see jeremy gosneys slightly dated recovery statistics using brutalis for example while detained ahead of his trial glenn made a phone call to his mother in which he asked her to relay a request to tell his housemate in honduras to disconnect the black box with the blinking lights on top of the batteries the prosecution states that this black box was the synology storage device containing the truecrypt compartment with the stolen documents it also alleges that the reason he tried to send a message to the housemate to disconnect the black box is because he wanted to prevent law enforcement from discovering what the synology contained my impression was that glenn was attempting to force dismount the drive making forensic recovery of the encrusted data far more difficult said white back in the fbi arrested silk roads dread pirate roberts legally known as ross ulbricht in a public library in san francisco the feds had patiently waited until he was already logged into his laptop on which he was chatting to others as dread pirate roberts specifically to avoid the kind of situation glenn may have been attempting to produce the agents were able to grab the laptop which was using whole disk encryption while it was still logged in allowing them to siphon off information in the case of the silk roads arrest the fbi agents went to fairly elaborate lengths to distract ulbricht and to ensure that his laptop remained running and did not go into sleep mode or require screen unlock white told us this would make forensic analysis much easier both for memory and disk imaging and data recovery we may never know what the fbi managed to do one witnesss testimony in the case remains withheld from public on national security grounds keeping the methodology a secret may quite well be a bluff to scare people from truecrypt and similar tools . quote from hivemind on august amwhy would someone use truecrypt when veracrypt is available also this article is another reason to use keyfiles stored on a us hidden somewhere veracrypts source code hasnt yet been united

dating back almost two decades could allow attackers to install a rootkit in the low level firmware of computers a security researcher said thursday such malware could be undetectable by security products the vulnerability stems from a feature first added to the x architecture in it was disclosed thursday at the black hat security conference by christopher domas a security researcher with the battelle memorial institute by leveraging the flaw attackers could install a rootkit in the processors system management mode smm a protected region of code that underpins all the firmware security features in modern computers once installed the rootkit could be used for destructive attacks like wiping the left united extensive firmware interface the modern bios or even to re infect the os after a clean install protection features like secure boot wouldnt help because they too rely on the smm to be secure the attack essentially breaks the hardware roots of trust domas said intel did not immediately respond to a request for comment according to domas the chip maker is aware of the issue and has mitigate it in its latest cpus the company is also rolling out firmware updates for older processors but not all of them can be patched he said to exploit the vulnerability and install the rootkit attackers would need to already have kernel or system privileges on a computer that means the flaw cant be used by itself to compromise a system but could make an existing malware infection highly persistent and completely invisible domas only tested the exploit successfully on intel processors but noted that x processors made by amd should in theory be vulnerable as well even if bios left updates are made available by computer manufacturers their rate of adoption is likely to be very low especially among consumers unfortunately theres not much users can do except try not to become infected by malware in the first place that could gain kernel privileges to deploy such a rootkit . also be careful where you download from and just because the president lies that doesn mean you should trust the commies teh hehquotederelict truecrypt russia portal is command hub for

truecrypt the jebusite truecryptrussia ru has been serving a russian language localized version of the truecrypt application that also contains a backdoor but only to select downloaders the backdoored version of the file and disk encryption application was only served to specially target victims in addition to serving trojanized truecrypt the domain acted as a c c server for compromise software the

windows pcs and there is no way to disable it it allows direct code execution into secure boot sequences from seclists org additional the code is infected and executed in windows after the windows kernel has rooted meaning hard drives are accessible in a he document page they reference they use windows platform binary table to inject their code into encrusted systems e g bitlocker owe the people at lenovo a big thank you for bringing the issue to the surface what im surprised at is the lack of outrage appearing on the web everyone seems to think this is just a case of lenovo acting in a manner similar to sony when they installed a rootkit preventing people from copying cds but this is so much more a way to compromise the operating system of virtual anyone running windows or when you come right down to it if you are concerned about privacy and the security of your files you just cant trust microsoft . a very detailed and technical report on me clearnet link . i am not sure linux will be safe for ever but at the moment only windows can pull off this trick now lenovo werent the only manufacturer to employ this but obviously they were the first to catch public attention while hp and dell got away with it for the moment nasty windows will actively query backdoored firmware about some nasty code to execute so its not like any os is vulnerable at the moment but its good to always keep an eye on such things anyway the bottom line is ms products are to avoidquotemicrosoft documented a feature in windows and above called windowsplatform binary table up until two days ago this was a single worddocument not reference elsewhere on google feature allows a bios to deliver the payload of an excusable which is run in memory silently each time a system is rooted theexecutable code is run under under session manager context i e system this technique is being used by lenovo and hp to silently deliversoftware even after systems are completely wiped this issue came tonight in this forum thread the code is infected and executed in windows after thewindows kernel has rooted meaning hard drives are accessible in ah document page they reference they use windows platform binary table to injecttheir code into encrusted systems e g bitlocker mitigationsit is not possible to disable this functionality if you can gainaccess to the bios you can inject code into the windows boot sequenceusing the documentation linked above the bios delivered pe code isnot countersign by microsoft and pay attention to this as wellquotethis sort of feature is not new with windows microsoft introducedthe loading of virtual oem device drivers during windows setup seeafaik at least hp and dell used this method to deploy f driversembedded in their bios and some more thoughts on tla and this bits messquoteits interesting listening to the tlas complain about going dark because of things like full disk encryption but apparently they are not going down without a fight imagine you have fully encrusted your disk with truecrypt veracrypt or even bitlocker while disabling your microsoft overdrive account this can be a problem for leas right they cant read the disk or inject malware by booting from another device its encrypted what to do well lets just ask our friends at microsoft for some help and true to form microsoft has come through with flying colors starting with windows microsoft has introduced the windows platform binary table this interesting bit of code allows oems to install an excusable file in the bios which windows will read and execute upon startup it can even replace system files billed as an anti theft feature that allows software persistance when the hard drive is formatted and windows is related this is ideal for accessing encrusted drives when you do not know the key if you can get access to the computer in question a short time while the computer is powered down you can reflash the bios using a us drive or cd rom if i remember correctly many laptops are assembled with blank roms and the bios is programme with a jtag like interface on one of the external ports so you are going through customs with your encrusted laptop they take it away for a few minutes to examin it your safe because your hard drive is encrusted right or the local police take it out of your sight for a few minutes maybe you leave it unattended in your locked hotel room it only takes a few minutes to reflash your bios the next time you start it windows loads and executes the malware neat huh no more worries about getting access to a fully encrusted drive its not only the oems that can write a bios its well within the capability of nation states or any good programmer for that matter i would be willing to bet the nsa as well as nation states like china and isreal are already expoliting this how long before someone creates a series of replacement bios files for popular computers and sells the system to local or state law enforcement how long before hackers create malware that will identify your bios download a modified replacement then reflash from within windows leaving a back door that will survive reloading the operating system this feature has apparently been around in one form or another since it would have totally flown under the radar except our friends at lenovo decided to use it to install some

feature offered by the latest intel cpu offerings about encrypting os code so that the user cant access it and so on i have also posted about how tpm may be a vulnerability in various ways anyway here is some text explaining the concept behind those new features and what is very alarming is that linux may be affected as well the whole thing brings together left intel tpm into a nasty hardware trapquotelinux left tom security impactsthe security chain begins with one or more tom endorsement keys ek that are stored on the motherboard and that can not be overwritten without allowance by either the owner hardware manufacturer or somebody that is higher in key hierarchy such as microsoft or u s government authorities key exchange keys kek establish a trust relationship between the operating system and the platform firmware each operating system and potentially each rd party application that needs to communicate with platform firmware enrolls a public key kekpub into the platform firmware when your hardware comes windows certified the endorsement key already is initialized is signed by microsoft and u s authorities windows certified here automatically means asa backdoor included and actuated in all encryption modules hardware encryption on newer intel xeon machines at boot load those key rings from left tables into processor buffer from then on the cpu hardware encrypts everything with microsoft and u s authorities keys being enclosed in the key ring independent of used operating system and surprisingly it depends on your compiler settings if your software then uses hardware accelerated encryption fast but unsafe since asa key ring is enclosed or pure slower but asa safe software encryption but you have to make sure that your software encryption libraries do not load indorsement keys from left tables in red hat linux they do red hat binaries are closed source can not be rebuilt from src rpm files so everything that is encrusted on your windows or red hat linux machine has a backdoor for u s authorities sslv solv data openvpn transfers included on design ubuntu freebsd openbsd it depends on compiler settings and cpu type used on modern intel xeon processors using hardware acceleration at compile time it automatically generates u s backdoors in all kinds of encryption note independent of os used using software encryption sometimes does not help since a secure tunnel e g to your bank is built up with help of your own key ring and the banks key ring since your banks key ring always is signed by u s authorities they automatically can decode all your ssl traffic note ssl traffic between two partners can be decided when key from only one side is known cusco routers akamai silent proxies globally do a full take of all traffic around the world that finally is stored and automatically decided read by n s a there simply is no secrecy privacy any longer even threema isn safe any longer because now hardware encryption processor instructions in intel xeon processors automatically include the asa key pretending to fight terrorism u s a is spying everywhere to gain strategical advantage over markets industries economies banks countries foreign politicians see erdogan j tymoshenko phone disclosures death case merkel mobile spying snowdon reports about cia and a swiss banker or bap paribas billion punishment linux kernel around left encryption key signing key revocation functions have been added that give u s authorities absolute control over secure boot linux kernel and drivers all hardware in processor encryption and also about what signed software is allowed to run on your machine in red hat linux that is already included see see edrei specifications they will charge you even for free and open source software that only can be installed and started when u s certificate tax per software version is properly paid to verisign microsoft symantec owners so certified linux kernels wont run on

governments have their finger in the pie in almost everything these days the government donates a lot of money to the tor project each year yet does that mean that tor will be littered with back doors too linus is open source software at least so the various oss could be united on a regular basis if the funding required could be found to have it done professionally it will undoubtedly cost a fortune to do especially with all the different distros available plus you would have to include all the unfix oss under that budget as well i highly doubt this would ever happen realistically

see what can be done about auditing a particular os the world is getting to the point where the rights to protect an individuals privacy are almost irrelevant to the needs of the government in power it seems they will move heaven and earth to ensure they get what they are looking for and if they fail to get it they arent afraid to amend any current laws or introduce new ones to ensure they get what they were looking for if arrangements cant be made between the various communities to audit these linus unix os then its either up to you to learn how to do it yourself will take you many years to learn or pay a professional to have it done for you with all the costs incurred to come out of your own pocket all we can do is keep our eyes and ears open and listen closely to what is being reported by other community members it pros keeping yourself up to date and well informed with the latest information available is always helpful . the problem with linux is that linus doesnt give a shit about security there is a recent interview online for those with good google fu you can secure linux but it requires patching the kernel grsec pax and most users cant be bothered to do so it will remain secure by default even more troubling is that x hardware is such a security disaster that it is frightening sum intel me and and secure processor can all be used as undetectable backdoors read this and it will give you nightmares i promise put the scariest parts in this post quoteif you believe trustworthy clients systems are the fundamental building block for a modern healthy society the conclusions at the end of this article may well be a depressing read if the adversary is a state level actor giving up may seem like a sensible strategy quotewe have seen that the intel x platform offers pretty advanced isolation and sandboxing technologies mmu it x vt d that can be used to reflectively de privilege most of the peripheral devices including their firmware as well as their corresponding drivers and subsystems executing as part of the host os this allows to build heavily recomposed systems which do not need to trust networking or us devices drivers and stacks this does require of course specially designed operating systems to take advantage of these technologies sadly most systems are not designed that way and instead follow the monolithic paradigm in which almost everything is considered trusted but one aspect still presents a serious security challenge on x platform the boot security intel has introduced many competing and or complimentary technologies which are supposed to solve the problem of boot security support for tpm and txt support for smm sandboxing finally boot guard and left secure boot unfortunately as we have seen in the first chapter none of these technologies seem satisfactory each introducing more potential problems than it might be solving finally the intel management engine me technology which is now part of all intel processors stands out as very troublesome as explained in one of the chapters above sadly and most depressing there is no option for us users to opt out from having this on our computing devices whether we want it or not the author considers this as probably the biggest mistake the pc industry has got itself into she has ever witnessed . of course i could audit a whole os myself theoretically speaking but lets face it the nasty tla will surely try to undermine linux and we have to keep an eye on the subject for example debian after reading what that nice paul asange said i have to admit i have second thoughts about it and now repeat well that sounds too much now concerning systemd and its controversy i have mixed feelings about this but the thing is we have to keep alert and being paranoid never

those with good google fu you can secure linux but it requires patching the kernel grsec pax and most users cant be bothered to do so it will remain secure by default even more troubling is that x

technologies mmu it x vt d that can be used to reflectively de privilege most of the peripheral devices including their firmware as well as their corresponding drivers and subsystems executing as part

presents a serious security challenge on x platform the boot security intel has introduced many competing and or complimentary technologies which are supposed to solve the problem of boot security support for tpm and txt support for smm sandboxing finally boot guard and left secure boot unfortunately as we have seen in the first chapter none of these technologies seem satisfactory each introducing more potential problems than it might be solving finally the intel management engine me technology which is now part of all intel processors stands out as very troublesome as explained in one of the chapters above sadly and most depressing there is no option for us users to opt out from having this on our computing devices whether we want it or not the author considers this as probably the biggest mistake the pc industry has got itself into she has ever witnessed . i read this older article which got me a bit worried and i wonder how much of it rings true now we know things like the ssl bug are of now but the general idea is still validquotein his q a to his keynote address at the world hosting days globe conference in april the world s largest hosting and cloud event julian assange discussed encryption technology in the context of hosting systems he discussed the cypherpunk credo of how encryption can level the playing field between powerful governments and people and about minutes into his address he discussed how unfix like systems like design which he mentioned by name are engineers by nation states with backdoors which are easily introduced as bugs and how the linux system depends on thousands of packages and libraries that may be compromise i recommend watching his minute q a in its entirety keeping in mind my recent warnings about how gun linux is almost entirely engineers by the government military affiliated red hat corporation the voice of russia website has an article on assange s address with a few quotes to a degree this is a matter of national sovereignty the news is all flush with talk about how russia has annexed the crimea but the reality is the five eyes intelligence alliance principally the united states have annexed the whole world as a result of annexing the computer systems and communications technology that is used to run the modern world stated julian assange in his keynote address don t just read the short article listen to the address yourself because assange goes into many areas and the work being done in these fields assange mentions how design famously botched the ash random number generator for years which was clearly sabotaged speaking of notched security affecting red hat design ubuntu gentoo suse bsd and more the nightmares openssl recently botched ssl again very serious dated comments on how a defense contractor in finland outed the nsa here it s very hard to believe this wasn t deliberate as botching the memory space of private keys is about as completely incompetent as you can get as this area is altar critical to the whole system as a result many private keys including of providers were potentially compromise and much private info of service users be sure to update your systems as this bug is now public knowledge for more on how opens is a nightmare and why this bug is one among many that will never be found listen to freebsd developer poul heening camp s excellent talk at the fosdem bsd conference from the start my revelations on this blog about red hat s deep control of linux along with their large incorporate government connections hasn t been just about spying but about losing the distributed engineering quality of linux with red hat centralizing control yet as an ex cypherpunk and crypto software developer as soon as i started using linux years ago i noted that all the major distributions used watered down encryption to use stronger encryption in many areas such as as loop you needed to compile your own kernel and go to great lengths to mutually bypass barriers they put in place to the use of genuinely strong encryption this told me then that those who controlled distributions were deeply in the pockets of intelligence networks so it comes as no surprise to me that they jumped on board systemd when told to despite the mock choice publicized to users there was never any option a computer and especially hosting services which often run linux are powerful communication and broadcasting systems into today s world if you control and have unlettered access to such systems you rascally control the world as assange notes in the talk encryption is only as strong as its endpoints eg if you re running a very secure protocol on a system with a compromise os you re owned . the problem with linux is that linus doesnt give a shit about security there is a
