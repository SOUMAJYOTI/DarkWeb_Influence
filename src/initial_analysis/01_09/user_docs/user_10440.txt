almost like the ideal marketplace auto withdrawal partial fe options working resolution center etc except for the slow traffic i am sticking with it . i have gotten word recently that bsm is close to

seconded fast and smooth from the buyer point of view too what was the bluest fud spread on the silk road forums when bluesky first opened i done remember seeing that . i mean its always so fast and smooth almost never a hiccup its refreshing i just wish the traffic would pick up a bit the sr forums bashed bsm in the beginning as being a scam and they halted the growth but i think the last months have easily been my most lawless vending experience on the dn the guys running it are always making improvments this makes me feel like its not some quick hit run scam like smp they simply spend so much time improving and adding security post your experience at bsm in this thread . in fairly new to the deep web new year and have perused through a few different markets but so far i like blue sky agora was nice until all the traffic hit and silk road was sketch from the start ive completed about transactions total across the three markets give tried and have not received a package once it got seized for a domestic order so my luck has been pretty good i like blue sky better so far for a few reasons first i like the feedback system second i like the stats bsm shows for each vendor third the speed of the marketplace is very good once i make more transactions at bsm ill have a better idea of how i like it overlay but so far i like it better than agora or sr . quote from damiel on march

was hitting rough waters a few people posted links for bsm agora and pandora bsm was instantly deemed a scam then nobody mentioned it anymore for the last months bsm has been anything but a swam agora does that referred program where people get paid to spam their address so it was way overhyped and is probably going to be the first to fall it got too big too fast blue sky has had time to mature and from what the staff told me they are only at like capacity so i feel like it will be around longer than the other two sr forums pretty much dictate what happens w dnms and they jumped the gun on bsm rascally halting growth but as it perseveres and outlasts market after market it will grow the admins are always prating things its really nice to see a market where the operators really care . according to all his words accentuate about traffic a good market requires traffic easy handling no problems for deposits no problems for withdrawals good system for contact pgp correct communication
