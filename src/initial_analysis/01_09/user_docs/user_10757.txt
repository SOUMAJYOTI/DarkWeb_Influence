with user pass they cant get coins without pin so in not sure that would make sense no doubt if they can get your surname and your password ontaining the pin would be a peice of cake and even if it werent all theyd have to do is hit the reset button and wait the hours or whatever not necessarily brute forcing logic page is easier because onion site receives all traffic as coming from so it cant tell an automatic bot from an actual user im pretty sure this is the case so blocking bruteforce on logic page would be much harder since it doesnt know if the request is from actual user or automatic to attempt to bf the pin they would have to do this through your account and i believe after a few incorrect attempts it locks up so a bf attack would be futile in this scenario in regards to clicking reset id hope after a prolonged bf attack which they could see happened in their logs if this is the case they would be much more prudent in allowing the resetting of pins especially if there was a sudden influx of reset requests just my nontechnical assessment well if the bf theory is correct and agora have taken the precautionary measure to disconnect the userbase server this bf bot should be
