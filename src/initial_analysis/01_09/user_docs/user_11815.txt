become part of a growing migration by gandalf it has come to my attention that many of you especially vendors are growing increasingly tired of the slow speeds and lack of service that you receive at agora most of you vendors out there use sr as your primary market and then sell on agora as your secondary market i do not see why anyone should have to be a slave to such a slow site especially as a
