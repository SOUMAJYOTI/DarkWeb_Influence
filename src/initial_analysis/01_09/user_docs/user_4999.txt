you have it right i would reccomend that after you tumble your coins you send them all to an address that you controll that you only access through tor that way if anything goes tits up with the coin mixing you don t have to involve the vendor in getting it figured out before you tumble since you re buying with coinbase your coins are tied to your name so learned is fine there s nothing illegal about buying btc also most vendors on here use a fresh wallet address for each transaction so there is no publicly listed wallet address associated with implicit activities for leos to see your coins go to it just looks like any old etc transaction it s still wise to tumble but probably not necessary for transactions on here . quote from magicmountain on may amhi tammyit is really tempting to use the direct route you described because no third party marketplace is involvedand i guess most vendors will provide a one time only address nevertheless i always tumble my coins for anonymity simply because it s in my hands and i don t have to rely on a vendor and his her diligence that being said the vendor will have a delivery address you provide so i guess the bitcoin address is the

to an address stored in a local wallet is that an adversary with full access to your internet traffic would be able to link the network announcements of sending the bitcoins from that wallet with your identity however an adversary without that power think local police or maybe the dea but not the nsa would have to rely on blockchain analysis which would not reveal in addresses you could make the argument that even without tumbling your coins blockchain analysis would only reveal the addresses involved with the transactions but not which service or site they are afflicted with if a vendor were busted and an adversary gained information as to the originating addresses of customers bitcoins they would not be able to convulsively determine whether the address belongs to a coinbase account a personal wallet or represents a face to face cash transaction all the addresses would appear the same the adversary would then require knowledge of all known addresses of a service such as coinbase search warrants would never be this broad in order to make correlations between addresses found during busts and where the coins actually came from because of this it is my opinion that the information gleaned from blockchain analysis has been repeatedly overrated and exaggerated in darknet lore and that bitcoin tumbling unless you are using a very identifiable and famous address
