glitch in their internal btc accounting however they informed me that my computer or account had been compromise and that i should install tails looking at azores forums i see several people reporting similar issues and getting similar responses from agra support i think this is a mistake rather than outright theft but at the end of the day im still out in bitcoins i dont know if or when this will happen again but it seems to be an going problem this means that until this is addressed i no longer feel comfortable buying or vending on agora hence the grand wizards lair will be closing up on agora for the time being look for us on evolution and c and in the near future who knows where else we might turn up so long agora its been nice but the wits sparkle spider sense is twitching between
