a multi sig escrow system being used by your market please correct me if in wrong here quote why would you assume the market doesnt have mufti sig or vendor fe in place mate please read your opening post again brad and ask yourself the same question its self explanatory imo partly because you havent mentioned the words multi sir escrow anywhere in your opening post it seems as though you want

youre not mate nothing at all where did brad go to im eager to hear their response and for brad to clarify the issue of his market having a functions multi sig escrow system current in place for all customers this option for vendors to send any finalized coins to an external wallet is pointless and a moot point if your market offers its customers a genuine multi sig escrow option even the option on hansa is a much better option than any centralized escrow system this way the coins are never held in a markets hot wallet and are instead held in a newly generated multi sig btc address off site right from the outset with each party being in possession of one of the three btc public keys used to generate the new multi sig address in the case of a multi sig address only two of the three public keys are needed for the funds to be released from escrow and in the process your funds are protected from a market admin pulling off an exit scam and stealing your coins this option brad is proposing will do very little imo considering the coins have already been held in a markets centralized escrow system for the majority of the time taken to complete the transaction its only at the very end of the transaction process that the vendor will receive these finalized coins sent directly to a btc address instead of the vendor logging into their market vendor account and having to mutually send them to a new btc address once the buyer finalizes their order sorry brad but i just cant see any real benefit this would provide the vendor i really cant the difference in the time frame taken to complete both options is eligible at best its certainly not a multi sir replacement alternative not even close im afraid . we posted this earlier and was requested to get a tag first now we are good
