cringe at the flight time alone so i just wanted to talk to you on here no pressure you dont have to answer anything you dont want to im not a journalist weve chatted before briefly so you know a ll something on me yep and with all of what happened yesterday even though i knew all of that i didnt let me contacts at fox business publish it because i didnt want to see bitcoin or gox going up in flames if it could be savage obviously holding that info back and not publishing a tumblr or leaking docs first allowed someone else to stake a claim on it first but you win some you lose some and honestly im not a fan of people posting things that are rumors or bullshit or not verified just because it damages the shit out of someone or a company and it really can not be taken back afterwards is that crisis strategy draft even legit more or less as the name suggests its a draft and its a bunch of proposals to deal with the issue at hand not things that are actually planned and or done this said this document was not produced by mtgox i saw some strategies in there that i had shared with you but also saw some things in there that i would have never suggested anyone ever go through with as it would make you look horrible i think a lot of people ignored the draft part it was just really surprising to see that being leaned do you think it was leaned by someone purposely to hurt you personally or gox in general do you think it was leaned by someone purposely to hurt you personally or gox in general i have some doubts heh i bet are you stepping down as ceo and away from gox too if

account posts and all right away speculation within the bitcoin arena went into her chaotic mode and the word on the street was that you were closing up shop and running away with all of their monies and bitcoin how does that make you feel to hear or see people you bailed out yourself and stood up for over the years turn on you like that not good mark i know youre not one for expressing yourself but heres your chance at it because you really have stepped up before and done things no one else ever had or probably will again and it seems like all of it has been quickly forgotten and instead youre being labelled as the madoff of bitcoin were having this chat and youre still in japan at your apt office and not in a cave somewhere right look mark you took mtgox and ran with it built on it stuck with it and took it to a level no one ever thought possible when other exchanges were crippled you stepped in and bailed them out or absorbed them to save the bitcoin market in general in

the start were having this chat and youre still in japan at your apt office and not in a cave somewhere right at home with my cat being a pain sleeping on the keyboard yeah doesnt sound like someone on the run with bags of money whats the plan now for you and mtgox cant comment on that yet aright mostly because doing so could compromise our current efforts imgur the simple image sharer my cat pushing my keyboard me pushing the keyboard back on the desk so you guys are still actively trying to save it though we havent given up you could have given up and walked away a bunch of times

channelname mode channelname magicaltux magicaltu magog staff magicaltux has joined channelname hey mark thanks for coming in i know youre a bit shaken up and dressed hi are you doing okay more or less its am and tomorrow morning first time i have a lawyer appointment things couldnt be better well not tomorrow but today now yeah youre in the future over there in japan lol guys in nz are even more in the future yeah two places give wanted to visit but cringe at the flight time alone so i just wanted to talk to you on here no pressure you dont have to answer anything you dont want to im not a journalist weve chatted before briefly so you know a ll something on me yep and with all of what happened yesterday even though i knew all of that i didnt let me contacts at fox business publish it because i didnt want to see bitcoin or gox going up in flames if it could be savage obviously holding that info back and not publishing a tumblr or leaking docs first allowed someone else to stake a claim on it first but you win some you lose some and honestly im not a fan of people posting things that are rumors or bullshit or not verified just because it damages the shit out of someone or a company and it really can not be taken back afterwards is that crisis strategy draft even legit more or less as the name suggests its a draft and its a bunch of proposals to deal with the issue at hand not things that are actually planned and or done this said this document was not produced by mtgox i saw some strategies in there that i had shared with you but also saw some things in there that i would have never suggested anyone ever go through with as it would make you look horrible i think a lot of people ignored the draft part it was just really surprising to see that being leaned do you think it was leaned by someone purposely to hurt you personally or gox in general do you think it was leaned by someone purposely to hurt you personally or gox in general i have some doubts heh i bet are you stepping down as ceo and away from gox too if you cant legally disclose then just say so cant disclose that yety yet k np the reason im asking is because after yesterday events of you removing yourself from the foundation and deleting the twitter account posts and all right away speculation within the bitcoin arena went into her chaotic mode and the word on the street was that you were closing up shop and running away with all of their monies and bitcoin how does that make you feel to hear or see people you bailed out yourself and stood up for over the years turn on you like that not good mark i know youre not one for expressing yourself but heres your chance at it because you really have stepped up before and done things no one else ever had or probably will again and it seems like all of it has been quickly forgotten and instead youre being labelled as the madoff of bitcoin were having this chat and youre still in japan at your apt office and not in a cave somewhere right look mark you took mtgox and ran with it built on it stuck with it and took it to a level no one ever thought possible when other exchanges were crippled you stepped in and bailed them out or absorbed them to save the bitcoin market in general in exchange it brought you a massive surge of customers and press that made you look like the hero of the day and then some but what most people forget too was that you werent set up to handle this from the start were having this chat and youre still in japan at your apt office and not in a cave somewhere right at home with my cat being a pain sleeping on the keyboard yeah doesnt sound like someone on the run with bags of money whats the plan now for you and mtgox cant comment on that yet aright mostly because doing so could compromise our current efforts imgur the simple image sharer my cat pushing my keyboard me pushing the keyboard back on the desk so you guys are still actively trying to save it though we havent given up you could have given up and walked away a bunch of times previously but you always stuck it out even though others have closed up and walked away why have you continued to fight and work at it and not give up giving up is not part of how i usually do things do you want to tell your side of this a bit more like what youve sacrificed or given up personally i have to imagine its taken quite a toll on you well first i would guess is my health what do you mean took on more than kg since handling mtgox compensating for stress by eating in guessing stress from lack of sleep too like now heh and drinking liters of coca cola how american almost american actually since some people see cock cola as being non american lol anyway i should try to get some sleep already am waking up in hours err one more thing and starting to be tired of pushing my keyboard so it stays on the desk do you still believe in the viability of an regulated digital currency like bitcoin tho difficult tbqh the pressure we got from banks and governments makes things very hard do you think if it were regulated it would make it easier to work things out partially how so well first avoid being blocked by banks and governments around the world if regulated it means that as long as you follow the regulations youre fine the biggest question people really have asked though is are you personally vested in mtgox with your own btc and whether or not you like everyone else have taken a personal hit and are in the same boat as they are in terms of taking a loss hit from the recent events and whether or not you like everyone

account magicaltux end of whois well how much is travail for you im not even sure guys on reddit and wickedfire are running around posting screenshots of horror stories about how much bitcoin they have lost from this didnt check my wallet before pushing the site office anyway maybe i should go to sleep now anything else you like to say to everyone before all the passed off people start going nuts even more not really maybe just a link something like that why do we fall gag well well see how this one goes anyway well in like to chat more but i know youre pushing to go to sleep and so long as you are saying youre not disappearing from this thats okay i still think you should say something more to all these people or at least reveal how much youve taken a hit for personally it would show them that you are still on their side by the way that whole removal from the foundation did you decide to leave that before or after the chats with them to help save god versus let it fail . any intelligent person would register a jebusite and business like mtgox in a stolen identity not only do these websites operate completely in the gray area of law but in a situation like this you would

foundation did you decide to leave that before or after the chats with them to help save god versus let it fail . let me mine a few more bitcoins so i can become a millionaire overnight . cyprus has long been an attractive offshore financial hub their economy is based on the finance sector and tourism but the gfc did come a knockin in unfortunately with the citizens left to involuntarily foot the bill a bailout agreement reached with er meant that the country second biggest bank froze accounts so that the gov could take out of the money from all uninjured accounts as well as other measures hostile to the interests of the people this was the catalyst for a bail in of bitcoin due to people wanting to protect their wealth from their own government the bitcoin price shot up practically from highs of to before we were all goxxed of course as cyprus have long been well educated when it comes to finance it is no surprise to see many cypriots calling for cyprus to become the worlds first bitcoin hub they realize that there are huge advantages for the country that jumps in first the initials meteors rise in the price of bitcoin that they would be holding at the time is just one tantalizing prospect for a country to become a hub for bitcoin would also be a huge win for bitcoin if not just for the initials rise in value there is also the perceived legitimacy that comes with an entire country getting behind it and once bitcoin has a country and their banks heavily invested in it the exchange of bitcoins for fiat will be much easier there would be a host of new exchanges popping up out of cyprus without the banking limits the current exchanges are plagued with cyprus also has the first university to accept bitcoin for fee payments and to offer a course in cryptocurrency recently the worlds first bitcoin bank was opened in cyprus this will help foster widespread adoption in a country where people are a little more openminded when it comes to bitcoin central bank of cyprus has been more favourable to bitcoin lately . i made the cryptocurrency sub its own sub as opposed to a child board now so feel free to move this over there if you want . quote from withatrollogies on february amalso the perceived legitimacy that comes with an entire country getting behind sensational . yea and unlike sr where the theif is virtual anonymous fatfuck has to worry about more than moving coins around he needs to worry about moving himself around his doxx are pretty much public record almost feel bad for the guy almost . i made the cryptocurrency sub its

shakil khan who is heavily invested in bitpay so take bitpay related news with a grain of salt they certainly keep in touch with many important bitcoiners in the american community and have a good track record of publishing rumors that are later revealed to be correct in this article a source believes karpeles was involved in arbitrage attempts something that has long been suspected further allegationsmt gox has alleged never conducted a single audit of its customer deposits and it is believed that karpeles may have been the only one within the company to have knowledge of how to actually tap the exchange s cold storage it remains unclean exactly how this type of storage leak could have happened over a mufti year period without any knowledge on the part of the executives at mt gox as a result of karpeles apparent wizard of oz status within the organization it also appears unlikely that the true technical cause of the leak will be fully understood until the embattled ceo speaks whether that will happen during an interview or a possible criminal case is unclean the latter seems likely however as one source believes that karpeles knew about the persuasive damage of the transaction malleability attacks for several weeks and was engaging in an arbitrage scheme that leveraged the depressed mt gox price to reap gains on other exchanges this was alleged happening well before the exchange s breaking point this past weekend . often you get to see a ceo speak so freely the guy is clearly passionate about bitcoin hopefully his exchange can overcome their latest us banking woes i can t help but be angry and frustrated and depressed all the hard work we ve done to bring bitcoin in to the mainstream and now this and the people fuck look i was supposed to write some lawyer approved or statement about how kraken kicks ass and is super secure and compliant and payward is leading the charge at data and all the great things we re doing right . quote from kraken ceoit s a goddard war and it s not going to be won without you how many opportunities in history have we had as a people to change the world in such a positive way ummmnever none zero . haha that was his views if he views this as a war he has fallen asleep at the helm of a bomber plane and flown straight into his own peoplehis incompetence has caused this issue no amount of passion will compensate this . scum all of them at mtgox are scum in glad mtgox is dead now the btc community can move forward and the coin can go up . if i understand correctly god have been letting coins out to the hackers over many years so this will have caused an inflation in the actual btc in circulation or would so on the surface of things those coins stolen will have undoubtedly been sold at other exchanges bringing the prices down so does this mean now we see those coins are gone in the long run there is actually much less coins in circulation that people first perceived in which case we can expect a rise in price as is the supply demand criteria . any intelligent person would register a jebusite and business like mtgox in a stolen identity not only do these websites operate completely in the gray area of law but in a situation like this you would def want to run off with that million in bitcoin dat mill million dollai bet mr fatboy faggot feels like a dick now for not understanding identity theftjust cost you million dollarsfaggot . him up . him up .
