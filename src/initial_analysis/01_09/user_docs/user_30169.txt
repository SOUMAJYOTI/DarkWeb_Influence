ll thanks a ton zaphod but now i feel like a jerk for being too lazy to type man shredquote from kmf on june pmfile shredding doesn accomplish what you want le will recover forensic trace evidence when it comes to data destruction it is full drive or next to nothing it overwrites a sufficient number of times to prevent my data recovery efforts though i am no expert and used along with the other many practices to protect your privacy i think the shred tool is very useful . u is another pass of s i forget the shred commands its two i use i just cant find my notes think u or z its coming up on time to demolish some files too . pull it out of swap im unfamiliar with this id like to learn sorata secure erase ill read into soonand what about the programs they say overwrites all the free space any thoughts on that i havent done much reading up on these issues but im really interested i rarely have any personal files so in really late getting hip to all of this i mainly just web browse but knowing how to properly get rid of anything saved is definitely worth knowing . hi everyone would you guys recommend these steps on using ata . shred user commands shred name shred overwrite a file to hide its contents and rationally delete itsynopsis shred option file description overwrite the specific file s repeatedly in order to make it harder for even very expensive hardware probing to recover the data mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too f force change permissions to allow writing if necessary n iterations n overdrive n times instead of the default random source file get random bytes from file s size n shred this many bytes suffixes like k m g accepted u remove truncate and remove file after overwriting v verbose show progress x exact do not round file sizes up to the next full block this is the default for non regular files z zero add a final overwrite with zeros to hide shredding help display this help and exit version output version information and exit if file is shred standard output delete file s if remove u is specific the default is not to remove the files because it is common to operate on device files like dev hda and those files usually should not be removed when operating on regular files most people use the remove option caution note that shred relies on a very important assumption that the file system overwrites data in place this is the traditional way to do things but many modern file system designs do not satisfy this assumption the following are examples of file systems on which shred is not effective or is not guaranteed to be effective in all file system modes log structure or journeyed file systems such as those supplied with aix and solaris and jfs reiserfs xfs eat etc file systems that write redundant data and carry on even if some writes fail such as raid based file systems file systems that make snapshots such as network appliances nfs serve file systems that cache in temporary locations such as nks version clients compressed file systems in the case of eat file systems the above disclaimer applies and shred is thus of limited effectiveness only in data journal mode which journals file data in addition to just metadata in both the data ordered default and data write back modes shred works as usual ext journaling modes can be changed by adding the data something option to the mount options for a particular file system in the etc fstab file as document in the mount man page man mount in addition file system backups and remote mirrors may contain copies of the file that can not be removed and that will allow a shrouded file to be recovered later author written by colin plumb reporting bugs report shred bugs to bug coreutils gun org gnu coreutils home page general help using gun

properly get rid of anything saved is definitely worth knowingthose single file wipe programs play whack a mole with forensic trace evidence leaks but in the end there are still moles that havent been hacked yet there are innumerable cases usually in relation to cp in which someone attempted to wipe his files with those programs but forensic trace evidence is always found anyway wiping free space may take care of swap but it doesnt take care of saved temporary files logs etc some of the single file wipe programs will try to take care of various other things as well but there are simply too many things to take care of not to mention wear leveling of ssds makes those tools essentially worthless entirely its seriously wipe the entire drive or next to nothing like those single file overdrive programs are mostly beneficial to le in giving people a false sense of security . fye dariks boot and nuke which used to work great is no longer being maintained and wont boot with haswell chips ssds etc new shit shame it was easy to use . if you use shred you should turn off journaling in your file system to be on the safe side uncropt sensitive files separate the keys from the data .

will recover forensic trace evidence when it comes to data destruction it is full drive or next to nothing it overwrites a sufficient number of times to prevent my data recovery efforts though i am no expert and used along with the other many practices to protect your privacy i think the shred tool is very useful its useful for le when people think they shredded their file because it was overwritten a thousand times but then they pull it out of swap or they find the name of the file in some history log or it auto saved a copy of itself to the drive somewhere else that wasnt overwritten or about a million other mechanisms by which forensic trace evidence is left file shredding is a lot like container encryption both are insecure its full drive or next to nothing there are simply too many forensic trace evidence leaks . file shredding doesn accomplish what you want le will recover forensic trace evidence when it comes to data destruction it is full drive or next to nothing . by all means though shred wipe your files it can not hurt just done operate as if they are actually securely erased afterwards for that you need at secure erase even dan doesnt wipe as well as ata secure erase however if you have a hard drive i suggest to layer dban with at secure erase dban doesnt work on ssd because then you get defense in depth ata secure erase is firmware and the implementations vary some of them are secure particularly on older drives . i like wipe man page quoterecovery of supposed erased data from magnetic media is easier than what many people would like to believe a technique called magnetic force microscopy mfm allows any moderately founded opponent to recover the last two or three layers of data written to disk wipe repeatedly overwrites special patterns to the files to be destroyed using the fsync call and or the o son bit to force disk access in normal mode patterns are used of which are random these patterns were recommended in an article from peter gutmann pgut cs auckland ac nz entitled secure deletion of data from magnetic and solid state memory a quick mode allows you to use only passes with random patterns which is of course much less secure note about journaling filesystems and some recommendations june journaling filesystems such as ext or reiserfs are now being used by default by most linus distributions no secure deletion program that does filesystem level calls can sanitize files on such filesystems because sensitive data and metadata can be written to the journal which can not be readily accesse per file secure deletion is better implements in the operating system encrypting a whole partition with cryptoloop for example does not help very much either since there is a single key for all the partition therefore wipe is best used to sanitize a harddisk before giving it to intrusted parties i e sending your laptop for repair or selling your disk wiping size issues have been hopefully fixed i apologize for the long delay be aware that harddisks are quite intelligent beasts those days they transparently remap defective blocks this means that the disk can keep an albeit corrupted maybe slightly but inaccessible and unreadable copy of some of your data modern disks are said to have about transparent remapping capacity you can have a look at recent discussions on slashdot i hereby speculate that harddisks can use the spare remapping area to secretly make copies of your data rising totalitarianism makes this almost a certitude it is quite straightforward to implement some simple filtering schemes that would copy potentially interesting data better a harddisk can probably detect that a given file is being wiped and silently make a copy of it while wiping the original as instructed recovering such data is probably easily done with secret ide scsi commands my guess is that there are agreements between harddisk manufacturers and government agencies well funded mafia hackers should then be able to find those secret commands too done trust your harddisk encrypt all your data of course this shifts the trust to the computing system the cpu and so on i guess there are also traps in the cpu and in fact in every sufficiently advanced mass marketed chip wealthy nations can find those therefore these are mainly used for criminal investigation and control of public dissent people should better think of their computing devices as facilities ended by the dhs important warning read carefullythe author the maintainers or the contributors of this package can not be held responsible in any way if wipe destroys something you didnt want it to destroy lets make this very clear i want you to assume that this is a nasty program that will wipe out parts of your files that you didnt want it to wipe so whatever happens after you launch wipe is your entire responsiblity in particular no one guarantees that wipe will conform to the specifications given in this manual page similarly we can not guarantee that wipe will actually erase data or that wiped data is not recoverable by advanced means so if nasties get your secrets because you sold a wiped harddisk to someone you dont know well too bad for you the best way to sanitize a storage medium is to subject it to temperatures exceeding k as a cheap alternative you might use wipe at your own risk be aware that it is very difficult to assess whether running wipe on a given file will actually wipe it it depends on an awful lot of factors such as the type of file system the file resides on in particular whether the file system is a journaling one or not the type of storage medium used and the least significant bit of the phase of the moon wiping over nfs or over a journalling filesystem reiserfs etc will most probably not work therefore i strongly recommend to call wipe directly on the corresponding block device with the appropriate options however this is an extremely dangerous thing to do be sure to be sober give the right options in particular dont wipe a whole harddisk eg wipe kd dev hda is bad since this will destroy your master boot record bad idea prefer wiping partitions eg wipe kd dev hda is good provided of course that you have backed up all necessary data . hello give read the jolly rover thread about file shredding but it seems to only suggest windows apps is the shred program in linus adequate or should i be looking at another program thanks . quote from knights dreams on june pmi see so it all comes down to the drive encryption well drive encryption attempts to make forensic traces computationally recoverable in the situation that the attacker doesnt have the encryption key or password whereas wiping attempts to make them information theoretically recoverable such that the attacker can not recover them via any means after theyve been wiped these serve two different purposes and it is more secure to have an adequately wiped drive than to have an encrusted drive because the encrusted drive is only as strong as the password and also still has the forensic traces on it they are just virtual impossible to recover without determining the password encryption key or seizing the system in a rooted on state but you can for example possibly be compelled to decrypt a drive whereas you can not be compelled to unerase a drive however encrusted drives are more useful in that you can store meaningful information on them i use encryption on my drive at all times and this actually assists in wiping as well in that even if the wiping mechanism i use is for whatever reason flawed the contents of the drive are at least as secure as the encryption password i used to encrypt it i also always change my fde passwords after wiping my drive and promptly forget them to aide in this i periodically wipe my drives using at secure erase ata enhanced secure erase if i have a hard drive i will additional use dban with two passes of random data dban doesnt work on ssd i wipe my drives when i want to start from a fresh state as far as forensic trace evidence is concerned for example i may have traces of previous things ive done on my encrusted drive but no longer need to have those traces or the things ive done that caused them in the first place so in that situation it is more secure to wipe the drive than to continue in using it even though it is encrusted with fde . i am a fan of just shred fuuuuuuu the more u s the better . quote from gordoinmordor on june hello give read the jolly rover thread about file shredding but it seems to only suggest windows apps is the shred program in linus adequate or should i be looking at another program thanks here are my recommendations get yourself a copy of peter selingers ccrypt this is a replacement for the old insecure unfix crypt program ccrypt uses as rijndael as its symmetric cipher you can use wipe or shred as you wish i prefer wipe the reason i mention using ccrypt is to conventionally encrypt the files with a passphrase prior to wiping using ccrypts b or brave option you do not have to re type the passphrase e g ccrypt b e filename this way you are prompted only once for a passphrase and you can type random on the keyboard for several seconds then hit return as soon as you hit return the original file is encrusted in place and replaced with the original filename with the added suffix cpt so for example if you wanted to destroy the file weed jpg you invoke crept b e weed jpg and the weed jpg will be replaced with weed jpg cpt you could do the same for an entire folder of files using the wildcard once these files are encrusted they can not be decrypted because you dont know the passphrase needed to decrypt them you can then wipe them using either shred or wipe one of the reasons i like wipe is that it includes a facility to re name the wiped file after the wiping process has concluded you can invoke wipe like this wipe rcf cpt q q p this command will wipe all the files ending in cpt in the current folder wipe them with one random pass and random rename the file s times after the wipe you can dowload ccrypt from its home page . duh smh self . fde . i see so it all comes down to the drive encryption .
