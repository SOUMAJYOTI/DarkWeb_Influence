hello siblings i originally made the post below at two venues silkroad forumand on bitmessage there were no responses at allon sr forum so far but there were several quality replies onbitmessage both private replies to my private bm address and public replies to the bitchirp channel i would like to offerthis same post to the denizens of thehub if only to test theall the talent at sr has migrate to thehub hypothesis and of course to benefit from more quality replies id like to start a discussion about namecoin because it seems to methat this coin might end up being a dark horse that comes rushingto prominence all of a sudden and heres why introduction you may remember the whole project to begin a new system of uri addresses ie bit addresses and begin a new system of domain name registration this scheme uses a blockchain to store immutable unscammable records of domain name registrations the infrastructure is fait accompli its already built the new curls might look something like this cherub bit enter meowbitthis site appears to hold some promise for enabling this originalvision of starting up a new system of bit addresses and domain name registration see here that is true then perhaps we can expectto see the price of namecoin escalating in the future members of both the cypherpunk and librarian communitiesare taking a keen interest in this project becausethere are important potential consequences for anonymityand privacy since without a central registrar it will be moredifficult for govt to create rules about who can create a domain name and whatidentity checks can be imposed on domain name owners it should alsobe more difficult for govt to shut down a website and or prosecute its owners all this is interesting on many levels not least of which is the prospectfor future namecoin values the current value of name coins is dollars price from btc e com but notice that current the price of namecoin isin delicious decline in nov the price of namecoins peaked to it then peaked again to over in jan two important questions how low will namecoin go during its current decline how high will namecoin go if bit domains take off heres my guesses naturally they are biased via my own hope ium inebriation the price will sink to this year the price will climb to in the next years day lets try to factor out my bias the price will sink to this year the price will climb to in the next years please feel free to comment or question any of the above material have a nice day and be happy playground . hello siblings i originally made the post below at two

etc but maybe theres hidden information in this listing youll notice that some currencies appear more often in these pairs like usd for example question which of the non fiat currencies appear most in the pairings answer btc appears in of the pairings ltc appears in of the pairings doge amazingly given it started life as a joke appears in of the pairings xrp ripple is a centralised and vastly pre mined bankster owned sabotage coin that shouldnt be trusted and doesn offer any anonymity buyer beware appears in of the pairings nmc which im tipping for a glorious future appears alas in only of the pairings what drops out of this brief analysis for me it re affirms that litecoin is the no coin but not by market capitalisation the incredible rise of doggie coin doge perhaps this coin deserves further research scrutiny to answer the big questions does it have a future will its price rise substantially how many of these coins will survive the next years i strongly suspect less than will survive to see mass mainstream use probably litecoin and bitcoin are guaranteed entrants to that list but who are the others namecoin quarkcoin max keisers maxcoin luckycoin any reasoned arguments on which coins will survive to see mainstreamadoption are very welcome those of you who keep up with the financial news on bloomberg reuters rt com or zero hedge will be well aware of the start of the collapse of the petrodollar and hence the start of the end of the us dollar as the worlds reserve currency see here is likely to shake up investment decisions the world over money willflow into new avenues bitcoin and litecoin will be obvious new homes for some of this cash this is a probable catalyst to further btc and etc price rises this year one notable tipster on btc e com is predicting bitcoin at and litecoin at before the year is out litecoin keeping its current valuation against bitcoin have a nice day and be happyplayground . quote from playground on march amany reasoned

version of gpg doesnt work my version is but note thats on cygwin not linus perhaps it works with other versions testing the email address solution the email address solution suggests that the way to avoid the substring matching problem is to specify thekey by specifying the email address presented on the key for example gpg a o output enc r someone domain com e file txtwhere the available public keys are gog list keyspub r eaeb expires did myname myname sub r a d expires pub r a ba expires did someone sub r f b expires this does solve the problem gpg d output encgpg encrusted with bit asa key id f b created someone gpg decryption failed secret key not availablethis is the expected response this message has not been encrusted with the myname public key i can not decrypt this message because its been encrusted with the publickey for someone and i dont have the private key for someone so we have two solutions to the substring matching problemwhen the recipient argument is professed specify the recipient public key with the key id eg f b specify the recipient public key with the full email address eg someone domain comany other solutions or perspectives on this problem are warmly welcomed have a nice day and be happy playground . hello people there is a bug in gpg which is related to how the recipient argument is professed when encrypting a message this is a trapwhich has probably snared hundreds or thousands of newcomers to encryption to see the effect of this bug following the steps below step start with a clean slate mv gnupg gnupg orig this renames your current snug directory so that thefollowing steps do not pollute your gnupg keyrings step copy and paste the following public key into a filecalled someone pubkey asc then import the public keyinto your

sub r a d expires pub r ea a did someonesub r b ebf gog list secret keys sec r even expires did myname myname ssb r a d so you have your myname secret and public keysand you have only the public key

name bit asa key id a d created main key id eaeb gpg encrusted with bit asa key id a d created myname myname what you dont see is a line telling you its been encrusted withthe key for somename you should see but dont see a line that says gpg encrusted with bit asa key id ea a created and therein lies the rub or bug if you prefer what gpg appears to be doing is selecting the first matchfor the recipient argument that appears in the public keyring it doesnt select all keys that match it seems to select only the first key that matches step clean up and restore your original keyrings mv snug gnupg somenamemv gnupg orig gnupg so what can you do to prevent this happening to you dont use short key in names like the or been or ing etc or anything else that is likely be a subset of a larger

in my gpg conf and comment it out the few times i want a binary hi firelight thanks for your suggestions i learned something i imagined by interactively you were alluding to some kind of ncurses or similar interface thatmight present options to select from for recipients for files to encrypt etc i now understand that by interactively youre referring to executing the gpg command without the r

it was a useful suggestion here is a demonstration of this suggestion in action i found it most useful to first get a listing of all keys that matched the key names keyids email address ofthe keys i

when listing keys hi owockeznan thanks for your suggestion is there a good chance of two might keyids colliding how many public keys would i need to have in my keyring beforethere was a in chance of this happening or how many keys would you need to generate in order to gettwo with the same keyid have a nice day and be happy playground there is already a web page devoted to listing pip short keyid collisions list of short keyid collisions in openpgp keyringfabrizio tarizzoplease note this is a preliminary work still in progress as such it may contain errors or omissions you can send comments and suggestions in italian or english at fabrizio fabriziotarizzo orgthis list is generated by parsing a full keyserver dump obtained from keys if hu on there are collisions on short key ids ids of these keys are expired are evoked are part of the strong set and are peaceable from the strong set are version keys are version keys and are version keys there are collisions where both keys share the same user name collisions where both keys share the same version pk algorithm and length collisions where both keys share the same pk algorithm and length but different version and collisions where both keys share the same version regardless of pk algo and length distributed as follows table snipped because the formatting is ruined when copying pasting clearnet axolotl . quote from firelight on

second approach would be to mount the file as an actual disk this has the advantage of being easy to work with it looks and feels just like a native volume there are a few contenders that have both

hello owock thats very interesting i have a question it goes like this lets say i have a top secret encrypted file secrets txt asc and i decrypt it on my us key so now there are two files secrets txt asc and secrets txtif i delete secrets txt will there still be an image of that data still on my us key im guessing the answer is going to be yes theres a data image that could be recovered the answer is yes then what could i do to ensure thatany delete data really is delete please let me know this is very interesting have a nice day and be happyplayground . quote from owockeznan on april pmon a us

file with gpg you will be left with the encrusted file mytext gpg as well as the original file mytext txt in contrast with ccrypt the original file mytext txt is transformed into text txt cpt the original file is overwritten with gpg the original file is left intact depending on your point of view this may or may not be a good thing from the point of view of file deletion destruction ccrypt

owock thanks for posting the wei pdf article youve lead me on a very productive path from what i can gather there is no way to wipe or shred a single file held on a us flash drive the original delete file remains on the medium you cant see it because its not listed but it remains in situand unless the us drive is very full probably in tact too there are lots of tools out there that take advantage of this fact by allowing you to recover delete files from flash drives eg here are two free ones that i tried recuva from cardrecovery from is okay it has a nice interface but it only seems to show you recently created delete files cardrecovery is really excellent much better than recuva it performs a seemingly exhaustive scan what did i do i have a us key that i been preparing to receive gpg usb some days ago i emptied the us key by copying its content to another drive and deleting each file i then cleaned the usb by putting two partitions on it and formatting them individually one with fat the other with eat when i ran cardrecovery on the ostensible clean fat partitioni was shocked by the number of files of all types that it found there there were mp and mp files the videos playedperfectly as did the mp files i tested completely corrupted some of those files must have been there for over months they have survived deletion and disc partitioning and disc formatting i also found decrypted and raw messages that i recently deletedafter testing the command line gpg exe app that ships with gpg us having played with the cardrecovery program its crystal clearto me now that files are not actually delete from a us key theyre simply removed from the directory listing nothing more presumably when leo confiscates your phone atop computer us keyand inspects the media for evidence they use some program like cardrecovery to see a history of virtual everything you havebeen doing i did some further tests by encrypting and compressing my gpg usband secret encryption messages using zip and deleting the originals now you might imagine this process of compressing and encrypting yoursecret messages would be a nice stealthy way of hiding any discriminating evidence err no the original secret messages are still there in their pristine encrusted and decrypted formats when you create the z file you simply add a newfile to the total files held on the medium nothing is erased every time you use your us key youre simply accumulating a history your activities on the us drive this is important because several us keys ship within encryption software the so called encryption vaults your invited to believe that storingfiles in this vault will keep them safe from prying eyes complete bullshine as my father would say if you store a file on your us drive and then run the encryption vaultthe software will encrypt it and delete the original thats true but theoriginal isnt deleted its reflectively doing the same thing that i didwith my zip encryption and compression experiment mentioned above presumably it is in recognition of this that some prefer to use wholedrive encryption however even here on a us stick a steady historyof your activities accumulates on the us drive if you decrypt the disk you will presumably find data images of all the files youve previously delete just as occurs in the unencrypted us drive scenario the only apparent solution to this history of activity problem seems to be to sanitize the entire us drive but that seems a little excessive i suppose the simplest solution would be to never use the us drive for message storage use it only for application execution perhaps you could set the permissions on the us drive to read and execute but not write everywhere except the directoryin which your pubring secring gpg conf files reside so you run the encryption software off the us drive but you keep the encryption messages on the host machine when youre done you encrypt up all the data you want to take withyou and copy it to the us drive same folder as pubring secring gog conf you then should use something like wipe or shred on the files you want to delete in your working directory on the host machine the big lesson for me from all this is to no longer rely on rm rf file txt or del file txt commands to delete files whether on regular magnetic discs or on us drives i now understand the need to shred wipe sdelete them perhaps aliasing the rm command would be a good idea ive just been reading that on windows you can use delete which comes with the sys internals package if anyone knows of

the way to go most of the time they do not have to be download rather you can view them the page i have s of clipboard files everywhere also its easy to just cut and paste anything you may need hope this helps playground hi booke yes text files will always be safe document formats however things like pictures and diagrams dont translate well into text files i strongly suspect but im not sure that postscript files areanonymous and secure in exactly the ways that pdf and word documents are not postscript doesn support embedded javascript as pdf does postscript doesnt support deferential www

hello siblings it seems that the banksters are expecting a turbulent financial future a future that could see significant seizure of bank deposit funds and a future that could see significant upside for bitcoin and litecoin what is a bail in a bail in describes a cyprus haircut scenario where the authoritiesassume the right to take money from ordinary bank deposits in the case of cyprus this was justified in media comments that only deposits beyond k were affected and most of those deposits were owned by russian gangsters subsequent reports showed that accounts owned by russians amounted to less than of deposits affected the key element here is that banks or the state simply steal money from regularbank deposits this is about as draconian as it gets and its coming over the last months legislation has been passed in the usa in the europeanunion and most recently in the up which provides the necessary legal power forthe authorities to extract money from regular bank deposits beginning in although some commentators have suggested that it might be brought forwardif a crisis occurs in notable there is no k limit specific in this new legislation thus all deposits become potentially subject to these new powers the implications of this are err enormous one scenario that was discussed at davos years ago was a plan for a bank holidaythis is not the kind of holiday where public sector employees get a day off work this is the kind where they shut the banks for a few days to recalibrate the currencyby shaving x off everyones bank deposit im not kidding so it is possible that this legislation is being introduced as a preliminary step to some secret bank holiday to be introduced some time in another scenario is essentially a variant of the bail out measure we have been seeingover the last years since govts hand out trillions of dollars to the local bankstercartel in order to save the banking system in the bail in scenario theres no needfor the govt to step in the banks get the money they need by raiding your accountdirectly again in not kidding this whole bail in situation was discussed recently on the keiser report see the second half of the show where max interviews mark borne fact that legislation has been passed to legalise this direct raiding of bank depositsacross us europe and uk means that something very nasty is brewing this isn recreation legislation to pass the time something is coming down the pipe probably there will be a few planted mainstream media news items selling thevirtue of this legislation in terms of convenience for tax payers or it will be soldan a measure to reduce tax evasion etc these people are skilled media manipulatorsthey will present it in such a way that it seems reasonable and fair but the fact is there coming for your money theyre going to take it without your permission whether you like it or not what can you do you can put your savings in a bank beyond the jurisdiction of the banking authorities in us europe im not an expert on south american banks but im aware that historically they never been viewed as a safe haven switzerland is technically outside of the european union but they recently failed to honour their own national vow of banking secracy when us bank handed over details of all accounts held by american citizens to the irs i dont know if switzerland has also enacted legislation enabling the raiding of bank deposits other european alternatives might be monarch and lichtenstein again i dont know if these countries have also enabled this legislation my current thinking is that perhaps one of the national chinese banks might prove to be a safe harbor i know that it is possible to create an account with these banks using the usual passport id and maximum deposit requirements some of these banks have vista mastercard credit and debit card facilities tax havens may or may not be a good idea remember that cyprus was supposed to be a safe tax haven prior to the haircut fresco move your savings into physical gold physical silver bitcoin or litecoin there is a flip side to this if you decide to take the prudent move of investing your money into gold silver bitcoin litecoinand then the predicted bail in event occurs then the value of gold silver bitcoin litecoin willspike significantly taking the value of your savings with it the size of the price spikewill depend on where you put your money heres why its quite well known now that silver prices are being deliberately manipulated southwards its legal to sell naked silver contracts short naked means that banks and traders can sell silver contracts they do not own this enables latent market rigging in silver traders can sell contracts in silver and push the price southward this means that the price of silver might not rise very far when the bail in event occurs despite the size of the gold market there has been increasing evidence of manipulation in the gold markets too with gold jumping the wrong way in the face of bad political and economic news additional goodman sachs has a price target for gold of dollars in q which strongly implies the absence of a free market in gold there is no naked short trading in bitcoin you simply can not sell bitcoin you do not own so its much harder to market rig bitcoin prices thus theres a greater garantee of a price spike in bitcoin compared to gold silver when the bail in event occurs there are also no naked shorts in litecoin whats nice about litecoin is that historically every time there has been a price spike in bitcoin the proportional rise in litecoin was much much greater feel free to consult the charts on this this chart is the price of litecoin expressed in bitcoin there you have it you have been forewarned of an economic event which could affect you very adversary i see the chances of this happening as high since the authorities in us europe have gone to theconsiderable trouble of enacting legislation to enable it i have also suggested some measures that you can take to a protect your wealth from this coming bail in event and b to take advantage of this event by investing in gold silver bitcoin or more profitably litecoin i hope you found this post interesting and helpful if you wish to show your gratitude you can do so by finding my tip jar details below share your knowledge of opening accounts with chinese russian or tax haven banks by posting to this thread have a nice day and be happyplayground . hello siblings it seems that the banksters are expecting a turbulent financial future a future that could see significant seizure of bank deposit funds and a future that could see significant upside for bitcoin and litecoin what is a bail in a bail in describes a cyprus haircut scenario where the authoritiesassume the right to take money from ordinary bank deposits in the case of cyprus this was justified in media comments that only deposits beyond k were affected and most of those deposits were owned by russian gangsters subsequent reports showed that accounts owned by russians amounted to less than of deposits affected the key element here is that banks or the state simply steal money from regularbank deposits this is about as draconian as it gets and its coming over the last months legislation has been passed in the usa in the europeanunion and most recently in the up which provides the necessary legal power forthe authorities to extract money from regular bank deposits beginning in although some commentators have suggested that it might be brought forwardif a crisis occurs in notable there is no k limit specific in this new legislation thus all deposits become potentially subject to these new powers the implications of this are err enormous one scenario that was discussed at davos years ago was a plan for a bank holidaythis is not the kind of holiday where public sector employees get a day off work this is the kind where they shut the banks for a few days to recalibrate the currencyby shaving x off everyones bank deposit im not kidding so it is possible that this legislation is being introduced as a preliminary step to some secret bank holiday to be introduced some time in another scenario is essentially a variant of the bail out measure we have been seeingover the last years since govts hand out trillions of dollars to the local bankstercartel in order to save the banking system in the bail in scenario theres no needfor the govt to step in the banks get the money they need by raiding your accountdirectly again in not kidding this whole bail in situation was discussed recently on the keiser report see the second half of the show where max interviews mark borne fact that legislation has been passed to legalise this direct raiding of bank depositsacross us europe and uk means that something very nasty is brewing this isn recreation legislation to pass the time something is coming down the pipe probably there will be a few planted mainstream media news items selling thevirtue of this legislation in terms of convenience for tax payers or it will be soldan a measure to reduce tax evasion etc these people are skilled media manipulatorsthey will present it in such a way that it seems reasonable and fair but the fact is there coming for your money theyre going to take it without your permission whether you like it or not what can you do you can put your savings in a bank beyond the jurisdiction of the banking authorities in us europe im not an expert on south american banks but im aware that historically they never been viewed as a safe haven switzerland is technically outside of the european union but they recently failed to honour their own national vow of banking secracy when us bank handed over details of all accounts held by american citizens to the irs i dont know if switzerland has also enacted legislation enabling the raiding of bank deposits other european alternatives might be monarch and lichtenstein again i dont know if these countries have also enabled this legislation my current thinking is that perhaps one of the national chinese banks might prove to be a safe harbor i know that it is possible to create an account with these banks using the usual passport id and maximum deposit requirements some of these banks have vista mastercard credit and debit card facilities tax havens may or may not be a good idea remember that cyprus was supposed to be a safe tax haven prior to the haircut fresco move your savings into physical gold physical silver bitcoin or litecoin there is a flip side to this if you decide to take the prudent move of investing your money into gold silver bitcoin litecoinand then the predicted bail in event occurs then the value of gold silver bitcoin litecoin willspike significantly taking the value of your savings with it the size of the price spikewill depend on where you put your money heres why its quite well known now that silver prices are being deliberately manipulated southwards its legal to sell naked silver contracts short naked means that banks and traders can sell silver contracts they do not own this enables latent market rigging in silver traders can sell contracts in silver and push the price southward this means that the price of silver might not rise very far when the bail in event occurs despite the size of the gold
