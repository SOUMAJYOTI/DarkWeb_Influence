ive changed my mine about eight thousand times since this all started its now time to assume that every thing you see before you is part of the process from top to bottom from defcon to oracle its being very well played if it keeps going as is not only will they have pocketed some coins but they may even have a customer base ready and willing to line and up and be slammed again there was a glimpse of hope in the early hours when hiniguel seemed to be blowing the place apart but in the cold light of day i think its become apparent that last night was a stimulant fueled journey headfirst into a superhero fantasy for a man to be speaking of extreme hacking partners and boasting of his k k moneys no object approach when a quick background check reveals someone importanting meth and maybe making k on a good month i think tells you what you need to know its going to be fun to watch fall apart over the next few days well move on some of us learning from it and maybe even analysing decentralised options while no doubt a large group will fall into the same old traps . this is the likely explanation imo it looks to me like when sr was taken down some of the guys in the background that never really got to take part decided to use it to their advantage sr was mostly filled with lots of big speeches and large things happening in the background but beyond the words of a few people what did we really get to see most of their development announcements were about security features and hardening etc etc but we never really got to see any of it the things that we got to see were fixes and feature development that any site in development would have and of course the big features that were really needed kept getting delayed and i no longer buy the cold storage thing for a

perfect way to gain a lot of traction for their con i was lucky this time give never kept coin stored on markets beyond pocket change but because of bad timing i did lose a fair amount on sm it could have happened here too my last deposit was only weeks ago i hope this is the final nail in the coffin for centralized marketplaces i know i wont ever use one again weve let these people burn us time

someone look good the day the last original mods went was when it started showing cracks that really stopped me using it . sub . sub . it was all a con . sub . gentlemen it is a distinct possibilty that the sr forums have been compromise by law enforcement or some other group since at least the time of the arrests in december screenshots copies of text documents correspondence and statements from other knowledgeable users tend to lend credibility to this notion if this is true then almost certainly the sr operation in its entirety is being monitor and or controlled in some capacity and probably has been for some time according to my sources one or more of the admins mods is either le or is cooperating with authorities cirrus was named these same allegations were made by others in december during act i when incriminating photos were printed on the forums only to be delete staff denied this then and im sure that they will continue to do so now whether or not the above mentioned theory is true remains to be seen if le is involved in not sure yet how this all fits together however something tells me that this is going to be a good one but fuck all that for now well worry about act iii after i fill in those of you who drifted off to sleep or went to the can during act ii silk road was not hacked it was looked by its captain a loathesome annoying moniker if give ever heard

going about our business we were keeping our fingers crossed that what seemed almost certain to happen wouldnt but we were also exchanging messages and pining for simpler times and silently betting on whether it would be a sat team or an angry mob of dope sick torch wielding townspeople who showed up first and how soon would they arrive the sr forums are useless now even more so than in december back then they deleted hundreds of posts threads citing security as the reason theyre doing it again the only entries that youll see are by the actors themselves and the noobs whose simple natures and naivete makes shenanigans such as these possible in the first place and finally a handful of members masquerading as dozens more with hoards of disguises and countless aliases at their disposal at times they even carry on conversations with themselves inside of a thread when i see it happening it reminds me of a child putting on a puppet show and compelling one hand to talk to the other the forums are like a fucking daycare for noobs while simultaneously functioning as a kind of giant playground for the adults who take the opportunity to trade inside jokes and troll one another and the real communication what very little there is can be read between the lines no one ever says much and when they do subtle codes are employed consider these quotes as just a few examples quote from meerkovo on february pmoracle quick question accroding to defcon all wallets were affected so as sr as a business has cash assets just wondering if i should kiss my coins goodbye and wish the person

these quotes as just a few examples quote from meerkovo on february pmoracle quick question accroding to defcon all wallets were affected so as sr as a business has cash assets just wondering if i

wish you had responded to what i said before the email and pip question though sometimes silence speaks volumes has deacon been in contact with with dpr lately hey oracle whereve you been seriously oracle is just a sucking nym that redacted and redacted oh and redacted trot out for these special occasions nothing is what it seems folks the communitys core the dark market communitys core is a lot smaller than you think youl see just remember that while youre a totally anonymous stranger who lives in ohio and thought that this silk road thing sounded like fun the people who conceived of all of this who built it and have been here from the start well there all well acquainted some are allies while others share bitter rivalries jesus christ think about it research it its a secret shhh wink wink yeah and so is the grand finale ill be publishing an obituary for this goddamned zoo in the near future and then im going back to writing about politics im not directly tied up in any of this im

the time to do so as well technically speaking i really am a journalist albeit a shifty inefficient one and im fed up with the bullshit which theyve taken just too goddamned far this time you ever hear of quitting while youre ahead i cant sit here and watch while you guys bamboozle these poor bastards out of their money especially when they dont doubt you for a second even as you point down the

through the door and whips out his social security card and his drivers license all eager to get in on the action where do i sign up he says come on people and if this gets delete in the hub well well know where their loyalties are its time to weed out the thieves and liars and trolls so we might as well start here i cant say with any certainty whether or not the silk road sub reddit is trustworthy either but once i have more information i will pass it along and in the meantime deepdotweb is probably your best source for accurate timely news regarding the markets as i believe in his integrity incidentally he has nothing to do with this posting nor was he aware of it prior to its publication despite everything i remain opposed to prohibition while supporting online trading i believe that
