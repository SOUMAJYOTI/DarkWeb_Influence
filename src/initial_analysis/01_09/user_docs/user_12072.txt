doubht bitcoinfog they could be angels but for all i know its run by le it was less concerning when they werent linked to markets but if they are the same or closely connected people they can straight away see what everyone is doing and spending there coin on now thats a could not they are but it concerns me that they have access to so much info if they were taken over by le and being linked i am assuming they both get done they could easily follow the trail from market to laundering to exchange which is what most people do exchanges on the whole will co operate with le it probably is far fetched but gives me an uneasy feeling especially in the scenario where le let it run for a while after taking over to myself it doesn matter as much as i use several layers of obfuscation but i dont like one group having too much info leads to a single point of failure im probably toking too hard and getting paranoid but like i say just makes me feel a little uncomfortable but i am not accusing

hoping to cream off some buyers that use tba but other than that i have heard nothing nothing at all i logged on today days before i have been there for months and i am still yet to sell a thing im not complaining i am here wondering why with sr going down agora under do people saying pandora vendors scam there hast been a bigger charge towards tba to just sit there doesnt bother me i check in every few days to see if i have any questions to answer or orders to fill but i never have is there not many vendors on tba or are buyers put off for some reason . it had been rather slow taking off but am guessing thats the case with every new market as there are so many to chose from and then folks are very wary with all new dnms from having been slammed multiply times lately it takes time to build trust and for folks to part with their coins over a relatively new marketplace but that said things have picked up over the last couple of weeks mostly migrants from agora and the registrations have been steadily growing by the day that in turn has brought about a good momentum in sales but unfortunately for you its mostly from the drug selections and not ccs though there have been a few cc inquiries on the support forum to which you could chip in also i guess theres only so much a market can do after all offer free vendor accounts for a couple of months along with zero commisions on all orders etc payout bonus for referrals besides making sure by having a secure and bug free site for smooth transactions but guess then the onus lies with the site users to get the good word around and refer their clients were gradually getting there and good things take time . i would say all the new sites are running slow for trade there are so many to choose from now so those that left the main
