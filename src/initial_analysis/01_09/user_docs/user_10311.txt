then notifie you of any incoming payments or existing balances so from a privacy point of view you certainly only want to connect via tor from electrum in tails this is of course the default behaviour

august amdhl asks for your big public key so does that mean you would have to create new key yes you will need to generate a bip compatible master key you cn generate child keys from this which is the he wallet part electrum and later fully support bip keys so i would suggest installing that and generating a new bip key which can then be exported . electrum is thin so whilst the keys are all generated totally and not stored on any server the bitcoin operations are performed via an electrum stratum server your coins dont really go to an office wallet though your private keys are only in your home user electrum folder so if you make a payment in electrum the transaction is created and signed on your machine by electrum but then is broadcast to the bitcoin network via one of the servers each of which have a full blown bitcoind running on them similarly if you are watching addresses for payments then electrum rascally gives a list of the addresses you are watching to one of the servers which then notifie you of any incoming payments or existing balances so from a privacy point of view you certainly only want to connect via tor from electrum in tails this is of course the default behaviour you must make sure if you are not using tails that electrum is configured to use your socks proxyideally electrum should use a different server for broadcasting transactions than it uses for watching addresses to at least make it harder for operators of malicious servers to enumerate what you are doing sadly electric does not yet do this in axis mundi we will use one random electrum server for broadcasts and one random server for watching addresses obviously only over tor . their wires are reversible too and thats a selling point to rich noobs who still use banks once you kick out your buttcoins theyre gone for good and its a pilot program doesnt mean they will adopt bitcoin nessecarily they could be studying blockchain tech to come out with proprietary digital shit like baclaycoin or something and market that why do we need banks again . quote from enigma on september pmthanks for the advice guys youve taken a bit of a hit on the old karma who did you piss

dhl asks for your big public key so does that mean you would have to create new key . arent there onion servers available for electrum the only flaw imo is that electrum still uses your ip to
