inthefuture on april pmit seems drclu has a very abundant supply of gay pornography on his pc who wouldve known i was gon na say something but thought the better of it why the focus on dick in all the listings . i dont have club pip key to verify it but he cant deny sending the threat if he pgp signed it well he can but nobody will believe him like when he said the dnm mods were police as soon as he learned that they banned sr . quote from northwest nuggets on april pmi love how s acts like sr is copying them as if they arent both copies of the site silk road yeah read my post near the top this shit is the sucking face of irony . the worst part is what that missx cunt is sayingquote from miss cuntsome enterprising clown has started a new market called silkroad and guess who its run by dread pirate roberts no less they say imitation is the sincerest form of flattery but in this case the ghastly design and system inadequacies are an insult a few months ago people were saying those exact words about a different market hmmmm ignorance is venomous and it murders the soul spreading like a virus running rampant out of control . tedquote can someone pm me a link please must try and see if its vulnerable to sql injection dr cluquoteted there is nothing worth even trying i did doesn look like it is even functions but i own the front page now do not use real creds a vendor named clu just spammed the market with at least listings that have the sr url in then and various obsceneties . i seriously think all the people who havent had their balls removed should get together in an effort to bring sr and every other sr themed site down it is the cancer of the deepweb i honeslty could give a fuck about what an sr clone scam site thinks about another sr clone scam site i just want all of them and all of their sheep to get the fuck out of here this isnt a place for ignorant cunts . i love how s acts like sr is copying them as if they arent both copies of the site silk road . this makes me think that it really was dpr who threatened backopy over a uri and paid a hacker to try and hack agora over a uri clu acts as if the url is a weapon or something he uses it to attack the other market so he would consider it an attack if he saw a url on his market . quote from inthefuture on april pmhi drclu doctorclu on minutes ago unread reply begin pgp signed message hash sha so who

proper way to deal with threats instead of retalitating if you simply post the threat in public then everybody can see that you are taking the high road so we now know for sure that sr threatens to ddos other sites so they probably are behind the agra ddos as we suspected . lol i think clu messed up he got so angry that he forgot he had recently claimed he didn have a botnet to attack agora with now we have pip signed proof that it was a lie because how can he ddos attack sr yet he is unable to ddos attack agora . quote from inthefuture on april pmit seems drclu has a very abundant supply of gay pornography on his pc who wouldve known i was gon na say something but thought the better of it why the focus on dick in all the listings . both dr clu and father ted tried various exploits on the market and none of them worked all they can do is swam but they are spamming the hell out of the market before clu was banned his listings were very equally explicit and now other vendor accounts are making categories like dick and unloading porn . we have proof clu is a liar too because recently when he was accused on s forum of ddosing agora with his botnet he said he no longer was in control of a botnet he just threatened to use it on sr . quote from inthefuture on april pmhi drclu doctorclu on minutes ago unread reply begin pgp signed message hash sha so who are you what have you done to

it always worked perfectly backopy was great and i dont think you could have asked for anyone better to run a black market the original dpr was also great in my opinion as it seemed he genuinely believed in the movement and i think he was a honourable man unlike many of the learders now who are very much in for the money which is sad but i guess quite creditable . very good security with backopy the site was just painfully slow when is the new one up and running any inside info . i miss bmr . there was a great site as well i too loved bmr backopy it was well run and well staffed the road was also very good i did not get on until like right before ross went down it was amazing the first time i went trolling the site i was in fucking awwwwwwwwwweeeeeeeeeee i must have stayed hours

more orders from agora than i do from pandora the fact that pandora allows vendors to withdraw bitcoins without entering a pin is scarf as fuck they will be hacked and a lot of people will lose coins

and dpr dpr are legends not matter what anybody else says they risked a lot by leading fellow freedom fighters im not a vendor on sr but i love to read their forum cause its pretty interesting and by judging what i see over their now i can say defcon is on his way of becoming a legend himself standing up for the community like he is doing takes a lot of courage so i salute defcon and all the other silk road staff dont forget about topic its hasnt been opened to the public yet but i think it will become a highly respected market because of its administrators and staff we all know that swim
