systems where the market and the vendor are the two parties in posession of the two keys needed to release the funds held in escrow with the poor old buyer you know that person who paid for their order in full without having received it misses out on being given the responsibility of holding one of the keys needed to release the coins held in escrow in reality multi sig systems are as useless as a bull with tits on a dnm only a genuine multi sig escrow system where keys are generated giving one to the vendoor one to the buyer and one to the marketplace from there if the buyer is happy with their order then both they and the vendor can use the two keys in their posession to release the coins to the vendor in a system youl need either the buyer and vendor to agree or vise versa and if an agreemment cant be reached and a dispute opened between the buyer and the vendor in question the administrator or moderator in charge of the dispute who also has posession of one of the keys needed to release the funds in escrow can then review the evidence provided by both parties and then make a firm but fair ruling based on the evidence put in front of them once a winner of the dispute is found

to be that complex at all dense helix light onion link grat sfrom here on always operate within the virtual machine and only with tor remember to always use a different username and password then the one on clearnet law enforcement will otherwise match your tor info with your clearnet info and find you open tor don t connect yet first configure newly acquired pray vpn address in tor and then connect to tor create yourself an anonymous email address like safe mail net or saigant or others this is where the pgp keys come in remember that those services are anonymous but will turn people in if they are forced to do so they are after all clearnet sites in the open we saw what happend to silkroad even if it was on tor better be safe than sorry never use free clearnet emails like hotmail and others those services will turn you in as well register on alphabay market because it s simply the best send bitcoins from your wallet to your alphabet market wallet i would advise you to never leave tons of bitcoins on onion tor sites always withdraw to your own wallet afterwards sites might go down sites might close sites might be hacked and you ll lose everything get educated read read read work work work get educated you get the point never overlook details get the best setup possible or this whole tor adventure could be the biggest mistake of your life shop and do whatever you do

information from vendors as they have worked hard to be where they are and will not give you everything for free you have to put in the work you have to educate yourself read ask around help communicate make friends even though you shouldn t trust anybody really don t forget that law enforcement hangs out on tor and so do scammers and so do assholes and so do criminals and so do rapists and so do murderers you get the point never give away your real information name or location to anybody on tor always remain as elusive as possible you never know who you re talking to tor is full of honey pots and law enforcement that will be friendly to you beware be smart patient and don t be greedy uneducated and greedy moves will get you in trouble never do anything on here when you re high or drunk you always need to focus for whatever you do it minimizes mistakes and at the same time you have to make mistakes to learn drive formatting the proper way by valorssd s and hard drives should not be formatted or irrecoverably erased using the same methods hard drives consist of moving mechanical parts whilst solid state s transfer data using a form of flash memory which is what makes them so compact and less prone to physical wear and tear unlike their counterpart formatting an ssd using the same approach as how you format a hard drive has some implications that may be life threatening to your drive using such a program like dban on your ssd may result in complete death of your drive a shortened life span or even some performance inhibiting side effects thus we all should take the correct approach to securely erasing data on our drives with pre caution and care to what level hardware we are using no one wants their fresh sed factory formatted ssd to fail on them in a month right lolin addition if you were to operate a system for use in illicit activities then i would suggest you use a solid state drive as your primary form of data storage reason being is that hard drives even when securely erased still have a low chance of being forensically recovered with whatever methods the forensic analyst has chosen to use sounds weird but we never know how these federal agencies or corrupt authorities are up to lol as for ssd s its practically impossible to recover any data when erased properly the data read and write speeds are greater due to the fact that no moving parts are involved and that it does not have to write to a disk that can be forensically suspected when formatting an ssd there is a spike in voltage sent to all the flash storage chips on the device and that resets all the electrons within it back to a factory state this can be performed as many times as you want ll but erase is fine as it overwrites pre existing data many times over software for formatting and irrecoverably erasing data on a hard drive hdderase this software erases is capable of erasing everything that is on the hard drive it is known to supports only built in drive sanitization method it come in iso for thus you can develop a notable flash drive from it download hhderase go to darik s boot and duke dban its open source makes data irrecoverable has six option for you to erase hard drive it overwrites the hard drive with pseudo numbers that are generated dban can be download from software for formatting and irrecoverably erasing data on a solid state drive ccleaner cleans interest history removes temporary items from many applications comes with an built registry cleaner the clean gets and fixes registry errors download it here eraser works with windows xp windows serve windows vista works with any drive as long as the drive works with windows erase hard drive folders files and the already delete files works well with customizable scheduler to get this hard drive eraser go to for formatting and irrecoverably erasing data on a solid state drive active killdisk pro in line with over international data erasure standards allows the user to apply custom erasure methods it erases suds and us drives to confirm complete data removal it provides a certificate improved parallel erasing performance you can stop the erasure after a give number of errors to get this hard drive erase go to parted magic best software to use to securely erase data on solid state drives build specially for the erasing of data on ssd s costs a bit but is well worth the money here is the link use a prepaid to purchase for the hands on methods to destroy data d hard drivesok what do you do if you want to wipe drives that have died or become defective in some way with data still on them that now can not be wiped you could take a chance that since the drive is dead the data is gone but you got to plan on the drive falling into the hands of someone cleverer than you or someone who has more time and patience you will need a hammer i use my trusty of fine adjustment hammer a thick nail a inch nail will do fine thick gloves because youre going to be hammering that nail through the drive using the hammer and hammers are magnetically attracted to thumbs a block of wood so you dont nail the drive to your floor its preferable to do this outside if you can eye protection youve only got a maximum of two to start with so its silly to take chances now you apply brute force really you want to put a nail through the platters of the drive going all the way through its actually not as hard as it sounds i aim for the spot marked by the red x by aiming for this spot you not only smash the platters holding the data but you also mangle the read write heads if youre really paranoid put a nail through the green stars which will put more holes in the platters this is a very effective method of destroying drives and its also a lot of fun not to mention a great way to relieve stress the hands on method for ssd sif the drive is dead or you just want to get rid of it in a hurry and dont want a functioning drive at the end of it then you can take a hammer to the ssd one thing to bear in mind is that the data in ssds in held on small flash storage chips rather than large platters and to securely erase the data you need to smash the chips usually this means taking the cover off the drive before you start swinging if youre not sure which are the flash storage chips just drive a nail through all the large chips just to be on the safe side . found a

during my years on tor i have seen countless scam attempts and many sad faces of those who were ripped off lets face it here in the deep web scammers will always exist plain and simple no matter how hard we all try to bust them down their presence will always remain you will find them on forums their own websites and throughout all major and established dark markets now that we all have accepted this sad issue lets discuss the many methods to help prevent you from falling into this trap first and foremost the number one rule when doing business on the deep web is to always trust your instinct in sure all of you heard this old saying before if its too good to be true it probably is i know its very cliche but it still holds a lot of merit most swam victims fail to follow this quote and go with their impulses instead they see a product or deal at a astounding price that they dont think of anything else but having the items in their hands its like being hypnotized in a sense dont worry im not talking down on anyone its human nature to follow with impulses just remember that next time you see an amazing deal think it through and see if this can be realistic now that we covered the golden rule im now going to discuss the different types of scam methods that are present thought the deep web please post if i left anything out or if you have any questions or comments the hidden wiki thw thw is probably one of the oldest sites still in existance on tor it is more then likely one of the first sites many people new to tor visit it can be quite an amazing discovery seeing all the different businesses selling drugs weapons fraud items stolen electronics etc for a lack of words its really gamesome to see that you now have access to pretty much anything you want when you didnt prior to setting up tor now the problem here is that thw can be moderated by pretty much anyone who has registered an account some of the nefarious hidden wiki staff are very aware of the many new comers to th deep web this is why it is safe to that just about every commercial site on thw are seams plan and simple even legitimate and well known markets featured on thw are more then likely phishing sites set up to steal your account information long story short avoid the hidden wiki when searching for market links example of phishing site for sr do not login best way to tell is that the url is obviously the wrong one if you need a link to a market site visit the subreddit darknetmarkets or the deep dot web these sites provide legitimate market links that are never altered if anyone knows of any other sites new comers can use to find let links please toss them up non market commercial sitesjust like the ones listed on thw pretty much all of the small sites that sell products and services are all pretty much scams the only exception are sites that operated by established market vendors who are well recognized and can be verified with their pgp if anyone needs help verifying someones pgp you are more then welcome to message me and ill be glad to help plus there are a few sites that catalog vendor pgps and offer verification as well ill show you some examples of sites and how to tell the are rippers green notes counter is a site that sells counterfeit money sadly they do not accept escrow and give the typical scammer reason that they do not trust escrow sites but for some ill logic reason its okay to trust them lol year right double your btc is a site that promises to return to you the double amount of btc you send them lets think about this who on earth will give you free money no one thats who if they have such a wonderful method on doubling bitcoin then why would they share it and not just keep it themselves to get rich well actually they do have a method for getting rich its by stealing others coin carders paradise wow a site that sells closed debit cards with a pin so that you can just easily walk to any atm and cash it out just like with the double your etc service who in their right mind would give away free money why couldnt they just keep the cards and cash them out themselves these are the question you have to ask and the true simple answer is that they dont have any cards they just want your coin and bolt peoples drug store another rip off site that offers no escrow protection and just wants steal from you same with the other mentioned sites they state that once payment is received they will mail you the shipping information i hate to say it but you will be waiting a long time for that info important keep and eye out with other sites using the same format they are hasted by a pseudo organization called torshops avoid all of their sites at all costs iphones for just gon na say it all of these electric stores are seams never have i seen a let ones either they feed you a line of shit on why they dont crow and there are ones that offer a fake escrow service the sites with escrow accepted will usually send you a link to a site you probably never heard of and ask you do depoist money and simply release it when you get your item sadly the electric site most likely owns that escrow site and will just take the btc and avoid your emails i wont go into a lot of detail but the self operated sites that sell guns and offer hitman services they are all scams plain and simple the solution is to just stick to the established markets and use their escrow system remember escrow is the main line of defense that protects you from losing your coin always use it scammers on commercial marketsthis section will cover how to spot and deal with rippers that use established markets to host their swam some of them demand fe on everything others will appear to have upstanding feedback and there are even some that offer escrow too crazy i know so here are the ways to spot them and some tactics they use to steal your coins the first and easy ones to spot are the brand new vendors to a site with no reputation and off the bat request fe they either sell a great variety of different products red flag at great price hoping to grab as many customers as possible or they have a few big and expensive products and wait until someone takes the bait when you spot these people question them on why they dont accept escrow the most common replies scammers give are they done trust escrow or btc is too unpredictable whatever excuse they give you just walk away i know thats a killer deal they offer but wouldnt you rather be at peace of mind there are plenty of let vendors that accept escrow done risk it and go with them i forgot to mention always check their feedback and the forums to find any reviews the vendor may have this will give you better assurance whether or not to deal with the vendor a lot of the time you will find scammers with amazing feedback how could this be well they use the tactic called feedback stacking this is when a scammer registers numerous buyer accounts and buy from themselves and leave amazing feedback here is what to look for when spotting padded feedback numerous complete orders on the same day price is extremely low or item was delete same username or same comments are used over and over again example if you have pandora login and check out this sellers profile note this is not an attack on pandora it was just an example i found these are found on every market sorry pandora bbb d scroll all the way down and look at the feedback long way down sellers way of hiding it loot at that this is probably the most obvious padded feedback ever seen some are more clever then that but they always slip up by showing a pattern youll notice it when you come across it when you order from a vendor and the item is in crow make sure you note the shipping time a lot of rippers will set a short shipping time hoping that you wont notice so that the order will auto finalize just remember when funds are released whether after feing or the order auto finalized the first thing that vendor will do is quickly withdraw the coin to their wallet it is now out of the staffs hands to recover your money one final note be careful when posting in the wanted or buyer request section of a markets forum this is where a lot of rip offs occur you may get plenty of pms from people who arent even a vendor saying they can help you out just remember to tell them hell no and wait for a

reputation and off the bat request fe they either sell a great variety of different products red flag at great price hoping to grab as many customers as possible or they have a few big and expensive products and wait until someone takes the bait when you spot these people question them on why they dont accept escrow the most common replies scammers give are they done trust escrow or btc is too unpredictable whatever excuse they give you just walk away i know thats a killer deal they offer but wouldnt you rather be at peace of mind there are plenty of let vendors that accept escrow done risk it and go with them i forgot to mention always check their feedback and the forums to find any reviews the vendor may have this will give you better assurance whether or not to deal with the vendor a lot of the time you will find scammers with amazing feedback how could this be well they use the tactic called feedback stacking this is when a scammer registers numerous buyer accounts and buy from themselves and leave amazing feedback here is what to look for when spotting padded feedback numerous complete orders on the same day price is extremely low or item was delete same username or same comments are used over and over again example if you have pandora login and check out this sellers profile note this is not an attack on pandora it was just an example i found these are found on every market sorry pandora bbb d scroll all the way down and look at the feedback long way down sellers way of hiding it loot at that this is probably the most obvious padded feedback ever seen some are more clever then that but they always slip up by showing a pattern youll notice it when you come across it when you order from a vendor and the item is in crow make sure you note the shipping time a lot of rippers will set a short shipping time hoping that you wont notice so that the order will auto finalize just remember when funds are released whether after feing or the order auto finalized the first thing that vendor will do is quickly withdraw the coin to their wallet it is now out of the staffs hands to recover your money one final note be careful when posting in the wanted or buyer request section of a markets forum this is where a lot of rip offs occur you may get plenty of pms from people who arent even a vendor saying they can help you out just remember to tell them hell no and wait for a verified vendor to reply because you know whats gon na if you decide to follow through with that pm offer well this is what i got so far pretty long winded i know please feel free to

hyper rare substances items especially discontinued sparingly prescribed pills up powders mescaline is not that realistic but someone is advertising the fabled diurnal sufentana too goggle will help clear up that sort of horseshit right away taken from user boogie on alphabay during my years on tor i have seen countless scam attempts and many sad faces of those who were ripped off lets face it here in the deep web scammers will always exist plain and simple no matter how hard we all try to bust them down their presence will always remain you will find them on forums their own websites and throughout all major and established dark markets now that we all have accepted this sad issue lets discuss the many methods to help prevent you from falling into this trap first and foremost the number one rule when doing business on the deep web is to always trust your instinct in sure all of you heard this old saying before if its too good to be true it probably is i know its very cliche but it still holds a lot of merit most swam victims fail to follow this quote and go with their impulses instead they see a product or deal at a astounding price that they dont think of anything else but having the items in their hands its like being hypnotized in a sense dont worry im not talking down on anyone its human nature to follow with impulses just remember that next time you see an amazing deal think it through and see if this can be realistic now that we covered the golden rule im now going to discuss the different types of scam methods that are present thought the deep web please post if i left anything out or if you have any questions or comments the hidden wiki thw thw is probably one of the oldest sites still in existance on tor it is more then likely one of the first sites many people new to tor visit it can be quite an amazing discovery seeing all the different businesses selling drugs weapons fraud items stolen electronics etc for a lack of words its really gamesome to see that you now have access to pretty much anything you want when you didnt prior to setting up tor now the problem here is that thw can be moderated by pretty much anyone who has registered an account some of the nefarious hidden wiki staff are very aware of the many new comers to th deep web this is why it is safe to that just about every commercial site on thw are seams plan and simple even legitimate and well known markets featured on thw are more then likely phishing sites set up to steal your account information long story short avoid the hidden wiki when searching for market links example of phishing site for sr do not login best way to tell is that the url is obviously the wrong one if you need a link to a market site visit the subreddit darknetmarkets or the deep dot web these sites provide legitimate market links that are never altered if anyone knows of any other sites new comers can use to find let links please toss them up non market commercial sitesjust like the ones listed on thw pretty much all of the small sites that sell products and services are all pretty much scams the only exception are sites that operated by established market vendors who are well recognized and can be verified with their pgp if anyone needs help verifying someones pgp you are more then welcome to message me and ill be glad to help plus there are a few sites that catalog vendor pgps and offer verification as well ill show you some examples of sites and how to tell the are rippers green notes counter is a site that sells counterfeit money sadly they do not accept escrow and give the typical scammer reason that they do not trust escrow sites but for some ill logic reason its okay to trust them lol year right double your btc is a site that promises to return to you the double amount of btc you send them lets think about this who on earth will give you free money no one thats who if they have such a wonderful method on doubling bitcoin then why would they share it and not just keep it themselves to get rich well actually they do have a method for getting rich its by stealing others coin carders paradise wow a site that sells closed debit cards with a pin so that you can just easily walk to any atm and cash it out just like with the double your etc service who in their right mind would give away free money why couldnt they just keep the cards and cash them out themselves these are the question you have to ask and the true simple answer is that they dont have any cards they just want your coin and bolt peoples drug store another rip off site that offers no escrow protection and just wants steal from you same with the other mentioned sites they state that once payment is received they will mail you the shipping information i hate to say it but you will be waiting a long time for that info important keep and eye out with other sites using the same format they are hasted by a pseudo organization called torshops avoid all of their sites at all costs iphones for just gon na say it all of these electric stores are seams never have i seen a let ones either they feed you a line of shit on why they dont crow and there are ones that offer a fake escrow service the sites with escrow accepted will usually send you a link to a site you probably never heard of and ask you do depoist money and simply release it when you get your item sadly the electric site most likely owns that escrow site and will just take the btc and avoid your emails i wont go into a lot of detail but the self operated sites that sell guns and offer hitman services they are all scams plain and simple the solution is to just stick to the established markets and use their escrow system remember escrow is the main line of defense that protects you from losing your coin always use it scammers on commercial marketsthis section will cover how to spot and deal with rippers that use established markets to host their swam some of them demand fe on

when if we will have any new info so far there were no reported updates from the admins either way if it goes back up you should avoid any deposits to the market until the issues with the locked out vendors are cleared until then remember exit scams are part of the dark net markets game some alternatives are in my signature current time issues are also being reported on cryuserv which is hosting
