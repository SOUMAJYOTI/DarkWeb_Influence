it sound like your site doesnt use wallets but in fact the btc is still sent to your wallet quotebuyers send payments directly to the escrow account for that order and sellers are paid directly from the escrow account to their external wallet with a small commission deduced there is a wallet because its being used as an escrow account a wallet that you keep and is not on the site itself quoted for the escrow accounts the private keys for these are kept offline and decrypted with two separate keys current my personal key and the system key so only you have full access to the btc and even if i want my btc only you can get it for me mutually how long does it take what if your service was unavoidable how do i know you wont run off with the btc quoteim also sceptical of mufti sig as a rogue market operator could steal bitcoins despite the use of multi sig if they were determined at the end of the day there has to be a level of trust between the user and the admit otherwise these markets would not work mufti sig or not it makes no difference do you even know what you are talking about how could a rogue market operator steal btc from a multi sig address they would also need the private key of either buyer or seller multi sig address is locked in the bitcoin blockchain not by the market operator quotei take precautions to prevent any bitcoins being stolen by external parties but people using any service will have to decide for themselves whether the administrator is a credible enough mediator for them to place their trust with during bitin transactions with the stuff listed above trust is a tough issue here you even denied a reproducible xss vulnerability listed on reddit com a while back worst part is the vulnerability is still there i have torbrowser set to alert me of
