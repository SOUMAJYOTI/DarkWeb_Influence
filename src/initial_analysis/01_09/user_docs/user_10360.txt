would give you a but i dont have enough posts yet i do change my return addresses regularly and never go back to old ones other tips to make your letter or package not stand out are do not overlay tape the outside of the package this is another thing they look for you can tape the inside and it will not show make sure the contents done rattle or shift around if sending powders put them inside multiply packaging to resist penetration portal employees have been known to puncture a package to better sniff the contents instead of using cryer sheets or other scented things to mask the odor invest in year packaging to stop odor another good thing to use is aluminum foil bags sealed with aluminum tape . what are the things the post office and dea look for to decide what packages to inspect closely billions of packages and letters are sent every year so they obviously cant inspect each one they do not have dogs sitting by the conveyor belt which has mail whizzing by it just doesnt work that way dogs get bored quickly when they dont detect what they are trained to sniff for plus the length of time is not enough for a careful sniff they look for certain things one of those is a false return name and address they have high speed scanners which can scan the to and from address of each piece of mail they have computers that will check it against known addresses and can match it to the name associated with that address this helps them avoid sending out mail and having to send it back when its misaddressed but they can also spot a false return they wont investigate solely because of that but it is a red flag other things they look for are strong odors coming from the package like coffee perfume etc that is usually used to mask the odor of drugs they also look for hand written labels no one of those things are enough but a suspicious odor will usually make them look further and if it has a false return they will then usually bring in the dog and present the package along with some other packages to see if the dog alerts if it does that is probable cause to get a warrant when i send a package i always use a real name and address from the phone book i print out the label so no hand written or type labels which they look for the goods have to be carefully packages and if they have an odor it must be put into mylar and well sealed also i dont handle the package when i have handled product i dont ask anyone to sign for the package they can use that against you though its not solid proof if they just drop it in your mailbox wait a while before bringing it in take a walk and check out whats going on in the area before bringing it in if its not supposed to be signed for and they ask you to sign refuse the package or if its not supposed to be signed for but they knock on the door and present you with the package that is very very suspicious obviously if they knock and talk say nothing except to deny you ordered anything anyone have other tips . quote from mirage on february amto cross post from an sr post i made a couple months back in the shipping forum at vendors please read recycling return addys years ago on the old forums as a former vendor using a different nym i ranted at times about the potential of snail mail itself being tracked and the impact that could potentially have on a business model such as ours and my rants seemed at times to fall on deaf ears what first led me to consider this possibility were confirmations that alphabet soup had for over years been hiding from the public that they were tracking all license plates and the movements locations of all cars in washington d c and other cities at all times using a network of cameras position throughout the city for example study government tracking movement of every vehicle with license plate more important that the technology they were using was based on tech the usps had developed and been using for many many years prior to track mail whether for surveillance purposes or simply for proper delivery purposes is irrelevant they were using technology based on what the usps had been using for years to track unknowing us citizens and recent articles have since proved this theory correct that the asa surveillance program includes tracking not only cell phone internet location and electric communications metadata but uses snailmail as well u s portal service logging all mail for law enforcement portal service uses spying programs similar to asa mail spy u s portal service active partner with feds for surveillance picture of each side of each and every envelope or package sent thru usps is taken in the process of its delivery to the intended recipient now i have always said that all vendors should just assume that at least one or more of their products was purchased by the dea posing as a buyer for obvious reasons to hopefully collect fingerprint handwriting samples eat and to at the very least know which city county state said vendor is shipping and most likely operating from and now the dea has a record of at least one return address said vendor used in the process so it is common understanding that return addys should either besides being printed and not at least always be handwritten that a use a fake name or fake home business type name with a real address preferable from a local apartment complex with the apartment unit omitted as to not unintentionally get someone else who might be a friend ally in trouble or b use the name addy of a small local retail store which one could safely assume is not likely involved in illegal activities and using their name addy shouldn unwittingly compromise anyones freedom although the feds are well aware the majority of vendors use a fake return addy this has not always been the case as the recent busts of those s vendors doctors in the boston area i believe prove they used a po box registered using their real world credentials as a return address really regardless a mistake i truly hope never to see repeated again what im getting at is in my opinion i feel until a long term trust has been built with a specific customer a vendor should always use a brand new return address for each and every letter package they send out yes this is an extra tedious time consuming process but its nothing a phone book the internet and a ox program like snailmail wont make much easier to accomplish because remember assume at least one of your packages was indeed ordered by the feds and contained a return address a return address that is now flagged in the uses system and in the future could be used to track your packages if used again to identify your customers and even compromise your own safety by allowing them to narrow down the hopefully various multiply drops you use and many articles referenced that the feds did indeed pose as buyers to collect such data before the fall of sr so this is now fact and beyond theory at this point and i feel personally it is your responsibility as a vendor to take this extra precaution until a certain level of trust has been built with individual customers at which point you are free to consider recycling return addresses as it were or so a little bird told me peacemirage . there are many other things i havent mentioned for example use gloves when handling goods when packing and when mailing an alternative for using gloves when dropping your mail off is to put it in a plastic bag wearing gloves and then they can be slid from the bag directly into the blue box no gloves needed at that point

makes it too easy to set up a controlled delivery when you get your package let it sit in the mailbox for a while before you take it in dont be in such a rush in fact its good to take a little walk to eyeball the neighborhood to spot suspicious vehicles people loitering for no obvious reason etc after you get your mail let it sit by the door a while unopened if they bang on your door asking if you got anything you didnt expect to get say yes and hand it over if its unopened it makes you look innocent and adds support to your statement that you didnt order it . a very good point mirage i would

handling of the gun i do with pairs of gloves on i thoroughly wipe each piece down with gun oil then a lint free cloth before putting it in a bubble mailer so no possible trace of prints i use different types of labels different fonts with business label shipping templates yeah in kind of canal about it lol the more professional you make your packages look the less likely they are to arouse suspicion i live in a larger metropolitan city so what i do is i have a list of all the apartment complexes in a mile radius i keep track of how often i use each one i use a fake name and simply dont put an apartment number on the return address i take each package to a different post office each time keeping track of which ones i go to before walking into the post office i wipe the mailer down then bring it in holding it between my index and thumb i swing it back and forth so people don t wonder why i m carrying it like that as i m handing it to the clerk i slide my fingers opposite each hard which gets rid of any print that might have been there year again i m canal lol with the receiver i wrap it in sticky lead tape to make it look like anything except a receiver to a gun in case it gets x rayed i normally throw other stuff in the packages too that are made of metal never had one not make it . in my own case i ship firearms i ship it in pieces and ironically the receiver is the

mirage you just repeated what i said about plastic vs mylar or foil if you can find gloves that fit closely there is nothing wrong with wearing of them i just done see the need wearing gloves to me is like having robot fingers that are super clumsy nothing they can trace will go through a cotton glove you are only wearing it long enough to do the packing what are other ways to stop odor from coming through put the goods in a glass jar put them in a tin of some sort and tape it carefully pack them in pvc pack them in abs or other odor proof plastic any other tips . another point i should mention is do not use plastic bags elastic wrap etc to stop odor that and vac sealing do not stop odor for more than a few minutes even triple sealing does very little and can be smelled by a human let alone a dog after hours or so use mylar at the maximum aluminum foil bags are even better seal them with aluminum tape found at home improvement centers world wide id also suggest using layers of gloves one cloth then an external par of nitre gloves not latexthat will certainly work but no need for pair of gloves one pair of cotton will do the job no prints will get through that latex or nitrile will get hot as hell if you wear them for long same with other rubber substitutes . another point i should mention is do not use plastic bags elastic wrap etc to stop odor that and vac sealing do not stop odor for more than a few minutes even triple sealing does very little and can be smelled by a human let alone a dog after hours or so use mylar at the maximum aluminum foil bags are even better seal them with aluminum tape found at home improvement centers world wide id also suggest using layers of gloves one cloth then an external par of nitre gloves not latexthat will certainly work but no need for pair of gloves one pair of cotton will do the job no prints will get through that latex or nitrile will get hot as hell if you wear them for long same with other rubber substitutes . bandcamp those are good points mirage you just repeated what i said about plastic vs mylar or foil if you can find gloves that fit closely there is nothing wrong with wearing of them i just done see the need wearing gloves to me is like having robot fingers that are super clumsy nothing they can trace will go through a cotton glove you are only wearing it long enough to do the packing what are other ways to stop odor from coming through put the goods in a glass jar put them in a tin of some sort and tape it carefully pack them in pvc pack them in abs or other odor proof plastic any other tips . bandcamp those

thats actually illegal to ship any handling of the gun i do with pairs of gloves on i thoroughly wipe each piece down with gun oil then a lint free cloth before putting it in a bubble mailer so no possible trace of prints i use different types of labels different fonts with business label shipping templates yeah in kind of canal about it lol the more professional you make your packages look the less likely they are to arouse suspicion i live in a larger metropolitan city so what i do is i have a list of all the apartment complexes in a mile radius i keep track of how often i use each one i use a fake name and simply dont put an apartment number on the return address i take each package to a different post office each time keeping track of which ones i go to before walking into the post office i wipe the mailer down then bring it in holding it between my index and thumb i swing it back and forth so people don t wonder why i m carrying it like that as i m handing it to the clerk i slide my fingers opposite each hard which gets rid of any print that might have been there year again i m canal lol with the receiver i wrap it in sticky lead tape to make it look like anything except a receiver to a gun in case it gets x rayed i normally throw other stuff in the packages too that are made of metal never had one not make it . another point i should mention is do not use plastic
