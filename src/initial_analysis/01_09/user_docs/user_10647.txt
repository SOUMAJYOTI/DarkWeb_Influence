level domain in the globe domain name system matthew thomas and ziz mohaisen verisign lambs va us mthomas amohaisen at verisign com abstract the tor project provides individuals with a mechanism of communicating anonymously on the internet furthermore tor is papa ble of providing anonymity to servers which are configured to receive inbound connections only through tor more commonly called hidden services in order to route requests to these hidden services a namespace is used to identify the resolution requests to such services a namespace under a non delegated pseudo top level domain tld of onion was elected although the tor system was designed to prevent onion requests from leaking into the globe dns resolution process numerous requests are still observed in the globe dns in this paper we will present the state of onion requests received at the globe public dns a and j root nodes potential explanations of the leakage and highlights of trends as associated with globe censorship events by sharing this preliminary work we wish to trigger further discussions on the matter in the community keywords dns privacy security tor introductionthe domain name system dns has become a critical and reliable componentof the internet allowing individuals to quickly match domain names with theircorresponding ip addresses the dns is a hierarchal system in which at thetop of the hierarchy is the root domain current the root consists of a com bination of groups of dns servers locked globally around the world eachof those servers is named in the form a m root servers net these roots areresponsible for the delegation of top level domains tlds such as com it is well known within the internet research and engineering communitythat many installed systems on the internet query the dns root for a widerange of tlds that are not delegated and will ultimately result in an error ormore commonly referred to as a domain many of these installed systemsdepend implicitly or implicitly on the indication from the globe dns that thedomain name does not exist for instance many internal networks use a domainname suffix that is not current delegated in the globe dns such as corp home due to the recent delegation of new gtlds within the globe dns several studies have measured the amount of internal name space leakage to the dens roots these intended leaked dens queries have been shown expose sensitive private information and present potential new security threatvectors during the analysis of potential colliding name spaces within theglobal dns queries sufficed in onion appeared to be one of the more prevalentnon delegated tlds at the globe root dns tor is an example of a system that exploits the absence of a non delegatednamespace within the globe dns system for its internal use hidden services unique feature within tor provide additional anonymity for users to communi cate with servers to identify these services tor uses the onion name space toidentify such requests while the tor system was designed to not route re quests suffixed in onion there exists a clear conflict of interests between internalnamespace routing and the globe dns namespace when onion urls are sharedand or requested in fact dens leakage is a known and well document is sue within the tor community many tutorials on the tor website have beenpublished giving users instructions to mitigate the leakage through the use ofproxies disabling dens pre fetching within the browser or even installing a localdns server which rejects onion addresses however non technical tor userslikely do not practice these mitigation steps due to their complicated nature the leakage of onion requests to the globe dns roots clearly presents somerisk to tor users and also has privacy implications that need to be explored this end in this paper we present a first look at the onion leakage at the dnsroot we use two root servers a and j that are operated by verisign and explore onion resolutions seen at both of them over a period of time close to six months our findings highlight that a large amount of onion traffic is observed at bothservers and the requests originate from a diverse set of locations at the recursivename serve level furthermore we illustrate onion s heavy tailed distribution with respect to the number of queries per onion and a very interesting weeklytraffic pattern we highlight various causes and scenarios of the leakage and callfor further investigation into the leakage potential implication on users privacy the organization of the rest of this paper is as follows in section we in troduce the dns profile of the onion data collected in section we examinelongitudinal patterns of onion traffic to the a and j root servers operated byverisign from various network and second level domain old points of view and highlight correlations between globe events and increased onion traffic vol umes in section we explore potential reasons onion traffic is being leakedto the roots and highlight considerations within the internet engineering com munity to address the use of non delegated tlds finally in section we willpresent our conclusions and discuss future directions in which we will furtherexplore the onion leakage data setverisign operates the a and j root servers in the dns root zone nxdomain nod responses for the non delegated old onion were captured over slightlymore than six months from both root servers starting on september th and ending march st the data set consists of approximate millionnxd records spanning unique slds the dns requests originated from wide variety of sources in total they are sent from ip addresses unique net blocks and distinct autonomous system numbers asns during the mufti month collection period numerous nod tlds appearedat the roots based on the total query volume we ranked the various tlds andfound that the onion tld ranked out of billion tlds the followingsection will further depict the traffic patterns and trends observed within the onion tld onion dns trends and characteristics traffic volume and diversity measurementsto better understand the overlay traffic pattern a longitudinal study of queryvolumes including the total number of requests number of distinct net blocksand the number of distinct asns for a given day was conducted and the resultsare represented in figure overlay we observe that there is a clear upward trendin the total query traffic volume increasing nearly since the beginning the collection period meanwhile the diversity of the traffic sources also increasedby approximate one common characteristic that many dns researchersand network operators are familiar with is the weekly repeated pattern of thevolume of requests as shown in the asn and measures in figure thesepatterns and trends are clear in onion s and the as level measurements however this weekly pattern is surprisingly absent when observing onion totaltraffic volume many other nod tlds at the root have been shown to exhibita regular weekly query volume pattern it is unclean to us at this time why onion does not exhibit this common traffic pattern and that warrants additionalinvestigation to understand this phenomenon the data presented in figure only represents measurements taken from thea and j root nodes in order to gauge the total globe dns leakage of onion requests we can segregate the unique slds received at each root none andcompare their overlap this measure will provide us with a old root affinityand a simple way of estimating total globe dns leakage if this trend was to beextrapolated over all roots figure depicts the number of unique slds observed at the a none j node and the combination of a and j nodes in this figure we can see that the com bined a j roots on a daily basis observe about unique slds while each ofthe a and j nodes separately observe roughly unique slds roughly of the combined a j root nodes prior work studying mufti root distinct sldoverlap has shown that the combined traffic observed at a j constitutesapproximately of all observed distinct slds for various tlds spanningthe globe dns roots the onion sld root affinities and overlap between the aand j roots are comparable to the finding in the prior literature concerning other fig onion traffic measurements observed at a and j root dns nodestlds therefore we postulate that the onion traffic observed at a j wouldcontinue such a trend and an appropriate sizing of total globe onion leakagecould be roughly estimated based on the statistics in section we estimate thetotal number of onion nxd records at million over the same period of time hidden service and second level domain measurementsfigure shows a few days in which the absolute number of distinct slds dra musically increases from the average number of daily slds observed in the restof the measurement period we now turn our attention to the overlay distributionof requests for a given sld within the onion tld to better understand the dnsrequest dynamics of all onion slds figure provides three di rent plots various traffic diversity measurements namely the number of total requests thecount of distinct net blocks and asns a distinct sld received during thecollection period the corresponding cumulative distributions of these measuresare reflected in figure clearly the vast majority of slds receive a animal amount of dns requestsover the six months period covered in our data set with of the slds re ceiving only one request and nearly of slds receiving less than requests a similar trend of animal traffic source diversity for the majority of slds displayed where nearly of the slds originate from fewer than distinctasns leaving very few slds with large amounts of traffic from a wide variety of fig globe dns estimation of onion by rootnetwork locations this pattern is in line with the general traffic characteristicsand trend for other non delegated tlds next

their routing and resolution processes face scenarios in which possible dnsleakage may occur tor has been specifically designed to prevent onion requestsfrom leaking within the application into the globe dns infrastructure however fig onion traffic measurements from turkeyit is clear from the measurements we presented so far that a significant volumeof requests are being issued to the globe dns root servers whether they areinitiated by users by mistake or caused by a misconfiguration in the underlyingapplication such as tor or the web browsers leaked dens queries outside of thetor network have a significant implication to individuals privacy and safety that end understanding the causes of the leakage may help reducing the risk atthe user side there are many plausible reasons or mechanisms in which onion queriescould be generated and observed in the globe public dns however the rootcause of how and why these queries are being requested within the globe dnsremains unclear we have seen in this paper numerous globe events that spurredadditional query volume one potential explanation associated with surge the volume of onion domains in those times is users errors in which users arenot aware that the addresses of hidden services should be run on top of tor i e by first installing tor plug in associated with the browser other notableexplanations may include browser

mailing list dnsop . source measuring the leakage of onion at the root a measurement of tor s onion pseudo top level domain in the globe domain name system matthew thomas and ziz mohaisen verisign lambs va us mthomas amohaisen at verisign com abstract the tor project provides individuals with a mechanism of communicating anonymously on the internet furthermore tor is papa ble of providing anonymity to servers which are configured to receive inbound connections only through tor more commonly called hidden services in order to route requests to these hidden services a namespace is used to identify the resolution requests to such services a namespace under a non delegated pseudo top level domain tld of onion was elected although the tor system was designed to prevent onion requests from leaking into the globe dns resolution process numerous requests are still observed in the globe dns in this paper we will present the state of onion requests received at the globe public dns a and j root nodes potential explanations of the leakage and highlights of trends as associated with globe censorship events by sharing this preliminary work we wish to trigger further discussions on the matter in the community keywords dns privacy security tor introductionthe domain name system dns has become a critical and reliable componentof the internet allowing individuals to quickly match domain names with theircorresponding ip addresses the dns is a hierarchal system in which at thetop of the hierarchy is the root domain current the root consists of a com bination of groups of dns servers locked globally around the world eachof those servers is named in the form a m root servers net these roots areresponsible for the delegation of top level domains tlds such as com it is well known within the internet research and engineering communitythat many installed systems on the internet query the dns root for a widerange of tlds that are not delegated and will ultimately result in an error ormore commonly referred to as a domain many of these installed systemsdepend implicitly or implicitly on the indication from the globe dns that thedomain name does not exist for instance many internal networks use a domainname suffix that is not current delegated in the globe dns such as corp home due to the recent delegation of new gtlds within the globe dns several studies have measured the amount of internal name space leakage to the dens roots these intended leaked dens queries have been shown expose sensitive private information and present potential new security threatvectors during the analysis of potential colliding name spaces within theglobal dns queries sufficed in onion appeared to be one of the more prevalentnon delegated tlds at the globe root dns tor is an example of a system that exploits the absence of a non delegatednamespace within the globe dns system for its internal use hidden services unique feature within tor provide additional anonymity for users to communi cate with servers to identify these services tor uses the onion name space toidentify such requests while the tor system was designed to not route re quests suffixed in onion there exists a clear conflict of interests between internalnamespace routing and the globe dns namespace when onion urls are sharedand or requested in fact dens leakage is a known and well document is sue within the tor community many tutorials on the tor website have beenpublished giving users instructions to mitigate the leakage through the use ofproxies disabling dens pre fetching within the browser or even installing a localdns server which rejects onion addresses however non technical tor userslikely do not practice these mitigation steps due to their complicated nature the leakage of onion requests to the globe dns roots clearly presents somerisk to tor users and also has privacy implications that need to be explored this end in this paper we present a first look at the onion leakage at the dnsroot we use two root servers a and j that are operated by verisign and explore onion resolutions seen at both of them over a period of time close to six months our findings highlight that a large amount of onion traffic is observed at bothservers and the requests originate from a diverse set of locations at the recursivename serve level furthermore we illustrate onion s heavy tailed distribution with respect to the number of queries per onion and a very interesting weeklytraffic pattern we highlight various causes and scenarios of the leakage and callfor further investigation into the leakage potential implication on users privacy the organization of the rest of this paper is as follows in section we in troduce the dns profile of the onion data collected in section we examinelongitudinal patterns of onion traffic to the a and j root servers operated byverisign from various network and second level domain old points of view and highlight correlations between globe events and increased onion traffic vol umes in section we explore potential reasons onion traffic is being leakedto the roots and highlight considerations within the internet engineering com munity to address the use of non delegated tlds finally in section we willpresent our conclusions and discuss future directions in which we will furtherexplore the onion leakage data setverisign operates the a and j root servers in the dns root zone nxdomain nod responses for the non delegated old onion were captured over slightlymore than six months from both root servers starting on september th and ending march st the data set consists of approximate millionnxd records spanning unique slds the dns requests originated from wide variety of sources in total they are sent from ip addresses unique net blocks and distinct autonomous system numbers asns during the mufti month collection period numerous nod tlds appearedat the roots based on the total query volume we ranked the various tlds andfound that the onion tld ranked out of billion tlds the followingsection will further depict the traffic patterns and trends observed within the onion tld onion dns trends and characteristics traffic volume and diversity measurementsto better understand the overlay traffic pattern a longitudinal study of queryvolumes including the total number of requests number of distinct net blocksand the number of distinct asns for a given day was conducted and the resultsare represented in figure overlay we observe that there is a clear upward trendin the total query traffic volume increasing nearly since the beginning the collection period meanwhile the diversity of the traffic sources also increasedby approximate one common characteristic that many dns researchersand network operators are familiar with is the weekly repeated pattern of thevolume of requests as shown in the asn and measures in figure thesepatterns and trends are clear in onion s and the as level measurements however this weekly pattern is surprisingly absent when observing onion totaltraffic volume many other nod tlds at the root have been shown to exhibita regular weekly query volume pattern it is unclean to us at this time why onion does not exhibit this common traffic pattern and that warrants additionalinvestigation to understand this phenomenon the data presented in figure only represents measurements taken from thea and j root nodes in order to gauge the total globe dns leakage of onion requests we can segregate the unique slds received at each root none andcompare their overlap this measure will provide us with a old root affinityand a simple way of estimating total globe dns leakage if this trend was to beextrapolated over all roots figure depicts the number of unique slds observed at the a none j node and the combination of a and j nodes in this figure we can see that the com bined a j roots on a daily basis observe about unique slds while each ofthe a and j nodes separately observe roughly unique slds roughly of the combined a j root nodes prior work studying mufti root distinct sldoverlap has shown that the combined traffic observed at a j constitutesapproximately of all observed distinct slds for various tlds spanningthe globe dns roots the onion sld root affinities and overlap between the aand j roots are comparable to the finding in the prior literature concerning other fig onion traffic measurements observed at a and j root dns nodestlds therefore we postulate that the onion traffic observed at a j wouldcontinue such a trend and an appropriate sizing of total globe onion leakagecould be roughly estimated based on the statistics in section we estimate thetotal number of onion nxd records at million over the same period of time hidden service and second level domain measurementsfigure shows a few days in which the absolute number of distinct slds dra musically increases from the average number of daily slds observed in the restof the measurement period we now turn our attention to the overlay distributionof requests for a given sld within the onion tld to better understand the dnsrequest dynamics of all onion slds figure provides three di rent plots various traffic diversity measurements namely the number of total requests thecount of distinct net blocks and asns a distinct sld received during thecollection period the corresponding cumulative distributions of these measuresare reflected in figure clearly the vast majority of slds receive a animal amount of dns requestsover the six months period covered in our data set with of the slds re ceiving only one request and nearly of slds receiving less than requests a similar trend of animal traffic source diversity for the majority of slds displayed where nearly of the slds originate from fewer than distinctasns leaving very few slds with large amounts of traffic from a wide variety of fig globe dns estimation of onion by rootnetwork locations this pattern is in line with the general traffic characteristicsand trend for other non delegated tlds next we shift our focus to those few but very popular slds within the oniontld table provides a list

many dns based censorship events took place the requests originating from turkey during the censorship spanned hundreds unique slds and were spread over several ass root cause exploration and namespace managementapplications electing to use non delegated tlds as a namespace in which theyseed their routing and resolution processes face scenarios in which possible dnsleakage may occur tor has been specifically designed to prevent onion requestsfrom leaking within the application into the globe dns infrastructure however fig onion traffic measurements from turkeyit is clear from the measurements we presented so far that a significant volumeof requests are being issued to the globe dns root servers whether they areinitiated by users by mistake or caused by a misconfiguration in the underlyingapplication such as tor or the web browsers leaked dens queries outside of thetor network have a significant implication to individuals privacy and safety that end understanding the causes of the leakage may help reducing the risk atthe user side there are many plausible reasons or mechanisms in which onion queriescould be generated and observed in the globe public dns however the rootcause of how and why these queries are being requested within the globe dnsremains unclear we have seen in this paper numerous globe events that spurredadditional query volume one potential explanation associated with surge the volume of onion domains in those times is users errors in which users arenot aware that the addresses of hidden services should be run on top of tor i e by first installing tor plug in associated with the browser other notableexplanations may include browser prefetching third party application or plug ins dns suffer search lists web crawlers and malware

of onion dns requests issued to the a and root nodes of the globe dns infrastructure we examined the unique char acteristics of these requests longitudinally as well as the dynamics of

highlighting the potential human factor those leakages i e user error while the root cause of these leaned dns queriesremains unknown our preliminary investigation unveiled concerns to the sever ity of the leakage and to the possibility of more sensitive private informationbeing unintentionally exposed our future work will continue the examinationof leaked dens queries to the root but will also extend to other non delegatedtlds such as i p and exit we will plan to further dissect the impact of globalevents and the role of malware in the leakage and investigate the potential pri vacy
