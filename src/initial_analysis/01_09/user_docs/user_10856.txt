for a reward no sitting in a cafe or using public wifi is not a solution its an additional security precaution thanksdonation address is in my signature since i have not seen the best answer posted above i will give it the absolute best way to use those unsafe plugins like javascript java and flash is as follows you must use separate machines the first machine has no other way of connecting to the internet other than through the second machine preferable running a whonix gateway you can also run a virtual machine on machine for an added layer which any exploits or malware would need to break out of first before they can access or execute any type of code on your host operating system at this point even if they are able to phone home from your host operating system of machine they are not able to do so outside of the interest connection from machine running the gateway therefore any attempt at phoning home will still have to go through tor and as long as you did not do something stupid like use your real name on machine or leave any identifying information on it there should be no identifying information to be transmitted one of the possible easier solutions for this is called raspberry pi which runs as a separate computer gateway through routes all your internet traffic and now there is a company selling something called an onion pi which has been set up specifically to route all your traffic through tor and the pi is itself a mini computer that acts as a gateway you please . you should really be careful using javascript altogether from what i understand but if you do choose to use whonix i do believe the whonix developers recommend using a physical gateway and a am workstation rather than using two virtual machines i would imagine there should be another option other than using javascript at all javascript flash iframe as well as some other plugins really arent recommended if you are attempting to stay anonymous whether you are using virtualization technology or not certainly using a vm or whonix would be your best option as has been mentioned but javascript truly should be avoided altogether whenever possible as even vm technology itself has its flaws and vulnerabilities as well so perhaps there is another option to using javascript altogether why do you feel it is absolutely necessary to use javascript in your situation . quote from jacobs crackers on march ami need to anonymously access a website but i need to use it in its fully function state can someone please point me in the correct direction best i
