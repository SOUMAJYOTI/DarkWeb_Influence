general here is a reddit post from u sapiophile quotei actually love i p and give been using it for years and years since the jrandom days learned about it just after i learned about tor way back when i think its design is actually far far superior to tors for hidden services mostly because of two things much lower barrier of entry for relays meaning theres probably a lower percentage of le controlled relays as compared to tor of course theres no way to confirm this and cover traffic holy shit cover traffic that shit is so important it makes timing and correlation attacks way way way harder to pull off if youre running an active i p router with lots of good participating tunnels its gon na be damn hard for anyone to know which eepsites youre visiting or serving or if your visiting or serving any at all tor has absolutely nothing like this and i honestly think its a huge security improvement edit oh also not using designated entry guards for hidden services is a big security improvement as well a malicious entry guard on tor can really fuck your day up if youre using hidden services edit oh also also i p uses one direction tunnels instead of two direction circuits which is a way more secure design from an anonymity standpoint also i p offers a lot that tor does not and can not offer like anonymous bittorrent irc etc protip if youre using bittorrent over tor youre a fool and youre not protected and youre just severely damaging the network i p is also rolling out a new set of ciphers for their traffic encryption and signing at the moment and will soon be using mostly ed and ecdsa which are almost definitely a big step up from tors rsa theres also some problems with i p though its definitely not nearly as reviewed or united as tor is just because it isnt in the spotlight as much this is fairly significant but of course even widely popular projects like openssl dont get the review they need and we end up with stuff like heartbleed so its hard to place a distinct value on i p also gets less attention from some of the big names in the cryptography and security world compared to tor which is really unfortunate to be really secure and reliable people using it really have to leave it running for a while at least a couple days preferable but really is best and configure their network firewall for it of course it works without doing those things but it works way way better and way more securely if you do see note above about cover traffic this is a serious hurdle for a lot of end users because the relays are mostly home connections its slower and less reliable for despite service reachability than tor with more users sharing more of their bandwidth though it could theoretically start being even better than tor in these respects this is especially true into the future as home connections start to have some serious speeds and ipv starts getting rolled out for real i dont have the time or the qualifications to really review the code or the implementation but from what give read from the devs and the interactions ive seen between them and other people i feel like theyre pretty competent i would love nothing more than for someone with real credentials to have a real hard look at i ps code but theres almost certainly nothing thats really obviously wrong with it when exodus released their exploit against i p a little while back it relied on browser javascript and xss pretty much the shallowest and simplest possible ways that something like this can be attacked that issue was also incredibly simple to fix as it has been so that definitely a good sign in a sense the underlying protocol was not easily attacked by them and they are perhaps the most professional and competent security researchers to have tried their hand against

there are a lot of new stuff in this update that i really liketh tor browser team is proud to announce the first stable release in the series this release is available from the tor browser project page and also from our distribution directory the series provides significant ability security and privacy enhancements over the series because these changes are significant we will be delaying the automatic update of users to the series for one week on the usability front weve improved the application launch experience for both windows and linus users during install windows users are now given the choice to add tor browser to the start menu applications view which should make it easier to find and launch this choice is on by default but can be disabled and only affects the creation of shortcuts the actual tor browser is still self contained as a portable app folder on the linus side users now start tor browser through a new wrapper that enables launching from the file manager the desktop or the applications menu the same wrapper can also be used from the command line weve also simplified the tor menu the green onion and the associated configuration windows the menu now provides information about the current tor circuit in use for a page and also provides an option to request a new tor circuit for a site tor browser is also much better at handling tor circuits in general while a site remains in active use all associated requests will continue to be performed over the same tor circuit this means that sites should no longer suddenly change languages behaviors or log you out while you are using them on the security front the most exciting news is the new security slider the security slider provides user friendly vulnerability surface reduction as the security level is increased browser features that were shown to have a high historical vulnerability count in the is partners hardening study are progressive disabled this feature is available from the tor onion menus privacy and security settings choice our windows packages are now signed with a hardware signing token graciously donate by digicert this means that windows users should no longer be prompted about tor browser coming from an unknown source additional our automatic updates are now individually signed with an offline signing key in both cases these signatures can be reproducibly removed so that builders can continue to verify that the packages they produce match the official build binaries the series also features a rewrite of the obfs obfs and scramblesuit transports in golang as well as the introduction of the new obfs transport the obis transport provides additional dpi and probing resistance features which prevent automatic scanning for tor bridges as long as they are not discovered via other mechanisms fresh obfs bridge addresses will work in china today additional barring new attacks private obis addresses should continue to work indefinitely on the privacy front the series improves on our first party isolation implementation to prevent third party tracking specifically blow uris are now scope to the uri bar domain that created them and the sharedworker api has been disabled to prevent cross site and third party communication we also now make full use of tors circuit isolation to ensure that all requests for any third party content included by a site travel down the same tor circuit this isolation also ensures that requests to the same third party site actually use separate tor circuits when the uri bar domain is different this request isolation is enforced even when long lived http keep alive connections are used we have also improved our resolution and local fingerprinting defenses and we now disable the device sensor and video statistics

road clearnet warning . nice read about the silk road clearnet warning . plate now there are a lot of new stuff in this update that i really liketh tor browser team is proud to announce the first stable release in the series this release is available from the tor browser project page and also from our distribution directory the series provides significant ability security and privacy enhancements over the series because these changes are significant we will be delaying the automatic update of users to the series for one week on the usability front weve improved the application launch experience for both windows and linus users during install windows users are now given the choice to add tor browser to the start menu applications view which should make it easier to find and launch this choice is on by default but can be disabled and only affects the creation of shortcuts the actual tor browser is still self contained as a portable app folder on the linus side users now start tor browser through a new wrapper that enables launching from the file manager the desktop or the applications menu the same wrapper can also be used from the command line weve also simplified the tor menu the green onion and the associated configuration windows the menu now provides information about the current tor circuit in use for a page and also provides an option to request a new tor circuit for a site tor browser is also much better at handling tor circuits in general while a site remains in active use all associated requests will continue to be performed over the same tor circuit this means that sites should no longer suddenly change languages behaviors or log you out while you are using them on the security front the most exciting news is the new security slider the security slider provides user friendly vulnerability surface reduction as the security level is increased browser features that were shown to have a high historical vulnerability count in the is partners hardening study are progressive disabled this feature is available from the tor onion menus privacy and security settings choice our windows packages are now signed with a hardware signing token graciously donate by digicert this means that windows users should no longer be prompted about tor browser coming from an unknown source additional our automatic updates are now individually signed with an offline signing key in both cases these signatures can be reproducibly removed so that builders can continue to verify that the packages they produce match the official build binaries the series also features a rewrite of the obfs obfs and scramblesuit transports in golang as well as the introduction of the new obfs transport the obis transport provides additional dpi and probing resistance features which prevent automatic scanning for tor bridges as long as they are not discovered via other mechanisms fresh obfs bridge addresses will work in china today additional barring new attacks private obis addresses should continue to work indefinitely on the privacy front the series improves on our first party isolation implementation to prevent third party tracking specifically blow uris are now scope to the uri bar domain that created them and the sharedworker api has been disabled to prevent cross site and third party communication we also now make full use of tors circuit isolation to ensure that all requests for any third party content included by a site travel down the same tor circuit this isolation also ensures that requests to the same third party site actually use separate tor circuits when the uri bar domain is different this request isolation is enforced even when long lived http keep alive connections are used we have also improved our resolution and local fingerprinting defenses and we now disable the device sensor and video statistics apis our default search provider has also been changed to disconnect here is the complete list of changes in the
