the coins from alice to bob in order to do this alice has to prove that she owns the coins so she provides the transaction which shows she mined the coins then when sending the coins to bob it is accepted by the bitcoin network of nodes next bob wants to send the coins to carol bob proves he owns the coins by providing the transaction that alice sent coins to bob as proof of ownership then he can send the coins to carol and again it should be accepted by the bitcoin network then carol can send the coins to david by providing proof and so forth so can fake bitcoins be created yes and it has been done before quotetwo hackers have been arrested accused of creating a fake cache of the bitcoin internet currency in germany police said they used the processing power of linked hacked computers to generate the bitcoins a cryptography based digital currency other words they used a botnet to create them so how did they do it they falsely created blocks and broadcasted them to the bitcoin network so the way that this works is that every block in the blockchain contains a string of transactions accepted by the network your job as a hacker is to create your own block including some real transactions and some false ones that pay you and have it accepted by the other miners before another miners block is accepted then whoever wins the race of having their block accepted will have their block become part of the blockchain whenever there is a dispute between blocks the blockchain splits and the longest chain meaning the one with the most blocks wins and is accepted again this has been done before but it is getting more and more difficult to do this especially with the patches being released by the bitcoin developers but if you had enough computation power it could be done just hope you do it over tor which will significantly reduce your chances of getting your block into the longest chain but will also protect you from getting caught very very very difficult to do . quote from

possible in a attack what happens is that a guy with power starts mining a separate blockchain in secret then he spends bitcoins somewhere and that place waits a few confirmations and then gives him his product or service then once he has his product or service he publishes his secretly mine longer chain which becomes the valid longest chain and which does not contain the transaction where he spent his bitcoins originally so even though there were a few confirmations all of that gets undone when his new blockchain that he was secretly mining is published and its only possible to do that if he has a majority of the network hashing power because otherwise the normal legitimate miners would have the longest chain and he couldnt publish his chain because it wouldnt be the longest but in both chains the attackers on and the legitimate orphaned one in both chains all the transactions are valid and the blocks are valid no bitcoins are created out of thin air or faked or otherwise counterfeited such transactions are not possible because no bitcoin software will accept them a longest chain wouldnt be valid if it had an invalid tx in it and the second longest chain would be the real chain because its the longest chain that is valid the other major attack of majority hashing power is blocking transactions you can just refuse certain txs and thus they will confirm slower which will bottleneck the network eventually and cause people to stop using bitcoin its sort of a reverse spam attack but again none of that is faking bitcoins bitcoins can not be faked or counterfeited because any transaction that does so is considered invalid by the bitcoin software and not considered a real transaction bitcoins can be spent twice if you go around accepting unconformed transactions because unconformed transactions are just that not confirmed anybody can create any transaciton they want to say whatever they want even faking bitcoins but its not a real transaction until its been verified and sits in the blockchain even then its possible to undo it just like with the example above and block chains are often orphans because two miners find blocks at about the same time and so half the network is working on one chain and half is working on the other but then as soon as one side finds a new block on top of that the network re adjusts and all goes back to the same longest chain of course that can happen on the new block as well but as you gain more and more blocks its exponentially more and moreunlikely and so eventually the network will always all rather together on the same chain so if you have something really valuable youre selling for bitcoins maybe wait or or confirmations or even more in the fork that happened in march of i think it was confirmations that got undone when the network finally regrouped onto the correct chain no bitcoins are ever for sure its just there more and more for sure as you get more and more confirmations because it would take more and more washing power to undo those confirmations with confirmation a malicious entity might be able to get a longer chain without a lot of difficulty but with say confirmations theyd have to go back and find new blocks before the rest of the network finds that means they need of the network hashing power so as confirmations increase its just a lower and lower probability that your tx will get undone who knows maybe the us gov has been secretly mining blocks with no txs in them for the last k blocks and will soon publish that longest chain to undo years of txs and completely luck over everybody but even for that type of thing theres yet another fix to mitigate that which is that your bitcoin client throws up an alert and says something like dont use bitcoin until you check the forums and figure out wtf just happened because bitcoin might be under attack something weird just happened if more than blocks are suddenly orphans and a new different longest chain of blocks is published all in a row and if that happened likely an update would come out that just makes the first block of the us gov chain invalid and thus all following us god blocks are invalid and so the real chain becomes once again the longest valid chain and bitcoin would keep right on trucking after a few days of mass panic and price drops but ya bitcoins cant be faked because they arent real they are just transactions and only valid transactions get in the blockchain transactions can be un done if the block gets orphans but thats why you wait for a few confirmations and its still safe to accept zero conf txs that you check as at least being valid for small things because the effort to double spend twenty bucks with any remote degree of success costs way more than bucks . quote from jolly roger on march amok here is how it works let us take alice bob carol and david alice mines the coins herself this is her proof of the coins existence alice sends the coins from alice to bob in order to do this alice has to prove that she owns the coins so she provides the transaction which shows she mined the coins then when sending the coins to bob it is accepted by the bitcoin network of nodes next bob wants to send the coins to carol bob proves he owns the coins by providing the transaction that alice sent coins to bob as proof of ownership then he can send the coins to carol and again it should be accepted by the bitcoin network then carol can send the coins to david by providing proof and so forth so can fake bitcoins be created yes and it has been done before quotetwo hackers have been arrested accused of creating a fake cache of the bitcoin internet currency in germany police said they used the processing power of linked hacked computers to generate the bitcoins a cryptography based digital currency other words they used a botnet to create them so how did they do it they falsely created blocks and broadcasted them to the bitcoin network so the way that this works is that every block in the blockchain contains a string of transactions accepted by the network your job as a hacker is to create your own block including some real transactions and some false ones that pay you and have it accepted by the other miners before another miners block is accepted then whoever wins the race of having their block accepted will have their block become part of the blockchain whenever there is a dispute between blocks the blockchain splits and the longest chain meaning the one with the most blocks wins and is accepted again this has been done before but it is getting more and more difficult to do this especially with the patches being released by the bitcoin developers but if you had enough computation power it could be done just hope you do it over tor which will significantly reduce your chances of getting your block into the longest chain but will also protect you from getting caught very very very difficult to do no nobody has faked bitcoins in fact the article you cite simply says the word faked and then just goes onto say they had a botnet mining bitcoins nothing fake about them no you can not fake bitcoins its not possible in a attack what happens
