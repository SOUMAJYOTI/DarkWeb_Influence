i just went on vacation mode here is the message at the top of my order pagewe are aware of the payment issues working on the solution when and if i get my coin which i just withdrew last night and the forum is back up i will probably open for business again the forum being down is very suspicious all by itself now i wish i had not sent out the orders this morning i forgot to check to see if my payment had arrived give been taking coin out almost every day so ill lose a few hundred bucks and thats it at least there is eve for now . i dont think its an exit scam i think they either got robbed of them or something else is going down . give been looking into this all day and something big is happening with agora and i recommend everyone stay away from agora and try to get your coins out of there asa something big is about to be announced i feel its suspected that the admins are now officially mia and theres also some suspection that either a huge theft just occurred and a ton of coins just got stolen from there or they are pulling an exit and running with the money i could very well be wrong here but theres is enough evidence that something fishy is going on and people need to stay away for now . the more i think about it it seems like a technical issue they have been down before the forums have been down and it always came back up we always thought maybe this time it goes down for good but then it was back they put a notice right at the top saying there are payment issues if they were trying to scam they wouldnt say a thing like that it would be come on in and spend your coin however i will stay on vacation mode until things have cleared up that seems like the prudent thing to do and i could use a break anyway i dont see how reports of coin moving around on the btc network means anything even if it was agra coin which we dont know that means nothing i doubt they kept much coin on the market itself probably just enough for liquidity and kept their stash well hidden maybe in paper wallets or something probably they got attacked and had a problem maybe it was from all the sr refugees and those from other markets going there and clogging up the system if they found the bitcoin system wasnt working right shutting down until it was fixed would be top priority the forums are lower priority though its odd they went down at the same time im thinking they come back good as new chance its over . oh boy so that whats up fun the biggest issue with these markets trust reliability it would seem very plausible that in the wake of s seizure ag decides to pull an exit scam like the good vendors who have been true to their mission to spread love lets pray that the ag team are just dealing with a technical issue but large btc moving that done sound good s . something is definitely wrong but it is all speculation for now unfortunately there have been problems for about hours now i believe funny that i just came back to these forums just before the problems occurred worried about problems occurring there proceed with caution hc . well theres some heavy suspicion something happened with the btc a very large amount of btc is being moved around right now and its suspected to be some of agoras coins . i havent been able to connect all day anyone know whats up . i haven t been able to connect all day anyone know whats up . something is

there was a thread where someone was urging others to approach bitcoin fog with caution apparently there were some issues with bitcoin fog in response to that issue the fog admins issued an signed statement on the site addressing the issue which apparently it s unusual for them to not include their pip signature stranger still one had to follow a pastebin link to access that message which apparently requires javascript that s the gist of it i was following the agra thread closely up until the point that the forums went down and deposit issues ensued it s well known that there s a connection between bitcoin fog and agora because bitcoin fog gave their endorsement for agra upon it s debut i ve read that agora s recent statements have also not included their usual pgp signature
