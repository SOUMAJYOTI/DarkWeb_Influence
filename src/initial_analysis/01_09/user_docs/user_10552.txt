where our photographs are snapped by surveillance or smartphone cameras equipped with racial recognition and leaked onto public social networks for all to see but a new privacy visor created by ii researchers could help wearers protect their anonymity by blocking out any sky racial recognition systems the glasses will hit shelves in japan in and are expected to cost around the tech behind the visor is pretty simple it s nothing like the previous version made by the same researchers which consisted of near inferred flashing leds that blinded surveillance tech according to a press release from the nii this time around the researchers are attaching a novel material they don t mention what exactly it is to the visors the material confuses racial recognition systems by absorbing and reflecting light in a nutshell it prevents racial recognition systems from focusing on your racial features previous attempts at racial recognition scrambling tech have included completely covering your face or using a way make up strategy to distort it these elaborate methods assert the researchers are disruptive for regular people who just want to go about their daily lives the degraded
