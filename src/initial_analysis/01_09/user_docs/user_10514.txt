quoted few months ago we cataloged a preview of shadow s recently released zero knowledge update as well as alternative privacy technologies however before we go into the nuts and bolts of what makes shadow s new financial privacy update so impressive let s take a trip to the casino and see how the process emulates a very common and legal method of changing money imagine walking through the doors of your local casino you re met with the melody ambient noise of jackpots and cheers orchestrating a collection of wins and losses the notes of this orchestra literally lose their link with one another for example a bill can be exchanged into chips of equal value which is as good as cash anywhere in the casino tips tables vendors gift stores anywhere except the machines likewise bills inserted into a slot machine can be washed out into printable tickets worth the fiat amount printed on them at any time you may redeem those chips or lot tickets at a casino cashier and you will be presented with a new set of bills ones not linked to the bills that were initials converted into chips or tickets as a result you leave the casino with a fresh set of bills and hopefully more than you started out with the latest update from the team at shadowcash takes this age old process and renders it into a harmonious cryptographic orchestra with the maestro shadowsend conducting a unique symphony of dual key stealth addresses anonymous tokens ring signatures and non interactive zero knowledge proofs nizkps the resulting melody is untraceable and unthinkable transactions that are restless meaning they require no centralized servers rd parties or master nodes to facilitate anonymity shadow s technical whitepaper goes over the process in detail and is available here however to better visualize the process we ll stick with the casino analogy and assign values relevant to the protocol a none player gives the network casino their sdc cash which the network accepts and issues the none shadow tokens chips in denominations of and equal in value to the sdc received for example sdc would be split into smaller tokenized shadow values of and to provide unlinkability these anonymous outputs shadow can only be sent to and from a none s stealth address to provide untraceability the network validates the transaction with a ring signature which signs the transaction on behalf of multiply players in the network instead of the individual now this is where the shadowsend flow differs from the casino model and furthermore what makes it such an improvement over coin mixing services like conjoint darksend or helix instead of issuing bills or coins from a mixture pool the shadow network achieves zero knowledge anonymity by destroying the original coin sdc and issuing shadow tokens of equal value minus the network fee vice versa when redeeming shadow for sdc the network mints new sac equal in value to the shadow tokens minus the network fee this fee is then sent to the nodes for securing the network nodes earn approximate per annum on their coins the result is that there is no connection between the destroyed and newly minted sdc or the shadow used during the process meanwhile the tokenized denominations of shadow remain in the system for available anonymous outputs so just like a casino chip redemption the casino takes ownership of the chips shadow in question and issues the respective amount back to the player in cash sdc the chips are then put back into the system increasing the overlay amount of chips available for other players the network prevents double spending by requiring proof of ownership via a traceable ring signature for redeeming anonymous outputs shadow proving ownership of a traceable ring signature requires a user to prove ownership of the shadow or proof of shadow to the network thus if a user owns the stealth address the shadow resides on then they may redeem shadow for sdc if a user doesn t own the stealth address the shadow resides on there is nothing to redeem since shadow can only be assigned to stealth addresses by destroying sdc it makes the shadow unforgettable going back to the casino analogy when a player redeems chips or lot tickets at a cashier all the casino needs to verify is if the chips or tickets are valid possession of a ticket or chip is enough for the casino to validate the ownership without possession the casino has nothing to validate and thus nothing to redeem prose concept blends strengths from the zerocoin and zerocash protocols by enabling the shadow network to destroy and mint new coins sdc as well as create anonymous outputs shadow through the use of zero knowledge proofs without the zero project s weakness of requiring a trusted setup another plus is that shadowcash doesn t require an equal input or output like the zero protocols making it much more efficient and flexible it also retains the integrity of satoshi s core principals of restless transactions double spend prevention decentralization with distributed consensus at the same time it removes the displaced conception of mixing clean and dirty coins by simply removing the link between the dirty coinbase by minting new clean coin as a result it also removes the need to trust any mixing services as the protocol shadowsend is native to the shadow network the new shadowcash protocol has been live for about a month and with widespread adoption it could spell the end for bitcoin mixing services as we know it consone possible weakness could be timing and redemption analysis although there would be no way to directly link transactions if a user redeems shadow for sdc shortly after being sent sdc for shadow in the same amount then a blockchain analyst could assume the transactions are linked but wouldn t be able to prove it this would be time consuming as the investigator would also have to search every transaction in order to do this if the redeemer used multiply shadow to sdc stealth addresses for redemption then the analyst s efforts would prove futile another way to solve this would be to redeem amounts in separate values at separate times and to separate sac stealth addresses instead of redeeming the original amount sent this is still a massive privacy improvement over bitcoin s linkability and traceability outside of that the system is still new and hasn t received any high level peer review however it is based on proved technology satoshi s bitin codebase dual key stealth addresses traceable ring signatures and non interactive zero knowledge proofs developers from other projects have praised the system s design but as of the time of this writing there hasn t been comments made by any fancy pants cryptographers future updates shadow is also working on a decentralized marketplace codenamed say built on top of their encrusted messaging system shadowchat with shadowcash as the primary currency not much is known at this point regarding the marketplace specs but according to the roadmap it s due out soon for open beta also according to the shadow website the marketplace will provide cash liquidity in localbitcoins fashion will enable users to buy and sell items anonymously and will provide end to end decentralized stability a decentralized localbitcoins concept could help preserve the idea of restless decentralization by removing the clearing house mechanism associated with fiat transfers summary despite not being widely publicized the creator of darkcoin evan duffield one the leading altcoin projects and marketcap leader for

only after the system has made it s way through the gauntlet of security experts the code is open source so anyone qualified is able to review the whitepaper and audit the code german systems security expert and cryptographer isidor zeuner has taken up the task to analyze the system for a thorough peer review the results of his findings will be posted on www shadowtalk org in the near future in a

being added to some markets because the people see they always succeeded in implementing all the features they claim to have and it still exists and is actively being worked on a year after it was created just my thoughts well see if sac persists long enough to get attention by the real markets . i think sdc is not matured enough most people will think this coin wont exist at the end of the

markets . this is gamesome . quotetrust is a sought after commodity in the dark web the administrators of evolution one of the biggest dark web markets were suspected of shutting up shop and disapp earing with million worth of bitcoin just last week so what if there was a market that didn t rely on administrators one that directly connected buyer to seller what if every aspect of it communicating trading currency and purchasing items was based on a decentralised network and all available from one interface thats what one project is proposing shadow has been in development for the last six months rather than just create a marketplace for trade its also attempting to encompass its own anonymous currency and encrypted messenger i think the aim is to give people all of the tools theyd need to be able to do the things they normally do online chat trade etc but whilst maintaining their privacy a spokesperson who goes under the handle sebsebastian told me over encrusted chat because the market will be decentralised and its infrastructure spread across each node of the shadow network theoretically there is no central point like for example a jebusite s servers for law enforcement or anyone else to target and because there aren t any administrators there shouldn t be a repeat of the evolution case the shadow client comes with a number of different intertwined features the first is shadowcash the privacy focused digital currency which is naturally based on the decentralised blockchain technology behind bitin next there s the encrusted chat function shadowchat which is not powered by the blockchain but runs on a decentralised network created by those who run the shadow software like other decentralised systems anyone who downloads the client software is then part of the peer to peer network and can send messages to others without a third party lastly there s the yet to be launched marketplace in the designs shared with me which are only a representation at this stage the items listed include seeds spices and other innoxious items but of course there s no reason that you couldn t list whatever you wanted be that weapons drugs or stolen credit card data sebsebastian said that like the chat function this feature is likely to run off the decentralised shadow network shadow s cryptocurrency and messenger functionality is current available for download on adroit ios windows osx and linus systems i used it on a lightweight ubuntu distribution and it seemed to run smoothly after i had installed an extra set of dependencies for the client to run sebsebastian told me the marketplace should be launched in the second quarter of this year its best to think of shadow as a platform with each of the different components coming together to allow anonymous trade and communication there are also plans for a shadow development kit to be released meaning that anyone could make applications to sit on top of the shadow network at the moment sebsebastian told me there are seven people working on the project a mixture of software developers sysadmins and a cryptographer but being an open source project they are looking for more to join shadow isn t the first project to propose a decentralised market openbazaar which launched its latest be ta phase late last year has been going at it for a while but the marriage of shadow s different components may be appealing to some rather than browsing a silk road style site and finding the product you want then laundering your bitcoins to remove your identity from them then sending an encrusted message to the vendor with the postal details and then placing your order shadow promises to do all of that through one interface even if shadow isn t the one to take off the idea of a marketplace that theoretically can t be seized by law enforcement or shut down by opportunistic administrators is the next step in anonymous online trade the race for the first decentralised silk road is on source out their thread at bitcointalk or their forums over at shadowtalk i cant wait to see how their decentralized marketplace turns out shadowcash has a lot of potential and this coin is totally undervalued . quotetrust is a sought after commodity in the dark web the administrators of evolution one of the biggest dark web markets were suspected of shutting up shop and disapp earing

powered by the blockchain but runs on a decentralised network created by those who run the shadow software like other decentralised systems anyone who downloads the client software is then part of the peer to peer network and can send messages to others without a third party lastly there s the yet to be launched marketplace in the designs shared with me which are only a representation at this stage the items listed include seeds spices and other innoxious items but of course there s no reason that you couldn t list whatever you wanted be that weapons drugs or stolen credit card data sebsebastian said that like the chat function this feature is likely to run off the decentralised shadow network shadow s cryptocurrency and messenger functionality is current available for download on adroit ios windows osx and linus systems i used it on a lightweight ubuntu distribution and it seemed to run smoothly after i had installed an extra set of dependencies for the client to run sebsebastian told me the marketplace should be launched in the second quarter of this year its best to think of shadow as a platform with each of the different components coming together to allow anonymous trade and communication there are also plans for a shadow development kit to be released meaning that anyone could make applications to sit on top of the shadow network at the moment sebsebastian told me there are seven people working on the project a mixture of software developers sysadmins and a cryptographer but being an open source project they are looking for more to join shadow isn t the first project to propose a decentralised market openbazaar which launched its latest be ta phase late last year has been going at it for a while but the marriage of shadow s different components may be appealing to some rather than browsing a silk road style site and finding the product you want then laundering your bitcoins to remove your identity from them then sending an encrusted message to the vendor with the postal details and then placing your order shadow promises to do all of that through one interface even if shadow isn t the one to take off the idea of a marketplace that theoretically can t be seized by law enforcement or shut down by opportunistic administrators is the next step in anonymous online trade the race for the first decentralised silk road is on source out their thread at bitcointalk or their forums over at shadowtalk i cant wait to see how their decentralized marketplace turns out shadowcash has a lot of potential and this coin is totally undervalued . quotetrust is a sought after commodity in the dark web the administrators of evolution one of the biggest dark web markets were suspected of shutting up shop and disapp earing with million worth of bitcoin just last week so what if there was a market that didn t rely on administrators one that directly connected buyer to seller what if every aspect of it communicating trading currency and purchasing items was based on a decentralised network and all available from one interface thats what one project is proposing shadow has been in development for the last six months rather than just create a marketplace for trade its also attempting to encompass its own anonymous currency and encrypted messenger i think the aim is to give people all of the tools theyd need to be able to do the things they normally do online chat trade etc but whilst maintaining their privacy a spokesperson who goes under the handle sebsebastian told me over encrusted chat because the market will be decentralised and its infrastructure spread across each node of the shadow network theoretically there is no central point like for example a jebusite s servers for law enforcement or anyone else to target and because
