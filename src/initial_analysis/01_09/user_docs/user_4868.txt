i though to copy this here from dhl forums remember shut the fuck up is open rule key points for darknet survival by aesopnoble on november quotejust thought i would post some basin key points for anyone new or old who wants to improve their security a lot of noobies out there who are just earning their stripes just want to make those of you who are new aware of what goes on around the darknet and how to stay safe i would hate to see a promising individual get caught for something that could have been prevented social engineering this is the holy grail of doxxing be aware of what you say in public or private a using chat software xmpp is a form of isolation isolation is used in one of two ways relaxation or intimidation you should always be cautious of who you talk to even if you think they are cool or you knew them for a long time not only le but if your cool friend gets wrapped up he will be the first to snitch you out the most notorious hackers of the world arent always just sitting behind of a computer kevin mitnick once the most wanted hacker in the world although advanced technically was a far better social engineer who ended up in a plethora of allegations ranging from hacking into the department of defense national security and several banks so it isnt always about how many computer skills you have or how many programming languages you can write in sure that is one aspect but rascally no one here is your friend we can be social and cordial to one another but always keep in mind that you dont know the person on the other side or their aged online dumpster diving rummaging through posts and trying to gather and piece together information to build enough identity about you be careful about what you post in the forums think before you write too much never post absolutes about yourself and always stay adaptive a you can be anything you want to be in anonymous world just done be you if you stick to facts and the less opinionated you are the less character you have it is often easy to use a forum such as these to come and hang out honestly this is not the place to hang out hang out with your family get a girlfriend boyfriend or facebook for that it doesnt mean you cant snap a joke and you have to be rigid it just means take a second to think before you post something it might end up being too revealing money they follow money trails wash your coins double and triple wash buy other e currencies and trade back buy physical goods with btc you are capable of selling for fiat money is nice especially when you finally get to spend it that car that house that diamond studded role well all those major purchases get reported to some tax collection agency in the us it is the irs they have the authority to monitor your spending whether legitimate or illegal purely for the purpose of finding out if you have been paying your taxes third parties be aware of third party websites like reddit blond wig washing services and the possibility of a fake market a not only can fake washers and markets be used to steal your money they can also be used to track your money dont use the same log ins for every site le can cross analyzed data and habits much the same way google analytics works here you have a way to start linking your identity if you arent cautious for example you post identical comments on the darknet as you do on the clear net you use the same name to buy and vend and wash your coins it is always a figuratively pain in the ass to go the extra steps to be secure but done let it become a literal pain in the ass when you get to prison keep your personal life and darkness life completely independent they watch you from the outside in and the inside outthere should be no need to tell your friends around town what you do that is not being anonymous that is being pseudonymous patience is the weapon that forces deception to reveal itself unknown it works both ways the feds will can watch you for years if they want when they get tired of you thats it if youre in for a long run follow the rules of engagement never become relaxed and keep your opsec up to date at all times be patient there is no need to rush anything anyone trying to rush you is a pressure salesman of some sort malware phishing links and sites le are no better than you or me we breathe the same air and bleed the same blood they are capable of writing code as well always check the links in messages they could be a wishing attempt always bookmark the correct links and use those and then search for a thread or verify the main url first its a bit lazy and insane to just go around clicking every link you get on the darknet keep your software up to date when tor has an plate update it when tails or whonix has an plate update it there are some exceptions to this rule when it comes to new features by windows lenovo and other commercial hardware and software manufacturers they are now joining together to fight cyber crime by installing back doors and rootkits to your privately owned software quite a few years back sony had several class action law suits against them including u s states for installing rootkits via columbia records digital content cds now it is becoming the norm to invade your privacy windows users disable install telemetry updates found in windows and clearnet link if you dont trust the software you can do this mutually from the install updates menu and search for each kb file independently there are or so i believe pgp for yourself auto pgp is a nice feature but it is not as secure as we like to pretend it to be no dnm is open source the darknet is a trust less environment not saying anything is truly bad going on but there is possibility that auto pgp messages are retained the way php the language works is by grabbing form data and then manipulating it this leaves it wide open for the admin to do whatever they want to with your message not saying they are or spreading fed pgp on your pc and then paste it to the form do this for all markets and forums . thank you for posting kgreat info for all users . there is already alot of blame being put on encryption rather than the real reason
