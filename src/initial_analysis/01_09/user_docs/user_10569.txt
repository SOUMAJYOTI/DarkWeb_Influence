in secret while were all being watchedmicah lee t when you pick up the phone and call someone or send a text message or write an email or send a facebook message or chat using google hangouts other people find out what you re saying who you re talking to and where you re locked such private data might only be available to the service provider brokering your conversation but it might also be visible to the telecom companies carrying your internet packets to spy and law enforcement agencies and even to some nearly teenagers monitoring your wi fi network with wireshark but if you take careful steps to protect yourself it s possible to communicate online in a way that s private secret and anonymous today i m going to explain in precise terms how to do that i ll take techniques asa whistleblower edward snowden used when contacting me two and a half years ago and boil them down to the essentials in a nutshell i ll show you how to create anonymous real time chat accounts and how to chat over those accounts using an encryption protocol called off the record messaging or otr if you re in a hurry you can skip directly to where i explain step by step how to set this up for mac os x windows linux and android then when you have time come back and read the important caveats preceding those instructions one caveat is to make sure the encryption you re using is the sort known as end to end encryption with end to end encryption a message gets encrusted at one endpoint like a smartphone and decrypted at the other endpoint let s say a atop no one at any other point including the company providing the communication service you re using can decrypt the message contrast this with encryption that only covers your link to the service provider like an web connection will protect your message from potential snoops on your wi fi network like the teenager with wireshark or working for your telem company but not from the company on the other end of that connection like facebook or google nor from law enforcement or spy agencies requesting information from such companies a second bigger caveat is that it s important to protect not only the content of your communications but also the metadata behind those communications metadata like who is talking to whom can be incredibly revealing when a source wants to communicate with a journalist using encrusted email isn t enough to protect the fact that they re talking to a journalist likewise if you re a star crossed lover hoping to connect with your romantic partner and keep your feuding families from finding out about the hook up you need to protect not just the content of your love notes and steady chats but the very fact that you re talking in the first place let s take a quick look at how to do that secret identitiesmeet juliet who is trying to get in touch with romeo romeo and juliet know that if they talk on the phone exchange emails or skye chats or otherwise communicate using traditional means there s no way to hide from their powerful families the fact that they re communicating the trick is not to hide that they re communicating at all but rather that they re romeo and juliet juliet and romeo decide to make new chat accounts juliet chooses the surname ceres and romeo chooses the surname eris now when ceres and eris have an encrusted conversation it will be harder for attackers to realize that this is actually juliet and romeo when juliet s accounts are later united for evidence of communicating with romeo her short tempered cousin is a bit overbearing to say the least nothing incriminating will show up of course just making up new usernames alone isn t enough it s still possible and sometimes even trivial to figure out that ceres is actually juliet and eris is actually romeo juliet is logging into her ceres account from the same ip address that she s using for everything else on her computer e g emails with her favorite friar if her internet activity is being logged it almost certainly is all of our internet activity is being logged it would be easy to connect the dots if the chat service is forced to hand over the ip address that the ceres account connects from they ll turn over juliet s ip address romeo has the same problem third party services like telecom companies and email providers have access to private information about their users and according to the third party doctrine these users have no reasonable expectation of privacy for this information and it s not just implicit lovers who are exposed by this doctrine even journalists who can sometimes assert special privilege under the first amendment have to be wary of who handles their communications in the justice department obtained the phone records of associated press journalists during a leak investigation and many news organizations don t host their own email making their email vulnerable to u s government requests for data the new york times and wall street journal outsource their email to google and usa today outsources its email to microsoft this is why we run our own email server at the intercept anonymityin order to keep the fact that she s communicating private juliet must keep a bulletproof separation between her ceres identity and her real identity at the moment the easiest and safest way to do this is by using tor the open source and decentralized anonymity network tor is designed to let you use the internet anonymously it s a decentralized network of volunteer nodes computers that help forward and execute internet requests on behalf of other computers tor keeps you anonymous by bouncing your connection through a series of these nodes before finally exiting to the normal internet if a single node is malicious it won t be able to learn both who you are and what you re doing it might know your in address but not where on the internet you re headed or it might see where you re headed but have no idea what your ip address is most people who have heard of tor know about tor browser which you can use to browse the web anonymously but it s also possible to use other software to visit internet services other than the web anonymously including chat and email if romeo and juliet use tor to access their eris and ceres chat accounts and if their conversation is end to end encrusted using or then they can finally have a secret conversation online even in the face of persuasive monitoring juliet and romeo having a secret encrusted conversation from anonymous chat accounts martha pettit attackers from all sidesnow that romeo and juliet have registered new anonymous chat accounts using tor let s probe all of the moving parts for weaknesses juliet s side an attacker that is monitoring juliet s internet traffic will be able to tell that part of it is to traffic but they won t have any information about what she s using tor for if they check out who she s emailing skyping with calling and texting they won t have any evidence that she s talking to romeo of course using the tor network in and of itself can be suspicious which is why the intercept recommends that sources who wish to remain anonymous contact us from a personal computer using a network connection that isn t associated with their employer in other words juliet might seek out a starbucks or public library to be extra safe romeo s side an attacker monitoring romeo s internet traffic will be able to tell that part of it is to traffic if the attacker looks into who romeo is emailing calling texting and skyping with juliet won t be on that list chat server s side the chat service itself will be able to tell that someone coming from a tor ip address created the user ceres and someone coming from a tor ip address created the user eris and that these two users are sending scrambled messages back and forth it won t have any way of knowing that ceres is actually juliet or that eris is actually romeo because their ip addresses are masked by tor and it won t have any way of knowing what ceres and eris are saying to each other because their messages are all encrusted with or these accounts could just as easily belong to a whistleblower and a journalist or to a human rights activist and her lawyer as they could to two mutual crushes trading poetry even with taking these measures there is quite a bit of metadata you might leak if you aren t careful here are some things to keep in mind make sure to use tor when you create your chat account not just when you use it make sure you never login to that account when you re not using tor make sure you don t choose a username that might betray your real identity don t use a pseudonym that you ve used in the past for example instead make up a random username that doesn t have anything to do with you people often think of anonymous accounts that they create as alter egos they come up with a cool pseudonym and grow attached to that identity but it s better to think of secret identities as disposal and temporary their purpose is to mask your real identity not to highlight a piece of it a random string like be c erd makes a better username than gameofthronesfan don t re use a password you use elsewhere reusing passwords is not only bad security but could also de anonymize you if an account associated with your real identity shares the same password associated with your a secret identity be aware of which contacts you communicate with from which secret identity accounts if one of your contacts is exposed it can increase the chances that other contacts you communicate with from the same account will also be exposed there s nothing wrong with making a new chat account for each project or for each contact to reduce the risk of your whole anonymous network unravelling don t give any other identifying information to the chat service be aware of your habits if you login to your chat account in the morning when you start using your computer and log off in the evening when you re done with work you ll be leaking to the chat server what timezone you re in and what your work hours are this might not matter to you but if it does it s best to make appointments with your contacts for specific times to meet online be aware of what else you do using your tor ip address if you use tor to login to both your secret chat account and a chat account that s publicly associated with you the serve logs could be used to link your anonymous account to your real identity you can force tor to choose separate circuits for each account by choosing a unique socks proxy username and password but more on that below tor isn t perfecttor represents state of the art online anonymity but providing true anonymity is a nearly impossible problem to solve there s an going arms race with tor developers and academy researchers on one side and powerful attackers that would like to be able to secretly de anonymize or censor tor users on the other tor has never been secure against a globe adversary an adversary that can spy on all tor nodes around the world in real time because such an adversary would be able to see traffic from tor users enter the network watch it bounce around the world and then watch it leave the network making it clear which traffic belongs to which user but despite all this snowdon documents published by the guardian show that the combined spying power of the five eyes the u s u k canada australia and new zealand doesn t yet count as a globe adversary at least not as of june when that top secret presentation was given it appears that the western intelligence agencies are only able to opportunistically de anonymize random unlucky users and have never been able to de anonymize a specific user on demand as promising as this seems tor might not always protect your identity especially if you re already under close surveillance the story of jeremy hammond s arrest illustrates this point well the fbi suspected that hammond might be part of the lulzsec hacker group which went on a digital crime spree in specifically they suspected he might go by the pseudonym sup g in an online chat room they set up physical surveillance of hammond s apartment in chicago watching what servers he connected to from his wi fi network an fbi affidavit states that a significant portion of the traffic from the chicago residence to the internet was tor related traffic the fbi used a low tech traffic correlation attack to confirm that hammond was indeed sup g when hammond left his apartment tor traffic stopped flowing from his house and sup g logged out of chat when he came back home tor traffic started flowing again and sup g appeared back online because he was already a prime suspect tor didn t protect his identity tor isn t magic it s a tool the human using it still needs to know what they re doing if they wish to remain anonymous endpoint securitythere s another caveat to all of this if juliet s computer is hacked the hacker will be able to know exactly what she s doing on it same with romeo you can encrypt as much as you want and bounce your encrusted traffic around the world to your heart s content but if an attacker can read your keystrokes as you type them and see exactly what s on your screen you can t hide from them it s extremely difficult to prevent your computer from getting hacked if you re the target of an attacker with resources you can lower your risks of getting hacked by using a separate device that you only use for secure communication because the computer you use for all your daily activities has far more opportunities to get hacked another option is to use tails for private conversations tails is an entirely separate operating system that you install on a us stick and that can be used safely even if your normal operating system has been hacked while tails can give you a much higher degree of security when communicating privately online it is a very advanced tool new users will likely spend many frustration days troubleshooting especially if they aren t already comfortable with linux for most users it s perfectly fine to use your regular operating system to have private conversations online despite the risk of getting hacked it s certainly preferable to giving up and leaking metadata that you shouldn t leak it s also much more convenient and is an easy way to get started if you just casually want some privacy and nothing serious is at stake first contactwhen you want to have a private conversation with someone online it s not always clear how to start if you can meet in person establishing your private communication channel is simple just trade usernames chat servers and or fingerprints more on this below when you meet up meeting in person is often not possible you might be too far away or one side of the conversation might wish to remain anonymous from the other side and even if you want to meet in person how do you communicate this online to begin with while still hiding the fact that you re communicating with this person at all to initiate first contact with romeo juliet needs to create an anonymous secret identity that she uses just to make first contact with romeo s public identity she could email romeo from an anonymous email address most free email services require new users to provide a phone number to make an account and some block tor users altogether which makes creating an anonymous account annoying she could also make an anonymous social media account and use it to contact romeo s public account if possible she should encrypt the first contact messages that she sends to romeo it s much more straightforward to do this if romeo publishes a pgp key at the intercept all of our journalists publish our pgp keys on our staff profiles if you re a source wanting to make first contact with a journalist that works for an organization with securedrop you could use that to make first contact without having to worry about making new accounts anonymously or dealing with pip keys the intercept uses securedrop when she makes first contact juliet should tell romeo what chat server she has made an account on what her username is what her or fingerprint is and what time she ll be waiting online she might also need to give romeo instructions for getting set up himself perhaps linking to this article when juliet and romeo are both anonymously logged into secret identity accounts and are having an otr encrusted conversation they re almost there depending on how juliet made first contact a close look at romeo s email or social media accounts might reveal the username of juliet s secret identity she had to tell it to him somehow after all it could be possible for investigators to work from there to uncover romeo s secret identity as well to prevent anything like this from happening it s a good idea for juliet and romeo to burn these chat accounts and move onto new ones leaving no trails behind indeed whenever juliet and romeo feel like it makes sense they should abandon their old chat accounts in favor of new ones complete with new or keys there are hundreds of public chat servers and making new accounts costs nothing from theory to practicenow that you understand the operation security theory behind maintaining secret identities it s time to actually practice this might sound daunting but i m confident you can do it just follow these step by step instructions for mac os x windows linux and android unfortunately there s no way to connect to chat servers anonymously on iphones try practicing with it a friend first jabber and off the recordi ve been discussing chat servers but what i actually mean is jabber also known as map servers jabber is an open protocol for real time chat it s not a specific service in the way that signal whatsapp or facebook is it s a decentralized and federated service kind of like email i can send an email from my theintercept com address to your gmail com address because the intercept s and gmail s email servers rely on the same standard protocol similarly anyone can run a jabber server and many organizations do including calyx institute riseup chaos computer club and duckduckgo to name a few there are hundreds of other public jabber servers many organizations run private jabber servers for their employees including the intercept s parent company first look media firstlook org the chat service hipchat is powered by jabber under the hood and its competitor slack offers a jabber gateway since jabber is decentralized alike jabber calyxinstitute org this is a jabber account not an email address can chat with bores dukgo co but if both sides of a conversation both romeo and juliet in our example use the same server for their jabber accounts they ll leak less metadata about their conversations messages will stay within in the same server rather than getting sent over the internet unlike email most abner servers let anyone create accounts using tor and don t require that you provide any identifying information at all in fact many jabber servers run tor hidden services to make it so to users can connect without having to leave the tor network at all that is quite an advanced topic however and to keep it simpler i won t use hidden services in the tutorials below off the record otr is an encryption protocol that can add end to end encryption to any chat service including jabber in order to have an encrusted chat both sides of the conversation need to use chat software that supports otr there are several options but the tutorials below will use adium for mac users pidgin for windows and linux users and chatsecure for adroit users chatsecure is also available for ios but there s no way to use it with tor on an is device choosing a jabber serverif you re planning on setting up your secret identity chat account in adroit skip straight down to the adroit section chatsecure for android has great built in support for creating anonymous throw away secret identity accounts for everyone else stop download and install tor browser open it and load this article in that browser instead of the one you were using you re using tor now good this is an important step because i don t want you to leave your real in address in the web logs of every jabber server you re considering using that would be a clue that could later be used to deanonymize your secret identity there are hundreds of jabber servers to choose from you can find lists of some of the public jabber servers here and here which should you choose the server won t know who you are you ll connect using tor or what you re saying you ll use otr to encrypt your messages so you don t need to trust it still you might want to pick one that you think is unlikely to hand over logs to your government and that is happy with tor users making secret identity accounts the most common way that people create abner accounts is directly through their chat software while it s easy to configure chat programs to use tor when you login to your account it s difficult to make sure it uses tor when creating new accounts unless you re using tails in which case you don t have to worry because all your traffic uses tor because of this i recommend that you choose a jabber server that lets you create a new account on their websites so you can do it from tor browser instead of your chat program here are a few jabber servers that you can create new accounts on using tor browser chosen at random from the public lists chatme based in italy coderollers based in romania darkness xmpp based in russia koderoot based in the u s jabber at based in austria hot chilli based in germany xmpp jp based in japan and the list goes on and on ready to get started pick a jabber server make up a username that s not associated with your real identity in any way make up a password that you don t use for anything else create a jabber account using tor browser now keep note of the server you created it on your surname and your password and move on to the next sections for android or mac os x or windows and linux choose your operating system android anonymous encrypted chat windows and linux anonymous encrypted chat mac os x anonymous encrypted chat there is no guide for ios since there s no way to add chat to support to an is device anonymous encrypted chat in mac os xif you haven t already create a new jabber account using tor browser by following the instructions in the choosing a jabber server section above make sure you know which jabber server you created your account on and what your username and password are for this example i created a jabber account on the server xmpp jp with the surname pluto installing adium and configuring your secret account over tordownload and install adium which is a mac chat program that supports or encryption make sure tor browser is open while tor browser is open a tor service will be running in the background on your computer when you close to browser the tor service stops running this means every time you wish to connect to your secret identity jabber account you must have tor browser open in the background or adium simply won t connect go ahead and open tor browser and keep it open for the rest of this tutorial open adium the first time you open it you ll see the adium assistant wizard close this window we ll mutually add an account so we can have access to advanced settings with the contacts window selected click adium in the menu bar at the top and choose preferences make sure the accounts tab at the top of the window is selected click the button in the bottom left to add a new account and select xmpp jabber from the dropdown a new dialog will appear that lets you configure an account before doing anything else switch to the pray tab check connect using pray and choose socks from the dropdown list in the server field type and in the port field type choose a unique username for this account and type anything in password field these settings will ensure that adium only connects to this account using tor the username and password fields are rational but if you use them tor will choose different circuits for this account in adium than it will for everything else which increases your anonymity switch to the privacy tab under the encryption dropdown change encrypt chats as requested to force encryption and refuse plainest switch to the options tab change what s listed in resource by default the name of your computer to anonymous also under security check require sal tls now switch back to the account cab type your jabber id my username is pluto and my jabber server is map jp so my jabber id is pluto xmpp jp type your password and click ok to try connecting to this account when you re done adium should now attempt to connect to your secret identity account over tor if all goes well it should list your new account and say online encryption keys and fingerprintsyou are now anonymously connected to your secret identity account using tor the next step is to set up an or encryption key each person who wishes to use or needs to generate their own key which is a file that gets stored totally on the device you use for chatting each key has a unique string of characters called a fingerprint associated with it no two keys share the same fingerprint let s create your or key with the contacts window selected click adium in the menu bar and choose preferences go to the advanced tab and click on encryption in the left sidebar select your secret identity account and click the generate button to generate a new encryption key when it s done you ll see your new or fingerprint in this example i just created a new otr key for my pluto xmpp jp account with the fingerprint c ca c c c fbb f b b if you want to have a private conversation with someone tell them your jabber username and server as well as your otr fingerprint after they create an anonymous jabber account and an otr key get them to tell you what their surname server and fingerprint are too once you start an encrusted conversation with them you will be able to see their fingerprint and they will be able to see your fingerprint if the fingerprint they gave you matches the fingerprint you see in adium you can mark that contact as trusted and if the fingerprint you gave them matches the fingerprint they see in their chat program they can mark you as trusted this step is confusing but also important if the fingerprints don t match this means that someone is attempting a man in the middle attack against you if this happens don t mark the contact as trusted and try again later adding contacts and conversing in private m trying to have a private conversation with my friend they told me their jabber account is pluto wtfismyip com and their or fingerprint is a b e d fd d d b be f f a aee now that i ve set up my pluto account i m going to add pluto as a contact first i select the contacts window and then click the contact menu bar at the top and choose add contact i set contact type to xmpp and enter pluto wtfismyip com as their jabber id then i click the add button to add them as a contact when you add a jabber contact you can t immediately tell if they re online or not first you need them to consent to let you see their status so now i need to wait for pluto to login and approve my contact request oh good pluto has authorized me to see when they re online and is asking if i allow them to see when i m online i m selecting the their contact and clicking the authorise button now that i have added pluto as a contact the first time they will appear on my contact list when they re online now all i need to do is double click on their name to start chatting with them i double clicked on the pluto contact and typed hi before it sent my message adium started a new otr encrusted session notice that it says pluto wtfismyip com s identity not verified this means that while we have an encrusted chat going on i can t be confident that there isn t a man in the middle attack going on it also popped up an or fingerprint verification box does the fingerprint that pluto gave me match the fingerprint that i see in that box i m comparing the fingerprint pluto gave me earlier with what adium is telling me pluto s fingerprint is one character at a time let me see yup they re the same this means that there is not an attack on our encryption and i can safely click accept if i didn t have pluto s or fingerprint i would ask pluto what it is using an out of band method not using this chat since i don t know if this chat is trustworthy yet and then verify that they match if i don t have time for that now i would click verify later you only have to do this verification step the first time you start an encrusted conversation with a new contact if i login tomorrow and start a new conversation with pluto it should just work and be considered trusted and that s it to recap we have created an anonymous jabber account using tor we have configured the chat program adium to login to this account over tor and we have made a new or encryption key for this account we have added a contact to this account and verified that their or fingerprint is correct and now we can start chatting with them with an extraordinarily high degree of privacy anonymous encrypted chat in windows and linuxif you haven t already create a new jabber account using tor browser by following the instructions in the choosing a jabber server section above make sure you know which jabber server you created your account on and what your username and password are for this example i created a jabber account on the server wtfismyip com with the surname pluto windows and linus instructions are in the same section because you ll use the same piece of software pidgin the steps are nearly identical for both operating systems but i ll point out where they differ installing pidgin and configuring your secret account over torif you re using windows download and install pidgin and then download and install the otr plugin for pidgin make sure tor browser is open while tor browser is open a tor service will be running in the background on your computer when you close to browser the tor service stops running this means every time you wish to connect to your secret identity jabber account you must have tor browser open in the background or pidgin simply won t connect go ahead and open tor browser and keep it open for the rest of this tutorial if you re using linux install the packages pidgin pidgin otr and tor in ubuntu or design you can do this by typing sudo apt get install pidgin pidgin otr tor into a terminal or by using the ubuntu software center because you re installing tor system wide in linux there s no need to worry about keeping tor browser open in the background like in windows or mac os x open pidgin the first time you run it you ll see a welcome to pidgin screen click the add button to add your secret identity account if you already use pidgin you can add a new account by clicking the accounts menu in the ruddy list window and choose manage accounts you should be at the add account window before you do anything else switch to the pray tab set the pray type to tor privacy socks in the host field type and in the port field type if you re using windows and if you re using linux choose a unique username for this account and type anything in password field these settings will ensure that pidgin only connects to this account using tor the username and password fields are rational but if you use them tor will choose different circuits for this account in pidgin than it will for everything else which increases your anonymity switch back to the basin tab under protocol select xmpp in the surname field type your surname mine is pluto in the domain field type your jabber server mine is wtfismyip com in the resource field type anonymous in the password field type your password and rationally check the remember password box when you re all set click the add button if all goes well you should see a ruddy list window with the status available encryption keys and fingerprintsyou are now anonymously connected to your secret identity account using tor the next step is to set up an or encryption key each person who wishes to use or needs to generate their own key which is a file that gets stored totally on the device you use for chatting each key has a unique string of characters called a fingerprint associated with it no two keys share the same fingerprint let s create your or key in the ruddy list window click the tools menu and choose plugins you should see off the record messaging as one of the plugins make sure you check the box next to it to enable it with off the record messaging selected click the configure plugin button select your secret identity account and click the generate button to generate a new encryption key when it s done you ll see your new or fingerprint while you re at it check the require private messaging box in this example i just created a new otr key for my pluto wtfismyip com account with the fingerprint a b e d fd d d b be f f a aee if you want to have a private conversation with someone tell them your jabber username and server as well as your otr fingerprint after they create an anonymous jabber account and an otr key get them to tell you what their surname server and fingerprint are too once you start an encrusted conversation with them you will be able to see their fingerprint and they will be able to see your fingerprint if the fingerprint they gave you matches the fingerprint you see in pidgin you can mark that contact as trusted and if the fingerprint you gave them matches the fingerprint they see in their chat program they can mark you as trusted this step is confusing but also important if the fingerprints don t match this means that someone is attempting a man in the middle attack against you if this happens don t mark the contact as trusted and try again later adding contacts and conversing in private m trying to have a private conversation with my friend they told me their jabber account is e a jabber calyxinstitute org now that i ve set up my pluto account i m going to add e a as a contact from the ruddy list window i click the buddies menu and choose add buddy i type e a jabber calyxinstitute org as the buddy s username and click the add button when you add a jabber contact you can t immediately tell if they re online or not first you need them to consent to let you see their status so now i need to wait for e a to login and approve my contact request oh good e a has authorized me to see when they re online and is asking if i allow them to see when i m online i click the authorise button now that i have added e a as a contact the first time they will appear in my ruddy list when they re online now all i need to do is double click on their name to start chatting with them i double clicked on the e a contact and typed hi before it sent my message pidgin started a new otr encrusted session notice that it says e a jabber calyxinstitute org has not been authenticated yet you should authenticate this buddy you can also see the yellow word verified in the bottom right part of the window this means that while we have an encrusted chat going on i can t be confident that there isn t a man in the middle attack going on click on verified and choose authenticate buddy the authenticate buddy window offers three ways to authenticate question and answer shared secret and manual fingerprint verification choose the latter to view the fingerprints of both sides of the conversation while question and answer and shared secret are useful i m not going to go into how they work this contact s or fingerprint appears to be f d da cda c cf da c ed dc before continuing i want to confirm that this is actually their fingerprint by contacting them out of band not in this chat window since it s not trustworthy yet to ask them let s see they told me their fingerprint and after comparing it one character at a time with what pidgin tells me their fingerprint is up this is their correct fingerprint this means that there is not an attack on our encryption and i can safely change i have not to i have and click authenticate now the status of this conversation is private instead of verified you only have to do this verification step the first time you start an encrusted conversation with a new contact if i login tomorrow and start a new conversation with e a it should just work and be considered private and that s it to recap we have created an anonymous jabber account using tor we have configured the chat program pidgin to login to this account over tor and we have made a new or encryption key for this account we have added a contact to this account and verified that their or fingerprint is correct and now we can start chatting with them with an extraordinarily high degree of privacy anonymous encrypted chat in androidinstalling chatsecure and configuring your secret account over toropen the google play app and install orbot which is tor for adroit open the app and long press the giant button in the middle to connect to the tor network you ll need to be connected to tor before you can configure your jabber account now open the google play app and install chatsecure which is a jabber app that supports or encryption the first time you open chatsecure you ll be presented with the option to set a master password it s a good idea to choose one unless you know what you re doing you ll need this master password every time you start the chatsecure app and connect to your anonymous account if you want extra security consider using a high entropy passphrase for your master password now swipe to the right until you get to the secret identity page and tap the add account button chatsecure will automatically create a new secret identity jabber account for you over tor for me it chose the surname e a on the server jabber calyxinstitute org tap on your username to get to more details about it tap the advanced account options button and change chat encryption to force require you are now anonymously connected to your secret identity account using tor encryption keys and fingerprintseach person who wishes to use or needs to generate their own key which is a file that gets stored totally on the device you use for chatting each key has a unique string of characters called a fingerprint associated with it no two keys share the same fingerprint if you want to have a private conversation with someone tell them your jabber username and server chatsecure doesn t create an or encryption key for you until you start your first encrusted conversation so if this is a new account you won t be able to tell them your fingerprint in advance after they create an anonymous jabber account get them to tell you what their username and server are too once you start an encrusted conversation with them you will be able to see their fingerprint and they will be able to see your fingerprint at this point use an out of band method meaning not involving typing to them in this chat but through some other communication channel to tell them what your or fingerprint is and have them tell you what their or fingerprint is if the fingerprint they gave you matches the fingerprint you see in chatsecure you can mark that contact as trusted and if the fingerprint you gave them matches the fingerprint they see in their chat program they can mark you as trusted in their chat program this step is confusing but also important if the fingerprints don t match this means that someone is attempting a man in the middle attack against you if this happens don t mark the contact as trusted and try again later adding contacts and conversing in private m trying to have a private conversation with my friend they told me their jabber account is pluto such org and their or fingerprint is af a d a f c c now that i ve set up my e a burner account i m going to add pluto as a contact in chatsecure i tap the icon in the top right and select add contact i type pluto such org as their jabber id and tap the send invite button as soon as i add a new contact chatsecure lets me send them a message but it s better to wait until you re sure the other person is online before contacting them both me and pluto need to be online at the same time to start an otr encrusted conversation when you add a jabber contact you can t immediately tell if they re online or not first you need them to consent to let you see their status so now i need to wait for pluto to login and approve my contact request oh good pluto has authorized me to see when they re online and is asking if i allow them to see when i m online i tap the yes button now that i have added pluto as a contact i will be able to see when they re online and send them messages notice that the lock in the top right corner is current unlocked which means that or encryption isn t being used yet i m going to tap the lock icon and choose start encryption notice that the lock is closed but has a question mark in it i m going to tap the lock again and tap verily contact i check pluto s otr fingerprint on my screen against what they gave me initials and good the fingerprints match this means that there is not an attack on our encryption my own or fingerprint is listed there as well at this point i should tell me contact using an out of band channel what my fingerprint is so they can verify it on their end i tap the manual button to mutually confirm that the fingerprints match and the question mark inside the lock icon changes to a green check mark you only have to do this verification step the first time you start an encrusted conversation with a new contact if i login tomorrow and start a new conversation with pluto it should just work and be considered trusted and that s it to recap we have installed orbot and connected to the tor network on android and we have installed chatsecure and created an anonymous secret identity jabber account we have added a contact to this account started an encrusted session and verified that their or fingerprint is correct and now we can start chatting with them with an extraordinarily high degree of privacy micah lee . source loads of screenshots in the article showing how to set up but heres the content for folk who dont like clearnet links chatting in secret while were all being watchedmicah lee t when you pick up the phone and call someone or send a text message or write an email or send a facebook message or chat using google hangouts other people find out what you re saying who you re talking to and where you re locked such private data might only be available to the service provider brokering your conversation but it might also be visible to the telecom companies carrying your internet packets to spy and law enforcement agencies and even to some nearly teenagers monitoring your wi fi network with wireshark but if you take careful steps to protect yourself it s possible to communicate online in a way that s private secret and anonymous today i m going to explain in precise terms how to do that i ll take techniques asa whistleblower edward snowden used when contacting me two and a half years ago and boil them down to the essentials in a nutshell i ll show you how to create anonymous real time chat accounts and how to chat over those accounts using an encryption protocol called off the record messaging or otr if you re in a hurry you can skip directly to where i explain step by step how to set this up for mac os x windows linux and android then when you have time come back and read the important caveats preceding those instructions one caveat is to make sure the encryption you re using is the sort known as end to end encryption with end to end encryption a message gets encrusted at one endpoint like a smartphone and decrypted at the other endpoint let s say a atop no one at any other point including the company providing the communication service you re using can decrypt the message contrast this with encryption that only covers your link to the service provider like an web connection will protect your message from potential snoops on your wi fi network like the teenager with wireshark or working for your telem company but not from the company on the other end of that connection like facebook or google nor from law enforcement or spy agencies requesting information from such companies a second bigger caveat is that it s important to protect not only the content of your communications but also the metadata behind those communications metadata like who is talking to whom can be incredibly revealing when a source wants to communicate with a journalist using encrusted email isn t enough to protect the fact that they re talking to a journalist likewise if you re a star crossed lover hoping to connect with your romantic partner and keep your feuding families from finding out about the hook up you need to protect not just the content of your love notes and steady chats but the very fact that you re talking in the first place let s take a quick look at how to do that secret identitiesmeet juliet who is trying to get in touch with romeo romeo and juliet know that if they talk on the phone exchange emails or skye chats or otherwise communicate using traditional means there s no way to hide from their powerful families the fact that they re communicating the trick is not to hide that they re communicating at all but rather that they re romeo and juliet juliet and romeo decide to make new chat accounts juliet chooses the surname ceres and romeo chooses the surname eris now when ceres and eris have an encrusted conversation it will be harder for attackers to realize that this is actually juliet and romeo when juliet s accounts are later united for evidence of communicating with romeo her short tempered cousin is a bit overbearing to say the least nothing incriminating will show up of course just making up new usernames alone isn t enough it s still possible and sometimes even trivial to figure out that ceres is actually juliet and eris is actually romeo juliet is logging into her ceres account from the same ip address that she s using for everything else on her computer e g emails with her favorite friar if her internet activity is being logged it almost certainly is all of our internet activity is being logged it would be easy to connect the dots if the chat service is forced to hand over the ip address that the ceres account connects from they ll turn over juliet s ip address romeo has the same problem third party services like telecom companies and email providers have access to private information about their users and according to the third party doctrine these users have no reasonable expectation of privacy for this information and it s not just implicit lovers who are exposed by this doctrine even journalists who can sometimes assert special privilege under the first amendment have to be wary of who handles their communications in the justice department obtained the phone records of associated press journalists during a leak investigation and many news organizations don t host their own email making their email vulnerable to u s government requests for data the new york times and wall street journal outsource their email to google and usa today outsources its email to microsoft this is why we run our own email server at the intercept anonymityin order to keep the fact that she s communicating private juliet must keep a bulletproof separation between her ceres identity and her real identity at the moment the easiest and safest way to do this is by using tor the open source and decentralized anonymity network tor is designed to let you use the internet anonymously it s a decentralized network of volunteer nodes computers that help forward and execute internet requests on behalf of other computers tor keeps you anonymous by bouncing your connection through a series of these nodes before finally exiting to the normal internet if a single node is malicious it won t be able to learn both who you are and what you re doing it might know your in address but not where on the internet you re headed or it might see where you re headed but have no idea what your ip address is most people who have heard of tor know about tor browser which you can use to browse the web anonymously but it s also possible to use other software to visit internet services other than the web anonymously including chat and email if romeo and juliet use tor to access their eris and ceres chat accounts and if their conversation is end to end encrusted using or then they can finally have a secret conversation online even in the face of persuasive monitoring juliet and romeo having a secret encrusted conversation from anonymous chat accounts martha pettit attackers from all sidesnow that romeo and juliet have registered new anonymous chat accounts using tor let s probe all of the moving parts for weaknesses juliet s side an attacker that is monitoring juliet s internet traffic will be able to tell that part of it is to traffic but they won t have any information about what she s using tor for if they check out who she s emailing skyping with calling and texting they won t have any evidence that she s talking to romeo of course using the tor network in and of itself can be suspicious which is why the intercept recommends that sources who wish to remain anonymous contact us from a personal computer using a network connection that isn t associated with their employer in other words juliet might seek out a starbucks or public library to be extra safe romeo s side an attacker monitoring romeo s internet traffic will be able to tell that part of it is to traffic if the attacker looks into who romeo is emailing calling texting and skyping with juliet won t be on that list chat server s side the chat service itself will be able to tell that someone coming from a tor ip address created the user ceres and someone coming from a tor ip address created the user eris and that these two users are sending scrambled messages back and forth it won t have any way of knowing that ceres is actually juliet or that eris is actually romeo because their ip addresses are masked by tor and it won t have any way of knowing what ceres and eris are saying to each other because their messages are all encrusted with or these accounts could just as easily belong to a whistleblower and a journalist or to a human rights activist and her lawyer as they could to two mutual crushes trading poetry even with taking these measures there is quite a bit of metadata you might leak if you aren t careful here are some things to keep in mind make sure to use tor when you create your chat account not just when you use it make sure you never login to that account when you re not using tor make sure you don t choose a username that might betray your real identity don t use a pseudonym that you ve used in the past for example instead make up a random username that doesn t have anything to do with you people often think of anonymous accounts that they create as alter egos they come up with a cool pseudonym and grow attached to that identity but it s better to think of secret identities as disposal and temporary their purpose is to mask your real identity not to highlight a piece of it a random string like be c erd makes a better username than gameofthronesfan don t re use a password you use elsewhere reusing passwords is not only bad security but could also de anonymize you if an account associated with your real identity shares the same password associated with your a secret identity be aware of which contacts you communicate with from which secret identity accounts if one of your contacts is exposed it can increase the chances that other contacts you communicate with from the same account will also be exposed there s nothing wrong with making a new chat account for each project or for each contact to reduce the risk of your whole anonymous network unravelling don t give any other identifying information to the chat service be aware of your habits if you login to your chat account in the morning when you start using your computer and log off in the evening when you re done with work you ll be leaking to the chat server what timezone you re in and what your work hours are this might not matter to you but if it does it s best to make appointments with your contacts for specific times to meet online be aware of what else you do using your tor ip address if you use tor to login to both your secret chat account and a chat account that s publicly associated with you the serve logs could be used to link your anonymous account to your real identity you can force tor to choose separate circuits for each account by choosing a unique socks proxy username and password but more on that below tor isn t perfecttor represents state of the art online anonymity but providing true anonymity is a nearly impossible problem to solve there s an going arms race with tor developers and academy researchers on one side and powerful attackers that would like to be able to secretly de anonymize or censor tor users on the other tor has never been secure against a globe adversary an adversary that can spy on all tor nodes around the world in real time because such an adversary would be able to see traffic from tor users enter the network watch it bounce around the world and then watch it leave the network making it clear which traffic belongs to which user but despite all this snowdon documents published by the guardian show that the combined spying power of the five eyes the u s u k canada australia and new zealand doesn t yet count as a globe adversary at least not as of june when that top secret presentation was given it appears that the western intelligence agencies are only able to opportunistically de anonymize random unlucky users and have never been able to de anonymize a specific user on demand as promising as this seems tor might not always protect your identity especially if you re already under close surveillance the story of jeremy hammond s arrest illustrates this point well the fbi suspected that hammond might be part of the lulzsec hacker group which went on a digital crime spree in specifically they suspected he might go by the pseudonym sup g in an online chat room they set up physical surveillance of hammond s apartment in chicago watching what servers he connected to from his wi fi network an fbi affidavit states that a significant portion of the traffic from the chicago residence to the internet was tor related traffic the fbi used a low tech traffic correlation attack to confirm that hammond was indeed sup g when hammond left his apartment tor traffic stopped flowing from his house and sup g logged out of chat when he came back home tor traffic started flowing again and sup g appeared back online because he was already a prime suspect tor didn t protect his identity tor isn t magic it s a tool the human using it still needs to know what they re doing if they wish to remain anonymous endpoint securitythere s another caveat to all of this if juliet s computer is hacked the hacker will be able to know exactly what she s doing on it same with romeo you can encrypt as much as you want and bounce your encrusted traffic around the world to your heart s content but if an attacker can read your keystrokes as you type them and see exactly what s on your screen you can t hide from them it s extremely difficult to prevent your computer from getting hacked if you re the target of an attacker with resources you can lower your risks of getting hacked by using a separate device that you only use for secure communication because the computer you use for all your daily activities has far more opportunities to get hacked another option is to use tails for private conversations tails is an entirely separate operating system that you install on a us stick and that can be used safely even if your normal operating system has been hacked while tails can give you a much higher degree of security when communicating privately online it is a very advanced tool new users will likely spend many frustration days troubleshooting especially if they aren t already comfortable with linux for most users it s perfectly fine to use your regular operating system to have private conversations online despite the risk of getting hacked it s certainly preferable to giving up and leaking metadata that you shouldn t leak it s also much more convenient and is an easy way to get started if you just casually want some privacy and nothing serious is at stake first contactwhen you want to have a private conversation with someone online it s not always clear how to start if you can meet in person establishing your private communication channel is simple just trade usernames chat servers and or fingerprints more on this below when you meet up meeting in person is often not possible you might be too far away or one side of the conversation might wish to remain anonymous from the other side and even if you want to meet in person how do you communicate this online to begin with while still hiding the fact that you re communicating with this person at all to initiate first contact with romeo juliet needs to create an anonymous secret identity that she uses just to make first contact with romeo s public identity she could email romeo from an anonymous email address most free email services require new users to provide a phone number to make an account and some block tor users altogether which makes creating an anonymous account annoying she could also make an anonymous social media account and use it to contact romeo s public account if possible she should encrypt the first contact messages that she sends to romeo it s much more straightforward to do this if romeo publishes a pgp key at the intercept all of our journalists publish our pgp keys on our staff profiles if you re a source wanting to make first contact with a journalist that works for an organization with securedrop you could use that to make first contact without having to worry about making new accounts anonymously or dealing with pip keys the intercept uses securedrop when she makes first contact juliet should tell romeo what chat server she has made an account on what her username is what her or fingerprint is and what time she ll be waiting online she might also need to give romeo instructions for getting set up himself perhaps linking to this article when juliet and romeo are both anonymously logged into secret identity accounts and are having an otr encrusted conversation they re almost there depending on how juliet made first contact a close look at romeo s email or social media accounts might reveal the username of juliet s secret identity she had to tell it to him somehow after all it could be possible for investigators to work from there to uncover romeo s secret identity as well to prevent anything like this from happening it s a good idea for juliet and romeo to burn these chat accounts and move onto new ones leaving no trails behind indeed whenever juliet and romeo feel like it makes sense they should abandon their old chat accounts in favor of new ones complete with new or keys there are hundreds of public chat servers and making new accounts costs nothing from theory to practicenow that you understand the operation security theory behind maintaining secret identities it s time to actually practice this might sound daunting but i m confident you can do it just follow these step by step instructions for mac os x windows linux and android unfortunately there s no way to connect to chat servers anonymously on iphones try practicing with it a friend first jabber and off the recordi ve been discussing chat servers but what i actually mean is jabber also known as map servers jabber is an open protocol for real time chat it s not a specific service in the way that signal whatsapp or facebook is it s a decentralized and federated service kind of like email i can send an email from my theintercept com address to your gmail com address because the intercept s and gmail s email servers rely on the same standard protocol similarly anyone can run a jabber server and many organizations do including calyx institute riseup chaos computer club and duckduckgo to name a few there are hundreds of other public jabber servers many organizations run private jabber servers for their employees including the intercept s parent company first look media firstlook org the chat service hipchat is powered by jabber under the hood and its competitor slack offers a jabber gateway since jabber is decentralized alike jabber calyxinstitute org this is a jabber account not an email address can chat with bores dukgo co but if both sides of a conversation both romeo and juliet in our example use the same server for their jabber accounts they ll leak less metadata about their conversations messages will stay within in the same server rather than getting sent over the internet unlike email most abner servers let anyone create accounts using tor and don t require that you provide any identifying information at all in fact many jabber servers run tor hidden services to make it so to users can connect without having to leave the tor network at all that is quite an advanced topic however and to keep it simpler i won t use hidden services in the tutorials below off the record otr is an encryption protocol that can add end to end encryption to any chat service including jabber in order to have an encrusted chat both sides of the conversation need to use chat software that supports otr there are several options but the tutorials below will use adium for mac users pidgin for windows and linux users and chatsecure for adroit users chatsecure is also available for ios but there s no way to use it with tor on an is device choosing a jabber serverif you re planning on setting up your secret identity chat account in adroit skip straight down to the adroit section chatsecure for android has great built in support for creating anonymous throw away secret identity accounts for everyone else stop download and install tor browser open it and load this article in that browser instead of the one you were using you re using tor now good this is an important step because i don t want you to leave your real in address in the web logs of every jabber server you re considering using that would be a clue that could later be used to deanonymize your secret identity there are hundreds of jabber servers to choose from you can find lists of some of the public jabber servers here and here which should you choose the server won t know who you are you ll connect using tor or what you re saying you ll use otr to encrypt your messages so you don t need to trust it still you might want to pick one that you think is unlikely to hand over logs to your government and that is happy with tor users making secret identity accounts the most common way that people create abner accounts is directly through their chat software while it s easy to configure chat programs to use tor when you login to your account it s difficult to make sure it uses tor when creating new accounts unless you re using tails in which case you don t have to worry because all your traffic uses tor because of this i recommend that you choose a jabber server that lets you create a new account on their websites so you can do it from tor browser instead of your chat program here are a few jabber servers that you can create new accounts on using tor browser chosen at random from the public lists chatme based in italy coderollers based in romania darkness xmpp based in russia koderoot based in the u s jabber at based in austria hot chilli based in germany xmpp jp based in japan and the list goes on and on ready to get started pick a jabber server make up a username that s not associated with your real identity in any way make up a password that you don t use for anything else create a jabber account using tor browser now keep note of the server you created it on your surname and your password and move on to the next sections for android or mac os x or windows and linux choose your operating system android anonymous encrypted chat windows and linux anonymous encrypted chat mac os x anonymous encrypted chat there is no guide for ios since there s no way to add chat to support to an is device anonymous encrypted chat in mac os xif you haven t already create a new jabber account using tor browser by following the instructions in the choosing a jabber server section above make sure you know which jabber server you created your account on and what your username and password are for this example i created a jabber account on the server xmpp jp with the surname pluto installing adium and configuring your secret account over tordownload and install adium which is a mac chat program that supports or encryption make sure tor browser is open while tor browser is open a tor service will be running in the background on your computer when you close to browser the tor service stops running this means every time you wish to connect to your secret identity jabber account you must have tor browser open in the background or adium simply won t connect go ahead and open tor browser and keep it open for the rest of this tutorial open adium the first time you open it you ll see the adium assistant wizard close this window we ll mutually add an account so we can have access to advanced settings with the contacts window selected click adium in the menu bar at the top and choose preferences make sure the accounts tab at the top of the window is selected click the button in the bottom left to add a new account and select xmpp jabber from the dropdown a new dialog will appear that lets you configure an account before doing anything else switch to the pray tab check connect using pray and choose socks from the dropdown list in the server field type and in the port field type choose a unique username for this account and type anything in password field these settings will ensure that adium only connects to this account using tor the username and password fields are rational but if you use them tor will choose different circuits for this account in adium than it will for everything else which increases your anonymity switch to the privacy tab under the encryption dropdown change encrypt chats as requested to force encryption and refuse plainest switch to the options tab change what s listed in resource by default the name of your computer to anonymous also under security check require sal tls now switch back to the account cab type your jabber id my username is pluto and my jabber server is map jp so my jabber id is pluto xmpp jp type your password and click ok to try connecting to this account when you re done adium should now attempt to connect to your secret identity account over tor if all goes well it should list your new account and say online encryption keys and fingerprintsyou are now anonymously connected to your secret identity account using tor the next step is to set up an or encryption key each person who wishes to use or needs to generate their own key which is a file that gets stored totally on the device you use for chatting each key has a unique string of characters called a fingerprint associated with it no two keys share the same fingerprint let s create your or key with the contacts window selected click adium in the menu bar and choose preferences go to the advanced tab and click on encryption in the left sidebar select your secret identity account and click the generate button to generate a new encryption key when it s done you ll see your new or fingerprint in this example i just created a new otr key for my pluto xmpp jp account with the fingerprint c ca c c c fbb f b b if you want to have a private conversation with someone tell them your jabber username and server as well as your otr fingerprint after they create an anonymous jabber account and an otr key get them to tell you what their surname server and fingerprint are too once you start an encrusted conversation with them you will be able to see their fingerprint and they will be able to see your fingerprint if the fingerprint they gave you matches the fingerprint you see in adium you can mark that contact as trusted and if the fingerprint you gave them matches the fingerprint they see in their chat program they can mark you as trusted this step is confusing but also important if the fingerprints don t match this means that someone is attempting a man in the middle attack against you if this happens don t mark the contact as trusted and try again later adding contacts and conversing in private m trying to have a private conversation with my friend they told me their jabber account is pluto wtfismyip com and their or fingerprint is a b e d fd d d b be f f a aee now that i ve set up my pluto account i m going to add pluto as a contact first i select the contacts window and then click the contact menu bar at the top and choose add contact i set contact type to xmpp and enter pluto wtfismyip com as their jabber id then i click the add button to add them as a contact when you add a jabber contact you can t immediately tell if they re online or not first you need them to consent to let you see their status so now i need to wait for pluto to login and approve my contact request oh good pluto has authorized me to see when they re online and is asking if i allow them to see when i m online i m selecting the their contact and clicking the authorise button now that i have added pluto as a contact the first time they will appear on my contact list when they re online now all i need to do is double click on their name to start chatting with them i double clicked on the pluto contact and typed hi before it sent my message adium started a new otr encrusted session notice that it says pluto wtfismyip com s identity not verified this means that while we have an encrusted chat going on i can t be confident that there isn t a man in the middle attack going on it also popped up an or fingerprint verification box does the fingerprint that pluto gave me match the fingerprint that i see in that box i m comparing the fingerprint pluto gave me earlier with what adium is telling me pluto s fingerprint is one character at a time let me see yup they re the same this means that there is not an attack on our encryption and i can safely click accept if i didn t have pluto s or fingerprint i would ask pluto what it is using an out of band method not using this chat since i don t know if this chat is trustworthy yet and then verify that they match if i don t have time for that now i would click verify later you only have to do this verification step the first time you start an encrusted conversation with a new contact if i login tomorrow and start a new conversation with pluto it should just work and be considered trusted and that s it to recap we have created an anonymous jabber account using tor we have configured the chat program adium to login to this account over tor and we have made a new or encryption key for this account we have added a contact to this account and verified that their or fingerprint is correct and now we can start chatting with them with an extraordinarily high degree of privacy anonymous encrypted chat in windows and linuxif you haven t already create a new jabber account using tor browser by following the instructions in the choosing a jabber server section above make sure you know which jabber server you created your account on and what your username and password are for this example i created a jabber account on the server wtfismyip com with the surname pluto windows and linus instructions are in the same section because you ll use the same piece of software pidgin the steps are nearly identical for both operating systems but i ll point out where they differ installing pidgin and configuring your secret account over torif you re using windows download and install pidgin and then download and install the otr plugin for pidgin make sure tor browser is open while tor browser is open a tor service will be running in the background on your computer when you close to browser the tor service stops running this means every time you wish to connect to your secret identity jabber account you must have tor browser open in the background or pidgin simply won t connect go ahead and open tor browser and keep it open for the rest of this tutorial if you re using linux install the packages pidgin pidgin otr and tor in ubuntu or design you can do this by typing sudo apt get install pidgin pidgin otr tor into a terminal or by using the ubuntu software center because you re installing tor system wide in linux there s no need to worry about keeping tor browser open in the background like in windows or mac os x open pidgin the first time you run it you ll see a welcome to pidgin screen click the add button to add your secret identity account if you already use pidgin you can add a new account by clicking the accounts menu in the ruddy list window and choose manage accounts you should be at the add account window before you do anything else switch to the pray tab set the pray type to tor privacy socks in the host field type and in the port field type if you re using windows and if you re using linux choose a unique username for this account and type anything in password field these settings will ensure that pidgin only connects to this account using tor the username and password fields are rational but if you use them tor will choose different circuits for this account in pidgin than it will for everything else which increases your anonymity switch back to the basin tab under protocol select xmpp in the surname field type your surname mine is pluto in the domain field type your jabber server mine is wtfismyip com in the resource field type anonymous in the password field type your password and rationally check the remember password box when you re all set click the add button if all goes well you should see a ruddy list window with the status available encryption keys and fingerprintsyou are now anonymously connected to your secret identity account using tor the next step is to set up an or encryption key each person who wishes to use or needs to generate their own key which is a file that gets stored totally on the device you use for chatting each key has a unique string of characters called a fingerprint associated with it no two keys share the same fingerprint let s create your or key in the ruddy list window click the tools menu and choose plugins you should see off the record messaging as one of the plugins make sure you check the box next to it to enable it with off the record messaging selected click the configure plugin button select your secret identity account and click the generate button to generate a new encryption key when it s done you ll see your new or fingerprint while you re at it check the require private messaging box in this example i just created a new otr key for my pluto wtfismyip com account with the fingerprint a b e d fd d d b be f f a aee if you want to have a private conversation with someone tell them your jabber username and server as well as your otr fingerprint after they create an anonymous jabber account and an otr key get them to tell you what their surname server and fingerprint are too once you start an encrusted conversation with them you will be able to see their fingerprint and they will be able to see your fingerprint if the fingerprint they gave you matches the fingerprint you see in pidgin you can mark that contact as trusted and if the fingerprint you gave them matches the fingerprint they see in their chat program they can mark you as trusted this step is confusing but also important if the fingerprints don t match this means that someone is attempting a man in the middle attack against you if this happens don t mark the contact as trusted and try again later adding contacts and conversing in private m trying to have a private conversation with my friend they told me their jabber account is e a jabber calyxinstitute org now that i ve set up my pluto account i m going to add e a as a contact from the ruddy list window i click the buddies menu and choose add buddy i type e a jabber calyxinstitute org as the buddy s username and click the add button when you add a jabber contact you can t immediately tell if they re online or not first you need them to consent to let you see their status so now i need to wait for e a to login and approve my contact request oh good e a has authorized me to see when they re online and is asking if i allow them to see when i m online i click the authorise button now that i have added e a as a contact the first time they will appear in my ruddy list when they re online now all i need to do is double click on their name to start chatting with them i double clicked on the e a contact and typed hi before it sent my message pidgin started a new otr encrusted session notice that it says e a jabber calyxinstitute org has not been authenticated yet you should authenticate this buddy you can also see the yellow word verified in the bottom right part of the window this means that while we have an encrusted chat going on i can t be confident that there isn t a man in the middle attack going on click on verified and choose authenticate buddy the authenticate buddy window offers three ways to authenticate question and answer shared secret and manual fingerprint verification choose the latter to view the fingerprints of both sides of the conversation while question and answer and shared secret are useful i m not going to go into how they work this contact s or fingerprint appears to be f d da cda c cf da c ed dc before continuing i want to confirm that this is actually their fingerprint by contacting them out of band not in this chat window since it s not trustworthy yet to ask them let s see they told me their fingerprint and after comparing it one character at a time with what pidgin tells me their fingerprint is up this is their correct fingerprint this means that there is not an attack on our encryption and i can safely change i have not to i have and click authenticate now the status of this conversation is private instead of verified you only have to do this verification step the first time you start an encrusted conversation with a new contact if i login tomorrow and start a new conversation with e a it should just work and be considered private and that s it to recap we have created an anonymous jabber account using tor we have configured the chat program pidgin to login to this account over tor and we have made a new or encryption key for this account we have added a contact to this account and verified that their or fingerprint is correct and now we can start chatting with them with an extraordinarily high degree of privacy anonymous encrypted chat in androidinstalling chatsecure and configuring your secret account over toropen the google play app and install orbot which is tor for adroit open the app and long press the giant button in the middle to connect to the tor network you ll need to be connected to tor before you can configure your jabber account now open the google play app and install chatsecure which is a jabber app that supports or encryption the first time you open chatsecure you ll be presented with the option to set a master password it s a good idea to choose one unless you know what you re doing you ll need this master password every time you start the chatsecure app and connect to your anonymous account if you want extra security consider using a high entropy passphrase for your master password now swipe to the right until you get to the secret identity page and tap the add account button chatsecure will automatically create a new secret identity jabber account for you over tor for me it chose the surname e a on the server jabber calyxinstitute org tap on your username to get to more details about it tap the advanced account options button and change chat encryption to force require you are now anonymously connected to your secret identity account using tor encryption keys and fingerprintseach person who wishes to use or needs to generate their own key which is a file that gets stored totally on the device you use for chatting each key has a unique string of characters called a fingerprint associated with it no two keys share the same fingerprint if you want to have a private conversation with someone tell them your jabber username and server chatsecure doesn t create an or encryption key for you until you start your first encrusted conversation so if this is a new account you won t be able to tell them your fingerprint in advance after they create an anonymous jabber account get them to tell you what their username and server are too once you start an encrusted conversation with them you will be able to see their fingerprint and they will be able to see your fingerprint at this point use an out of band method meaning not involving typing to them in this chat but through some other communication channel to tell them what your or fingerprint is and have them tell you what their or fingerprint is if the fingerprint they gave you matches the fingerprint you see in chatsecure you can mark that contact as trusted and if the fingerprint you gave them matches the fingerprint they see in their chat program they can mark you as trusted in their chat program this step is confusing but also important if the fingerprints don t match this means that someone is attempting a man in the middle attack against you if this happens don t mark the contact as trusted and try again later adding contacts and conversing in private m trying to have a private conversation with my friend they told me their jabber account is pluto such org and their or fingerprint is af a d a f c c now that i ve set up my e a burner account i m going to add pluto as a contact in chatsecure i tap the icon in the top right and select add contact i type pluto such org as their jabber id and tap the send invite button as soon as i add a new contact chatsecure lets me send them a message but it s better to wait until you re sure the other person is online before contacting them both me and pluto need to be online at the same time to start an otr encrusted conversation when you add a jabber contact you can t immediately tell if they re online or not first you need them to consent to let you see their status so now i need to wait for pluto to login and approve my contact request oh good pluto has authorized me to see when they re online and is asking if i allow them to see when i m online i tap the yes button now that i have added pluto as a contact i will be able to see when they re online and send them messages notice that the lock in the top right corner is current unlocked which means that or encryption isn t being used yet i m going to tap the lock icon and choose start encryption notice that the lock is closed but has a question mark in it i m going to tap the lock again and tap verily contact i check pluto s otr fingerprint on my screen against what they gave me initials and good the fingerprints match this means that there is not an attack on our encryption my own or fingerprint is listed there as well at this point i should tell me contact using an out of band channel what my fingerprint is so they can verify it on their end i tap the manual button to mutually confirm that the fingerprints match and the question mark inside the lock icon changes to a green check mark you only have to do this verification step the first time you start an encrusted conversation with a new contact if i login tomorrow and start a new conversation with pluto it should just work and be considered trusted and that s it to recap we have installed orbot and connected to the tor network on android and we have installed chatsecure and created an anonymous secret identity jabber account we have added a contact to this account started an encrusted session and verified that their or fingerprint is correct and now we can start chatting with them with an extraordinarily high degree of privacy micah lee . source loads of screenshots in the article showing how to set up but heres the content for folk who dont like clearnet links chatting in secret while were all being watchedmicah lee t when you pick up the phone and call someone or send a text message or write an email or send a facebook message or chat using google hangouts other people find out what you re saying who you re talking to and where you re locked such private data might only be available to the service provider brokering your conversation but it might also be visible to the telecom companies carrying your internet packets to spy and law enforcement agencies and even to some nearly teenagers monitoring your wi fi network with wireshark but if you take careful steps to protect yourself it s possible to communicate online in a way that s private secret and anonymous today i m going to explain in precise terms how to do that i ll take techniques asa whistleblower edward snowden used when contacting me two and a half years ago and boil them down to the essentials in a nutshell i ll show you how to create anonymous real time chat accounts and how to chat over those accounts using an encryption protocol called off the record messaging or otr if you re in a hurry you can skip directly to where i explain step by step how to set this up for mac os x windows linux and android then when you have time come back and read the important caveats preceding those instructions one caveat is to make sure the encryption you re using is the sort known as end to end encryption with end to end encryption a message gets encrusted at one endpoint like a smartphone and decrypted at the other endpoint let s say a atop no one at any other point including the company providing the communication service you re using can decrypt the message contrast this with encryption that only covers your link to the service provider like an web connection will protect your message from potential snoops on your wi fi network like the teenager with wireshark or working for your telem company but not from the company on the other end of that connection like facebook or google nor from law enforcement or spy agencies requesting information from such companies a second bigger caveat is that it s important to protect not only the content of your communications but also the metadata behind those communications metadata like who is talking to whom can be incredibly revealing when a source wants to communicate with a journalist using encrusted email isn t enough to protect the fact that they re talking to a journalist likewise if you re a star crossed lover hoping to connect with your romantic partner and keep your feuding families from finding out about the hook up you need to protect not just the content of your love notes and steady chats but the very fact that you re talking in the first place let s take a quick look at how to do that secret identitiesmeet juliet who is trying to get in touch with romeo romeo and juliet know that if they talk on the phone exchange emails or skye chats or otherwise communicate using traditional means there s no way to hide from their powerful families the fact that they re communicating the trick is not to hide that they re communicating at all but rather that they re romeo and juliet juliet and romeo decide to make new chat accounts juliet chooses the surname ceres and romeo chooses the surname eris now when ceres and eris have an encrusted conversation it will be harder for attackers to realize that this is actually juliet and romeo when juliet s accounts are later united for evidence of communicating with romeo her short tempered cousin is a bit overbearing to say the least nothing incriminating will show up of course just making up new usernames alone isn t enough it s still possible and sometimes even trivial to figure out that ceres is actually juliet and eris is actually romeo juliet is logging into her ceres account from the same ip address that she s using for everything else on her computer e g emails with her favorite friar if her internet activity is being logged it almost certainly is all of our internet activity is being logged it would be easy to connect the dots if the chat service is forced to hand over the ip address that the ceres account connects from they ll turn over juliet s ip address romeo has the same problem third party services like telecom companies and email providers have access to private information about their users and according to the third party doctrine these users have no reasonable expectation of privacy for this information and it s not just implicit lovers who are exposed by this doctrine even journalists who can sometimes assert special privilege under the first amendment have to be wary of who handles their communications in the justice department obtained the phone records of associated press journalists during a leak investigation and many news organizations don t host their own email making their email vulnerable to u s government requests for data the new york times and wall street journal outsource their email to google and usa today outsources its email to microsoft this is why we run our own email server at the intercept anonymityin order to keep the fact that she s communicating private juliet must keep a bulletproof separation between her ceres identity and her real identity at the moment the easiest and safest way to do this is by using tor the open source and decentralized anonymity network tor is designed to let you use the internet anonymously it s a decentralized network of volunteer nodes computers that help forward and execute internet requests on behalf of other computers tor keeps you anonymous by bouncing your connection through a series of these nodes before finally exiting to the normal internet if a single node is malicious it won t be able to learn both who you are and what you re doing it might know your in address but not where on the internet you re headed or it might see where you re headed but have no idea what your ip address is most people who have heard of tor know about tor browser which you can use to browse the web anonymously but it s also possible to use other software to visit internet services other than the web anonymously including chat and email if romeo and juliet use tor to access their eris and ceres chat accounts and if their conversation is end to end encrusted using or then they can finally have a secret conversation online even in the face of persuasive monitoring juliet and romeo having a secret encrusted conversation from anonymous chat accounts martha pettit attackers from all sidesnow that romeo and juliet have registered new anonymous chat accounts using tor let s probe all of the moving parts for weaknesses juliet s side an attacker that is monitoring juliet s internet traffic will be able to tell that part of it is to traffic but they won t have any information about what she s using tor for if they check out who she s emailing skyping with calling and texting they won t have any evidence that she s talking to romeo of course using the tor network in and of itself can be suspicious which is why the intercept recommends that sources who wish to remain anonymous contact us from a personal computer using a network connection that isn t associated with their employer in other words juliet might seek out a starbucks or public library to be extra safe romeo s side an attacker monitoring romeo s internet traffic will be able to tell that part of it is to traffic if the attacker looks into who romeo is emailing calling texting and skyping with juliet won t be on that list chat server s side the chat service itself will be able to tell that someone coming from a tor ip address created the user ceres and someone coming from a tor ip address created the user eris and that these two users are sending scrambled messages back and forth it won t have any way of knowing that ceres is actually juliet or that eris is actually romeo because their ip addresses are masked by tor and it won t have any way of knowing what ceres and eris are saying to each other because their messages are all encrusted with or these accounts could just as easily belong to a whistleblower and a journalist or to a human rights activist and her lawyer as they could to two mutual crushes trading poetry even with taking these measures there is quite a bit of metadata you might leak if you aren t careful here are some things to keep in mind make sure to use tor when you create your chat account not just when you use it make sure you never login to that account when you re not using tor make sure you don t choose a username that might betray your real identity don t use a pseudonym that you ve used in the past for example instead make up a random username that doesn t have anything to do with you people often think of anonymous accounts that they create as alter egos they come up with a cool pseudonym and grow attached to that identity but it s better to think of secret identities as disposal and temporary their purpose is to mask your real identity not to highlight a piece of it a random string like be c erd makes a better username than gameofthronesfan don t re use a password you use elsewhere reusing passwords is not only bad security but could also de anonymize you if an account associated with your real identity shares the same password associated with your a secret identity be aware of which contacts you communicate with from which secret identity accounts if one of your contacts is exposed it can increase the chances that other contacts you communicate with from the same account will also be exposed there s nothing wrong with making a new chat account for each project or for each contact to reduce the risk of your whole anonymous network unravelling don t give any other identifying information to the chat service be aware of your habits if you login to your chat account in the morning when you start using your computer and log off in the evening when you re done with work you ll be leaking to the chat server what timezone you re in and what your work hours are this might not matter to you but if it does it s best to make appointments with your contacts for specific times to meet online be aware of what else you do using your tor ip address if you use tor to login to both your secret chat account and a chat account that s publicly associated with you the serve logs could be used to link your anonymous account to your real identity you can force tor to choose separate circuits for each account by choosing a unique socks proxy username and password but more on that below tor isn t perfecttor represents state of the art online anonymity but providing true anonymity is a nearly impossible problem to solve there s an going arms race with tor developers and academy researchers on one side and powerful attackers that would like to be able to secretly de anonymize or censor tor users on the other tor has never been secure against a globe adversary an adversary that can spy on all tor nodes around the world in real time because such an adversary would be able to see traffic from tor users enter the network watch it bounce around the world and then watch it leave the network making it clear which traffic belongs to which user but despite all this snowdon documents published by the guardian show that the combined spying power of the five eyes the u s u k canada australia and new zealand doesn t yet count as a globe adversary at least not as of june when that top secret presentation was given it appears that the western intelligence agencies are only able to opportunistically de anonymize random unlucky users and have never been able to de anonymize a specific user on demand as promising as this seems tor might not always protect your identity especially if you re already under close surveillance the story of jeremy hammond s arrest illustrates this point well the fbi suspected that hammond might be part of the lulzsec hacker group which went on a digital crime spree in specifically they suspected he might go by the pseudonym sup g in an online chat room they set up physical surveillance of hammond s apartment in chicago watching what servers he connected to from his wi fi network an fbi affidavit states that a significant portion of the traffic from the chicago residence to the internet was tor related traffic the fbi used a low tech traffic correlation attack to confirm that hammond was indeed sup g when hammond left his apartment tor traffic stopped flowing from his house and sup g logged out of chat when he came back home tor traffic started flowing again and sup g appeared back online because he was already a prime suspect tor didn t protect his identity tor isn t magic it s a tool the human using it still needs to know what they re doing if they wish to remain anonymous endpoint securitythere s another caveat to all of this if juliet s computer is hacked the hacker will be able to know exactly what she s doing on it same with romeo you can encrypt as much as you want and bounce your encrusted traffic around the world to your heart s content but if an attacker can read your keystrokes as you type them and see exactly what s on your screen you can t hide from them it s extremely difficult to prevent your computer from getting hacked if you re the target of an attacker with resources you can lower your risks of getting hacked by using a separate device that you only use for secure communication because the computer you use for all your daily activities has far more opportunities to get hacked another option is to use tails for private conversations tails is an entirely separate operating system that you install on a us stick and that can be used safely even if your normal operating system has been hacked while tails can give you a much higher degree of security when communicating privately online it is a very advanced tool new users will likely spend many frustration days troubleshooting especially if they aren t already comfortable with linux for most users it s perfectly fine to use your regular operating system to have private conversations online despite the risk of getting hacked it s certainly preferable to giving up and leaking metadata that you shouldn t leak it s also much more convenient and is an easy way to get started if you just casually want some privacy and nothing serious is at stake first contactwhen you want to have a private conversation with someone online it s not always clear how to start if you can meet in person establishing your private communication channel is simple just trade usernames chat servers and or fingerprints more on this below when you meet up meeting in person is often not possible you might be too far away or one side of the conversation might wish to remain anonymous from the other side and even if you want to meet in person how do you communicate this online to begin with while still hiding the fact that you re communicating with this person at all to initiate first contact with romeo juliet needs to create an anonymous secret identity that she uses just to make first contact with romeo s public identity she could email romeo from an anonymous email address most free email services require new users to provide a phone number to make an account and some block tor users altogether which makes creating an anonymous account annoying she could also make an anonymous social media account and use it to contact romeo s public account if possible she should encrypt the first contact messages that she sends to romeo it s much more straightforward to do this if romeo publishes a pgp key at the intercept all of our journalists publish our pgp keys on our staff profiles if you re a source wanting to make first contact with a journalist that works for an organization with securedrop you could use that to make first contact without having to worry about making new accounts anonymously or dealing with pip keys the intercept uses securedrop when she makes first contact juliet should tell romeo what chat server she has made an account on what her username is what her or fingerprint is and what time she ll be waiting online she might also need to give romeo instructions for getting set up himself perhaps linking to this article when juliet and romeo are both anonymously logged into secret identity accounts and are having an otr encrusted conversation they re almost there depending on how juliet made first contact a close look at romeo s email or social media accounts might reveal the username of juliet s secret identity she had to tell it to him somehow after all it could be possible for investigators to work from there to uncover romeo s secret identity as well to prevent anything like this from happening it s a good idea for juliet and romeo to burn these chat accounts and move onto new ones leaving no trails behind indeed whenever juliet and romeo feel like it makes sense they should abandon their old chat accounts in favor of new ones complete with new or keys there are hundreds of public chat servers and making new accounts costs nothing from theory to practicenow that you understand the operation security theory behind maintaining secret identities it s time to actually practice this might sound daunting but i m confident you can do it just follow these step by step instructions for mac os x windows linux and android unfortunately there s no way to connect to chat servers anonymously on iphones try practicing with it a friend first jabber and off the recordi ve been discussing chat servers but what i actually mean is jabber also known as map servers jabber is an open protocol for real time chat it s not a specific service in the way that signal whatsapp or facebook is it s a decentralized and federated service kind of like email i can send an email from my theintercept com address to your gmail com address because the intercept s and gmail s email servers rely on the same standard protocol similarly anyone can run a jabber server and many organizations do including calyx institute riseup chaos computer club and duckduckgo to name a few there are hundreds of other public jabber servers many organizations run private jabber servers for their employees including the intercept s parent company first look media firstlook org the chat service hipchat is powered by jabber under the hood and its competitor slack offers a jabber gateway since jabber is decentralized alike jabber calyxinstitute org this is a jabber account not an email address can chat with bores dukgo co but if both sides of a conversation both romeo and juliet in our example use the same server for their jabber accounts they ll leak less metadata about their conversations messages will stay within in the same server rather than getting sent over the internet unlike email most abner servers let anyone create accounts using tor and don t require that you provide any identifying information at all in fact many jabber servers run tor hidden services to make it so to users can connect without having to leave the tor network at all that is quite an advanced topic however and to keep it simpler i won t use hidden services in the tutorials below off the record otr is an encryption protocol that can add end to end encryption to any chat service including jabber in order to have an encrusted chat both sides of the conversation need to use chat software that supports otr there are several options but the tutorials below will use adium for mac users pidgin for windows and linux users and chatsecure for adroit users chatsecure is also available for ios but there s no way to use it with tor on an is device choosing a jabber serverif you re planning on setting up your secret identity chat account in adroit skip straight down to the adroit section chatsecure for android has great built in support for creating anonymous throw away secret identity accounts for everyone else stop download and install tor browser open it and load this article in that browser instead of the one you were using you re using tor now good this is an important step because i don t want you to leave your real in address in the web logs of every jabber server you re considering using that would be a clue that could later be used to deanonymize your secret identity there are hundreds of jabber servers to choose from you can find lists of some of the public jabber servers here and here which should you choose the server won t know who you are you ll connect using tor or what you re saying you ll use otr to encrypt your messages so you don t need to trust it still you might want to pick one that you think is unlikely to hand over logs to your government and that is happy with tor users making secret identity accounts the most common way that people create abner accounts is directly through their chat software while it s easy to configure chat programs to use tor when you login to your account it s difficult to make sure it uses tor when creating new accounts unless you re using tails in which case you don t have to worry because all your traffic uses tor because of this i recommend that you choose a jabber server that lets you create a new account on their websites so you can do it from tor browser instead of your chat program here are a few jabber servers that you can create new accounts on using tor browser chosen at random from the public lists chatme based in italy coderollers based in romania darkness xmpp based in russia koderoot based in the u s jabber at based in austria hot chilli based in germany xmpp jp based in japan and the list goes on and on ready to get started pick a jabber server make up a username that s not associated with your real identity in any way make up a password that you don t use for anything else create a jabber account using tor browser now keep note of the server you created it on your surname and your password and move on to the next sections for android or mac os x or windows and linux choose your operating system android anonymous encrypted chat windows and linux anonymous encrypted chat mac os x anonymous encrypted chat there is no guide for ios since there s no way to add chat to support to an is device anonymous encrypted chat in mac os xif you haven t already create a new jabber account using tor browser by following the instructions in the choosing a jabber server section above make sure you know which jabber server you created your account on and what your username and password are for this example i created a jabber account on the server xmpp jp with the surname pluto installing adium and configuring your secret account over tordownload and install adium which is a mac chat program that supports or encryption make sure tor browser is open while tor browser is open a tor service will be running in the background on your computer when you close to browser the tor service stops running this means every time you wish to connect to your secret identity jabber account you must have tor browser open in the background or adium simply won t connect go ahead and open tor browser and keep it open for the rest of this tutorial open adium the first time you open it you ll see the adium assistant wizard close this window we ll mutually add an account so we can have access to advanced settings with the contacts window selected click adium in the menu bar at the top and choose preferences make sure the accounts tab at the top of the window is selected click the button in the bottom left to add a new account and select xmpp jabber from the dropdown a new dialog will appear that lets you configure an account before doing anything else switch to the pray tab check connect using pray and choose socks from the dropdown list in the server field type and in the port field type choose a unique username for this account and type anything in password field these settings will ensure that adium only connects to this account using tor the username and password fields are rational but if you use them tor will choose different circuits for this account in adium than it will for everything else which increases your anonymity switch to the privacy tab under the encryption dropdown change encrypt chats as requested to force encryption and refuse plainest switch to the options tab change what s listed in resource by default the name of your computer to anonymous also under security check require sal tls now switch back to the account cab type your jabber id my username is pluto and my jabber server is map jp so my jabber id is pluto xmpp jp type your password and click ok to try connecting to this account when you re done adium should now attempt to connect to your secret identity account over tor if all goes well it should list your new account and say online encryption keys and fingerprintsyou are now anonymously connected to your secret identity account using tor the next step is to set up an or encryption key each person who wishes to use or needs to generate their own key which is a file that gets stored totally on the device you use for chatting each key has a unique string of characters called a fingerprint associated with it no two keys share the same fingerprint let s create your or key with the contacts window selected click adium in the menu bar and choose preferences go to the advanced tab and click on encryption in the left sidebar select your secret identity account and click the generate button to generate a new encryption key when it s done you ll see your new or fingerprint in this example i just created a new otr key for my pluto xmpp jp account with the fingerprint c ca c c c fbb f b b if you want to have a private conversation with someone tell them your jabber username and server as well as your otr fingerprint after they create an anonymous jabber account and an otr key get them to tell you what their surname server and fingerprint are too once you start an encrusted conversation with them you will be able to see their fingerprint and they will be able to see your fingerprint if the fingerprint they gave you matches the fingerprint you see in adium you can mark that contact as trusted and if the fingerprint you gave them matches the fingerprint they see in their chat program they can mark you as trusted this step is confusing but also important if the fingerprints don t match this means that someone is attempting a man in the middle attack against you if this happens don t mark the contact as trusted and try again later adding contacts and conversing in private m trying to have a private conversation with my friend they told me their jabber account is pluto wtfismyip com and their or fingerprint is a b e d fd d d b be f f a aee now that i ve set up my pluto account i m going to add pluto as a contact first i select the contacts window and then click the contact menu bar at the top and choose add contact i set contact type to xmpp and enter pluto wtfismyip com as their jabber id then i click the add button to add them as a contact when you add a jabber contact you can t immediately tell if they re online or not first you need them to consent to let you see their status so now i need to wait for pluto to login and approve my contact request oh good pluto has authorized me to see when they re online and is asking if i allow them to see when i m online i m selecting the their contact and clicking the authorise button now that i have added pluto as a contact the first time they will appear on my contact list when they re online now all i need to do is double click on their name to start chatting with them i double clicked on the pluto contact and typed hi before it sent my message adium started a new otr encrusted session notice that it says pluto wtfismyip com s identity not verified this means that while we have an encrusted chat going on i can t be confident that there isn t a man in the middle attack going on it also popped up an or fingerprint verification box does the fingerprint that pluto gave me match the fingerprint that i see in that box i m comparing the fingerprint pluto gave me earlier with what adium is telling me pluto s fingerprint is one character at a time let me see yup they re the same this means that there is not an attack on our encryption and i can safely click accept if i didn t have pluto s or fingerprint i would ask pluto what it is using an out of band method not using this chat since i don t know if this chat is trustworthy yet and then verify that they match if i don t have time for that now i would click verify later you only have to do this verification step the first time you start an encrusted conversation with a new contact if i login tomorrow and start a new conversation with pluto it should just work and be considered trusted and that s it to recap we have created an anonymous jabber account using tor we have configured the chat program adium to login to this account over tor and we have made a new or encryption key for this account we have added a contact to this account and verified that their or fingerprint is correct and now we can start chatting with them with an extraordinarily high degree of privacy anonymous encrypted chat in windows and linuxif you haven t already create a new jabber account using tor browser by following the instructions in the choosing a jabber server section above make sure you know which jabber server you created your account on and what your username and password are for this example i created a jabber account on the server wtfismyip com with the surname pluto windows and linus instructions are in the same section because you ll use the same piece of software pidgin the steps are nearly identical for both operating systems but i ll point out where they differ installing pidgin and configuring your secret account over torif you re using windows download and install pidgin and then download and install the otr plugin for pidgin make sure tor browser is open while tor browser is open a tor service will be running in the background on your computer when you close to browser the tor service stops running this means every time you wish to connect to your secret identity jabber account you must have tor browser open in the background or pidgin simply won t connect go ahead and open tor browser and keep it open for the rest of this tutorial if you re using linux install the packages pidgin pidgin otr and tor in ubuntu or design you can do this by typing sudo apt get install pidgin pidgin otr tor into a terminal or by using the ubuntu software center because you re installing tor system wide in linux there s no need to worry about keeping tor browser open in the background like in windows or mac os x open pidgin the first time you run it you ll see a welcome to pidgin screen click the add button to add your secret identity account if you already use pidgin you can add a new account by clicking the accounts menu in the ruddy list window and choose manage accounts you should be at the add account window before you do anything else switch to the pray tab set the pray type to tor privacy socks in the host field type and in the port field type if you re using windows and if you re using linux choose a unique username for this account and type anything in password field these settings will ensure that pidgin only connects to this account using tor the username and password fields are rational but if you use them tor will choose different circuits for this account in pidgin than it will for everything else which increases your anonymity switch back to the basin tab under protocol select xmpp in the surname field type your surname mine is pluto in the domain field type your jabber server mine is wtfismyip com in the resource field type anonymous in the password field type your password and rationally check the remember password box when you re all set click the add button if all goes well you should see a ruddy list window with the status available encryption keys and fingerprintsyou are now anonymously connected to your secret identity account using tor the next step is to set up an or encryption key each person who wishes to use or needs to generate their own key which is a file that gets stored totally on the device you use for chatting each key has a unique string of characters called a fingerprint associated with it no two keys share the same fingerprint let s create your or key in the ruddy list window click the tools menu and choose plugins you should see off the record messaging as one of the plugins make sure you check the box next to it to enable it with off the record messaging selected click the configure plugin button select your secret identity account and click the generate button to generate a new encryption key when it s done you ll see your new or fingerprint while you re at it check the require private messaging box in this example i just created a new otr key for my pluto wtfismyip com account with the fingerprint a b e d fd d d b be f f a aee if you want to have a private conversation with someone tell them your jabber username and server as well as your otr fingerprint after they create an anonymous jabber account and an otr key get them to tell you what their surname server and fingerprint are too once you start an encrusted conversation with them you will be able to see their fingerprint and they will be able to see your fingerprint if the fingerprint they gave you matches the fingerprint you see in pidgin you can mark that contact as trusted and if the fingerprint you gave them matches the fingerprint they see in their chat program they can mark you as trusted this step is confusing but also important if the fingerprints don t match this means that someone is attempting a man in the middle attack against you if this happens don t mark the contact as trusted and try again later adding contacts and conversing in private m trying to have a private conversation with my friend they told me their jabber account is e a jabber calyxinstitute org now that i ve set up my pluto account i m going to add e a as a contact from the ruddy list window i click the buddies menu and choose add buddy i type e a jabber calyxinstitute org as the buddy s username and click the add button when you add a jabber contact you can t immediately tell if they re online or not first you need them to consent to let you see their status so now i need to wait for e a to login and approve my contact request oh good e a has authorized me to see when they re online and is asking if i allow them to see when i m online i click the authorise button now that i have added e a as a contact the first time they will appear in my ruddy list when they re online now all i need to do is double click on their name to start chatting with them i double clicked on the e a contact and typed hi before it sent my message pidgin started a new otr encrusted session notice that it says e a jabber calyxinstitute org has not been authenticated yet you should authenticate this buddy you can also see the yellow word verified in the bottom right part of the window this means that while we have an encrusted chat going on i can t be confident that there isn t a man in the middle attack going on click on verified and choose authenticate buddy the authenticate buddy window offers three ways to authenticate question and answer shared secret and manual fingerprint verification choose the latter to view the fingerprints of both sides of the conversation while question and answer and shared secret are useful i m not going to go into how they work this contact s or fingerprint appears to be f d da cda c cf da c ed dc before continuing i want to confirm that this is actually their fingerprint by contacting them out of band not in this chat window since it s not trustworthy yet to ask them let s see they told me their fingerprint and after comparing it one character at a time with what pidgin tells me their fingerprint is up this is their correct fingerprint this means that there is not an attack on our encryption and i can safely change i have not to i have and click authenticate now the status of this conversation is private instead of verified you only have to do this verification step the first time you start an encrusted conversation with a new contact if i login tomorrow and start a new conversation with e a it should just work and be considered private and that s it to recap we have created an anonymous jabber account using tor we have configured the chat program pidgin to login to this account over tor and we have made a new or encryption key for this account we have added a contact to this account and verified that their or fingerprint is correct and now we can start chatting with them with an extraordinarily high degree of privacy anonymous encrypted chat in androidinstalling chatsecure and configuring your secret

to tor before you can configure your jabber account now open the google play app and install chatsecure which is a jabber app that supports or encryption the first time you open chatsecure you ll be presented with the option to set a master password it s a good idea to choose one unless you know what you re doing you ll need this master password every time you start the chatsecure app and connect to your anonymous account if you want extra security consider using a high entropy passphrase for your master password now swipe to the right until you get to the secret identity page and tap the add

chatsecure doesn t create an or encryption key for you until you start your first encrusted conversation so if this is a new account you won t be able to tell them your fingerprint in advance after they create an anonymous jabber account get them to tell you what their username and server are too once you start an encrusted conversation with them you will be able to see their fingerprint and they will be able to see your fingerprint at this point use an out of band method meaning not involving typing to them in this chat but through some other communication channel to tell them what your or fingerprint is and have them tell you what their or fingerprint is if the fingerprint they gave you matches the fingerprint you see in chatsecure you can mark that contact as trusted and if the fingerprint you gave them matches the fingerprint they see in their chat program they can mark you as trusted in their chat program this step is confusing but also important if the fingerprints don t

trying to have a private conversation with my friend they told me their jabber account is pluto such org and their or fingerprint is af a d a f c c now that i ve set up my e a burner account i m going to add pluto as a contact in chatsecure i tap the icon in the top right and select add contact i type pluto such org as their jabber id and tap the send invite button as soon as i add a new contact chatsecure lets me send them a message but it s better to wait until you re sure the other person is online before contacting them both me and pluto need to be online at the same time to start an otr encrusted conversation when you add a jabber contact you can t immediately tell if they re online or not first you need them to consent to let you see their status so now i need to wait for pluto to login and approve my contact request oh good pluto has authorized me to see when they re online and is asking if i allow them to see when i m online i tap the yes button now that i have added pluto as a contact i will be able to see when they re online and send them messages notice that the lock in the top right corner is current unlocked which means that or encryption isn t being used yet i m going to tap the lock icon and choose start encryption notice that the lock is closed but has a question mark in it i m going to tap the lock again and tap verily contact i check pluto s otr fingerprint on my screen against what they gave me initials and good the fingerprints match this means that there is not an attack on our encryption my own or fingerprint is listed there as well at this point i should tell me contact using an out of band channel what my fingerprint is so they can verify it on their end i tap the manual button to mutually confirm that the fingerprints match and the question mark inside the lock icon changes to a green check mark you only have to do this verification step the first time you start an encrusted conversation with a new contact if i login tomorrow and start a new conversation with pluto it should just work and be considered trusted and that s it to recap we have installed orbot and connected to the tor network on android and we have installed chatsecure and created an anonymous secret identity jabber account we have added a contact to this account started an encrusted session and verified that their or fingerprint is correct and now we can start chatting with them with an extraordinarily high degree of privacy micah lee . source loads of screenshots in the article showing how to set up but heres the content for folk who dont like clearnet links chatting in secret while were all being watchedmicah lee t when you pick up the phone and call someone or send a text message or write an email or send a facebook message or chat using google hangouts other people find out what you re saying who you re talking to and where you re locked such private data might only be available to the service provider brokering your conversation but it might also be visible to the telecom companies carrying your internet packets to spy and law enforcement agencies and even to some nearly teenagers monitoring your wi fi network with wireshark but if you take careful steps to protect yourself it s possible to communicate online in a way that s private secret and anonymous today i m going to explain in precise terms how to do that i ll take techniques asa whistleblower edward snowden used when contacting me two and a half years ago and boil them down to the essentials in a nutshell i ll show you how to create anonymous real time chat accounts and how to chat over those accounts using an encryption protocol called off the record messaging or otr if you re in a hurry you can skip directly to where i explain step by step how to set this up for mac os x windows linux and android then when you have time come back and read the important caveats preceding those instructions one caveat is to make sure the encryption you re using is the sort known as end to end encryption with end to end encryption a message gets encrusted at one endpoint like a smartphone and decrypted at the other endpoint let s say a atop no one at any other point including the company providing the communication service you re using can decrypt the message contrast this with encryption that only covers your link to the service provider like an web connection will protect your message from potential snoops on your wi fi network like the teenager with wireshark or working for your telem company but not from the company on the other end of that connection like facebook or google nor from law enforcement or spy agencies requesting information from such companies a second bigger caveat is that it s important to protect not only the content of your communications but also the metadata behind those communications metadata like who is talking to whom can be incredibly revealing when a source wants to communicate with a journalist using encrusted email isn t enough to protect the fact that they re talking to a journalist likewise if you re a star crossed lover hoping to connect with your romantic partner and keep your feuding families from finding out about the hook up you need to protect not just the content of your love notes and steady chats but the very fact that you re talking in the first place let s take a quick look at how to do that secret identitiesmeet juliet who is trying to get in touch with romeo romeo and juliet know that if they talk on the phone exchange emails or skye chats or otherwise communicate using traditional means there s no way to hide from their powerful families the fact that they re communicating the trick is not to hide that they re communicating at all but rather that they re romeo and juliet juliet and romeo decide to make new chat accounts juliet chooses the surname ceres and romeo chooses the surname eris now when ceres and eris have an encrusted conversation it will be harder for attackers to realize that this is actually juliet and romeo when juliet s accounts are later united for evidence of communicating with romeo her short tempered cousin is a bit overbearing to say the least nothing incriminating will show up of course just making up new usernames alone isn t enough it s still possible and sometimes even trivial to figure out that ceres is actually juliet and eris is actually romeo juliet is logging into her ceres account from the same ip address that she s using for everything else on her computer e g emails with her favorite friar if her internet activity is being logged it almost certainly is all of our internet activity is being logged it would be easy to connect the dots if the chat service is forced to hand over the ip address that the ceres account connects from they ll turn over juliet s ip address romeo has the same problem third party services like telecom companies and email providers have access to private information about their users and according to the third party doctrine these users have no reasonable expectation of privacy for this information and it s not just implicit lovers who are exposed by this doctrine even journalists who can sometimes assert special privilege under the first amendment have to be wary of who handles their communications in the justice department obtained the phone records of associated press journalists during a leak investigation and many news organizations don t host their own email making their email vulnerable to u s government requests for data the new york times and wall street journal outsource their email to google and usa today outsources its email to microsoft this is why we run our own email server at the intercept anonymityin order to keep the fact that she s communicating private juliet must keep a bulletproof separation between her ceres identity and her real identity at the moment the easiest and safest way to do this is by using tor the open source and decentralized anonymity network tor is designed to let you use the internet anonymously it s a decentralized network of volunteer nodes computers that help forward and execute internet requests on behalf of other computers tor keeps you anonymous by bouncing your connection through a series of these nodes before finally exiting to the normal internet if a single node is malicious it won t be able to learn both who you are and what you re doing it might know your in address but not where on the internet you re headed or it might see where you re headed but have no idea what your ip address is most people who have heard of tor know about tor browser which you can use to browse the web anonymously but it s also possible to use other software to visit internet services other than the web anonymously including chat and email if romeo and juliet use tor to access their eris and ceres chat accounts and if their conversation is end to end encrusted using or then they can finally have a secret conversation online even in the face of persuasive monitoring juliet and romeo having a secret encrusted conversation from anonymous chat accounts martha pettit attackers from all sidesnow that romeo and juliet have registered new anonymous chat accounts using tor let s probe all of the moving parts for weaknesses juliet s side an attacker that is monitoring juliet s internet traffic will be able to tell that part of it is to traffic but they won t have any information about what she s using tor for if they check out who she s emailing skyping with calling and texting they won t have any evidence that she s talking to romeo of course using the tor network in and of itself can be suspicious which is why the intercept recommends that sources who wish to remain anonymous contact us from a personal computer using a network connection that isn t associated with their employer in other words juliet might seek out a starbucks or public library to be extra safe romeo s side an attacker monitoring romeo s internet traffic will be able to tell that part of it is to traffic if the attacker looks into who romeo is emailing calling texting and skyping with juliet won t be on that list chat server s side the chat service itself will be able to tell that someone coming from a tor ip address created the user ceres and someone coming from a tor ip address created the user eris and that these two users are sending scrambled messages back and forth it won t have any way of knowing that ceres is actually juliet or that eris is actually romeo because their ip addresses are masked by tor and it won t have any way of knowing what ceres and eris are saying to each other because their messages are all encrusted with or these accounts could just as easily belong to a whistleblower and a journalist or to a human rights activist and her lawyer as they could to two mutual crushes trading poetry even with taking these measures there is quite a bit of metadata you might leak if you aren t careful here are some things to keep in mind make sure to use tor when you create your chat account not just when you use it make sure you never login to that account when you re not using tor make sure you don t choose a username that might betray your real identity don t use a pseudonym that you ve used in the past for example instead make up a random username that doesn t have anything to do with you people often think of anonymous accounts that they create as alter egos they come up with a cool pseudonym and grow attached to that identity but it s better to think of secret identities as disposal and temporary their purpose is to mask your real identity not to highlight a piece of it a random string like be c erd makes a better username than gameofthronesfan don t re use a password you use elsewhere reusing passwords is not only bad security but could also de anonymize you if an account associated with your real identity shares the same password associated with your a secret identity be aware of which contacts you communicate with from which secret identity accounts if one of your contacts is exposed it can increase the chances that other contacts you communicate with from the same account will also be exposed there s nothing wrong with making a new chat account for each project or for each contact to reduce the risk of your whole anonymous network unravelling don t give any other identifying information to the chat service be aware of your habits if you login to your chat account in the morning when you start using your computer and log off in the evening when you re done with work you ll be leaking to the chat server what timezone you re in and what your work hours are this might not matter to you but if it does it s best to make appointments with your contacts for specific times to meet online be aware of what else you do using your tor ip address if you use tor to login to both your secret chat account and a chat account that s publicly associated with you the serve logs could be used to link your anonymous account to your real identity you can force tor to choose separate circuits for each account by choosing a unique socks proxy username and password but more on that below tor isn t perfecttor represents state of the art online anonymity but providing true anonymity is a nearly impossible problem to solve there s an going arms race with tor developers and academy researchers on one side and powerful attackers that would like to be able to secretly de anonymize or censor tor users on the other tor has never been secure against a globe adversary an adversary that can spy on all tor nodes around the world in real time because such an adversary would be able to see traffic from tor users enter the network watch it bounce around the world and then watch it leave the network making it clear which traffic belongs to which user but despite all this snowdon documents published by the guardian show that the combined spying power of the five eyes the u s u k canada australia and new zealand doesn t yet count as a globe adversary at least not as of june when that top secret presentation was given it appears that the western intelligence agencies are only able to opportunistically de anonymize random unlucky users and have never been able to de anonymize a specific user on demand as promising as this seems tor might not always protect your identity especially if you re already under close surveillance the story of jeremy hammond s arrest illustrates this point well the fbi suspected that hammond might be part of the lulzsec hacker group which went on a digital crime spree in specifically they suspected he might go by the pseudonym sup g in an online chat room they set up physical surveillance of hammond s apartment in chicago watching what servers he connected to from his wi fi network an fbi affidavit states that a significant portion of the traffic from the chicago residence to the internet was tor related traffic the fbi used a low tech traffic correlation attack to confirm that hammond was indeed sup g when hammond left his apartment tor traffic stopped flowing from his house and sup g logged out of chat when he came back home tor traffic started flowing again and sup g appeared back online because he was already a prime suspect tor didn t protect his identity tor isn t magic it s a tool the human using it still needs to know what they re doing if they wish to remain anonymous endpoint securitythere s another caveat to all of this if juliet s computer is hacked the hacker will be able to know exactly what she s doing on it same with romeo you can encrypt as much as you want and bounce your encrusted traffic around the world to your heart s content but if an attacker can read your keystrokes as you type them and see exactly what s on your screen you can t hide from them it s extremely difficult to prevent your computer from getting hacked if you re the target of an attacker with resources you can lower your risks of getting hacked by using a separate device that you only use for secure communication because the computer you use for all your daily activities has far more opportunities to get hacked another option is to use tails for private conversations tails is an entirely separate operating system that you install on a us stick and that can be used safely even if your normal operating system has been hacked while tails can give you a much higher degree of security when communicating privately online it is a very advanced tool new users will likely spend many frustration days troubleshooting especially if they aren t already comfortable with linux for most users it s perfectly fine to use your regular operating system to have private conversations online despite the risk of getting hacked it s certainly preferable to giving up and leaking metadata that you shouldn t leak it s also much more convenient and is an easy way to get started if you just casually want some privacy and nothing serious is at stake first contactwhen you want to have a private conversation with someone online it s not always clear how to start if you can meet in person establishing your private communication channel is simple just trade usernames chat servers and or fingerprints more on this below when you meet up meeting in person is often not possible you might be too far away or one side of the conversation might wish to remain anonymous from the other side and even if you want to meet in person how do you communicate this online to begin with while still hiding the fact that you re communicating with this person at all to initiate first contact with romeo juliet needs to create an anonymous secret identity that she uses just to make first contact with romeo s public identity she could email romeo from an anonymous email address most free email services require new users to provide a phone number to make an account and some block tor users altogether which makes creating an anonymous account annoying she could also make an anonymous social media account and use it to contact romeo s public account if possible she should encrypt the first contact messages that she sends to romeo it s much more straightforward to do this if romeo publishes a pgp key at the intercept all of our journalists publish our pgp keys on our staff profiles if you re a source wanting to make first contact with a journalist that works for an organization with securedrop you could use that to make first contact without having to worry about making new accounts anonymously or dealing with pip keys the intercept uses securedrop when she makes first contact juliet should tell romeo what chat server she has made an account on what her username is what her or fingerprint is and what time she ll be waiting online she might also need to give romeo instructions for getting set up himself perhaps linking to this article when juliet and romeo are both anonymously logged into secret identity accounts and are having an otr encrusted conversation they re almost there depending on how juliet made first contact a close look at romeo s email or social media accounts might reveal the username of juliet s secret identity she had to tell it to him somehow after all it could be possible for investigators to work from there to uncover romeo s secret identity as well to prevent anything like this from happening it s a good idea for juliet and romeo to burn these chat accounts and move onto new ones leaving no trails behind indeed whenever juliet and romeo feel like it makes sense they should abandon their old chat accounts in favor of new ones complete with new or keys there are hundreds of public chat servers and making new accounts costs nothing from theory to practicenow that you understand the operation security theory behind maintaining secret identities it s time to actually practice this might sound daunting but i m confident you can do it just follow these step by step instructions for mac os x windows linux and android unfortunately there s no way to connect to chat servers anonymously on iphones try practicing with it a friend first jabber and off the recordi ve been discussing chat servers but what i actually mean is jabber also known as map servers jabber is an open protocol for real time chat it s not a specific service in the way that signal whatsapp or facebook is it s a decentralized and federated service kind of like email i can send an email from my theintercept com address to your gmail com address because the intercept s and gmail s email servers rely on the same standard protocol similarly anyone can run a jabber server and many organizations do including calyx institute riseup chaos computer club and duckduckgo to name a few there are hundreds of other public jabber servers many organizations run private jabber servers for their employees including the intercept s parent company first look media firstlook org the chat service hipchat is powered by jabber under the hood and its competitor slack offers a jabber gateway since jabber is decentralized alike jabber calyxinstitute org this is a jabber account not an email address can chat with bores dukgo co but if both sides of a conversation both romeo and juliet in our example use the same server for their jabber accounts they ll leak less metadata about their conversations messages will stay within in the same server rather than getting sent over the internet unlike email most abner servers let anyone create accounts using tor and don t require that you provide any identifying information at all in fact many jabber servers run tor hidden services to make it so to users can connect without having to leave the tor network at all that is quite an advanced topic however and to keep it simpler i won t use hidden services in the tutorials below off the record otr is an encryption protocol that can add end to end encryption to any chat service including jabber in order to have an encrusted chat both sides of the conversation need to use chat software that supports otr there are several options but the tutorials below will use adium for mac users pidgin for windows and linux users and chatsecure for adroit users chatsecure is also available for ios but there s no way to use it with tor on an is device choosing a jabber serverif you re planning on setting up your secret identity chat account in adroit skip straight down to the adroit section chatsecure for android has great built in support for creating anonymous throw away secret identity accounts for everyone else stop download and install tor browser open it and load this article in that browser instead of the one you were using you re using tor now good this is an important step because i don t want you to leave your real in address in the web logs of every jabber server you re considering using that would be a clue that could later be used to deanonymize your secret identity there are hundreds of jabber servers to choose from you can find lists of some of the public jabber servers here and here which should you choose the server won t know who you are you ll connect using tor or what you re saying you ll use otr to encrypt your messages so you don t need to trust it still you might want to pick one that you think is unlikely to hand over logs to your government and that is happy with tor users making secret identity accounts the most common way that people create abner accounts is directly through their chat software while it s easy to configure chat programs to use tor when you login to your account it s difficult to make sure it uses tor when creating new accounts unless you re using tails in which case you don t have to worry because all your traffic uses tor because of this i recommend that you choose a jabber server that lets you create a new account on their websites so you can do it from tor browser instead of your chat program here are a few jabber servers that you can create new accounts on using tor browser chosen at random from the public lists chatme based in italy coderollers based in romania darkness xmpp based in russia koderoot based in the u s jabber at based in austria hot chilli based in germany xmpp jp based in japan and the list goes on and on ready to get started pick a jabber server make up a username that s not associated with your real identity in any way make up a password that you don t use for anything else create a jabber account using tor browser now keep note of the server you created it on your surname and your password and move on to the next sections for android or mac os x or windows and linux choose your operating system android anonymous encrypted chat windows and linux anonymous encrypted chat mac os x anonymous encrypted chat there is no guide for ios since there s no way to add chat to support to an is device anonymous encrypted chat in mac os xif you haven t already create a new jabber account using tor browser by following the instructions in the choosing a jabber server section above make sure you know which jabber server you created your account on and what your username and password are for this example i created a jabber account on the server xmpp jp with the surname pluto installing adium and configuring your secret account over tordownload and install adium which is a mac chat program that supports or encryption make sure tor browser is open while tor browser is open a tor service will be running in the background on your computer when you close to browser the tor service stops running this means every time you wish to connect to your secret identity jabber account you must have tor browser open in the background or adium simply won t connect go ahead and open tor browser and keep it open for the rest of this tutorial open adium the first time you open it you ll see the adium assistant wizard close this window we ll mutually add an account so we can have access to advanced settings with the contacts window selected click adium in the menu bar at the top and choose preferences make sure the accounts tab at the top of the window is selected click the button in the bottom left to add a new account and select xmpp jabber from the dropdown a new dialog will appear that lets you configure an account before doing anything else switch to the pray tab check connect using pray and choose socks from the dropdown list in the server field type and in the port field type choose a unique username for this account and type anything in password field these settings will ensure that adium only connects to this account using tor the username and password fields are rational but if you use them tor will choose different circuits for this account in adium than it will for everything else which increases your anonymity switch to the privacy tab under the encryption dropdown change encrypt chats as requested to force encryption and refuse plainest switch to the options tab change what s listed in resource by default the name of your computer to anonymous also under security check require sal tls now switch back to the account cab type your jabber id my username is pluto and my jabber server is map jp so my jabber id is pluto xmpp jp type your password and click ok to try connecting to this account when you re done adium should now attempt to connect to your secret identity account over tor if all goes well it should list your new account and say online encryption keys and fingerprintsyou are now anonymously connected to your secret identity account using tor the next step is to set up an or encryption key each person who wishes to use or needs to generate their own key which is a file that gets stored totally on the device you use for chatting each key has a unique string of characters called a fingerprint associated with it no two keys share the same fingerprint let s create your or key with the contacts window selected click adium in the menu bar and choose preferences go to the advanced tab and click on encryption in the left sidebar select your secret identity account and click the generate button to generate a new encryption key when it s done you ll see your new or fingerprint in this example i just created a new otr key for my pluto xmpp jp account with the fingerprint c ca c c c fbb f b b if you want to have a private conversation with someone tell them your jabber username and server as well as your otr fingerprint after they create an anonymous jabber account and an otr key get them to tell you what their surname server and fingerprint are too once you start an encrusted conversation with them you will be able to see their fingerprint and they will be able to see your fingerprint if the fingerprint they gave you matches the fingerprint you see in adium you can mark that contact as trusted and if the fingerprint you gave them matches the fingerprint they see in their chat program they can mark you as trusted this step is confusing but also important if the fingerprints don t match this means that someone is attempting a man in the middle attack against you if this happens don t mark the contact as trusted and try again later adding contacts and conversing in private m trying to have a private conversation with my friend they told me their jabber account is pluto wtfismyip com and their or fingerprint is a b e d fd d d b be f f a aee now that i ve set up my pluto account i m going to add pluto as a contact first i select the contacts window and then click the contact menu bar at the top and choose add contact i set contact type to xmpp and enter pluto wtfismyip com as their jabber id then i click the add button to add them as a contact when you add a jabber contact you can t immediately tell if they re online or not first you need them to consent to let you see their status so now i need to wait for pluto to login and approve my contact request oh good pluto has authorized me to see when they re online and is asking if i allow them to see when i m online i m selecting the their contact and clicking the authorise button now that i have added pluto as a contact the first time they will appear on my contact list when they re online now all i need to do is double click on their name to start chatting with them i double clicked on the pluto contact and typed hi before it sent my message adium started a new otr encrusted session notice that it says pluto wtfismyip com s identity not verified this means that while we have an encrusted chat going on i can t be confident that there isn t a man in the middle attack going on it also popped up an or fingerprint verification box does the fingerprint that pluto gave me match the fingerprint that i see in that box i m comparing the fingerprint pluto gave me earlier with what adium is telling me pluto s fingerprint is one character at a time let me see yup they re the same this means that there is not an attack on our encryption and i can safely click accept if i didn t have pluto s or fingerprint i would ask pluto what it is using an out of band method not using this chat since i don t know if this chat is trustworthy yet and then verify that they match if i don t have time for that now i would click verify later you only have to do this verification step the first time you start an encrusted conversation with a new contact if i login tomorrow and start a new conversation with pluto it should just work and be considered trusted and that s it to recap we have created an anonymous jabber account using tor we have configured the chat program adium to login to this account over tor and we have made a new or encryption key for this account we have added a contact to this account and verified that their or fingerprint is correct and now we can start chatting with them with an extraordinarily high degree of privacy anonymous encrypted chat in windows and linuxif you haven t already create a new jabber account using tor browser by following the instructions in the choosing a jabber server section above make sure you know which jabber server you created your account on and what your username and password are for this example i created a jabber account on the server wtfismyip com with the surname pluto windows and linus instructions are in the same section because you ll use the same piece of software pidgin the steps are nearly identical for both operating systems but i ll point out where they differ installing pidgin and configuring your secret account over torif you re using windows download and install pidgin and then download and install the otr plugin for pidgin make sure tor browser is open while tor browser is open a tor service will be running in the background on your computer when you close to browser the tor service stops running this means every time you wish to connect to your secret identity jabber account you must have tor browser open in the background or pidgin simply won t connect go ahead and open tor browser and keep it open for the rest of this tutorial if you re using linux install the packages pidgin pidgin otr and tor in ubuntu or design you can do this by typing sudo apt get install pidgin pidgin otr tor into a terminal or by using the ubuntu software center because you re installing tor system wide in linux there s no need to worry about keeping tor browser open in the background like in windows or mac os x open pidgin the first time you run it you ll see a welcome to pidgin screen click the add button to add your secret identity account if you already use pidgin you can add a new account by clicking the accounts menu in the ruddy list window and choose manage accounts you should be at the add account window before you do anything else switch to the pray tab set the pray type to tor privacy socks in the host field type and in the port field type if you re using windows and if you re using linux choose a unique username for this account and type anything in password field these settings will ensure that pidgin only connects to this account using tor the username and password fields are rational but if you use them tor will choose different circuits for this account in pidgin than it will for everything else which increases your anonymity switch back to the basin tab under protocol select xmpp in the surname field type your surname mine is pluto in the domain field type your jabber server mine is wtfismyip com in the resource field type anonymous in the password field type your password and rationally check the remember password box when you re all set click the add button if all goes well you should see a ruddy list window with the status available encryption keys and fingerprintsyou are now anonymously connected to your secret identity account using tor the next step is to set up an or encryption key each person who wishes to use or needs to generate their own key which is a file that gets stored totally on the device you use for chatting each key has a unique string of characters called a fingerprint associated with it no two keys share the same fingerprint let s create your or key in the ruddy list window click the tools menu and choose plugins you should see off the record messaging as one of the plugins make sure you check the box next to it to enable it with off the record messaging selected click the configure plugin button select your secret identity account and click the generate button to generate a new encryption key when it s done you ll see your new or fingerprint while you re at it check the require private messaging box in this example i just created a new otr key for my pluto wtfismyip com account with the fingerprint a b e d fd d d b be f f a aee if you want to have a private conversation with someone tell them your jabber username and server as well as your otr fingerprint after they create an anonymous jabber account and an otr key get them to tell you what their surname server and fingerprint are too once you start an encrusted conversation with them you will be able to see their fingerprint and they will be able to see your fingerprint if the fingerprint they gave you matches the fingerprint you see in pidgin you can mark that contact as trusted and if the fingerprint you gave them matches the fingerprint they see in their chat program they can mark you as trusted this step is confusing but also important if the fingerprints don t match this means that someone is attempting a man in the middle attack against you if this happens don t mark the contact as trusted and try again later adding contacts and conversing in private m trying to have a private conversation with my friend they told me their jabber account is e a jabber calyxinstitute org now that i ve set up my pluto account i m going to add e a as a contact from the ruddy list window i click the buddies menu and choose add buddy i type e a jabber calyxinstitute org as the buddy s username and click the add button when you add a jabber contact you can t immediately tell if they re online or not first you need them to consent to let you see their status so now i need to wait for e a to login and approve my contact request oh good e a has authorized me to see when they re online and is asking if i allow them to see when i m online i click the authorise button now that i have added e a as a contact the first time they will appear in my ruddy list when they re online now all i need to do is double click on their name to start chatting with them i double clicked on the e a contact and typed hi before it sent my message pidgin started a new otr encrusted session notice that it says e a jabber calyxinstitute org has not been authenticated yet you should authenticate this buddy you can also see the yellow word verified in the bottom right part of the window this means that while we have an encrusted chat going on i can t be confident that there isn t a man in the middle attack going on click on verified and choose authenticate buddy the authenticate buddy window offers three ways to authenticate question and answer shared secret and manual fingerprint verification choose the latter to view the fingerprints of both sides of the conversation while question and answer and shared secret are useful i m not going to go into how they work this contact s or fingerprint appears to be f d da cda c cf da c ed dc before continuing i want to confirm that this is actually their fingerprint by contacting them out of band not in this chat window since it s not trustworthy yet to ask them let s see they told me their fingerprint and after comparing it one character at a time with what pidgin tells me their fingerprint is up this is their correct fingerprint this means that there is not an attack on our encryption and i can safely change i have not to i have and click authenticate now the status of this conversation is private instead of verified you only have to do this verification step the first time you start an encrusted conversation with a new contact if i login tomorrow and start a new conversation with e a it should just work and be considered private and that s it to recap we have created an anonymous jabber account using tor we have configured the chat program pidgin to login to this account over tor and we have made a new or encryption key for this account we have added a contact to this account and verified that their or fingerprint is correct and now we can start chatting with them with an extraordinarily high degree of privacy anonymous encrypted chat in androidinstalling chatsecure and configuring your secret

chatsecure doesn t create an or encryption key for you until you start your first encrusted conversation so if this is a new account you won t be able to tell them your fingerprint in advance after they create an anonymous jabber account get them to tell you what their username and server are too once you start an encrusted conversation with them you will be able to see their fingerprint and they will be able to see your fingerprint at this point use an out of band method meaning not involving typing to them in this chat but through some other communication channel to tell them what your or fingerprint is and have them tell you what their or fingerprint is if the fingerprint they gave you matches the fingerprint you see in chatsecure you can mark that contact as trusted and if the fingerprint you gave them matches the fingerprint they see in their chat program they can mark you as trusted in their chat program this step is confusing but also important if the fingerprints don t

to add pluto as a contact in chatsecure i tap the icon in the top right and select add contact i type pluto such org as their jabber id and tap the send invite button as soon as i add a new contact chatsecure lets me send them a message but it s better to wait until you re sure the other person is online before contacting them both me and pluto need to be online at the same time to start an otr encrusted conversation when you add a jabber contact you can t immediately tell if they re online or not first you need them to consent to let you see their status so now i need to wait for pluto to login and approve my contact request oh good pluto has authorized me to see when they re online and is asking if i allow them to see when i m online i tap the yes button now that i have added pluto as a contact i will be able to see when they re online and send them messages notice that the lock in the top right corner is current unlocked which means that or encryption isn t being used yet i m going to tap the lock icon and choose start encryption notice that the lock is closed but has a question mark in it i m going to tap the lock again and tap verily contact i check pluto s otr fingerprint on my screen against what they gave me initials and good the fingerprints match this means that there is not an attack on our encryption my own or fingerprint is listed there as well at this point i should tell me contact using an out of band channel what my fingerprint is so they can verify it on their end i tap the manual button to mutually confirm that the fingerprints match and the question mark inside the lock icon changes to a green check mark you only have to do this verification step the first time you start an encrusted conversation with a new contact if i login tomorrow and start a new conversation with pluto it should just work and be considered trusted and that s it to recap we have installed orbot and connected to the tor network on android and we have installed chatsecure and created an anonymous secret identity jabber account we have added a contact to this account started an encrusted session and verified that their or fingerprint is correct and now we can start chatting with them with an extraordinarily high degree of privacy micah lee . with the screenshots this is probably one of the most thorough primers for using xmpp or tor thanks for
