to do with hos and they are not the messenger the bottom line is no one should be posting anything about dnm on reddit period my initials reaction is not opposed to your proposition the discussion of our present cloak and dagger endevours should be kept not on this superfluous clearnet reddit . its v its got it lazy on my part language is a reflection of culture and culture changes over time to use outmoded language is improper in my opinion we dont use words such as thereupon anymore because they are superfluous figures of speech thereupon has no necessary meaning and really no meaning at all it is just word filler its an old fashioned fancy equivalent of like a linguist anacronism similarly the use of double negatives just obscures your true meaning and while they are english words they do no convey a clear meaning as the english language should historically this use of language served as a separation between economic and racial classes while i will admit there is still such a thing as class in modern society i am happy to say that language is not a barrier between them . quote from doses lysergic on january similarly the use of double negatives just obscures your true meaning unlike some of your other examples the double negative is far from being an anacronism and is widely used today not just in english but also in chinese french spanish and other major languages of course it can also be misused however in talking about english english not american english australian english etc the double negative is used to add greater emphasis to the statement it doesnt alter the logical meaning but it changes the emotional meaning that is it conveys additional information on the writers strength of feelings about what they have written so for me dxuutx was saying i consider this especially significant but in a low key way which didnt impose his view on the reader in speech it would be possible to lay extra stress on the word significance and thus give the option of avoiding the double negative in online prose emboldening or italicising significance could achieve a similar effect but personally i think these should not be used unless necessary because of the possibility of text being copied and passed into other applications notepad html editors social networking sites other forums etc where the mark up language would not be recognised maybe dxuutx could or should have avoided the double negative but that would be a choice of style not grammar or syntax the english as it stood was correct a search for the phrase not insignificant including the quotes finds somewhere between and results depending on the search engine which indicates that the phrase is in everyday use perhaps it comes down to different forms of english eg what is common and acceptable in england may be uncommon or unacceptable in the us and vice versa its something of a stereotype that english english abounds with understatements often tinged with irony if jack swigert had been english the phrase would probably have been hutton weve had a slight mishap here rather than houston weve had a problem here quote from doses lysergic on january historically this use of language served as a separation between economic and racial classes no argument to your general polnt very broadly speaking england has been bilingual since the norman invasion of there was the norman french latin spoken by the new aristocracy and clergy and there was the older germanic anglo saxon spoken by the peasants writers such as chaucer and shakespeare helped bridge the gap and the invention of the printing press must have played a part but it wasnt until the late c th that the english caste system finally began to thaw yet even with all the changes of the last years the differences in vocabulary grammar syntax and pronunciation between the top level of the establishment and the average worker are so distinct that it only takes a couple of seconds and half a sentence

both ancient and modern in europe it has a fine pedigree being found in homers iliad ovlds metamorphoses and the epic poem beowulf logically it may be true that its not insignificant has the same

examples the double negative is far from being an anacronism and is widely used today not just in english but also in chinese french spanish and other major languages of course it can also be misused however in talking about english english not american english australian english etc the double negative is used to add greater emphasis to the statement it doesnt alter the logical meaning but it changes the emotional meaning that is it conveys additional information on the writers strength of feelings about what they have written so for me dxuutx was saying i consider this especially significant but in a low key way which didnt impose his view on the reader in speech it would be possible to lay extra stress on the word significance and thus give the option of avoiding the double negative in online prose emboldening or italicising significance could achieve a similar effect but personally i think these should not be used unless necessary because of the possibility of text being copied and passed into other applications notepad html editors social networking sites other forums etc where the mark up language would not be recognised maybe dxuutx could or should have avoided the double negative but that would be a choice of style not grammar or syntax the english as it stood was correct a search for the phrase not insignificant including the quotes finds somewhere between and results depending on the search engine which indicates that the phrase is in everyday use perhaps it comes down to different forms of english eg what is common and acceptable in england may be uncommon or unacceptable in the us and vice versa its something of a stereotype that english english abounds with understatements often tinged with irony if jack swigert had been english the
