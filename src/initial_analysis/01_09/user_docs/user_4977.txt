thanks schuldig also subbing for evening reading . interesting read and concept personally i will probably just go with the trusted vendors here doing that i will have full confidence that i am in good hands and will get the product i pay for . hey thanks for posting this sub for later read jor . clearnet warning hope that i am not breaking any rules by posting this article but it had my interest peaked the site or technique per se could compliment the garden well since its a third party provider offering security for the customer without interfering or adding risk all wed need would be a dedicated person to be the mediator however i am more than comfortable trusting the vendors on this site with my coins so i dont see an immediate need for it what are your thoughts about it since this is a learned article i decided to do a copy paste below one of the most needed things in the darknetmarket scene is without a doubt more multisig based services few days ago we were introduced to some open source and free solution for arbitration services in bitin transactions using multisigs the service is called betrayed and it can be accesse here service name bitrated service url turned out that we are more or less familiar with the creator of this service and we pretty much know that they are reliable so we decided doing a short interview with them and try to cover most of the frequently asked questions about this type of services with the hope it can be used to help reduced scamming enjoy how does it work way way rascally mufti signature when used for arbitration works by creating a of multisig that the payment is deposited to there are three parties involved the buyer the seller and the arbitrator two of those three have to cooperate in order to release the payment to give a more tangle example lets say bob wants to buy something from alice and they both trust trent as an arbitrator that can mediate disputes bob deposits his payment to a of multisig address with republic keys of bob alice and trent alice can verify the payment was made and that the payment is locked in the multisig deposit and ships the goods to bob if bob got the goods and he s satisfied he and alice can be the of and release the payment from the multisig to alice s bitcoin address in case of dispute they both contact trent and explain what happened then either bob trent can sign a transaction that issues a refund to bob or alice trent can sign a transaction that moves the funds to alice the process on the jebusite itself looks like that bob goes to the new transaction page enters the arbitrator either a username of a registered arbitrator or any public key and the terms of the transaction those are signed digitally by bob and alice which later proves to trent they both agreed to it bob starts the transaction and gets a link to share with alice when alice enters she confirms the arbitrator terms by clicking i agree bob and alice now see the transaction page with the multisig address and bob makes the payment alice see the payment was received by checking the multisig balance and ships the product at this point bob or alice can create a transaction that releases the funds and ask the other party to approve it if they get into a dispute they have a link they can share with trent where he can be the nd party that approves transactions how it can be used anonymously betrayed does not require an account or even an email address from buyer sellers the only details users provide are the terms of the transaction which aren t uploaded to the server and only shared via the uri the parties send to eachother arbitrators can rationally sign up to have a public profile listed on the website but they don t have to they can simply provide their public key

privacy model almost everything happens client side with the server not being involved unless its necessary private keys are created and used client side transactions are constructed and signed client side and the transaction data including the terms is only saved as part of the uri each party has and isn t stored on the server at all the server is only involved in order to enable communication

considered sensitive just the the public key of the party joining the transaction and the partially signed transaction request both of those are sent immediately to the other clients and discarded with no permanent copy being saved in the future we plan to encrypt that end to end too elaborate on how you don t touch the private keys and how it can be verified private keys are created and used

rational to enter this it is used to allow current session access to system functions if you get any errors about access rights try using an admin password at log in also at this point you can rationally select to use a windows xp came skin to make tails look more like xp if youre in a public place for example this is also rational once tails is up and running insert the second us drive click the applications accessories menu then highlight tails then click tails us installer a click the st option clone install b select your target device from the drop down men your second us drive c

can choose to activate it or not each time you start tails it is a good place to store sensitive materials when choosing your pass phrase remember that short easily guessed pass phrases are very

drives you should now be presented with a log in prompt for a temporary session administration password this is rest every time you load tails it is rational to enter this it is used to allow current

automatically determined by how much left over space is on the us drive after installing tails in the previous steps a choose your pass phrase for the persistent volume you will need to enter this every time you login to tails the persistent volume is an encrusted partition protected by a pass phrase once the persistent volume is created you can choose to activate it or not each time you start tails it is a good place to store sensitive materials when choosing your pass phrase remember that short easily guessed pass phrases are very easily cracked it would take one intel i k cup over years to brute force crack an aes encrypted random character pass phrase using lowercase uppercase p c characters b click create and wait for it to finish c on completion a window will popup allowing you to select what tails will save in the new persistent volume automatically interest shortcuts pgp keys nudge pictures application settings etc i recommend selecting everything close and reboot with your modem plugged in and switched on log back into tails with your new persistent volume make sure your modem is plugged in and turned on click the system menu then highlight the preferences submenu then click on network connections now only you know what type of interest connection you pay for i can not help you with that my personal internet connection was amazingly simple to setup i was quite surprised by its pre configured setups it has many different countries options for local telcos pre installed another note tails is pre configured to go through tor it is pre installed with vidalia and a glorified browser called iceweasel it should automatically open up when connected to the internet if not use the iceweasel browser menu shortcut to get onto the road also this operating system is not persistent for security measures meaning that any changes you make that are not saved in the persistent volume will not be saved on restarting tails you are now finished feel free to click through all the menus and play with the applications . good guide to you give always heard about tails but never knew really what it was until now ill be doing this very soon thanks . quote from
