question i finished snug email and be on to make a bitcoins account do i need a wallet or is it enough to buy some coins via bitcoins de for example i dont get what is the difference between buy sell bitcoins and a wallet when i have a bank account i dont need more okay a physical wallet of course but not a virtuell one and another noon question what is the difference between this site and silk road i mean this site sometimes refers to the silk road that confuses me a bit . quote from n rg on august pmdo i need a wallet or is it enough to buy some coins via bitcoins de for example i dont get what is the difference between buy sell bitcoins and a wallet when i have a bank account i dont need more okay a physical wallet of course but not a virtuell one okay well when you buy coins from a site they store your coins in a wallet which is a bitcoin address some people use multiply wallets and transfer coins between them for security so you can withdraw into another btc address i always use bitcoinfog which tumbles the coin making it harder to trace and i am lazy so i store any coin there until i send it to the vendors other people take their coins into different wallets which are more secure quote from n rg on august pmand another noon question what is the difference between this site and silk road i mean this site sometimes refers to the silk road that confuses me a bit there s a lot of differences here on silk road and other darkweb markets you transfer your coin to your wallet on the site which holds it and transfers it to vendors when you make a purchase there is a system called escrow which means the funds aren t released to people until you ve verified that you received the product that doesn t exist here because a all the vendors have been petted so they never scam people because their reputation is on the line avengers star ratings etc and b its kind of more secure if you just transfer coin directly to the vendors using a unique bitcoin address for each transaction if you check out silk road or some of the other marketplaces love avengers com dated llist of hidden marketplaces tor i p you will notice a big difference in the atmosphere of the places here there is an emphasis on education safety community and quality no addictive substances are allowed for example and scamming and trolling aren t tolerated its really much more chilled out dealing directly with vendors other marketplaces have a lot more products and a lot more vendors but with that comes a lot more risks and bullshit personally i m happy here right now cause it has everything i need including nice conversation without the judgement attitudes of a lot of people on the darknet markets enjoy and be safe make sure you learn about security and all that if you are a

august pmwow thank you sooo much for that detailed answer that helps me really much thats so nice i have a little checklist here so i do it like that and it should work right buy bitcoins transfer via deposit address to bitcoin fog find a reliable vendor and mail via snug mail make order and send bitcoinsis that right yeah this is pretty much the maximum amount of security you should be doing providing that the bitcoin is not linked to your name in any way so you are buying it anonymously and sending it through a tumbler fog directly to a vendor there is a lot more security you could be doing like tumbling it through different tumblers and using another external wallet and stuff like that but i think this is pretty okayquote from n rg on august pmand can i give everyone that strange endless long email crypt code i see some ppl posting that so i guess a can make a request and leave that code there right yes you need to follow a guide so that you can give people your public key this is so that people can send messages to you but only you can read them because saved on your computer is your private key which is the thing that decodes the message you must save the vendors public key and then when you send personal details you encrypt the message using their public key i bet theres a guide on tmg but definitely there will be guides on other forums quote from n rg on august really now the last thing i looked up in that board if my country was already asked by any user to be delivered its in the eu but i didnt find any match is it allowed to say in a public request which country is the delivery aim i guess not right or is it just the right way to write every vendor and ask if he can deliver an amount of x to country y its better not to announce what country youre in but there are some countries that vendors wont ship to because customs are much tougher australia some of scandinavia us etc if you are in the eu you probably dont need to worry though some people have issued with no if in doubt yes ask the vendor if its okay before transferring any coin be safe . quote from n rg on august pmwow thank you sooo much for that detailed answer that helps me
