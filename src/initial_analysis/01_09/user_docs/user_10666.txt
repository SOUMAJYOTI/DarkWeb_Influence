didnt take any precautions to hide their identities as what they were doing was perfectly legal what they didnt know however was that the government in their country had very quietly changed the law to make what they were doing illegal so during the months of november and december the police monitored the places where these people hung out online observing everything that was going on and making notes at the stroke of midnight december st as the old year ended and the new year began the new laws took effect what had previously been completely legal was now highly illegal the police had carefully prepared themselves for months they had already obtained the names and addresses of those involved and as soon as the new law took effect they carried out a series of raids those people still in possession of the newly contraband items were arrested and prosecuted those who had taken precautions even though what they were doing was perfectly legal were neither raised nor arrested

true story in this regard a few years back there was a group of people in eastern europe who traded in a particular commodity many of them didnt take any precautions to hide their identities as what they were doing was perfectly legal what they didnt know however was that the government in their country had very quietly changed the law to make what they were doing illegal so during the months of november and december the police monitored the places where these people hung out online observing everything that was going on and making notes at the stroke of midnight december st as the old year ended and the new year began the new laws took effect what had previously been completely legal was now highly illegal the police had carefully prepared themselves for months they had already obtained the names and addresses of those involved and as soon as the new law took effect they carried out a series of raids those people still in possession of the newly contraband items were arrested and prosecuted those who had taken precautions even though what they were doing was perfectly legal were neither raised nor arrested remember that laws can change in the blink of an eye what is perfectly
