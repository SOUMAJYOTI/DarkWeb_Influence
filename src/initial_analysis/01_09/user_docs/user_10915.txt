itself quoted for the escrow accounts the private keys for these are kept offline and decrypted with two separate keys current my personal key and the system key so only you have full access to the btc and even if i want my btc only you can get it for me mutually how long does it take what if your service was unavoidable how do i know you wont run off with the btc quoteim also sceptical of mufti

these markets would not work mufti sig or not it makes no difference do you even know what you are talking about how could a rogue market operator steal btc from a multi sig address they would also need the private key of either buyer or seller multi sig address is locked in the bitcoin blockchain not by the market operator quotei take precautions to prevent any bitcoins being stolen by external parties but people using any service will have to decide for themselves whether the administrator is a credible enough mediator for them to place their trust with during bitin transactions with the stuff listed above trust is a tough issue here you even denied a reproducible xss vulnerability listed on reddit com a while back worst part is the vulnerability is still there i have torbrowser set to alert me of javascript xss attacks and it always pops up ass detected there are potential issues here what if i was explained by someone and they stole my session what if someone exploits my browser and gets my irl ip and dox me hand me to le im not saying you are a scam but there are others who are listing unc as one you be more clear on the descriptions for gods sake please also fix the
