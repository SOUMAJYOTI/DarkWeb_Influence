previously this technology was rather difficult for your average user to wrap their head around requiring using command line to create and handle these transactions fortunately for us the demand is there and simplified web uis are now popping up to make this process significantly easier so what is multisig long story short its a way to eliminate having one centralized wallet holding all the coins while still maintaining the benefits of a third party arbitrating the huge advantage in comparison to the escrow were all used to is that the arbitrator can not single handedly decide the fate of the coins making situations like what happened w not only the hackers but also sundown by le impossible multiply parties hold the keys to the transaction and without coming to agreement the coins

there is a clear text field for seller to list the terms before sending to buyer arbitrator is not needed in any way should transaction not go into dispute buyer seller are given a uri containing

the parties involved can create the transaction barebones ui no need for arbitrator or users to start an account not very user friendly and very little support documentation no support for sending
