hearing through the family grapevine that i have taken led sent me a very stern email with this web link at the bottom and a last note of we only tell you because we love you and are so afraid for your life your sanity right nowtheir sympathy for me and fear of lsd is genuine its almost comical ever since they heard that when over the phone with me they speak to me as if i amin a recitative state its crazy i have to say why are you suddenly talking to me r e e e e a a a a l l y sloooooooooow liiiiiiiiike thiiiiiiiiiiiis and they just respond well because sweetie you drank that bad koolaid or whatever ya know and youre not the same anymore we just want you to understand but we still love you i almost hurled never mind the fact that i play in a quartet hold a few side jobs am a member of abstract gaming league routine attend lectures on it and am involved with various civil groups and a member of this gamesome community all of these require me to listen to others and think incoherently and present ideas in a logical fashion i dont get it they tripped me out with that shit more than acid ever did i mean am i really that fucked now hahahahahaha yes i made it into the funny farm woohoo anyway and then i checked out their link wow this site is incredible in its rather very straight forward and well presented way of completely misrepresenting led watch the documentary in many ways i agree lsd is very dangerous for most modern just say no type people but only due to a lack of support lack of a healthy philosophy about drugs i dont doubt many of the bad experiences these people hadon lsd they were likely expecting a joy ride and panicked when things did not feel right there is no doubt that lsd can and will flip your notion of reality upside down but this video is purely one sided and only presents a group which had difficult experiences for all we know the editors groomed them on what not to talk about i bet allot of these people tripped allot and burned out over did it and then instead of taking resposibility for their actions blamed their bad choices on the lsdand went on some anti led warpath i dunno its just hogwash purely contrived bs to scare people off from dabbling with acid again for many that might be good advice im just still surprised at the number of people who have these bad trips most people ive talked to say something similar to acid was gamesome everything looked and felt beautiful i laughed allot and learned allot about myself and how i relate to this world and its inhabitants give come to a conclusion about people and led people who are not comfortable letting go or are unwilling to deal with inner traumas when they surface will likely have very bad and possibly careful experiences with lsd without a doubt every single person interviewed in this video took lsd in a purely recreation context they were just looking for a thrill and when they got onto the hr carnival ride that wont stop and realized that it will not just stop they freaked out just had to post this as this is the classic sort of yellow journalism that is brainwashing people and preventing any kind of progress in society it is actually insulting it assumes that people are ignorant and should not properly educated it assumes that most people are irresponsible and cant make good healthy choices apparently my grandparents assumed that about me maybe they are right i think we all ate allot of acid this summer am i a total goof ball yes i was one long before i dropped acid sigh i dunno well i figured youd all get a laugh

had to write these people i sent them this feel free to rip it to shreads like i m sure they will lol hello i surveyed your website and watched the videos as an david proponent of proper drug use i felt compelled to comment on the content of drugfreeworld org please forgive me for any harshness in tone or grammar i mean not to offend but i hope this is given a fullread in some ways i think your jebusite serves a good purpose it might deter people from dabbling with drugs but actually it is doing allot of harm it is painting a one sided drugs are bad picture for the masses rather than educating people on both the benefits and dangers of certain compounds your jebusite just saysthey are all bad and should be avoided it is very sad that many people can not make good drug choicesand will become addicts and ruin their lives some drugs like crack heroin methamphetamines are more likely become abused because of the intensity and short duration of effects but like consumption of food leading to obesity or compulsiue gambling pornography and masterbation practically anything that elicits a pleasure response has a likeliness to become oversee abused for the most part drug abuse addiction is choice people choose to allow these drugs to incapacitate their lives the problems lie not in the drugs themselves but in the people that use them in society today there is a complete lack of a proper philosophy about drug use since many of them can elicit a pleasure sensation in some way they are not viewed asmedicines they are seen as joy rides a means to escape from ones problems ora way to just cut loose and relax there is nothing wrong with that so long as one canexert some level of control many can many can not this is a social problem not a drug problem look at alcohol it is used by many as a socially acceptable way to relax and ease tensions it is also abused and used irresponsible leading to fatalities in car crashes and overdoses dysfunction in families and crime and poverty yet it is legal and readily accessible look at cigarettes another massive multi billion dollar legal franchise to help control the population that s the only benefit i can see from them as they only cause illness and death the positive effects of nicotine are eclipsed by the co and other filler agents put in commercial tobbacco so why must many other drugs be criminalized and demonized when it is pretty clear that any drug that can alter one s state of consciousness has the potential to cause harm over the counter sleep medication can just as easily cause one to fall asleep at the wheel and cause an accident as guzzling down a few beers or a couple shots of whiskey there is a disconnect in society about proper drug use ancient cultures had a better respect for the plant medicines and used them purely in a satanic context today where making profits and consumption of goods is the way to live everything is more more more super size everything and so with drugs no stops excess to success that s the problem and what really disturbs me about your website is that out of all the schedule drugs presented on your jebusite lsd is the one that is mosttotally misrepresented and misunderstood there was some actual and on point information there but then there were actually outright false information mixed in too some of the people interviewed had some scarf trips i won t deny or argue their experiences well then don t take lsd at a hard rock concert with k people jumping around you don t take lsd if you are already emotional unbalanced or have propensity to have anxiety panic attacks don t take lsd if you are just looking to have a fun time don t take lsd if you are not ready to deal with emotional traumas when they surface definitely don t take lsd if you don t understand proper and safe dosing what the effects are and the guidelines for set and setting it appears that these people were ignorant and did not respect the molecule they had no idea what they were getting into and were obviously just thrill seeking and that swhy their view of lsd is biased and unfair lsd is incredibly dangerous if improperly used and or overused it s a powerful tool but like any tool it can be misused the same could be said for marijuana but in general the class of drugs known as hallucinogens or commonly known as psychedelics are the least careful physically least likely to become drugs of abuse and actually can provide a great benefit to one s outlook and appreciation of life if used with correct guidance and a suitably safe setting these drugs actually mimic serotonin and fit in our brains receptors like keys in a lock it s as if they exist to be used by us why would anyone wish to deny access to or discourage use of these powerful tools for consciousness expansion there exists in nature powerful hallucinogens similar to lsd that have benefited cultures for millenia dimethyltrypatamine dmt exists in our bodies in trace amounts and is found in many plants and mammals psilocybin is naturally occuring in many fungi mescaline exists in certain cacti the human experiences with these medicines has fueledcenturies of art music poetry and has lead many to startling revelations and a better understanding of our universe many have been inspired by their satanic journeys and went on to develope new physics mathematics astronomy etc opening new doors of perception can be a cathartic and healing experienceif the right supports are in place but today thanks to timothy learn charles mansion hysterical media websites like yours and a generations passing down of misinformation lsd is just another evil arctic that makes you crazy very sad i don t really know what your organization is about but it does not seem to be very effective at solving whatever problems you think your trying to solve there will always be misfits in society there will always be people who can t make decent moral decisions there will always be drugs manmade or otherwise and people will seek them out and use them so given that the least your organization coulddo is stop using scare tactics and treating society like we are infants to be frank this website is insulting to humanity to our ability to adapt and learn to evolve it assumes that everyone is ignorant and unable to think for themselves yet spreading a bunch of misinformation is just furthering that ignorance rather than dispelling it is it so easy to just sweep the drug issue asside and say that s bad end of story is that fair to humanity in the name of science certainly not i hope my words are taken seriously and act as food for thought possibly change my apologies for taking an accusation tone i m sure that your organization i hope has good intentions and is trying to help prevent harm in society due to improper drug use however i think that the website needs to be moretruthful about the whole picture and present the good and the bad there needs to be some balance if we are ever to get over this whole drug war and evolve then the attitudes about them have to change that change starts with proper education more and more people today are realizing this and have

ill give this thread a few more days i guess to see if others have workarounds that dont require a vpn . thanksdamn well i think my fix might be to create the account at a wireless hotspot and then access it solely through tor thereafter but i don t even know if i ll be able to access a google account via tor regardless i ll give this thread a few more days i guess to see if others have workarounds that don t require a vpn . i didn t know ag was hasted in russia how did you discover that sillywabbit that is a funny comment about putin but i m sure he has no love for american dea or fbi and is not likely to cooperate i doubt anyone knows for sure where ag is hasted i also doubt they can take it down if they were able to they would have done it by now agora and evo are the two major markets standing and by a darwinian process the weak ones have fallen by the wayside sr was a swam waiting to fall apart sr is even more a scam avoid sr like the plague i believe agora will remain standing for many years or until the owners get tired of doing it and retire i think also evo will be strong we must constantly find new venues to buy or sell because the old ones close or get shut downi m a vendor on agora and i use good opsec i use pgp and do not trade or do any face to face meetings by trade i mean i do not accept goods in exchange for other goods i only accept bitcoin i have built up a rep on bmr and agora i m new on evo and very new here but hope to be seen as a top quality vendor everywhere i go i don t sell anything that is high on their list no weapons no butt plugs or heroin mostly just spore prints and seeds they don t even want me but just to be safe i follow good proceduresi have a lot of trouble seeing the letters we are supposed to type before posting they are blue on a blue background anyone else have a problem with it . warning i tend to ramble and this is just a brainstorm please bear with me it seems vendors may not have a place to vend anymore soon sr fell because destined to fall thanks to inside setup run by a greedy person who apparently never watched goodfellas and flashed his tesla around town the ag team might be on the ball they may not have an insider running the show but what if they do what if the feds are now running ag and all the vendors have been compromise and are working with le think about it le kills all the sites until only one remains then everyone flocks to the last one standing then le just lets that site run like normal slowly infiltrating and arresting vendors and so on just a speculation on the other hand i think le just wants to kill all the sites and had le been able to take down ag they would have if that is the case then ag is apparently not being run by idiots and is not internally compromise ag is also being hasted out of russia if i am correct perhaps the only reason why ag stands is due to a lack of interest by vputin in any case if a falls many will likely come back here many will possibly move to seriously setting up personal shops what is the plan for tmg do you want to stay solely as a forum for knowledge and harm reduction or do you wish to add a market functionality as was once contemplated to me it seems the former is a better idea as tmg would not become a target then again perhaps just by being a contact point for vendors this place may become a target actually that is a good question do you think tmg is or ever will be a major target for le root and dns obviously have the technical know how to help vendors create websites that are robust and offer wallet wallet functionaility creating code that is easily deplorable in a pop up tentway will ensure that vendors can move around and ressurect if their sites get hacked i have an idea but it means tightening down tmg for awhile lock registration on tmg for a month help vendors set up their own custom shops create a private hidden forum member only page that has links to vendors hidden non public shops the point is to not make vendors shops locations public existing members can share the links with discrimination to help expand the vendors client base other option is to keep registration open for the general public but create a separate page that is only accessible by an email pm invite that way forum mods admins can decide who gets to access vendors private shops the general public can still order through vendors via pm but it will allow the vendors to call the shots and screen as necessary the point of all this is to really secure this place weed out our enemies and help the vendors tostay safe and far away from bad clients in scammers le irresponsible idiots i think we have a great community here but is everyone on the same page i dont think we will ever be able to truly weed out our enemies we have to always make the assumption that there are members of tmg who are trying to phish scam and attempt to pin down and de anonymize us all but i think over time if the right measures are taken the number ofbad eggs can be minimized for the most part i think tmg has done well to reach that ideal on another note openbazzar is loking to be quite promising possibly an answer to all of the problems associated with the current centralized dnm model thanks for reading . for more vendor specific shops onion domains for more decentralized dealstmg might not be a target now but you never know what the future could bring consider all your posts and pms to be read by le sooner or later as jor stated before encrypt all sensitive information and don t give away too much unnecessary information also i wouldn t trust agora too much it could be a honeypot as well be safe brothers on your tug goal thingy my preference goes to individual contact with vendors and this is were tmg could help as it always did bring buyers and sellers together and provide a forum for feedback and comparison between different vendors right now it s rather hard to compare all the different deals and filter out the rather low number of active and honest vendors from the ones mia . for more vendor specific shops onion domains for more decentralized dealstmg might not be a target now but

putin but in sure he has no love for american dea or fbi and is not likely to cooperate i doubt anyone knows for sure where ag is hasted i also doubt they can take it down if they were able to they would have done it by now agora and evo are the two major markets standing and by a darwinian process the weak ones have fallen by the wayside sr was a swam waiting to fall apart sr is even more a scam avoid sr like the plague i believe agora will remain standing for many years or until the owners get tired of doing it and retire i think also evo will be strong we must constantly find new venues to buy or sell because the old ones close or get shut downim a vendor on agora and i use good opsec i use pgp and do not trade or do any face to face meetings by trade i mean i do not accept goods in exchange for other goods i only accept bitcoin i have built up a rep on bmr and agora in new on evo and very new here but hope to be seen as a top quality vendor everywhere i go i done sell anything that is high on their list no weapons no cocaine or heroin mostly just spore prints and seeds they dont even want me but just to be safe i follow good proceduresi have a lot of trouble seeing the letters we are supposed to type before posting they are blue on a blue background anyone else have a problem with it . warning i tend to ramble and this is just a brainstorm please bear with me it seems vendors may not have a place to vend anymore soon sr fell because destined to fall thanks to inside setup run by a greedy person who apparently never watched goodfellas and flashed his tesla around town the ag team might be on the ball they may not have an insider running the show but what if they do what if the feds are now running ag and all the vendors have been compromise and are working with le think about it le kills all the sites until only one remains then everyone flocks to the last one standing then le just lets that site run like normal slowly infiltrating and arresting vendors and so on just a speculation on the other hand i think le just wants to kill all the sites and had le been able to take down ag they would have if that is the case then ag is apparently not being run by idiots and is not internally compromise ag is also being hasted out of russia if i am correct perhaps the only reason why ag stands is due to a lack of interest by vputin in any case if a

what s at which top also why did they stop to appear at some point . if your s at the top has a line through it you wont see them . theres only a thin line between proper precaution and paranoia im not sure where youre at at the moment right now it is not known how the government agencies identified the hidden services on tor did those agencies deanonymize tor we dont know is tor still safe we dont know is there a future for darknetmarkets you guessed it we dont know what in sure about is the fact that fud always works and even though the government forces have vast resources certainly not unending its the simple tactics that work best i guess it still is way safer to use tor than the www its just to easy to identify a person when using the www sure it depends on the certain laws on data preservation in your country but in guess that its easier than deanonymizing tor users maybe i p will be the next big step time will tell maybe the darknetmarkets got too much attention lately on the other hand i also think that there still is some drug trading on usenet there will always be a way to get drugs via the internet maybe can stop tor maybe they can mass surveil the www but and that in sure of they cant halt communications in general youre right encryption is our trumpcard not the means of communication by the way the term darknet can also refer to usenet i p etc its not only tor services always keep in mind we were never safe just another illusion we fall for what we do is illegal in most countries i think the perception of many darknet users has changed significantly in the beginning everything seemed to be a venture and we knew it inhibited risk with the enormous rise of the silkroad the perception changed many people came and thought wow this is like amazon i mean amazon made for the masses a few years ago we were a relatively small community that being said we still need people who venture but nowadays you have to be way more cautious stay safe everyone . newbie here trying to keep catch up on information about the dark net which i have just become aware of and interested in i am just a small fish and doubt i will be getting any attention from big brother but i would like to try to stay connected if tor tails becomes an enviable alternative i will be at a loss as how to proceed and have a couple of questions what i m sure about is the fact that fud always works what is fed on the other hand i also think that there still is some drug trading on sent what is the usenet and where can i find reliable information on how to setup and use it ps how does this quote function work on this forum not essential but would be nice to know pss one more newbie stupid and not really essential question i have tried to add an avatar to my profile no matter how small i make it it still says it is too large or not an avatar any suggestions thanks . don t laugh if it is not obvious already then these posts plus the olympus arrests shud indicate something fact is this govt forces have unending resources and money to spend on cracking software getting and deploying day sploits and so on they will not cease it s sad really that these pigheaded patty fat heads wan na disrupt our peaceful trades all because of some conditioned beliefs that it is leading to social misfits and human casualties but that is the case and it s sad to say but when it comes time to be judged in a courtroom you as a human does not matter they do not see you whether you are genuinely a good person all carefree tree hugging love due family oriented no none of that all they see is the law and that you broke the law means you get punished under those laws that being said i don t think it is safe to use any dnms anymore encryption is literally our sword it and the www is the sole means by which we are protected from mass surveillance use it if we have to resort to pm based comm with vendors so be it i m sure the extra effort is still worth it albeit more tedious we can thank the lsda and dnms for being a great platform to find trustworthy sourcesand build this amazzing community but now it is time to batten down the hatches i am suggesting that all active and rated vendors post their office contact details in one place i ll make a thread we need to prepare for the absolute worst case scenario that even forums like tmg are going to be shut down that the

are safe tho i m still worried about jc . regardless if le can see this shit or not can find us or not theres nothing wrong with using tor it gets back to the basics get busted with drugs and your in trouble get busted with a large stack of money that is linked to you and you have drugs you get busted using tor is not the issue getting caught with illegal stuff is work on your security and keep a clean house and keep your mouth shut should they come a knocking they would have to shut down tor p k and every other source of interent to stop this than again we would be living in north korea . tor

would be living in north korea . magicmountain yeah maybe i have crossed the line into paranoia idk and your right we sorta got in that cozy comfort zone and this shorta shit rattles ya abit it s a wakeup call these fukers r serious lives are at stake i mean sitting in a cell for yrs aint my kind way of living sappaloth yeah that s the confirmation attack method that the tor crew knows about es you do not have to ever worry your fucking smile will just puddle any le into giggle submissionbut yeah man ur right always be tidy and don t talk but here s the deal as a buyer of xyz i don t give a fuk acid is so er to hide liquid shit i can put it on anything and for personal amounts search my apt go on have at it pigs i mean really have fun like literally have every single page of my thousands of books tested for lsd i m more concerned for the vendors and it does matter allot if tor is not working right i mean ok so it s some crazy hard hack that requires timing and analysis and some other weird condition but le has the time and money and super computers and some eber l t haxors too boot and will keep trying they will wait for the stars to allign the perfect killing conditions what if all the tor nodes are being scooped up by le point is they will figure out a way to deanonymize you and if you are a big vendor who is considered some major threat they might point all their attention at you they might have a slew of people that just spend his day just trying to find you so i hope to the cosmos that any of you vendors are not keeping stock any way remotely close to where you live or use a pc to access dnms i would be keeping pip keys encrypted private keys hidden maybe even embedded in jpg files or something never have large sums of cash laying around etcsupposing le has traced back to you suppose they know when you are logged into dnms and from where they got you so good they can sit and wait till your on puter sitting cozy with a beer logged into a dnm handling orders etcassume your house is clean is having a vendor account with a long history of buyer reviews pms that seem to imply that you have had shocked and shipped illicit substances etcis that incriminating even if you don t have any drugs i would think so i mean charlie manson never actually killed anyone but he s serving life so maybe i m paranoid maybe i m not maybe i m just being really concerned that a shitstorm is brewing and some of my friends are gon na get popped no one wants to see that happen so whatever have fun people not trying to bust up the party or be a buzzkill i think we are all on the same page vendors stay safe be righteous always opsec before anything else live long and prosperous party on gayne acid . this thread is a good read and thank you for the links sillywabbit i know sillywabbit can come off as paranoid or over the top but safety and freedom is no laughing matter you can pinpoint a hidden service rather easily using a none takeover and server vectoring i think for the most part they were able to hit all the low hanging fruit and sagged all servers that were not properly fire walled and hidden within the server stay safe and use pgp . i have faith in root and what he s doing i haven t had faith in the marketplaces since sr went down but root has proved time and time again that he knows what he s doing along with the rest of the staff here so my faith is in root and tmg . ya know to you bd you are right bro lets show them we are not afraid now tip toe away done wake the dragon ooops oh dear i love you too ruddy stay safe . magicmountain yeah maybe i have crossed the line into paranoia idk and your right we sorta got in that cozy comfort zone and this shorta shit rattles ya abit its a wakeup call these fukers r serious

fucking smile will just puddle any le into giggle submissionbut yeah man ur right always be tidy and done talk but heres the deal as a buyer of xyz i dont give a fuk acid is so er to hide liquid shit i can put it on anything and for personal amounts search my apt go on have at it pigs i mean really have fun like literally have every single page of my thousands of books tested for lsd im more concerned for the vendors and it does matter allot if tor is not working right i mean ok so its some crazy hard hack that requires timing and analysis and some other weird condition but le has the time and money and super computers and some eber l t haxors too boot and will keep trying they will wait for the stars to allign the perfect killing conditions what if all the tor nodes are being scooped up by le point is they will figure out a way to deanonymize you and if you are a big vendor who is considered some major threat they might point all their attention at you they might have a slew of people that just spend his day just trying to find you so i hope to the cosmos that any of you vendors are not keeping stock any way remotely close to where you live or use a pc to access dnms i would be keeping pip keys encrypted private keys hidden maybe even embedded in jpg files or something never have large sums of cash laying around etcsupposing le has traced back to you suppose they know when you are logged into dnms and from where they got you so good they can sit and wait till your on puter sitting cozy with a beer logged into a dnm handling orders etcassume your house is clean is having a vendor account with a long history of buyer reviews pms that seem to imply that you have had shocked and shipped illicit substances etcis that incriminating even if you dont have any drugs i would think so i mean charlie manson never actually killed anyone but hes serving life so maybe in paranoid maybe im not maybe im just being really concerned that a shitstorm is brewing and some of my friends are gon na get popped no one wants to see that happen so whatever have fun people not trying to bust up the party or be a buzzkill i think we are all on the same page vendors stay safe be righteous always opsec before anything else live long and prosperous party on gayne acid . as bd says regardless of the events transpiring it is always good to take a break and update your security this takedown has served as a reminder for a lot of people to do that . ya know to you bd you are right bro lets show them we are not afraid now tip toe away don t wake the dragon ooops oh dear i love you too ruddy stay safe . honestly i feel this whole thread is fed look if this were the case why would we have so many other marketplaces still up if they could employ the same methods they used to take down sr and those places associated with sr or the same server setup or whatever either way agoras still up other marketplaces are still up you cant say agra wasnt on their radar either if they had the option and ability to do it they would have shut every single marketplace down that they could obviously tor is helping in some sort of way dont get me wrong im down for the next thing to come up to help better keep us safe and secure cause in sure tor has its flaws but until then this is what we got and we have to make due with that for now the bust of sr should not be this big of a deal its a huge deal but it was expected look at how they ran the place dont get me wrong in sure blake was a great guy and all but they had an undercover working with them from the very start it was going to come crashing down eventually and thank god it did and ill get to that this is a huge wake up call to everyone and should be treated as such those who slip up are going to get caught and they will do anything to get you to slip up so done slip up and this whole ordeal is a reminder why my heart goes out to those who are probably going to be imprisoned for the rest of their lives its really sad that our governments are doing this all around the world to people when weve created a way to access the substances we want without harming anyone else or going out on the street weve taken the violence out of the equation as well the violence is coming from them the governments the police the feds those cracking down on what we are doing if anything we should all keep using dams and show them this isnt going to scare us i love you all . thanks root i know you are l t h x r for sure and thats why tmg will stand proud always as sanctuary so in your honest opinion tor is still secure so long as site admins and users use good hardening of their os and software bd and some others made valid points too that ag and evo would be down already had they had not been as robust im just worried about being the unfortunate one who on the day i move funds to a market and place an order the site goes down that sun hard and i know many have suffered this plight also root from what i got here is that for a dnm to survive tor is not enuf the servers must be secured in other ways as well what about the vendors anonymity assuming servers are hacked cant they trace the vendors real ip from a hacked server by reading various data comparing login logout times traffic analysis etc i mean in sure their is plenty of useful data a vendor has to leave behind just to do their daily grind so even if all communication is encrusted that is not needed to pinpoint where a given vendor is operating from right but i will make a comforting assumption that so long as some of the admins are on the ball they would know if something is up with their own servers if their is a up in the midst but apparently defcon was not on the ball joyriding his tesla ignorance is not always bliss sometimes it means a cold cell and bland food and less than obliged sex time with someone ok i have a little bit more faith now i guess . honestly i feel this whole thread is fed look if this were the case why would we have so many other marketplaces still up if they could employ the same methods they used to take down sr and those places associated with sr or the same server setup or whatever either way agora s

havent had faith in the marketplaces since sr went down but root has proved time and time again that he knows what hes doing along with the rest of the staff here so my faith is in root and tmg . honestly its probably good a few of these vendors take a break and take a closer look at their operation to ensure they arent the next ones to be busted its always good to take a step back and check all that shit so judas to bv and hos for doing that its much needed . honestly it s probably good a few of these vendors take a break and take a closer look at their operation to ensure they aren t

more faith now i guess . this thread is a good read and thank you for the links sillywabbit i know sillywabbit can come off as paranoid or over the top but safety and freedom is no laughing matter you can pinpoint a hidden service rather easily using a none takeover and server vectoring i think for the most part they were able to hit all the low hanging fruit and sagged all servers that were not properly fire walled and hidden within the server stay safe and use pgp . as bd says regardless of the events transpiring it is always good to take a break and update your security this takedown has served as a reminder for a lot of people to do that . thank you root for the very clear and concise info wow i did not multibit needed udp i stopped using it awhile back thanks for the link i ll see if i can set that up quote from root on november pm no if they want a vendor then they will start buying from them and do their work tracking back the envelope i am pretty sure that s how they got of the vendors to date right and that s why vendors with good opsec do not ship out of their area where they live and they often use anonymous blue boxes i guess le could start monitoring blue boxes in suspected areas and start profiling the letters that get dropped in them but that s a shot in the dark i don t want to mention specific methods of stealth here then again i m sure le has seen them all and is learning every day but led dmt anything that is super light and small and can be pressed flat will almost never get flagged anyway so buyers are likely pretty safe in most cases domestic packages afaik need a warrant to be opened and suspected stuff coming through customs is another story i think all bets are off there lastly i think vendors with good opsec keep a very good distance from themselves their stock and where they ship from so even if le can trace a package to it s source what is the most they can glean that some packages being dropped in some city have had drugs in them if the shippers are in on the operation and work out of a let shipping house then it is even better playing devils advocate here le buys some drugs from vendor they can trace the pack to a specific bluebox in a city where it was dropped i m just guessing with letter timestamps and blue box pickup times they would at most be able to conclude that it was dropped between some pick up times that s a range of a few hours so perhaps with street cams they could piece together who dropped it and try to use some racial recognition software and pin a specific person eh this just seems so far fetched now ha they d have a better shot if the shipper was dropping at a post office then there are cameras andmaybe a shot at figuring out who is dropping drugs but if a vendor is doing that they are likelyjust having a friend or family member do the drops again layers of distance between product and vendor changing stealth pack designs switching up drop routes changing shippers all will serve to protectthe vendors the most important thing is to never have a traceable link to the stock or the vendor who is using the dnm if all of the measures are taken correctly the worst that could happen isa shipper gets popped with packages that contain drugs i m sure a good lawyer and a plausible deniability argument could get someone off on a charge esp if that person is truly removed from any dim activity and has a clean record work history etc then again it is kind hard to explain why one is walking around with packages that have drugs in them i don t know that might be a lucky situation . i do not believe le will close all of the darkmarkets my reasoning is because they themselves are using the same tools sold on those markets what they feed us is lies i ve seen evidence of this myself they can not hack themselves into a paperbag . thank you root for the very clear and concise info wow i did not multibit needed udp i stopped using it awhile back thanks for the link ill see if i can

much smaller they took out a few other very small markets but not the big guys why the obvious answer is they did what they could and what they couldnt do they ignored sr had circus a uc who was on the staff and doxed them many of the other markets were on the same server so once they find one they look for all sites hasted on that server some of the markets and sites may simply have had sloppy

but it s still the best thing we have current it s a whole lot harder to track down a specific user of a hidden service then it is to track down the service itself there are a few ways to throw of vectoring but it looks like there were a good amount of markets that didn t learn how to do that here is a link to a walk through that will help you set up a guest operating system hidden behind tor this will only allow it to communicate through tcp and block all udp that may leak your info it s great to use to find out what applications will not work without up multibit once a sever has been seized by the feds they will go through and look for vendors that have purchasing account s and find where they made a mistake but the only ip address that get s logged by the server is the loop back the amount of resources needed to do a time analyses on a widely used marketplace is too much effort for little return and not worth it to find one drug dealer no if they want a vendor then they will

much diff to a cryptanalyst who just sees double encryption as a composed function y f g x still the same techniques to crack the code input you raise some excellent points as to the usefulness of double encryption i would argue that superencryption or superenciperment as it used to be called was practiced excessively by the united states the former society union and others the idea was to make it as difficult as possible for an opponent to even attempt to crack the cipher the idea behind advocating for its use here is to avoid potential implementation bugs in the bitmessage crypto if the

narcissistic when i think that the police are after me i mean sure the cops like to fuck with people like us take down the bust here and there but i m sure that there are far more visible people out there doing much more wrong that are easier to catch and are much stupider about their business but really who am i to the letter gangs nobody i m sure they d love to intercept a package if i ever got packages that is and bust down my door over it but until they do i seriously doubt they even know i exist small fuckin potatoes . if they want to get you they will doesnt even matter if you have the best password if your computer that your checking your pgp messages on is in anyway connected to the internet you can still be sucked if they throw a keylogger on your computer your password doesnt really matter then theres the being identified as going on tor through your is maybe everyone on tor can have their addresss flagged then theres the mailing system where every single piece of mail gets photograph if quartus computing gets into their hands god knows what they would really be able to do that is the point where it truly gets horrifying remember before the govt brainwashed a shitload of people as terroristz hate us cuz of our freedomz now look at all the over reaching the govt has been doing the cin torture report bankers bailouts i mean luck i just look at the majority of govt politicians s and realize that holy luck alot of these people are just plain out psychopaths but then again in no security expert so i may just be talking out my ass . if they want to get you

idiot i had encrusted my windows partition with diskcryptor the other night i decided to install ubuntu and i made such a mistake i did not back up the headers and i did not decrypt the windows partition before installing ubuntu during the ubuntu install there was a red flag the windows partition was listed as unknown ie it is encrusted i don t know what was in my head but for some reason i was confident that grub would not overwrite the diskcryptor loader so now i have this beautiful linux running and the rest of my hdd is inaccessible it s all there justan encrypted blow anyway ideas i m hoping that the decryption keys are on that partition and all i need to do is be able to run the diskcryptor program mount that partition and decrypt it as i have the password written down i have a solution sort of move the entire windows partition to an external drive that has a windows installation and then go from there but i don t have any windows disks or any working windows around diskcryptor and wine don t seem to work together well do i even need diskcryptor in many ways i m glad to be forced out of windows linux offers better tools more security more options and gets me back into a coder mindset i swear i have lost some braincells since using windows every day for over a year anyway thank you for your help folks yes i know i am a complete dufus and all but sometimes we

technology gets better it may make it easier for leo s to go after all types of people after all even if it s small time buyers who knows where the arrests may lead to plus for leo it makes big headlines especially with their asinine costs of drugs i m torn with being silent or spoken out psychedelic use i understand the dangers of speaking about it in public but at the same time i m a good person and i would say the biggest part in that was due to psychedelics so it s like if none of us ever speak up about the good sides about psychedelics how are we ever going to get a dialogue about understanding what they are about instead of the generic bad trip stories or the are you tripping balls and colors type shit even though i have stopped worrying alot about what others think yesterday once again i was told the only reason i was happy was cause of my psychedelic usage it s not the first time i ve been told this but every time i just sit dumbfounded yeah i took something that changed me from a negative mindset to a happy one then lsd mushrooms told me to get into buddhism that lead to me finally being incredibly happy for once in my life and now it s somehow not good or real but if i had been happy due to sports yoga religion or anything else it s somehow more valid or real i always get the same reply well that s different sometimes i really don t know if i m somewhat just marginally smart or if i am a complete idiot understand things in the wrong ways my work mode has skyrocketed since my first small ketamine dose from the other week i wonder if all that work would now have been shoved off if i said it was due to the ketamine dose lol so back to security sillywabbit you also need to remember that the computer isn t the only thing to worry about you also have to keep in mind your telephone any type of webcam connected to the internet they can be turned on without your knowledge so that s another thing to remember the other thing is like you said talking about psychedelics to people in public all it takes is one friend to mention it to someone else who knows if a person gets arrested they may drop your name to leo yeah it s paranoid i guess but i m just listing some of the other ways to get busted since you need to sorta focus on everything or you can just say fuck it go on with the best security you can do love life others but most of all be a reflection of what you want the world to be . yeah at the local level it s really stupid kids that run their mouth they might get popped but for the most part the avg buyer is safe however my concern sithe possibility that encryption systems are readable bits is crazy long that is possible keys just counting them would take a long time let alone testing them and then the passwords that protect the keys a characters of symbols is also a major effort to bruteforce so until the quartus computers start cracking i don t worry too much aboutor encryption now and hopefully the code makers can keep up with the code breakers but i d hope that someday we can transcend all of this privacy issues end drug prohibition and be open and free in our dealings just think of all the hassles we go through here just so that we can spread medicines and talk about our experiences with them without fear of criticism the biggest fear is rootkits like regin that any commercial sold hardware particularly routers andmodems that can be rigged to log packets and send them to nsa or that can drop rootkits that own your system everything is logged keystrokes then there is no privacy but here s an idea have two computers one used to encrypt messages and is always offline the other only goes online when sending encrusted data and no us drives are inserted while online this way even if hardware is monitoring your data that data will always be encrusted of course this would only work for pip messages not jebusite usernames login passwords etcso i don t know how effective this would be just an idea knuckles your we re sucked no matter what is not just paranoia it is valid concern but i think scroat has a point small time buyers are hump change and will likely never be target unless one is careless the people in my area who have gotten popped for dmt lsd etc were kids teento s who were talking way to much starting to draw a scene particularly with dmt which i don t know how or why but is being used by kids as a party drug which is not a good thingfor it s reputation many ignorant people compare dat to crystal meth because many use a meth pipe to vape it sad but true i think the whole rave edom scene is hurting the psychedelic community it casts the image that these medicines are just party drugs like coke or ketamine which are also not necessarily party only drugs but that is the stigma that holds insociety . yeah at the local level its really stupid kids that run their mouth they might get popped but for the most part the avg buyer is safe however my concern sithe possibility that

increased productivity was a result of ketamine use well those people are brainwashed self righteous twits tell them when they are dragging at work and about to make a drunken run to not cheat that they need to rely on their own willpower its the same attitude perpetuated in society this false belief that everything we need is what is on the shelf or on a rx scripts that if its not sold on tv or in a pharmacy then its bad and illegal drugs are bad and on and on yes in careful who i share my views with asp people who are government workers psychiatrists medical staff many of these people are absolutely afraid of psychedelics and have very biased views of note recently a nurse who was treating me shared stories about people coming in bad trips and that you psychonauts have no idea what you are doing to your brains you dont see the cases i see these drugs are bad news buddy and i just laughed they only see one side yeah allot of ignorant people trip unprepared and go berserk andthen cops get called in and ship gets all spun out usually the bad trip gets worse because cops and medical staff have zero skills in dealing with a person who is having ego death anxiety likely end up tazing and clubbing you or screaming at you its so sucked man im not so worried about getting stuffed in a cell i will do my best to stay on the dl but if it all comes down to me sitting in a courtroom to defend my right to use sacraments i willfight the fight and if i end up imprisoned i wont change my view nor my spiritual practice if i could no longer access sacraments from inside a cell i would just eat as little as possible meditate and accept my isolation try to spread love with all those i encounter and be happy that i can still breathe things will be what they will be if that is apart of my life trip then so be it immortality can not be denied from anyone we all merge back into the life stream have a great day folks spead love every moment . hey knuckles so if people were to discount

could lead to a self awakening at many raves it just seemed like everyone was about just getting d up but then maybe thats their way of tuning in even if that is north goal and yeah i def think lsd is a steep ladder to self realization and just one of many means to achieving it sun night i tripped with a friend and saw a side of him that made me nearly boot him from my apt but we ended up hugging in the end he has serious mental issues and i think the acid makes it worse because hes notwilling to accept the trip or he just acts like a complete buffoon i dont know but we will eat paper again together because we are sure it is progress and i want us to be raw and real even if it means rolling around in the dirt abit its not a game its not always giggles sometimes its nasty and hurtful and the truth comes out and the pain is worst when we deny the truth you all stay let be you acid . scroat for your well formed and lucid points i never looked at it that way i guess a recklass

videos post your comments my grandparents after hearing through the family grapevine that i have taken led sent me a very stern email with this web link at the bottom and a last note of we only tell you because we love you and are so afraid for your life your sanity right now their sympathy for me and fear of lsd is genuine it s almost comical ever since they heard that when over the phone with me they speak to me as if i amin a recitative state it s crazy i have to say why are you suddenly talking to me r e e e e a a a a l l y sloooooooooow liiiiiiiiike thiiiiiiiiiiiis and they just respond well because sweetie you drank that bad koolaid or whatever ya know and you re not the same anymore we just want you to understand but we still love you i almost hurled never mind the fact that i play in a quartet hold a few side jobs am a member of abstract gaming league routine attend lectures on it and am involved with various civil groups and a member of this gamesome community all of these require me to listen to others and think incoherently and present ideas in a logical fashion i don t get it they tripped me out with that shit more than acid ever did i mean am i really that fucked now hahahahahaha yes i made it into the funny farm woohoo anyway and then i checked out their link wow this site is incredible in it s rather very straight forward and well presented way of completely misrepresenting led watch the documentary in many ways i agree lsd is very dangerous for most modern just say no type people but only due to a lack of support lack of a healthy philosophy about drugs i don t doubt many of the bad experiences these people hadon lsd they were likely expecting a joy ride and panicked when things did not feel right there is no doubt that lsd can and will flip your notion of reality upside down but this video is purely one sided and only presents a group which had difficult experiences for all we know the editors groomed them on what not to talk about i bet allot of these people tripped allot and burned out over did it and then instead of taking resposibility for their actions blamed their bad choices on the lsdand went on some anti led warpath i dunno it s just hoglah purely contrived bs to scare people off from dabbling with acid again for many that might be good advice i m just still surprised at the number of people who have these bad trips most people i ve talked to say something similar to acid was gamesome everything looked and felt beautiful i laughed allot and learned allot about myself and how i relate to this world and it s inhabitants i ve come to a conclusion about people and led people who are not comfortable letting go or are unwilling to deal with inner traumas when they surface will likely have very bad and possibly careful experiences with lsd without a doubt every single person interviewed in this video took lsd in a purely recreation context they were just looking for a thrill and when they got onto the hr carnival ride that won t stop and realized that it will not just stop they freaked out just had to post this as this is the classic sort of yellow journalism that is brainwashing people and preventing any kind of progress in society it is actually insulting it assumes that people are ignorant and should not properly educated it assumes that most people are irresponsible and can t make good healthy choices apparently my grandparents assumed that about me maybe they are right i think we all ate allot of acid this summer am i a total goof ball yes i was one long before i dropped acid sigh i dunno well i figured you d all get a laugh out of this i did have an gamesome day lmao your post is gamesome halah acid cooks your brain it will not expand your mind i mean you aren t eating and you re not drinking it s terrible woah just noah thanks for posting that for the great laugh . quote from sillywabbit on october amal dr check out the web link and watch the videos post your comments my

are so afraid for your life your sanity right nowtheir sympathy for me and fear of lsd is genuine its almost comical ever since they heard that when over the phone with me they speak to me as if i amin a recitative state its crazy i have to say why are you suddenly talking to me r e e e e a a a a l l y sloooooooooow liiiiiiiiike thiiiiiiiiiiiis and they just respond well because sweetie you drank that bad koolaid or whatever ya know and youre not the same anymore we just want you to understand but we still love you i almost hurled never mind the fact that i play in a quartet hold a few side jobs am a member of abstract gaming league routine attend lectures on it and am involved with various civil groups and a member of this gamesome community all of these require me to listen to others and think incoherently and present ideas in a logical fashion i dont get it they tripped me out with that shit more than acid ever did i mean am i really that fucked now hahahahahaha yes i made it into the funny farm woohoo anyway and then i checked out their link wow this site is incredible in its rather very straight forward and well presented way of completely misrepresenting led watch the documentary in many ways i agree lsd is very dangerous for most modern just say no type people but only due to a lack of support lack of a healthy philosophy about drugs i dont doubt many of the bad experiences these people hadon lsd they were likely expecting a joy ride and panicked when things did not feel right there is no doubt that lsd can and will flip your notion of reality upside down but this video is purely one sided and only presents a group which had difficult experiences for all we know the editors groomed them on what not to talk about i bet allot of these people tripped allot and burned out over did it and then instead of taking resposibility for their actions blamed their bad choices on the lsdand went on some anti led warpath i dunno its just hogwash purely contrived bs to scare people off from dabbling with acid again for many that might be good advice im just still surprised at the number of people who have these bad trips most people ive talked to say something similar to acid was gamesome everything looked and felt beautiful i laughed allot and learned allot about myself and how i relate to this world and its inhabitants give come to a conclusion about people and led people who are not comfortable letting go or are unwilling to deal with inner traumas when they surface will likely have very bad and possibly careful experiences with lsd without a doubt every single person interviewed in this video took lsd in a purely recreation context they were just looking for a thrill and when they got onto the hr carnival ride that wont stop and realized that it will not just stop they freaked out just had to post this as this is the classic sort of yellow journalism that is brainwashing people and preventing any kind of progress in society it is actually insulting it assumes that people are ignorant and should not properly educated it assumes that most people are irresponsible and cant make good healthy choices apparently my grandparents assumed that about me maybe they are right i think we all ate allot of acid this summer am i a total goof ball yes i was one long before i dropped acid sigh i dunno well i figured youd all get a laugh out of this i did have an gamesome day lmao your post is gamesome halah acid cooks your brain it will not expand your mind i mean you rent eating and youre not drinking its terrible woah just noah thanks for posting that for the great laugh . huge thanks to spitfire who sent me a very information and enlightening lecture on why i need to update my pgp keys apparently i was not using current standards and did not have a subkey and was even isinglass secure sha to sign messages so i did create a new key pair and in so doing learned allot about using gpg from the commandline andabout the different options including symmetry encryption which is quite nice ok here is my new key pub r ff f of created expires never usage s trust ultimate validity ultimatesub r f ea b created expires never usage e sub r d created expires never usage s ultimate sillywabbit a i created a revocation certificate and exported the secret keys to an encrusted us drive now here is my issue s how do i delete the main key the one ending in ef so i just have the two subkeys my understanding is one wants to have a master set consisting of main key for sc and a subkey for e then make another set using the same subkey for e and another new subkeyfor s but if i try to edit the key i can only delete the subkeys not the main key pub also does each subkey have their own public private part ie when i give out my public key it s always the one for the master key pub and say i revoke the e subkey must i notice people who use my key ie does the public key change it would appear not if my main key stays the same and all i am doing is revoking the olde subkey and adding a new one sorry if i seem like a dunce i am utterly confused and i hope spitfire offers comment thanks . huge thanks to
