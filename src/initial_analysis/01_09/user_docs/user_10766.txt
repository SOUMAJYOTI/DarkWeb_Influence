about the attack described in this video or at this page attack relies on knowing the in address of the box you wish to flood because you have to forge packets as coming from the address unless you are have a list of ip that you suspect to host a hidden service and beat on them to see which one causes the hidden service to go down . no hidden services dont use the globe domain name system and ip addressing heres a list of denial of service attacks are the attacks that hidden services are probably vulnerable to asymmetry of resource utilization in starvation attacks permanent denial of service attacks application level floods http post ddos attack r u dead yet rudy slow read attack distributed attack although this is harder over tor these are the attacks the hidden services are not vulnerable to icmp flood because tor doesnt carry imp packets syn flood because tor clients only keep circuits when tcp streams are fully formed teardrop attack modern oses are not vulnerable peer to peer attacks duke again because of icmp reflected spoiled attack what you asked about doesnt work because rendezvous circuits are not routed through normal dens resolution and ip addressing . amplification attacks are incredibly effective asymmetric attacks but as owockeznan said they have to be aimed at a legitimate notable public ip address i bet theyd work just dandy against an introduction point for a hidden service or any other key relay in the chain that an attacker could identify but again theyd have to be aimed at a public ip the only catch is that to launch them you really need a box on a network with decent bandwidth that doesnt have egress filtering since the attack is rascally just tricking a million remote hosts into sending responses whether dns ntp or other connectionless protocols to the target system by spoofing requests from the target not incidentally many providers have rapidly implements egress filtering over the past year only real defense short term is to try to filter the attacks out stream since theyre all coming from legitimate ass all over the place you cant really filter them out based on anything other than destination port long term a
