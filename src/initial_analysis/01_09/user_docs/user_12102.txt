quote from kirondelinews on october pmhi jigsaw your detailed answer is quite welcome and i praise you about it thank youmaybe i wasnt enough clear in my initials post but i have already an encrusted volume stored on a small sd card and i have been using it for more than years to keep records of all the important thing pgp keys dnm addresses a few useful notes i only need when browsing with tails thats why i was asking about storing the btc wallet on that s card cause i dont use it so many times when im browsing i keep the main dnm addresses in my mind and my impossible to remember passwords are written on plain paper and so i find it safer than a persistent volume cause the latter although encrusted is still plugged all the time to the computer when browsing with tails theres also the question of device lifetime the less you plug it the more time it will function im also a little bit afraid about the tails auto plate im afraid that an update could erase the persistent volume once i had a tails auto update that went wrong and i couldnt use the us flash anymore after that it could have been a material issue us flash dead but i really do not like the idea to store my data within

afraid that an update could erase the persistent volume once i had a tails auto update that went wrong and i couldnt use the us flash anymore after that it could have been a material issue us flash dead but i really do not like the idea to store my data within the same us flash that i use to boot the computer so that why i have always given my preferences to a separate encrusted storage volume and i would really prefer to stay attached with that method only if possible to store there my btc wallet thank you for all your answer jigsawwish you a happy day . quote from kirondelinews on october pmhi everybody im absolutely not new to the dnms but next time ill try direct sale trade with a vendor at the majestic garden i guess im going to use electrum embedded in tails to proceed to the payments but im a little bit scared about the errors i could do i boot tails with us flash but i didnt coniure persistent volume and im not really fond of that option i clearly prefer to opt for a small s card as my storage device so st question is it of to use electrum even if i dont enable persistence at the launch of electrum tails advises me it is strongly recommended to only run electric

is that correct how much fee should i give to the btc network to proceed to my transactions for example what you guys are you giving many thanks for your answers cheersquote so st question is it of to use electrum even if i dont enable persistence at the launch of electrum tails advises me it is strongly recommended to only run electric when its persistence feature is actuated youl need to configure a persistent volume if you intend on storing pip keys bookmarks or copies of market forum urls so you dont get wished one day pidgin settings electric wallet settings including all the bitcoin addresses current stored in your wallet plus a variety of other options for you to choose from go to applications tails configure persistent volume then tick any options you want to keep stored in the persistent volume encrypted before tails shuts down after each session more details found here following step tails tells me electrum could not find an existing wallet what do you want to do create new wallet restore an existing wallet from its seed create a watching only version of an existing wallet simple answer is nothing unless the bitcoin option isnt wicked in the persistence wizard as described to you in the first answer above then your electrum wallet will still be on your tails us under applications internet electrum bitcoin wallet just forget the other questions about the electrum wallet because theyre irrelevant quote when i have created my wallet i now want to send funds to my wallet the btc addresses i should use are the ones under receive tab main account receiving addresses got addresses there am i right yes quote concerning the saving of my wallet i just have to go under file then save copy save it on my device and keep a written copy of my wallet seed is it enough or should i also export my private keys to my storage device no you dont have to do anything other than what give already said in the first answer its entirely up to you but the more you have that would enable you to restore your wallet should anything ever happen stored away and encrypted the better off youll be quote when my btc vendor has proceeded to the sending of the funds in my wallet and when i saved my wallet i can close it and sundown tails before they show up in my wallet is that correct once the transaction has been sent to the network you can shut tails down and open it again in a months time if you want regardless of any time frames yes your coins will still be there ready to use quote how much fee should i give to the btc network to proceed to my transactions for example what you guys are you giving youre rascally required to give btc each time you process a transaction which actually speeds up the entire process for you anyway . quote from kirondelinews on october pmhi jigsaw your detailed answer is quite welcome and i praise you about it thank youmaybe i wasnt enough clear in my initials post but i have already an encrusted volume stored on a small sd card and i have been using it for more than years to keep records of all the important thing pgp keys dnm addresses a few useful notes i only need when browsing with tails thats why i was asking about storing the btc wallet on that s card cause i dont use it so many times when im browsing i keep the main dnm addresses in my mind and my impossible to remember passwords are written on plain paper and so i find it safer than a persistent volume cause the latter although encrusted is still plugged all the time to the computer when browsing with tails theres also the question of device lifetime the less you plug it the more time it will function im also a little bit afraid about the tails auto plate im afraid that an update could erase the persistent volume once i had a tails auto update that went wrong and i couldnt use the us flash anymore after that it could have been a material issue us flash dead but i really do not like the idea to store my data within the same us flash that i use to boot the computer so that why i have always given my preferences to a separate encrusted storage volume and i would really prefer to stay attached with that method only if possible to store there my btc wallet thank you for all your answer jigsawwish you a happy day from the sounds of your questions you dont seem to have a sound understanding of tails and whats included in each public release there is absolutely no reason for you to have your pgp keys dm curls and other sensitive info stored on a separate microsd supposed encrypted when you have the ability to store all this info securely in an encrusted using lurks persistent volume on your tails us quite frankly mate youre making your life much harder than it really has to be you also have the option of using the included pgp applet in tails which is actually capable of generating strong asa bit pip key pairs the same size keys that the very capable gpg us encryption software is capable of generating make sure you use a very strong passphrase to protect your pip private key s if youre going to continue using a separate microsd card to store this information on instead of the persistent volume on your tails device then you dont need to use the electrum wallet included with tails you could use another bitcoin client such as armory which is capable of handling all the latest multi sig transactions with ease if you intend on using this microsd to store your bitcoin wallet on then youll need to be wary of operating it over the tor network only like electrum in tails and never over the learned quote thats why i was asking about storing the btc wallet on that s card cause i dont use it so many times when im browsing i keep the main dnm addresses in my mind and my impossible to remember passwords are written on plain paper and so i find it safer than a persistent volume cause the latter although encrusted is still plugged all the time to the computer when browsing with tails theres also the question of device lifetime the less you plug it the more time it will function theres a very simple solution to your first problem pgp encrypt all your private and sensitive data including passwords passphrases etc first and then store that encrusted into inside your encrusted persistent volume on tails double the encryption for added security and peace of mind thats a much better option than physically writing things such a passwords passphrases down on paper and keeping them hidden away io if youre concerned about browsing the darknet using tails because its plugged into a pc during that time with your persistent volume open then your seriously a little paranoid there mate sit with your back against a wall in a room with one hand on your usb while browsing ready to pull it out in a flash if le burst in if your concerns are genuine but i can guarantee you that unless you come to the attention of the authorities for other reasons outside anything dw related the coppers arent going to be searching for a darknet market buyer they have yet to de annonymize simple make a copy backup of your current tails device by selecting the option to clone and parade under the tails installer that way if something ever happens to your original tails usb you have an exact copy ready to use immediately which has everything on it that your original tails us did you dont have to use the tails auto plate function you can still download a fresh copy of the latest version available and then burn it onto a dvd as an is image you then boot your pc using the tails dvd and once on the tails desktop go to applications tails tails installer clone upgrade which copies the new version of tails onto your current tails usb which is plugged in of course without touching anything else such as your persistent folder and all of its precious contents without trying to be a prick you really need to spend some time and read all about the pros and cons of using tails heres a link to the tails homepage for you from what youve told me thus far you have nothing to legitimately fear other than keeping a lid on your paranoia and applying that wasted energy into addressing any genuine security concerns you may come across . hi everybody im absolutely not new to the dnms but next time ill try direct sale trade with a vendor at the majestic garden i guess im going to use

amand i will also conclude also by that statement amen frankly jigsaw i really appreciate all the time you took to be the clearest possible you make my life easier im now using just one us stick with the persistence enabled the funny thing is that i have been using tails since version and maybe since which was older than at that time i read all i could find about tails but to tell the truth there was not so much in their website they didnt use the tails boum org domain at that time which has only been used since if in correct and i also had to collect lots on info from the now defunct sr forum and everything was not always true its also a good thing to get rid off that sd card because as you tell me i have been reading excessively tails website and it seems that my s card was encrusted with truecrypt algorithm and i completely forgot about that which is now abandoned and could be potentially not secure i laughed about the passage about me freaking out with my hand on the us stick ready to get it plugged in case le would break my door and i have to make my apologies for my late reply due to the forum downtimes last week but also to a bit of lazziness i have to confess it thanks again
