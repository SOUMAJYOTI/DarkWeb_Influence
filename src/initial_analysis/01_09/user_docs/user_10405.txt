the way the directory operates in a chased manner over the coming days and weeks we intend to start storing and displaying entries by vendor market rather than pgp key this way we ensure that key changes do not result in lots of orphan entries which is what we are starting to see the same level of information will be available but there may be some subtle differences this will mean each vendor will have a single entry generally and each market identity will have a pip key history showing previously published keys under that vendor name we also intend to stop signing vendor keys with individual market specific keys the main reason is there are just too many markets appearing we intend to use a single el presidente vendor key regardless of which market the key was extracted from we dont think this will be a problem for anyone but please do let us know if you are unhappy with that change we have just this minute finished the latest sr scrape and update and so endor feedback ratings are up to date again we have or so new vendors also and a few dozen key changes we will also shortly introduce searching by pgp key which we think will be very useful for quick key verification lastly thank you to those who have donate coin to the directory we have been able to secure a whole year of hosting costs which is excellent so thank you all from us at el presidente .

ambiguity on april well now in sure i dont have no pi middle boxes at my house and i thought the tor folks had already patched all the js exploits no offense intended but wtf are you talking about the more people that le hits with an exploit the more likely someone is to notice it the mass deployment of the fh exploit on every fh visitor guaranteed that it would be discovered so le only uses high value days on high value targets the fh exploit was a day and a majority of oh visitors were immense to it either because they had up to date browser bundles or werent in windows it was rascally a fishing expedition for the lowest hanging fruit boy talk about mixed metaphors if i were a high value target i would definitely be using physical isolation but i doubt theres any exploit theyd use against me that they wouldnt use against the masses and would quickly be discovered in not convinced at the usefulness of physical isolation for myself given the cost but thats why we build individual threat models for a pi cant break the bank you could do it all virtual for free its just about damage limitation really in the event of either a deanonymization attack on the browser or accidental self deanonymization its easy to forget to type torsocks before that ssh command etc . interesting i wonder if this was the oh exploit or another site it states that the malware would be deplored for up to days but only on logged in users i read numerous reports that the fh exploit was served to anyone who visited any site hasted on fh that kind of drive by deployment of malware on innocent people should be illegal but doesn appear to be . quote from ambiguity on april well now in sure i dont have no pi middle boxes at my house and i thought the tor folks had already patched all the js exploits

system we dont have much to add to it wifi used for one of the interfaces either we would like to see a build script than could be applied to a vanilla fresh arabian build it wouldnt be that much work for somebody quotewe have taken a slightly different approach with this in the past one that provides a little additional security at the cost of a little usability we provide it here for information it may be useful for some the fundamental difference is that rather than transparently route all traffic from the secure box and into tor we only route implicitly defined traffic the middle boxa simple tor client dual homed host really on a physical host it will have two network interfaces a public interface which connects to the internet really through a netting router or firewall and a private interface this system must be hardened because it will be able to establish arbitrary connections to the internet it will run tor in client mode and will expose the socks proxy to the private network only really it should be hard oded to connect to trusted guard nodes preferable ones that you either run or know to be safe at the least the guard nodes should be local to you in network terms this system should be configured to drop all inbound connections on the public interface regardless of any stream firewalls the system should also be configured to drop all traffic on and out on the private interface except inbound traffic to the local socks proxy port tcp or similar for good measure the middle box should also drop all outbound up traffic to the internet the private networkthis network exists purely between the middle box and the secure box really this should be a simple cross over cable which connects the two systems wireless is acceptable but the key thing is that the private network can not route anywhere other then between the middle and secure boxes and it will be carrying plain text sensitive traffic and thus must be protected from eavesdropping the private network must have no default gateway and no dns the secure boxthe key tenet of this system is that it does not know where it is or have any way of finding out where it is this system has a single network interface on the private network again there must be no default gateway no dns nothing just a simple state ip address and no more the local firewall iptables should be configured on this system to drop all inbound traffic and block all outbound traffic except outbound to the socks port on the middle box the browser on this system should be configured to use the socks proxy on the middle box if there is a requirement to use any other application other than the browser then it must implicitly be configured to use socks or failing that executed using torsocks which again will use the socks proxy on the middle box really the hostname of this system should be computer or server and only one user should be configured called user ensure the mac address of the system is modified from the hardware default at boot time really randomized each boot in terms of os anything that is non persistent is nearly always better such as tails the systems should have no microphone no camera no gps and really no wireless wlan bluetooth gam etc nothing that allows it to interact with the real world in any way except via that socks proxy when looking at the hardening of the secure box imagine you are a bad guy somewhere who has gained unrestricted access to the system and ask yourself a can you break out of it in any way that will cause you to generate network traffic that will not go through the socks port and into tor if you can then something is wrong rethink b can you extract anything from the system that provides ill identity information for instance address details that you might use to copy paste into order forms if you can find anything of value then something is wrong rethink this model can be virtualized easily enough but at the cost of some security if virtualized then make sure file sharing from guest to host is disabled shared clipboards etc the virtualization software should be configured to provide as much isolation between the guest and host systems as possible our preferred setup for this is simple and uses a rasberry pi as the middle box and an old laptop connected via a cross over ethernet cable the pi connects tirelessly to the local

site that just made the news for having been busted a year or so ago that collected videos of teenagers jacking off on webcams they called cam a lot website b from the wording of that it sounds like they didnt target casual browsers of the forum but only people who registered accounts in any case we should have expected them to do things like this the best defense is having two computers dedicated for anonymous activity one being a tor router on some secure os like openbsd and the other being a hardened system for browsing on physical isolation is the diamond standard for protecting from this sort of attack and obviously they are going to keep doing this type of attack more and more so it is time for people to rapidly start using physical isolation throw in a vm still though to hide hardware aerial numbers another technique to protect from attacks like this is to use virtual machine based isolation by itself you can also protect from attacks like this with software and or hardware firewalls and with process level firewalls like mandatory access controls so pretty much if this concerns you the things to look into are how to protect from this sort of attack with a firewalls complicated often requires extensive knowledge of exactly how it needs to be configured both the firewall and the system itself b mandatory access controls similar to firewalls also requires extensive knowledge c physical isolation requires much less knowledge and much less to go wrong as well its a very powerful technique d virtual isolation requires the least amount of knowledge trivial to configure provides significant protection but not as much as physical isolation you also need to know how to harden your browser like disable javascript on tor browser for sure if you dont need them disable images too so long as you understand that this could increase linkability risk though this wont matter much if you only go to a few websites or only go to websites you do illegal things on not using windows is one of the biggest favors you can do for yourself as well use some distribution of linus instead or maybe even some bsd destroy think of how you can add amelia in as well so even if you are compromise the attackers foothold is lost after some period of time tails has amnesia built into it for example and has protection from this sort of attack via the firewall method the firewall having been configured by professionals whonix goes with the virtual isolation technique for protecting from this sort of attack but it doesnt have amelia so an attacker can still gain a permanent foothold they just cant easily get your real in address though they can spy on your entire vm besides that so you will deanonymize yourself if you send an address in plaintext for example you could get amelia by using a stable operating system without many updates for it and loading it from a read only medium into memory or something maybe from a hard drive with a write blocker and only load it in a suitable format when updating the software on it intentionally never when in the process of doing sensitive things you could also use snapshots to do the same thing for virtual isolation the biggest thing to also keep in mind for our threat model is the risk of an attacker deanonymizing you with your plaintext address even if they cant get your ip address to protect from this your address needs to be encrusted before it passes through exposed security domains the best way to do this is with air gaps or virtual air gaps at least security on this level is really hard to get into and even harder to maintain but if you follow the already known best practices you can make it extremely unlikely that an abi level attacker can pwn you with this technique asa tao is a different story though . website a is reference to a cp forum hidden service that was called pedoforum it was run by the same guy who ran cam a lot apparently the site that just made the news for

have much to add to it wifi used for one of the interfaces either we would like to see a build script than could be applied to a vanilla fresh arabian build it wouldnt be that much work for somebody quotewe have taken a slightly different approach with this in the past one that provides a little additional security at the cost of a little usability we provide it here for information it may be useful for some the fundamental difference is that rather than transparently route all traffic from the secure box and into tor we only route implicitly defined traffic the middle boxa simple tor client dual homed host really on a physical host it will have two network interfaces a public interface which connects to the internet really through a netting router or firewall and a private interface this system must be hardened because it will be able to establish arbitrary connections to the internet it will run tor in client mode and will expose the socks proxy to the private network only really it should be hard oded to connect to trusted guard nodes preferable ones that you either run or know to be safe at the least the guard nodes should be local to you in network terms this system should be configured to drop all inbound connections on the public interface regardless of any stream firewalls the system should also be configured to drop all traffic on and out on the private interface except inbound traffic to the local socks proxy port tcp or similar for good measure the middle box should also drop all outbound up traffic to the internet the private networkthis network exists purely between the middle box and the secure box really this should be a simple cross over cable which connects the two systems wireless is acceptable but the key thing is that the private network can not route anywhere other then between the middle and secure boxes and it will be carrying plain text sensitive traffic and thus must be protected from eavesdropping the private network must have no default gateway and no dns the secure boxthe key tenet of this system is that it does not know where it is or have any way of finding out where it is this system has a single network interface on the private network again there must be no default gateway no dns nothing just a simple state ip address and no more the local firewall iptables should be configured on this system to drop all inbound traffic and block all outbound traffic except outbound to the socks port on the middle box the browser on this system should be configured to use the socks proxy on the middle box if there is a requirement to use any other application other than the browser then it must implicitly be configured to use socks or failing that executed using torsocks which again will use the socks proxy on the middle box really the hostname of this system should be computer or server and only one user should be configured called user ensure the mac address of the system is modified from the hardware default at boot time really randomized each boot in terms of os anything that is non persistent is nearly always better such as tails the systems should have no microphone no camera no gps and really no wireless wlan bluetooth gam etc nothing that allows it to interact with the real world in any way except via that socks proxy when looking at the hardening of the secure box imagine you are a bad guy somewhere who has gained unrestricted access to the system and ask yourself a can you break out of it in any way that will cause you to generate network traffic that will not go through the socks port and into tor if you can then something is wrong rethink b can you extract anything from the system that provides ill identity information for instance address details that you might use to copy paste into order forms if you can find anything of value then something is wrong rethink this model can be virtualized easily enough but at the cost of some security if virtualized then make sure file sharing from guest to host is disabled shared clipboards etc the virtualization software should be configured to provide as much isolation between the guest and host systems as possible our preferred setup for this is simple and uses a rasberry pi as the middle box and an old laptop connected via a cross over ethernet cable the pi connects tirelessly to the local broadband router internet router pi middle box secured atop . i guess this is my my first conversational hub posting so hey there hub anyways what is being current discussed are his and caspian

looking bitcoin addresses recent research shows that this level of anonymity is rather low this encourages users to connect to the bitcoin network through anonymizers like tor and motivates development of default tor functionality for popular mobile spv clients in this paper we show that combining tor and bitcoin creates an attack vector for the deterministic and stealthy man in the middle attacks a low resource attacker can gain full control of information flows between all users who chose to use bitcoin over tor in particular the attacker can link together users transactions

torchat s security is unknown it has not undergone a proper security audit professional or otherwise that i know of it creates a hidden service on your computer leaving you vulnerable to deanonymization attacks that apply to all hidden services it also seems to be a very basin protocol that looks like netcat over tor there is no way to decline a file transfer it automatically starts the transfer writing the file to tmp which is a ram mounted tmpfs on linux then you are supposed to save the file somewhere theoretically an attacker could transfer de urandom while you are away from your computer until it fills up your ram and crashes your computer this would be great for inducing intersection attacks not sure though if the kernel is managing the system correctly it may just stop the transfer when you run out of ram another thing is that once someone learns your torches id there is no way to prevent them from knowing you are online even if you remove them from your ruddy list the reason is because your torchat instance is a hidden service that publishes a normal hidden service descriptor which anyone can download there s no way to stop that if you want to cut off contact with someone you have to get a new torchat id so you should be very conservative about handing out your torchat id and only give it to extremely trusted associates emphasis in original n b i do not

creates a hidden service on your computer leaving you vulnerable to deanonymization attacks that apply to all hidden services it also seems to be a very basin protocol that looks like netcat over tor there is no way to decline a file transfer it automatically starts the transfer writing the file to tmp which is a ram mounted tmpfs on linux then you are supposed to save the file somewhere theoretically an attacker could transfer de urandom while you are away from your computer until it fills up your ram and crashes your computer this would be great for inducing intersection attacks not sure though if the kernel is managing the system correctly it may just stop the transfer when you run out of ram another thing is that once someone learns your torches id there is no way to prevent them from knowing you are online even if you remove them from your ruddy list the reason is because your torchat instance is a hidden service that publishes a normal hidden service descriptor which anyone can download there s no way to stop that if you want to cut off contact with someone you have to get a new torchat id so you should be very conservative about handing out your torchat id and only give it to extremely trusted associates emphasis in original n b i do not use torchat so i can not comment on the above that said according to evidence produced at trial ross was a very heavy torchat user and one has to wonder about some of the comments made above e g inability to refuse file downloads etc zaphod . should torchat users worry about this kind of thing . should torchat users

should be a requirement along with pgp the numbers dont lie . i have a unique problem as someone stole my password and tried to pass themselves off as me on sr and i have had no help resolving this issue i created both pdxblack accounts at the same time and worked very hard to build a name that is solid on agora with almost in sales my first month the accounts had different keys but they are both mine i just done want any of the shit this guy pulled to affect my name as i also have tha name on a couple other markets . amazing huge thanks for your upstanding efforts is there a similar directory or subforum here for which vendors offer which products . amazing huge thanks for your upstanding efforts is there a similar directory or subforum here for which vendors offer which products

contribution we would like to know if you ever plan on adding bluest market vendors to your roster . begin pgp signed message hash sha hello we are el presidentefor those of you who do not know there is a vendor directory which contains a unsearchable list of all vendor identities as they are on sr and as they were on mr sheep and to some extent sr where possible we record vendor names vendor profile page curls market join date pgp details and rating scores the directory server in nearly months old now and is intended to hold both current and historical data on vendors across all markets vendors from pandora and agora markets are being added this weekend and are being professed at the moment further markets will no doubt be added once they become established only vendors with valid pgp keys are present on the directory server due to the way we index and validate vendors and there are no exceptions to this we periodically update the vendor lists and statistics typical once every week or so additional functionality is being implements which we think will make the directory serve much more useful shortly is also a pgp key server which hold copies of all of the vendor public keys on the below link the pgp server supports hkp and if a vendor pgp key on the key server was acquired by us from a vendor market profile then we also sign it these are the same keys we use to populate the vendor directory server above important note remember to validate a vendor really holds the key they claim to the easiest way to do this is to pgp encrypt a message to them using their published public key if they can not read it then you may have an issue and need to be careful you should be using pgp for all market messaging anyway love presidente begin pip signature

vendor has been registered on the site so it is impossible to see if a vendor is long term or recently registered as such we can not say with any certainty when a vendor joined but we will record when they first become visible hopefully agora will address this it means that initials the current agra vendors who are active will have a start date of jan or earlier subsequently appearing vendors will have a start month specified there are a relatively high proportion of agra vendors without pgp keys much higher than we have observed on s sheep or bmr around please make us aware of any errors

to the community . hellowe will be introducing some changes to the way the directory operates in a chased manner over the coming days and weeks we intend to start storing and displaying entries by vendor market rather than pgp key this way we ensure that key changes do not result in lots of orphan entries which is what we are starting to see the same level of information will be available but there may be some subtle differences this will mean each vendor will have a single entry generally and each market identity will have a pip key history showing previously published keys under that vendor name we also intend to stop signing vendor keys with individual market specific keys the main reason is there are just too many markets appearing we intend to use a single el presidente vendor key regardless of which market the key was extracted from we dont think this will be a problem for anyone but please do let us know if you are unhappy with that change we have just this minute finished the latest sr scrape and update and so endor feedback ratings are up to date again we have or so new vendors also and a few dozen key changes we will also shortly introduce searching by pgp

at el presidente . begin pgp signed message hash sha hello we are el presidentefor those of you who do not know there is a vendor directory which contains a unsearchable list of all vendor identities as they are on sr and as they were on mr sheep and to some extent sr where possible we record vendor names vendor profile page curls market join date pgp details and rating scores the directory server in nearly months old now and is intended to hold both current and historical data on vendors across all markets vendors from pandora and agora markets are being added this weekend and are being professed at the moment further markets will no doubt be added once they become established only vendors with valid pgp keys are present on the directory server due to the way we index and validate vendors and there are no exceptions to this we periodically update the vendor lists and statistics typical once every week or so additional functionality is being implements which we think will make the directory serve much more useful shortly is also a pgp key server which hold copies of all of the vendor public keys on the below link the pgp server supports hkp and if a vendor pgp key on the key server was acquired by us from a vendor market profile then we also sign it these are the same keys we use to populate the vendor directory server above important note remember to validate a vendor really holds the key they claim to the easiest way to do this is to pgp encrypt a message to them using their published public key if they can not read it then you may have an issue and need to be careful you should be using pgp for all market messaging anyway love presidente begin pip signature iqicbaebcgagbqjs v gaaojeb h lou s sdz qalelqrymvpc z mknslmkaqehkqcieq xaqr on pb lpwpiic
