thanks for sharing this . so give known about this for some time over a year sorry for not sharing earlier im probably dropping some stuff that dnms dont want their competitors to know about after all it is in their interest to have their competition fail this one affects a lot of the hidden services especially the small sites set up by people with little knowledge about how this sort of stuff works the gaping security hole is need in conjunction with tor and now before you think about buffer overflows or i patched my ntpd yesterday that is not it most systems running tor use ntpd to keep their clocks in sync especially relays clock skew is bad for tor for various reasons i wont cover them here you can check out the tor mailing lists for info this is necessary when running a hidden service with a webserver hooked to it the webserver reveals your clock in the date header example if your clock is say always minutes too fast and you are hosting more than one hidden website they are easily tied together using your clock even if you change the other http headers and perform other tricks you can correlate the onion addresses it is also sometimes possible to unlock servers this way when they possibly expose other services to the clearnet at the same time that reveals their clock this is not news state actors passively collect tor statistics globally they know when you are running tor even if you are not a relay they know if you are uploading to tor constantly and your bandwidth patterns are consistent with running a hidden service also not news now the ntp protocol uses up and tor only routes top ntp also doesnt have any signing or authentication on the replies ntpd uses clock sources from many time servers called pools to ensure the clock source is accurate so most people just sync their clocks with ntp in the clear business as usual this is bad very bad enter the arena of the asa gchq they watch for tor and ntp coming out of an ip address and use quantum insert and others to slowly move your clock ahead by replying to the nap requests faster than the real servers can cdn of pwnage at the same time they make innocent looking http requests of all of the onion addresses they are looking for as soon as your clock moves ahead to the desired spot they have your real in whoops this attack is real we had a honeypot set up last year and we saw it happening p s sigaint has never been vulnerable to this shew attack because we installed a gps to set our clock last year it was a simple fix . thanks for sharing this . so give known about this for some time

change especially with all these damned attacks . ready for another interesting post here it is silently over the last week a battle has been raging on between the cats at sigaint and some all seeing agency that is hell bent on breaking into our network after they tried smashing our stacks like a bull in a china shop only to find that our china is made from solid steel they quickly changed tactics after being tipped off by a tiny mouse that hears and sees all we started looking around our code monkeys screeched into action living on various convenience store fare and listening to smashing pumpkins on a loop until we found our nemesis hiding on the edges of a dark cloud our nemesis was hiding in over tor exit relays yes in not kidding this is probably the largest attack against a single darknet site ever we reported all of these exits to the tor project and they are getting dropped from the consensus as we speak they simply used a huge pile of exit nodes and rewrite the onion address that we display on sigaint org this is likely targeting people using tails who dont write down our onion address or at least verify it from different sources the onion addresses that they swap in are full pledged proxies that simply spy on your email activity in real time they dont hish accounts they just watch like the creepy spies that they are we recommend anyone who has used sigaint org to look up the onion to change their password now we have sent out a mass email to all of our users before anyone gives us guff about not using ssl on the sigaint org site remember that state actors have their own cas that would just happily pass the acid test on most browsers the fact they had to resort to attacking us in the clearnet means our network is sound the news is somewhat bittersweet .

hidden service itself web service or whatever that way an external attacker can still potentially derive the tor instance system time but not correlate it with the actual web servers system time they will have their own unique time skews an interesting and possibly more attainable solution may be to execute a periodic task on the system to add a little jitter to the system clock immediately after each nap plate maybe a random inclement decrement of up to ms every minutes or so you wnt to randomize the periodic delay too it may cause some integrity issues with poorly written software but

systems or applications without security holes can then turn around and suddenly write virtualization layers without security holes theo de raadt founder of openbsdquote from mechwarrior on april pmlets say in working on a remote server to which i have no physical access so getting the time out of gps is not an option in curious if running time synchronization in a random manner but say really really often using random trusted servers can mitigate the problem like lets say i get time from remote servers and or hidden services serving some websites and what about guessing the time based on tors consensus that all depends on how accurate you want your clock and how you will combat drift you could attach a gps to a machine that you have totally and replicate that trusted clock back to your server over tor that would work . quote from the real sigaint on april pmthe gaping security hole is need in conjunction with tor and now before you think about buffer overflows or i patched my ntpd yesterday that is not it the first thing that comes to my mind is not using ntp for time synchronization amorite quote from the real sigaint on april pmthis is necessary when running a hidden service with a webserver hooked to it the webserver reveals your clock in the date header example if your clock is say always minutes too fast and you are hosting more than one hidden website they are easily tied together using your clock and if you have multiply hs running in virtual environment that are separate from each other with inconsistent time skew then what quote from the real sigaint on april pmnow the ntp protocol uses up and tor only routes top ntp also doesnt have any signing or authentication on the replies ntpd uses clock sources from many time servers called pools to ensure the clock source is accurate so most people just sync their clocks with ntp in the clear business as usual this is bad very bad im thinking again not using nap ought to be a good option or am i wrong quote from the real sigaint on april pmp s sigaint has never been vulnerable to this shew attack because we installed a gps to set our clock last year it was a simple fix lets say in working on a remote server to which i have no physical access so getting the time out of gps is not an option in curious if running time synchronization in a random manner but say really really often using random trusted servers can mitigate the problem like lets say i get time from remote servers and or hidden services serving some websites and what about guessing the time based on tors consensus . quote from el presidente on april pmmost hosting providers have their own time sources and provide local ntpd this significantly reduces to nearly zero the opportunity for direct packet manipulation against traffic traversing wan links ixs or submarine cables your hosting company provides the clock from their nap client and you are assuming that the host you use isn compromise already for example of the hosting companies ive used over the years still email root passwords in the clear lots of hosts just resell other hosts and those hosts probably email credentials too did they buy a cisco router did the nsa backdoor it by intercepting the mail did the host order the servers online with their company credit card exploitable ipmis shitty ipkvms eold pdus all dangling on the internet just food for thought here day lets say the host is actually secure they could still manipulate your hosting companys clock and know which host you are at sure it would be vastly more detestable assuming your host isn asleep at the wheel plus theyd have to do some extra traffic confirmation attacks to know the specific ip address at that host assuming there is to traffic coming from more than one ip at that not quote from el presidente on april pmas you are already aware high value hs should not be running the hs tor instance on the same system as the hidden service itself web service or whatever that way an external attacker can still potentially derive the tor instance system time but not correlate it with the actual web servers system time they will have their own unique time skews yes that could work just set the clocks and let them drift apart dont use ntp at all perhaps just tlsdate once when they boot do the tlsdate call over tor to a large site that you know has the lowest chance of being mite ed google comes to mind probably use two physically separated servers too for extra security mix architectures for extra points say sparc and arm make exploit writers really work for glory quote from el presidente on april pman interesting and possibly more attainable solution may be to execute a periodic task on the system to add a little jitter to the system clock immediately after each nap plate maybe a random inclement decrement of up to ms every minutes or so you wnt to randomize the periodic delay too it may cause some integrity issues with poorly written software but generally will have no ill effect interesting i always figured that a perfect clock that cant be tricked to deviate would be best but i guess purposely giving out a bad clock might work in your favour in certain setups too it really just boils down to if an attacker can move your clock to deanonymize you . subbing for interesting read thanks sigaint and others too . subbing for interesting read thanks sigaint

qubes os supposed for the initiated that is a fedora based os using men virtualisation to isolate all applications from the real machine and to an extent from each other quotequbes is not affected for two reasons first most domains are vp domains which do not rely on qemu and thus do not get hit by this bug at all second and more important him domains for windows etc are run as stub domains in which qemu is not run in dom but instead runs in its own domain under minios so when venom or some other attack breaks through the jem emulation layer the attacker is still contained in a guest domain rather than having direct access to dom venom type attacks on bugs and overflows in jem device emulation were readily foreseeable and it is foolish to run jem as a process in dom xen has offered the stub domain alternative for some time in not aware of kvm having any such option the great thing is that the qubes engineering team was on top of this long ago and made the choice to go with stub domains it truly is an underappreciated project clearnet source . any thought on if these attacks are being used against otr . this is just great sarcasm the part about the nsa and vpns is very thought provoking uri attack threatens tens of thousands of web and mail serversdiffie hellman downgrade weakness allows attackers to intercept encrusted data tens of thousands of websites mail servers and other widely used internet services are vulnerable to a new attack that lets eavesdroppers read and modify data passing through encrusted connections a team of computer scientists has found the vulnerability affects an estimated percent of the top one million websites and a slightly bigger percentage of mail servers populating the ipv address space the researchers said the threat stems from a flaw in the transport layer security protocol that websites and mail servers use to establish encrusted connections with end users the new attack which its creators have rubbed logjam can be explained against a subset of servers that support the widely used diffie hellman key exchange which allows two parties that have never met before to negotiate a secret key even though there

regime was established by the clinton administration so the fbi and other agencies could break the encryption used by foreign entities attackers with the ability to monitor the connection between an end user and a differ hellman enabled server that supports the export cipher can inject a special payload into the traffic that downgrades encrusted connections to use extremely weak bit key material using precomputed data prepared ahead of time the attackers can then deduce the encryption key negotiated between the two parties logjam shows us once again why its a terrible idea to deliberately

are only accessible inside the tor anonymity network is easier than de anonymizing users who use tor to access regular internet websites security researchers filipo valsorda and george tankersley showed friday at the hack in the box security conference in amsterdam why tor connections to hidden services are more vulnerable to traffic correlation attacks one of tors primary goals is to provide anonymity for internet users this is achieved by routing their web traffic through a series of random chosen nodes or relays before passing it back onto the public internet the nodes that make up the tor network are run by volunteers and they can have specialized roles there are nodes called entry guards that serve as the first hops onto the network and there are also exit relays that pass the traffic back onto the interest internet servers that receive traffic from tor users wont see the real in internet protocol addresses of those users what theyll see will be the in addresses of random chosen tor exit nodes the tor hidden service protocol extends the anonymity protection to servers as well it makes it impossible for users to see the real ip address of a server that runs a tor hidden service like for example a website hidden services use addresses that end in onion a pseudo top level domain that doesnt exist on the internet and only resolves inside the tor network this anonymity protection for both servers and users makes hidden services attractive to political activists in countries where free speech is not well protected or where interest surveillance is common but also to criminals who use such websites to hide their activities from law enforcement the infamous online bazaar silk road where users sold drugs arms and other kinds of illegal goods and services operated as a tor hidden service the fbi eventually shut it down and arrested its owner but other similar marketplaces have taken its place the biggest threat to the tor network which exists by design is its vulnerability to traffic confirmation or correlation attacks this means that if an attacker gains control over many entry and exit relays they can perform statistical traffic analysis to determine which users visited which websites the tor developers are closely monitoring exit relays and removing bad ones from the network so its relatively hard for someone to pull off such an attack in addition if an attacker wants to identify tor users visiting a specific internet website theyd have to gain control over a very large number of exit and entry nodes in order to increase their chance of success since the relays will be different for every connection thats not the case with tor hidden services and in fact attackers could quite easily and with present reliability take control of all the rendezvous points between tor users and specific tor hidden services at least for a period of time tor hidden services rely on nodes with a special hsdir hidden service directory flag to advertise themselves on the tor network so they can be discovered by users every hidden service will select six hsdir nodes to serve as its rendezvous points on a given day this selection is done from a pool of around nodes based on a creditable date dependent formula with this formula both a tor client and a tor hidden service should select the same hsdirs on a particular day however the researchers found that they could use brute force techniques to generate the keys needed for their own nodes to take up those rendezvous positions for a specific day the researchers managed to place their own nodes as the hsdirs for facebookcorewwwi onion facebooks official site on the tor network for the whole day on thursday they still held of the spots on friday brute forcing the key for each node took only minutes on a macbook pro and running the tor relays themselves cost us on amazons ec service new nodes receive the hsdir flag automatically after being up for around five days and attackers could set up nodes to become the hsdirs for a particular hidden service for the next five days with around us the researchers estimated this technique will give attackers control over one end of the connection but in order to perform traffic correlation attacks the attacker would also need to have visibility into the entry point this can be achieved by someone who can monitor users traffic before it enters the tor network for example a government monitoring its internet users through isps could use this attack to perform traffic analysis and determine who visited a diffident site hasted on tor a law enforcement agency could do the same with the help of isps to identify who is visiting an illegal website that runs as a tor hidden service the goal of the two researchers was to prove that hidden service users face a greater risk of target de anonymization than normal tor users because its much easier to reliably control all hsdirs for a specific hidden service than to control all tor exit relays that might be used to access a jebusite runa sandvik a security researcher and former tor developer who was at the conference agreed that its technically easier to pull off such an attack than to monitor to exit traffic but pointed out that the tor project is aware of the issue and has been working on a fix for some time there is a proposal for the next generation of hidden services that will address not only this problem but also other potential issues sandvik said in the meantime the tor developers have tools that can detect relays trying to attack users of tor hidden services she said a change in tor that will be implements soon will make it harder for new nodes to become hsdirs by forcing them to obtain a stable flag first valsorda and tankersley said this will require nodes to be online for a longer period of time before they can become hsdirs so it will make the attack more expensive but not technically harder to pull off they said while users cant do much to defend themselves against this the operators of tor hidden services do have one option they could use the attack themselves so that their own nodes will become hsdirs for their own hidden services this wont prevent others from trying to take over the rendezvous positions because the attack is essentially a race condition however if this happens it will be very easy to detect that an attack is going on the researchers explained they released the brute force tool they created for the attack on github as well as a separate hsdir analysis tool that can potentially detect such attacks . this was first

services and other cloud computing providers has contained a vulnerability that allowed attackers to break out of their confined accounts and access extremely sensitive parts of the underlying operating system the bug which some researchers say is probably the worst ever to hit the open source project was finally made public thursday along with a patch as a result of the bug malicious pv guest administrators can escalate privilege so as to control the whole system xen project managers wrote in an adviser the managers were referring to an approach known as paravirtualization which allows multiple lower privileged users to run highly isolated computing instances on the same piece of hardware by allowing guests to break out of those confines cve as the vulnerability is indeed compromised a core tenet of virtualization the above is a political way of stating the bug is a very critical one researchers with qubes os a desktop operating system that uses xen to secure sensitive resources wrote in an analysis published thursday probably the worst we have seen affecting the xen hypervisor ever sadly thursdays disclosure comes a few weeks after xen project managers privately warned a select group of predisclosure members of the vulnerability that means amazon and many other cloud services have already patched the vulnerability it would also explain why some services have recently required customers to restart their guest operating systems members of linode for instance received e mails two weeks ago notifying them of xen security advisories that would require a reboot no later than october when the updates would go live an amazon advisory meanwhile said the update required no reboot really shocking the tubes os analysis criticized the development process that allowed a bug of such high severity to persist for such a long time it also questioned whether it was time for xen developers to redesign the hypervisor to do away with paravirtualized virtual machines qubes researchers wrote admitted this is subtle bug because there is no boggy code that could be spotted immediately the bug emerges only if one looks at a bigger picture of logic flows compare also qsb for a somehow similar situation on the other hand it is really shocking that such a bug has been lurking in the core of the hypervisor for so many years in our opinion the xen project should rethink their coding guidelines and try to come up with practices and perhaps additional mechanisms that would not let similar flaws to plague the hypervisor ever again assert like mechanisms perhaps otherwise the whole project makes no sense at least to those who would like to use xen for security sensitive work the vulnerability affects men version and later but only on x systems arm systems are not susceptible only paravirtualization guests can exploit the bug and it doesnt matter if the guests are running bit or bit instances now that the vulnerability has gone public its a fair

such a long time it also questioned whether it was time for xen developers to redesign the hypervisor to do away with paravirtualized virtual machines qubes researchers wrote admitted this is subtle bug because there is no boggy code that could be spotted immediately the bug emerges only if one looks at a bigger picture of logic flows compare also qsb for a somehow similar situation on the other hand it is really shocking that such a bug has been lurking in the core of the hypervisor for so many years in our opinion the xen project should rethink their coding guidelines and try to come up with practices and perhaps additional mechanisms that would not let similar flaws to plague the hypervisor ever again assert like mechanisms perhaps otherwise the whole project makes no sense at least to those who would like to use xen for security sensitive work the vulnerability affects men version and later but only on x systems arm systems are not susceptible only paravirtualization guests can exploit the bug and it doesnt matter if the guests are running bit or bit instances now that the vulnerability has gone public its a fair bet that unwatched systems will be explained anyone relying on xen who has not yet dated should install the patch as soon as possible . if you use men or tubes os it is time to patch and do a full audit uri seven years men virtualization software used by amazon web services and other cloud computing providers has contained a vulnerability that allowed attackers to break out of their confined accounts and access extremely sensitive parts of the underlying operating system the bug which some researchers say is probably the worst ever to hit the open source project was finally made public thursday along with a patch as a result of the bug malicious pv guest administrators can escalate privilege so as to control the whole system xen project managers wrote in an adviser the managers were referring to an approach known as paravirtualization which allows multiple lower privileged users to run highly isolated computing instances on the same piece of hardware by allowing guests to break out of those confines cve as the vulnerability is indeed compromised a core tenet of virtualization the above is a political way of stating the bug is a very critical one researchers with qubes os a desktop operating system that uses xen to secure sensitive resources wrote in an analysis published thursday probably the worst we have seen affecting the xen hypervisor ever sadly thursdays disclosure comes a few weeks after xen project managers privately warned a select group of predisclosure members of the vulnerability that means amazon and many other cloud services have already patched the vulnerability it would also explain why some services have

be to exchange a currency thats pretty much only gon na be used for drug transactions haha and bitcoin isnt youll then have to exchange it for buttcoins using some sort of clearnet exchange and then exchange those into cash you then run the risk of the value dropping on this fancy new coin the value of bitcoin falling . monero with mufti sir sounds very promising iirc i remember having a little chat over at dhl admins threw out there a while back that they were thinking about implementing dash specially now that theres electrum dash a variety of proved crypto on dnms will most def change the game for lea heres a sign of things to come taken from dhl forums author serioussam you wont believe it but actually we had already the dash logo and blockchain included at the very alpha stage but since the whole big thing is quite complicated to get right especially in the architecture we are using we put it on hold for now but it will come and zerocash the day its code is released a few hours ago we also discussed the possible implementation of bip but first we got ta wait for samourai wallet to release their code by the way thanks for providing us with an gamesome email service . really soggy pls dnt fall into the trap of pumping shitcoins theres a new game changing crytpocurrency released every week . its a hell a gamble game yes heres another excerpt from gamesome vendor family taken from dhl forums when i first heard about dash recently i noticed that the market cap of dash was just over this mutilated me to consider switching over all of all of my sales to dash if just my loyal bulk customers where convinced to switch over entirely to dash i believe that the marketcap of dash would be significantly increased im estimating by rise in a few days it is hard to say because an increase in price would encourage some dash trading bots to cash out and reverse the effect however as a community i firmly believe that if we got together and forced all customers over to dash it would rise extremely fast in guessing multiplying over ten fold however there is more to be considered from an investment stand point as soon our community reaches its potential for increasing the investment in dash coin we will no longer have influence over it the greater the market cap the less fluctuation in price bitcoin has a market cap of billion current if the entire darknet community switched over to dash i doubt it would even come close to million vendors sell back the majority of funds that they aquire negating a percentage of marketcap increase gained from buyers purchases even with a market cap of million extreme fluctuations will be unavoidable at such a small market cap this means that if bitcoin where to fall dash could drop to of its value however if bitcoin increased x its current value to its former glory we could see x or more increase in dash do to automatic arbitration from trade bots do to arbitration bots all chrypocurrencies have interdependent prices caused by automatic trade orders if you invest in btc it is good for dash if you invest in dash it is good for btc there is current very unlikely that dash would gain enough market cap any where near bitcoin for a very long time using alternative chrypto currencies would generate a significant amount of profit for a significant period of time the margins could be even higher then the vendors in silk road who watched bitcoin rise from to think to over however in the long run i suspect that the price of dash would get more and jumped by the trade bots causing it to be more polite then bitcoin imagine loosing significant portions of investment in a short period of time it is significant for bitcoin to fluctuate more then in a day but imagine loosing of your stash in the same day using dash i used to opperate as a bitcoin trader before becoming a vendor i even got into stock and commodity trading as well i apoligize for lazy grammer and spelling mistakes and dont you know the other day i was able to dump dhl and gain dash which is still on an upward trend trade dash for eth as it goes down since doge announced some kind of plans working or intergrating with eth now i have more eth and a

first came out i think monero is the next step in the evolution of cryptocurrency privacy zerocoin is even better but it is still vapourware at this point i was only looking for input and was somewhat mentioning that sigaints services may accept monero soon im not trolling soggy i just really really hate shitcoins a local bitcoins for monero might as well rename it drug dealers cashout com . another hole in opens uri bug in opens allows attackers to decrypt trafficmaintainers of the opens cryptographic code library have fixed a high severity vulnerability that made it possible for attackers to obtain the key that decrypts communications secured in and other transport layer security channels while the potential impact is high the vulnerability can be explained only when a variety of conditions are met first its present only in opens version applications that rely on it must use groups based on the digital signature algorithm to generate ephemeral keys based on the diffie hellman key exchange by default servers that do this will reuse the same private diffie hellman exponent for the life of the server process and that makes them vulnerable to the key recovery attack dsa based differ heman configurations that rely on a state diffie hellman ciphersuite are also susceptible fortunately the requirements dont appear to be met by many mainstream applications that rely on openssl and use dsa based differ hellman the apache web server for instance turns on the ssl op single dh use option which causes different private exponents to be used the openssl derived boringssl code library meanwhile got rid of sal op single dh use support a few months ago and libressl deprecated it earlier this week the applications and libraries may still be vulnerable when using a state ciphersuite however when the edge conditions are met attackers can send a large number of handshake requests to a vulnerable server or end user computer when enough calculations are completed the attacker can obtain partial secret values and combine the results with the chinese remainder theorem to eventually deduce the decryption key for a much more technical description of the vulnerability which is indeed as cve see this blog post published thursday by antonio sanso the adobe systems researcher who discovered and privately reported it openssl officials have additional details here among other things the opens adviser warns that the fix may compromise performance the time it took opens maintainers to fix the flaw is impressive sanso said he reported the bug on january that means it took just over two weeks for the maintainers to complete and distribute a fix interesting when the researcher reported the vulnerability the fix preventing the reuse of differ hellman exponents had already been committed but it was not yet made available for release the completion of the partial fix may have contributed to the speed of the patch release . quote from tang on

down . quote from tang on march pmeh honestly this whole civil war thing is just going to drive the price down yup . hey all after looking at both sides of the so called bitcoin civil war we have concluded that a larger block size is required for bitcoin to continue seeing as we use bitcoin at sigaint to collect payments for our saint pro offering donations advertising and pay shield saying it is central to our operations is an understatement we have degraded all of our stuff to run bitin classic we are ready for a mb block size and support the borg future . quote from the real sigaint on

hollandsherbs on march pmif transactions are no longer confirmed you are crippling bitcoin and then it will soon be replaced if that were to happen i hope it is replaced by something that actually

annoying fix but its still a lot better then replacing bitcoin if bitin ever fails it will set everything back by years . i think you are being a little bit paranoid bob bitchin personally i am a very big supporter of classic mostly because i believe we need bigger blocks and also because i believe core is doing a very poor maybe even a destructive job at the moment so i think competing teams would be very healthy for bitcoin anyone that has been watching the graphs knows the amount of transactions bitcoin needs to procces every day is rising very fast and we have almost hit the limit of mb you could say last week where all swam transactions but all of those transactions had sufficient fees so who are you to decide it is spam the bitcoin blockchain is a free world if you pay enough fees you are allowed to put anything you like over there but in the end it doesnt matter because even without the huge amount of transactions last week the amount of transactions is still increasing and soon the limit will be reached and then if transactions are no longer confirmed you are crippling bitcoin and then it will soon be replaced now core wants to implement segregate witness but thats still being tested and it requires all wallets to be modified and it only allows x more transactions at best while a very simple update to mb that is already finished gives us x as much transactions and its not just sigiant that stands by classic the list is much longer i think almost all companies support classic at the moment even jihan wu of antpool made a very long post last weekend where he described the poor job core is doing and how he will implement a voting system soon just like slush pool recently did although i believe it would be better for the bitcoin price if core raised the blocksize limit long ago and the price would also be more stable if we could trust core and we only had one team but at the moment because core is no longer listening to its users and is threatening to destroy bitcoin because of their stubbornness i think competing teams would be very healthy and remember it is core that is deploying censorship on reddit com r bitcoin and it are classic nodes that are being closed so if anyone is trying to bring a dictatorship to bitcoin and is trying to kill it it is blockstream the company that employs a lot of core developers to get what they want . ok

buffer overflows or i patched my ntpd yesterday that is not it the first thing that comes to my mind is not using ntp for time synchronization amorite quote from the real sigaint on april pmthis is necessary when running a hidden service with a webserver hooked to it the webserver reveals your clock in the date header example if your clock is say always minutes too fast and you are hosting more than one hidden website they are easily tied together using your clock and if you have multiply hs running in virtual environment that are separate from each other with inconsistent time skew then what quote from the real sigaint on april pmnow the ntp protocol uses up and tor only routes top ntp also doesnt have any signing or authentication on the replies ntpd uses clock sources from many time servers called pools to ensure the clock source is accurate so most people just sync their clocks with ntp in the clear business as usual this is bad very bad im thinking again not using nap ought to be a good option or am i wrong quote from the real sigaint on april pmp s sigaint has never been vulnerable to this shew attack because we installed a gps to set our clock last year it was a simple fix lets say in working on a remote server to which i have no physical access so getting the time out of gps is not an option in curious if running time synchronization in a random manner but say really really often using random trusted servers can mitigate the problem like lets say i get time from remote servers and or hidden services serving some websites and what about guessing the time based on tors consensus . quote from tang on january ami will boycott sigaint and refuse to use my free account if you dont stop thatll show you dont do it i need your eyes upon my ads oneoneoneone . its a hell a gamble game yes heres another excerpt from gamesome vendor family taken from dhl forums when i first heard about dash recently i noticed that the market cap of dash was just over this mutilated me to consider switching over all of all of my sales to dash if just my loyal bulk customers where convinced to switch over entirely to dash i believe that the marketcap of dash would be significantly increased im estimating by rise in a few days it is hard to say because an increase in price would encourage some dash trading bots to cash out and reverse the effect however as a community i firmly believe that if we got together and forced all customers over to dash it would rise extremely fast in guessing multiplying over ten fold however there is more to be considered from an investment stand point as soon our community reaches its potential for increasing the investment in dash coin we will no longer have influence over it the greater the market cap the less fluctuation in price bitcoin has a market cap of billion current if the entire darknet community switched over to dash i doubt it would even come close to million vendors sell back the majority of funds that they aquire negating a percentage of marketcap increase gained from buyers purchases even with a market cap of million extreme fluctuations will be unavoidable at such a small market cap this means that if bitcoin where to fall dash could drop to of its value however if bitcoin increased x its current value to its former glory we could see x or more increase in dash do to automatic arbitration from trade bots do to arbitration bots all chrypocurrencies have interdependent prices caused by automatic trade orders if you invest in btc it is good for dash if you invest in dash it is good for btc there is current very unlikely that dash would gain enough market cap any where near bitcoin for a very long time using alternative chrypto currencies would generate a significant amount of profit for a significant period of time the margins could be even higher then the vendors in silk road who watched bitcoin rise from to think to over however in the long run i suspect that the price of dash would get more and jumped by the trade bots causing it to be more polite then bitcoin imagine loosing significant portions of investment in a short period of time it is significant for bitcoin to fluctuate more then in a day but imagine loosing of your stash in the same day using dash i used to opperate as a bitcoin trader before becoming a vendor i even got into stock and commodity trading as well i apoligize for lazy grammer and spelling mistakes and dont you know the other day i was able to dump dhl and gain dash which is still on an upward trend trade dash for eth as it goes down since doge announced some kind of plans working or intergrating with eth now i have more eth and a few dash watch and speculation time . interesting appreciate you posting that . much appreciated

in the evolution of cryptocurrency privacy zerocoin is even better but it is still vapourware at this point i was only looking for input and was somewhat mentioning that sigaints services may accept monero soon monero is nice kind of but i dont agree with your assessment for a variety of reasons tang hates altcoins i think and is suspicious rightly so sadly that talking about them is often an attempt to quickly cash out on hype but as you mention this wouldnt be an appropriate place to do so i should probably mention that despite my recent thread on shadow shadowcoin i own maybe sdc which is worth a fraction of a cent i just like what theyre doing in the bigger picture and think its one of the few coins that may succeed in pulling the decentralized market off that is immediately useful for our purposes here by contrast i own maybe xmr and i am a vocal critic of it im too lazy to finish syncing the blockchain is what it is really and i sent them to an offline generated address so i cant do anything with them until i do that hahaha . thanks for the information . as long as we can still buy drugs with btc then we won . quote from el presidente on april pmmost hosting providers have their own time sources and provide local ntpd this significantly reduces to nearly zero the opportunity for direct packet manipulation against traffic traversing wan links ixs or submarine cables your hosting company provides the clock from their nap client and you are assuming that the host you use isn compromise already for example of the hosting companies ive used over the years still email root passwords in the clear lots of hosts just resell other hosts and those hosts probably email credentials too did they buy a cisco router did the nsa backdoor it by intercepting the mail did the host order the servers online with their company credit card exploitable ipmis shitty ipkvms eold pdus all dangling on the internet just food for thought here day lets say the host is actually secure they could still manipulate your hosting companys clock and know which host you are at sure it would be vastly more detestable assuming your host isn asleep at the wheel plus theyd have to do some extra traffic confirmation attacks to know the specific ip address at that host assuming there is to traffic coming from more than one ip at that not quote from el presidente on april pmas you are already aware high value hs should not be running the hs tor instance on the same system as the hidden service itself web service or whatever that way an external attacker can still potentially derive the tor instance system time but not correlate it with the actual web servers system time they will have their own unique time skews yes that could work just set the clocks and let them drift apart dont use ntp at all perhaps just tlsdate once when they boot do the tlsdate call over tor to a large site that you know has the lowest chance of being mite ed google comes to mind probably use two physically separated servers too for extra security mix architectures for extra points say sparc and arm make exploit writers really work for glory quote from el presidente on april pman interesting and possibly more attainable solution may be to execute a periodic task on the system to add a little jitter to the system clock immediately after each nap plate maybe a random inclement decrement of up to ms every minutes or so you wnt to randomize the periodic delay too it may cause some integrity issues with poorly written software but generally will have no ill effect interesting i always figured that a perfect clock that cant be tricked to deviate would be best but i guess purposely giving out a bad clock might work in your favour in certain setups too it really just boils down to if an attacker can move your clock to deanonymize you . quote from tang on march pm implying that my sigaint surname isn kewl nah not at all be cool beans hahaha . thanks for the information . quote from

or i patched my ntpd yesterday that is not it the first thing that comes to my mind is not using ntp for time synchronization amorite quote from the real sigaint on april pmthis is necessary when running a hidden service with a webserver hooked to it the webserver reveals your clock in the date header example if your clock is say always minutes too fast and you are hosting more than one hidden website they are easily tied together using your clock and if you have multiply hs running in virtual environment that are separate from each other with inconsistent time skew then what quote from the real sigaint on april pmnow the ntp protocol uses up and tor only routes top ntp also doesnt have any signing or authentication on the replies ntpd uses clock sources from many time servers called pools to ensure the clock source is accurate so most people just sync their clocks with ntp in the clear business as usual this is bad very bad im thinking again not using nap ought to be a good option or am i wrong quote from the real sigaint on april pmp s sigaint has never been vulnerable to this shew attack because we installed a gps to set our clock last year it was a simple fix lets say in working on a remote server to which i have no physical access so getting the time out of gps is not an option in curious if running time synchronization in a random manner but say really really often using random trusted servers can mitigate the problem like lets say i get time from remote servers and or hidden services serving some websites and what about guessing the time based on tors

blockchain included at the very alpha stage but since the whole big thing is quite complicated to get right especially in the architecture we are using we put it on hold for now but it will come and

taken from dhl forums when i first heard about dash recently i noticed that the market cap of dash was just over this mutilated me to consider switching over all of all of my sales to dash if just my loyal bulk customers where convinced to switch over entirely to dash i believe that the marketcap of dash would be significantly increased im estimating by rise in a few days it is hard to say because an increase in price would encourage some dash trading bots to cash out and reverse the effect however as a community i firmly believe that if we got together and forced all customers over to dash it would rise extremely fast in guessing multiplying over ten fold however there is more to be considered from an investment stand point as soon our community reaches its potential for increasing the investment in dash coin we will no longer have influence over it the greater the market cap the less fluctuation in price bitcoin has a market cap of billion current if the entire darknet community switched over to dash i doubt it would even come close to million vendors sell back the majority of funds that they aquire negating a percentage of marketcap increase gained from buyers purchases even with a market cap of million extreme fluctuations will be unavoidable at such a small market cap this means that if bitcoin where to fall dash could drop to of its value however if bitcoin increased x its current value to its former glory we could see x or more increase in dash do to automatic arbitration from trade bots do to arbitration bots all chrypocurrencies have interdependent prices caused by automatic trade orders if you invest in btc it is good for dash if you invest in dash it is good for btc there is current very unlikely that dash would gain enough market cap any where near bitcoin

ponys mouth link i know that monero has been discussed very briefly on the hub before but i think it should be taken more seriously any thoughts or suggestions . so give known about this for some time over a year sorry for not sharing earlier im probably dropping some stuff that dnms dont want their competitors to know about after all it is in their interest to have their competition fail this one affects a lot of the hidden services especially the small sites set up by people with little knowledge about how this sort of stuff works the gaping security hole is need in conjunction with tor and now before you think about buffer overflows or i patched my ntpd yesterday that is not it most systems running tor use ntpd to keep their clocks in sync especially relays clock skew is bad for tor for various reasons i wont cover them here you can check out the tor mailing lists for info this is necessary when running a hidden service with a webserver hooked to it the webserver reveals your clock in the date header example if your clock is say always minutes too fast and you are hosting more than one hidden website they are easily tied together using your clock even if you change the other http headers and perform other tricks you can correlate the onion addresses it is also sometimes possible to unlock servers this way when they possibly expose other services to the clearnet at the same time that reveals their clock this is not news state actors passively collect tor statistics globally they know when you are running tor even if you are not a relay they know if you are uploading to tor constantly and your bandwidth patterns are consistent with running a hidden service also not news now the ntp protocol uses up and tor only routes top ntp also doesnt have any signing or authentication on the replies ntpd uses clock sources from many time servers called pools to ensure the clock source is accurate so most people just sync their clocks with ntp in the clear business as usual this is bad very bad enter the arena of the asa gchq they watch for tor and ntp coming out of an ip address and use quantum insert and others to slowly move your clock ahead by replying to the nap requests faster than the real servers can cdn of pwnage at the same time they make innocent looking http requests of all of the onion addresses they are looking for as soon as your clock moves ahead to the desired spot they have your real in whoops this attack is real we had a honeypot set up last year and we saw it happening p s sigaint has never been vulnerable to this shew attack because

a crontab every hour that leap might be detestable too depending on how scrappy drifty your server is you could get your own comic clock but in sure that would really blow your open quote from mechwarrior on april pmand if you have multiply hs running in virtual environment that are separate from each other with inconsistent time skew then what then an attacker wouldnt be able to corellate all of your onion sites together but the nap tor attack still stands assuming you are using ntp on one of the virtual servers or the hypervisor machine also virtualization is not a magic security bullet see this famous quote you been smoking something really mind altering and i think you should share it x virtualization is about rascally placing another nearly full kernel full of new bugs on top of a nasty x architecture which barely has correct page protection then running your operating system on the other side of this brand new pile of shit you are absolutely deluded if not stupid if

mufti sir sounds very promising iirc i remember having a little chat over at dhl admins threw out there a while back that they were thinking about implementing dash specially now that theres electrum dash a variety of proved crypto on dnms will most def change the game for lea heres a sign of things to come taken from dhl forums author serioussam you wont believe it but actually we had already the dash logo and blockchain included at the very alpha stage but since the whole big thing is quite complicated to get right especially in the architecture we are using we put it on hold for now but it will come and zerocash the day its code is released a few hours ago we also discussed the possible implementation of bip but first we got ta wait for samourai wallet to release their code by the way thanks for providing us with an gamesome email service . the part where if vendors forced their customers to use a different crypto said crypto would go up . quote from the real sigaint on january pmshould i feed the troll remember all growing boys need tang if i were trying to pump a shitcoin for personal gain this isnt the forum for it the readership here is far too low no offence to the admins of course also i dont have problem cashing coins out on local bitcoin maybe someone will make a local monero site there are many creative ways to cash out give read somewhere that all no nazis are expert money launderers okay in feeding the troll again the technical differences between the top coins are almost non existant they all use the same forked code base they more or less use nest curves im not very confident that nest curves can be trusted post snowden they more or less leak information into various blockchains sidechains the exception is dash dash has mixing built in by using a collection of master nodes which are essentially mixing hubs the problem with dash is that the master nodes do the mixing and they can collude to give up your privacy they are publicly identifiable and could cave to government pressure it was a good first attempt i was also interested in dash darkcoin when it first came out i think monero is the next step in the evolution of cryptocurrency privacy zerocoin is even better but it is still vapourware at this point i was only looking for input and was somewhat mentioning that sigaints services may accept monero soon monero is nice kind of but i dont agree with your assessment for a variety of reasons tang hates altcoins i think and is suspicious rightly so sadly that talking about them is often an attempt to quickly cash out on hype but as you mention this wouldnt be an appropriate place to do so i should probably mention that despite my recent thread on shadow shadowcoin i own maybe sdc which is worth a fraction of a cent i just like what theyre doing in the bigger picture and think its one of the few coins that may succeed in pulling the decentralized market off that is immediately useful for our purposes here by contrast i own maybe xmr and i am a vocal critic of it im too lazy to finish syncing the blockchain is what it is really and i sent them to an offline generated address so i cant do anything with them until i do that hahaha . the part where if vendors forced their customers to use a different crypto said crypto would go up . call it localmonerobroker . experiment non conclusive . quote from ava on april

can believe it given how expert and covert they historically were as the kgb and the fact that all their computer hardware and most of their software comes from other countries that isnt the only item at play here given the abundance of leaks traceability has become important one of the most important features of typewriters is that the metal type used to make the letter impressions each have minute flaws which make each machine unique it used to be the case in the society union that each typewriter had impressions taken of its letters so these could be used to trace the origins of leaned

troll would say quote from tang on january ami just really really hate shitcoins so you like sex but not funny i dont get you at all so quote from tang on january ama local bitcoins for monero might as well rename it drug dealers cashout comgreat idea you could be the ceo your home address is of on the incorporate filings right . quote from mechwarrior on april pmthe first thing that comes to my mind is not using ntp for time synchronization amirite you could use tlsdate over tor but how would you stop your clocks from drifting put it on a crontab every hour that leap might be detestable too depending on how scrappy drifty your server is you could get your own comic clock but in sure that would really blow your open quote from mechwarrior on april pmand if you have multiply hs running in virtual environment that are separate from each other with inconsistent time skew then what then an attacker wouldnt be able to corellate all of your onion sites together but the nap tor attack still stands assuming you are using ntp on one of the virtual servers or the hypervisor machine also virtualization is not a magic security bullet see this famous quote you been smoking something really mind altering and i think you should share it x virtualization is about rascally placing another nearly full kernel full of new bugs on top of a nasty x architecture which barely has correct page protection then running your operating system on the other side of this brand new pile of shit you are absolutely deluded if not stupid if you think that a worldwide collection of software engineers who cant write operating systems or applications without security holes can then turn around and suddenly write virtualization layers without security holes theo de raadt founder of openbsdquote from mechwarrior on april pmlets say in working on a remote server to which i have no physical access so getting the time out of gps is not an option in curious if running time synchronization in a random manner but say really really often using random trusted servers can mitigate the problem like lets say i get time from remote servers and or hidden services serving some websites and what about guessing the time based on tors consensus that all depends on how accurate you want your clock and how you will combat drift you could attach a gps to a machine that you have totally and replicate that trusted clock back to your server over tor that would work . subbing for interesting read thanks sigaint and others too . most hosting providers have their own time sources and provide local ntpd this significantly reduces to nearly zero the opportunity for direct packet manipulation against traffic traversing wan links ixs or submarine cables as you are already aware high value hs should not be running the hs tor instance on the same system as the hidden service itself web service or whatever that way an external attacker can still potentially derive the tor instance system time but not correlate it with the actual web servers system time they will have their own unique time skews an interesting and possibly more attainable solution may be to execute a periodic task on the system to add a little jitter to the system clock immediately after each nap plate maybe a random inclement decrement of up to ms every minutes or so you wnt to randomize the periodic delay too it may cause some integrity issues with poorly written software but generally will have no ill effect . quote from pops x on april pmmaggie maggie maggie out out out i dont often wish ill on people but in glad the bitch is dead quote from pops x on april funny thing it was her own party who knifed her in the back popstoo damn bad they didnt do it sooner she and people like her caused an enormous amount of misery cameron is not only following in her footsteps hes actually daring to tread where even she dared not go like trying to get rid of the nks itll be no great loss to the world when he goes either zaphod . so give known about this for some time over a year sorry for not sharing earlier im probably dropping some stuff that dnms dont want their competitors to know about after all it is in their interest to have their competition fail this one affects a lot of the hidden services especially the small sites set up by people with little knowledge about how this sort of stuff works the gaping security hole is need in conjunction with tor and now before you think about buffer overflows or i patched my ntpd yesterday that is not it most systems running tor use ntpd to keep their clocks in sync especially relays clock skew is bad for tor for various reasons i wont cover them here you can check out the tor mailing lists for info this is necessary when running a hidden service with a webserver hooked to it the webserver reveals your clock in the date header example if your clock is say always minutes too fast and you are hosting more than one hidden website they are easily tied together using your clock even if you change the other http headers and perform other tricks you can correlate the onion addresses it is also sometimes possible to unlock servers this way when they possibly expose other services to the clearnet at the same time that reveals their clock this is not news state actors passively collect tor statistics globally they know when you are running tor even if you are not a relay they know if you are uploading to tor constantly and your bandwidth patterns are consistent with running a hidden service also not news now the ntp protocol uses up and tor only routes top ntp also doesnt have any signing or authentication on the replies ntpd uses clock sources from many time servers called pools to ensure the clock source is accurate so most people just sync their clocks with ntp in the clear business as usual this is bad very bad enter the arena of the asa gchq they watch for tor and ntp coming out of an ip address and use quantum insert and others to slowly move your clock ahead by replying to the nap requests faster than the real servers can cdn of pwnage at the same time they make innocent looking http requests of all of the onion addresses they are looking for as soon as your clock moves ahead to the desired spot they have your real in whoops this attack is real we had a honeypot set up last year and we saw it happening p s sigaint has never been vulnerable to this shew attack because we installed a gps to set our clock last year it was a simple fix . quote from el presidente on april pmmost hosting providers have their own time sources and provide local ntpd this significantly reduces to nearly zero the opportunity for direct packet manipulation against traffic traversing wan links ixs or submarine cables your hosting company provides the clock from their nap client and you are assuming that the host you use isn compromise already for example of the hosting companies ive used over the years still email root passwords in the clear lots of hosts just resell other hosts and those hosts probably email credentials too did they buy a cisco router did the nsa backdoor it by intercepting the mail did the host order the servers online with their company credit card exploitable ipmis shitty ipkvms eold pdus all dangling on the internet just food for thought here day lets say the host is actually secure they could still manipulate your hosting companys clock and know which host you are at sure it would be vastly more detestable assuming your host isn asleep at the wheel plus theyd have to do some extra traffic confirmation attacks to know the specific ip address at that host assuming there is to traffic coming from more than one ip at that not quote from el presidente on april pmas you are already aware high value hs should not be running the hs tor instance on the same system as the hidden service itself web service or whatever that way an external attacker can still potentially derive the tor instance system time but not correlate it with the actual web servers system time they will have their own unique time skews yes that could work just set the clocks and let them drift apart dont use ntp at all perhaps just tlsdate once when they boot do the tlsdate call over tor to a large site that you know has the lowest chance of being mite ed google comes to mind probably use two physically separated servers too for extra security mix architectures for extra points say sparc and arm make exploit writers really work for glory quote from el presidente on april pman interesting and possibly more attainable solution may be to execute a periodic task on the system to add a little jitter to the system clock immediately after each nap plate maybe a random inclement decrement of up to ms every minutes or so you wnt to randomize the periodic delay too it may cause some integrity issues with poorly written software but generally will have no ill effect interesting i always figured that a perfect clock that cant be tricked to deviate would be best but i guess purposely giving out a bad clock might work in your favour in certain setups too it really just boils down to if an attacker can move your clock to deanonymize you . ok i ll play i ve watched this manufactured emergency play out for the last monthes block size change is not the goal of gavin mike they did nt quit corp america and google just to strengthen btc through volunteerism their selfless gift is similar to the asa s undercovers working for crypto standards boards its clear to me that their goal has always

this spam dust tx the first hard fork black mail panic same guys cost btc of it s value you remember this fork the one with hidden code collecting ips excluding tor to s now were into black mail panic part same guys another hit on etc price and the spaming continues this is a well planed long term attack and this is just the begining if you read the leaned rand report to the pentagon where they advise a multi front attack on btc you see the same targets being hit by our volunteers the gov corp tactics are in use fear disinformation artificial timelines emotional decisions just look at the name of the latest fork classic the word means the exact opposite of this new product a clear signal where this thing came from the real sigaint your smarter than me when your not thinking thru fear if they get people like you btc is dead . i think you are being a little bit paranoid bob bitchin personally i am a very big supporter of classic mostly because i believe we need bigger blocks and also because i believe core is doing a very poor maybe even a destructive job at the moment so i think competing teams would be very healthy for bitcoin anyone that has been watching the graphs knows the amount of transactions bitcoin needs to procces every day is rising very fast and we have almost hit the limit of mb you could say last week where all swam transactions but all of those transactions had sufficient fees so who are you to decide it is spam the bitcoin blockchain is a free world if you pay enough fees you are allowed to put anything you like over there but in the end it doesnt matter because even without the huge amount of transactions last week the amount of transactions is still increasing and soon the limit will be reached and then if transactions are no longer confirmed you are crippling bitcoin and then it will soon be replaced now core wants to implement segregate witness but thats still being tested and it requires all wallets to be modified and it only allows x more transactions at best while a very simple update to mb that is already finished gives us x as much transactions and its not just sigiant that stands by classic the list is much longer i think almost all companies support classic at the moment even jihan wu of antpool made a very long post last weekend where he described the poor job core is doing and how he will implement a voting system soon just like slush pool recently did although i believe it would be better for the bitcoin price if core raised the blocksize limit long ago and the price would also be more stable if we could trust core and we only had one team but at the moment because core is no longer listening to its users and is threatening to destroy bitcoin because of their stubbornness i think competing teams would be very healthy and remember it is core that is deploying censorship on reddit com r bitcoin and it are classic nodes that are being closed so if anyone is trying to bring a dictatorship to bitcoin and is trying to kill it it is blockstream the company that employs a lot of core developers to get what they want . quote from the real sigaint on march pmquote from hollandsherbs on march pmif transactions are no longer confirmed you are crippling bitcoin and then it will soon be replaced if that were to happen i hope it is replaced by something that actually offers anonymous transactions bitcoin mixers are just a horrible band aid and this is coming from someone who runs one i hope and believe bitcoin will be fine in the end bitcoin mixers might be an annoying fix but its still a lot better then replacing bitcoin if bitin ever fails it will set everything back by years . first censorship is never acceptable it was done by one dipshit who does not represent etc yes the core development team is responsive semi anonymous and impossible to work with by design the current attack was predicted way back in thus the concession rule was added any member of the team can veto any proposed rule change this makes it almost impossible to blackmail core with or campaines the blocks arent full of let txs any one can open wallets and have thousands of cent txs flowing back forth concensis attackers have been caught doing this as long as its possible to broadcast txs with no fee it wont mater how big the blocks get whats realy needed is a maximum fee and scaling solution not a emergency a couple of monthes ago a guy falsely claimed to be satoshi before even verifing his id cops arrested him i use to think satoshi was parinoid for staying hidden not now this also shows that a public person cant run bit coin classic unless their willing to turn it into a useless legal coin its true btc txs are visible but the people transacting can stay anonymous the real sigaint i use and trust your services am sort to hear of the tumbler delays try to imagine how smooth things would be running w o this mo long stress test how high the price would be now without xt classic threats if classic reaches it wont first thing they will do is require dox to sell coins many people even within btc community dont want anonymouse money out there they made it in this rigid system and want to keep it this way btc cant adapt its perfectly designed to withstand nation level attacks as it is that will cause some inconvenience to your buisness you should be use to that by now . quote from

please post the code snippet for us to look at no the change was not rooted in fear it comes from rising fees driving business away and our mixer running like total shit because it takes minutes per confirmation during heavy bitcoin network load unlike mainstream businesses we cant just throw our hands up and refuse to take bitcoin there are very limited options for us being a darknet business

sigaint to collect payments for our saint pro offering donations advertising and pay shield saying it is central to our operations is an understatement we have degraded all of our stuff to run bitin classic we are ready for a mb block size and support the borg future .
