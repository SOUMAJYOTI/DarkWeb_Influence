potential in running a niche market though what ever floats your boati totally agree with the open bazaar integration though there are still so many new markets with old systems coming up which will probably never get much traffic no matter how nice the software is just too much competition out there just because silkroad and agora still run successful with old scrappy software doesn mean anybody was waiting for your market and cant wait to switch over with you i mean people who start with a new market in general not your market specifically few can still make it with a lot of pr and community activity for example i think panacea has a good chance to become elegant but for no name startups with old centralized systems i dont see much chances on the other hand i think the work to make an ob market is not that big you can access the publicly available data which means you dont need to store much in your own db as far as i understand open bazaar the whole user order and messaging data is in the cloud and you dont need to store and manage it in your own db you can use functions and parts of software other people provide and benefit from a growing open source community evolving around ob i think the first ob markets will have an easy time to acquire new users and a lot of potential to profit from that if you develop for an old market system you most likely will have to dump your code in a while with high chances not having made any business with it if you get familiar with ob code and develop the first applications to it your code and know how probably will gain in value with endless business opportunities especially outside of the darknet i would do it myself but am too involved in other projects at the moment either way i will get my head into ob as soon as possible and

any updates the vendor makes to the order in openbazaar get reflected in the market website for the buyer to see now the buyer could bypass all of this and just run the openbazaar client and talk directly to the vendor through the dht p p network but that is beyond many users at this stage this way though you have the best of both worlds the core system is decentralized and very hard to pull down we hope but the users can still choose to have a very straightforward experience and all of the openbazaarness is hidden from them . another feature that i would like to see is a secret shopper vendor rating system for a fee vendors would pay you to have secret shoppers sample their products and send the goods off for quality testing perhaps to energy control the vendor would then be rated by the results i e how well their claims match the quality of their product . thanks for creating a market that accepts darkcoin i concur with jackblues points would especially like a market that is drugs only supporting a market that also sells seams stolen goods credit cards etc bothers me as my money is helping create the venue for their ethical behavior would also like to see integration with openbaazar this post describes what i mean by this model is straightforward one or more market web sites that allow users to log in and do markety stuff the same sort of features that you see in most of the current markets each market website has an openbazaar client attached to it that is the market sites communicate with the openbazaar dht and store nodes via a local openbazaar client the market websites use openbazaar to index all of the vendors and listings from the openbazaar dht these are then catched on the market web servers and may be browed by buyer users buyer submits an order market website takes some small commission and offloads the order directly to the vendor via the dht who will have an openbazaar store their own store mode or possibly a hasted openbazaar node vendor only deals with their own openbazaar site and presumably doesnt really care which market website submitted the order any updates the vendor makes to the order in openbazaar get reflected in the market

all of the openbazaarness is hidden from them i personally prefer when markets have no restrictions on the sold items you know except for the real bad shit but thats up to the one who runs the place i see the potential in running a niche market though what ever floats your boati totally agree with the open bazaar integration though there are still so many new markets with old systems coming up which will probably never get much traffic no matter how nice the software is just too much competition out there just because silkroad and agora still run successful with old scrappy software doesn mean anybody was waiting for your market and cant wait to switch over with you i mean people who start with a new market in general not your market specifically few can still make it with a lot of pr and community activity for example i think panacea has a good chance to become elegant but for no name startups with old centralized systems i dont see much chances on the other hand i think the work to make an ob market is not that big you can access the publicly available data which means you dont need to store much in your own db as far as i understand open bazaar the whole user order and messaging data is in the cloud and you dont need to store and manage it in your own db you can use functions and parts of software other people provide and benefit from a growing open source community evolving around ob i think the first ob markets will have an easy time to acquire new users and a lot of potential to profit from that if you develop for an old market system you most likely will have to dump your code in a while with high chances not having made any business with it if you get familiar with ob code and develop the first applications to it your code and know how probably will gain in value with endless business opportunities especially outside of the darknet i would do it myself but am too involved in other projects at the moment either way i will get my head into ob as soon as possible and develop software to it if theres still demand by then i might launch an ob dnm myself but would be happy to see some other playeuurs stepping up . quote from buheht on october pmthanks
