pgp signature that appears at the bottom of my forum posts because it still ends with my old email address i cant find my pip signature from within my pip program i am also confused because apparently there is a sig that starts with at the beginning and ends with my email address which appears at the bottom of my posts and in the signature field in my forum profile i dont remember how i was ever able to find my sig and enter in the sir field in my profile in the first place i tried entering my new pip public key in the pip signature field in my profile per the instructions in the new members thread hoping it would somehow convert it to a sig but that didn work apparently there is also something much longer about a fourth the size of a public key that starts with begin pgp signature that i see on a venders thread that is referred to as their sig so that means there are types of sigs i cant figure out how to find either one of these types of sigs for my own pgp key i also tried to change my email address in my forum account settings but it says i must enter my old email address in order to make any changes how can i change my email address in there if it needs my old email address in order to make changes also someone said i should be able to obtain their public key through the link in their sig they were referring to the long one that starts with begin pgp signature does anyone know how to obtain their key from that many thanks to all who can help me . thank you for your time and efforts nonya i tried to import your public key it said key import failed code error text gig total number professed i tried copying and pasting both your key and your sig and i tried copying and pasting just your key without your sig neither method worked give tried importing other peoples keys from the thread where members post their keys some of them import just fine but some dont i am using the exact same method every time so i dont dont know whats going on there i never have any problem importing venders keys from their vender pages on other markets i had a similar experience a long time ago i think it was on sr i could import someones key if they posted it on the forum but i couldnt do it if it was on their forum profile or maybe it was the other way around can you try pming me your key and maybe if i copy and paste it from there it will work give tried pasting your pgp key link in the address bar it took me to start page com and said sorry there are no web results for this search when i paste mine into the address bar it says unable to connect mine no longer appears at the bottom of my posts because i just deleted it from my profile last night but i copied it before i deleted it in case i need it again next day edit i tried your pgp key link again took a minute to connect but it worked this time and i was able to import your key so this seems consistent with what you were saying on one of your threads my pip key link still doesnt connect and i still dont remember how i acquired it in the first place and it would be nice to know how to create a new one with my dated email address but at least i can pm you now i didnt realize that your pgp key link goes to the same thread where all these members post their keys i generated a new key and tried to send it to my email address it said sending key failed thanks for clearing up my confusion over the word signature i understand the purpose of the sig ive found other into online about that but i cant find my sig i figured out how to generate a sig for a key that i generated yesterday and i exported the key to a folder like i normally do thats where i usually open a text file of my public key to give someone that text file still doesnt show a sir though oh and i wasnt trying to change the email address in my key i was trying to change it in my tmg forum account settings my main interest right now is to be able to import your public key then ill try working with that message you created then maybe ill try to tackle some of these other problems next day edit as i mentioned above i tried your pgp key link again took a minute to connect but it worked and i was able to import it this time when i get a chance ill try working with your encamped message exercise and see what happens with that but at least i have your key imported i really appreciate your help you have been so nice . begin pgp signed message hash sha in the pgp program you are using there should be an option under one of the tabs to back up keys use that option to save a text file of both your public and private keys as far as i know you can not change the email address on a key you will have to generate a new one during the creation of that key the program should ask you if you would like to email a backup of you keys i recommend you do once you have the key file i suggest saving it in more than one place since im almost positive it was my thread you were working with ill try and explain this better some of what your confusion is i think is with the terminology the signature in my post refers to the text links at the bottom of this post see the links there are of them vendor page review page and pgp key if you cut and paste those links into your address bar it will take you to those individual pages where give posted that info this is not to be confused with a pip signature the pgp signature was generated with my pgp keys on creation it allows me to sign a message other users that have my pip public key can use that to verify that the message was in fact created by the owner of the public key the message has not been changed or edited from the original content i will sign this message and include my public key from there you can copy and paste the whole message to your decryption clipboard and use the verify function to see that it was indeed me that created this post after you do that try this copy and paste the message to the clip board just as you did previously except this time pick a random word in here and delete it because the content was edited when you verify it you will receive a different message with a standard message if you receive that error message you can now confirm or suspect that either the post was not made by the person claiming to have written it or the original content of the message had been changed which is what happened when i edited my vendor op
