companies and leo are heavily indexing and trawling unsearchable hidden services for what they deem elegant content private companies and leo are now starting to deploy more hidden services for the

that this will be infected directly onto malicious hidden serviceson the third point in particular we know for a fact that the uk are doing this with regard to identity documents and passports the at fbi or companies acting on there behalf are doing this with firearms we have visibility of search terms used on a number of hidden services and can tell you that this is the case it would be interesting to compare notes with other site operators on some of these automatic search terms we played some games before january and without going into details can say that one or more individuals are following up mutually by investigating changes to search results for certain terms what we can not say is who they are but we suspect leo or contractors operating on their behalf however the latter two points should be of the most concern to dnm users we are current watching an interesting sequence playing out with some recently deplored hidden service hosted aggregation services no names at this stage they appear to have created seemingly unconnected services one of which is clearnet and are now slowly bringing of them together it may just be a group with a desire to make money or strongly influence the markets but it may be a more destructive force time will tell if anyone wants to discuss offline you know where to find us some of the exposures in tor are less applicable for users who only access hidden services which includes most dim activities but for those who access clearnet the risks are usually greater sticking with tails or whonix and ensuring that your endpoints are reasonably hardened which is generally true with either of those systems is the best you can do really along with minimizing clear net access or at least doing it with a different browser we believe that disruption rather than detection is the current favoured approach for the adversaries of the dnm and we believe they are probably putting what they need to in place to bring about

say that the packets arent being routing thru the routing box to get to the interface you say should be hidden if that is the case than your virtualization setup has nothing to do with it second it looks like its the host systems responcibility to route packets between the containers and the hardware i havent used xen before but looking at it it seems you want two bridges one that connected the nic from the isolated box to the nic on the routing box and one that connects the other nice on the routing box to the internet another option might be instead of using the bridging that comes with the kernel if that isnt enough info we need far more detail about the setup . hello guys can some more they guy help me out here i wan na create a setup which works just like the whonix system for technical reasons the only way i can do it is via xen and in stuck here in need of help so i wan na do the following machine with interest access gateway protected computer just like in whonix the main machine is the dom host which has got normal interest access gateway is a virtual machine which has got two network cards in it one is connected nat to the main machine the other is connected to the protected computer the two interfaces two networks are completely isolated the gateway is the machine which connects to tor and forces all incoming connections through tor im ok with this part once i figure out how to properly set up the xen network ill do the tunneling with iptables the protected computer is another vm and the only computer it can see is the gateway there are absolutely no other machines on its private network so its traffic either goes through the gateway or it does not have interest access at all this is exactly like how phoenix works i just wan a do it under xen and for hours now i just can not figure out the network config what setup should i use bridge nat i tried both but either way i successfully pinged the main computer from the protected machine which means failure i know guys that there are a lot of arguments here about how is this set secure or not but please just help me solve it if you can its even possible that it is very easy to setup im just not that familiar with xens networking subsystem i appreciate the help guys thank you very much adam . hello guys can some more they guy help me out here i wan na create a setup which works just like the whonix system for technical reasons the only way i can do it is via xen and in stuck here in need of help so i wan na do the following machine with interest access gateway protected computer just like in whonix the main machine is the dom host which has got normal interest access gateway is a virtual machine which has got two network cards in it one is connected nat to the main machine the other is connected to the protected computer the two interfaces two networks are completely isolated the gateway is the machine which connects to tor and forces all incoming connections through tor im ok with

are you sure that the configuation of the routing box is correct that is to say that the packets arent being routing thru the routing box to get to the interface you say should be hidden if that is the case than your virtualization setup has nothing to do with it second it looks like its the host systems responcibility to route packets between the containers and the hardware i havent used xen before but looking at it it seems you want two bridges one that connected the nic from the isolated box to the nic on the routing box and one that connects the other nice on the routing box to the internet another option might be instead of using the bridging that comes with the kernel if that isnt enough info we need far more detail about the setup . hello guys can some more they guy help me

its torvm does exactly what you describe . mmm okay and thanks for your answer why do you think this setup is a bad idea honestly in interested or what is the best method for hosting something really secure trying to protect an average site from average hackers no national security content thanks . quote from adam on june pmmmm okay and thanks for your answer why do you think this setup is a bad idea honestly in interested or what is the best method for hosting something really secure trying to protect an average site from average hackers no national security content thanks i done think its a bad setup i just think you dont want to be the one to implement it if somebody else has done it a slightly different way its better to make their solution fit your needs or find somebody who already did it the way you need it and grab their solution as far hosting something really secure the first thing you will need is complete control over your boxes hardware if the enemy has control over the physical hardware of your setup then its not yours of course most colocation companies will only get you a full rack if you want total control over the physical access to the machine maybe you dont want it really secure then you have to define the capabilities of your attacker i have a few boxes that arent too hardened except for stripping them all services that bind to the outside interface except ssh and tor and then run a pretty non interesting hidden service sure they have many attack vectors but if if they are completely compromise there isnt too much on there to make me worry about my main annoyance would be finding a new host . quote from adam on june pmmmm okay and thanks for your answer why do you think this setup is a bad idea honestly in interested or what is the best
