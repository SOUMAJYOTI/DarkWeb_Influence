call you because they are not at their computer at the moment and using codewords haha i feel you with the piazza thing its mostly not even relevant what you talk about but how you talk it always starts pretty good with something like hey dude everything worked out sending the party invitations or did you manage to bang that hot chick yesterday the one with the green skirt but then one tries to sqeeze more info into it like price amount location time whatever lots of eehhhhmmmmm you know s while the story becomes more and more bullshit after you hang up in of cases you think daamn only a
