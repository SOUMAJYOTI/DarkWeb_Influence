evos servers then they would know everything or if they were russian just sell the info . i havent read much about quartus computers how far is the development is it even considered in the near future i think the only but very effective form of encrypting data and withstand hacks from quartus computers is using the same quantum computers to create new forms of encryption raising the bar as a whole im not so worried that there will be a point where there is a sudden hardware upgrade with no form of encrypting data safely from hackers and le at the time but what about old data and every data gets old sometime le could store all encrusted data they can gather and just crack it someway in the future if needed when the encryption of messages is old enough for modern hardware to crack i done think business will collapse there will be some time for developing and adjusting everything both business and hackers have the same ressources the encrypter is always ahead of the hacker but im really concerned about archives of old encrusted data that gets encrusted years later when some hyper computer is invented . sure would suck if someone was able to hijack evos servers then they would know

reading has led me to believe that most classical cryptographic systems current deplored would fall victim to a quantum computer with one or two possible exceptions as an example the reason that aes exists is due to the potential of quantum computers according to shors algorithm the effective strength of of aes would be cut in half this means that aes would be reflectively reduced to bits while aes would be reduced to bits a bit cipher potentially possesses combinations or about x there are several algorithms which are believed immense to quantum computers meaning that the underlying mathematical problems are not as susceptible as say rsa or the discreet logs problem if quartus computers were really a reality then we all would be in a world of hurt as a great deal of electric
