i started ordering from imb in his first month vending on sr and used him up until he retired from market vending and used him via email a few times and thus lost it i have recently been going through checkpoint but held off for the past month to order through trust in us when he is ready but in getting to the point where if i dont have mama in least weeks i will be too broke to deal other drugs as well and halt my income completely til it arrives so i fear i have to go through europe vendors again as im not sure if trust will be able to pull through for me this time does anyone know if imb is still vending through wallet wallet transactions and if so if i could get his email im pretty sure i have his old pgp key still so ill confirm it that way thanks to whoever can help or at least give me a tip to what hes doing or if he retired . i started ordering from imb in his first month vending on sr and used him up until he retired from market vending and used him via email a few times and

i sure as hell have skills to avoid stupid mistakes that will compromise your anonymity i know how ross was caught because he is a arrogant fuck and that interfered with his judgement calls namely
