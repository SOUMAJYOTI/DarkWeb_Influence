standard paper folded inside an envelope use your own stealth be creative using foldable origami figures is just an idea make it look flat and nice it could be a birthday present as well if you are just sending a few trips chances are you ll be fine and you will be making your friends very happy you can also use the occasion to tell your friends why you love them and why they are so important to you so the letter is not just blank paper use your imagination and stay safe might be more than just a few but nothing too intense or serious everafterglow thanks for the in depth post to clarify what type of address would you use real complete bogus etc i would be handwriting so the note would look personal i imagine if using a real address then a random presidential might more fitting than a business if that even matters . while i agree it would be nice to send words of love then your handwriting is on it sending a note typed would also be odd that was why i suggested a magazine article so card doesnt appear empty my method is pretty overkill but if you want to protect your identity it is useful honestly though no matter how it goes your gon na be fine its just blotter . done it a

though no matter how it goes your gon na be fine its just blotter . my cents i would recommend for someone like yourself to go into a store and buy envelopes birthday cards alot of cards have spaces in between the front cover and the inside page a perfect place to stash the l take extra care to not touch the middle card because that is the one you are sending hand them to the cashier where he she will scan and hate to say touch the cards since youre not touching the middle card you can hand them over in a not sketch way as soon as you are out of the store or able place the middle card into a gallon ziplock bag send the other cards to your grandmother or whatever go home or to a clean location where marijuana is not present and hast been for a good amount of time in fact make sure that none of the items you will be using have come into contact with marijuana or other drugs wearing either heavy duty kitchen gloves or pairs of disposables wrap the tabs in some clean computer paper or a small baggie and place in the space between the front cover and the inside page and secure with scotch tape be very careful with scotch tape as hairs dust and skin particles can get stuck to it maybe insert a magazine newspaper article into the card place card in envelope run your gloved finger over tap water and use to smear the glue and seal shut a few extra pieces of tape to secure outside are not a bad idea but again use care put stamp on card put addresses on card using printer and labels if you cant do this and have to handwrite it use a sharpie marker write big and let ink bleed while you write it slowly in a handwriting that does not look like yours place envelope in new ziploc guess the old one will be of to use here drive to a distance of a few blocks of a blue box that is unlikely to have cameras go at night wear a hoodie anyway open the ziploc invert it so you can hold the envelope through the plastic and not touch the paper drop the envelope into the box bon
