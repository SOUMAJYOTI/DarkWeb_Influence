someone at some time is gon na get lucky and youll either be ripped off or worse yet busted the chances of this happening increase the longer you are in existence thats where ross and blake both

potentially agora may never return and who could blame them if they decided not to its a huge loss for the community albeit only a temporary one that will result in some big migration numbers to other

thats what youd expect the admin s to do well done to them for doing the right thing a rare trait in today world i wouldnt blame them if they didnt come back in fact i would argue that it would be wise of them not to return theyve had an excellent run of it without being hacked or busted and this streak of luck will not endure forever which i am sure they are well aware of i would even be so bold as to venture that some of the most vociferous arguments against their retirement will come from law enforcement connected accounts lea will be passed that all their work to date will very likely be for nought if agra disappears and does not return zaphod . its sad knowing theyll be taking the market off line for the immediate future but its a sensible thing to do if the information they have

made the tug pm utcgpg using rsa key b a a be gpg good signature from agora one gpg warning using intrusted key begin pgp signed message hash sha recently research had come that shed some light on vulnerabilities in tor hidden services protocol which could help to deanonymize serve locations most of the new and previously known methods do require substantial resources to be executed but the new research shows that the amount of resources could be much lower than expected and in our case we do believe we have interested parties who possess such resources we have a solution in the works which will require big changes into our software stack which we believe will mitigate such problems but unfortunately it will take time to implement additional we have recently been discovering suspicious activity around our servers which led us to believe that some of the attacks described in the research could be going on and we decided to move servers once again however this is only a temporary solution at this point while we dont have a solution ready it would be unsafe to keep our users using the service since they would be in jeopardy thus and to our great sadness we have to take the market offline for a while until we can develop a better solution this is the best course of action for everyone involved in the mean time we shall do our best to clear all upstanding orders and we ask all of you users who have money on their accounts withdraw them as soon as possible because we dont want to be responsible for it during the time when the market will be office during this time there might be some delays in payouts since many people are expected to withdraw money at the same time but we intend to resolve any such issues in the end but we advice you to use only destination bitcoin addresses that do not expire when you send money out from agora as the payments to them might get delayed while the market is office do not send any bitcoin to any of your deposit addresses on agora we do not gurantee the safety of any funds sent there vendors we strongly advice you to abort any orders that havent been sent out or professed yet as we can not gurantee what will happen with the orders in resolution we shall try to resolve it on a case by case basis but there might not be time to wait for orders that require long shipping times we are going to handle the situation with the vendor bonds soon we need some time to make sure that noone uses this as an opportunity to start scamming wildly all of the market data will be kept intact and be available upon return including

indeed this is the same trait that earned backopy his reputation quote from the jigsaw puzzle on august pmi certainly hope they do return some day soon but the reality of it all is that potentially agora may never return and who could blame them if they decided not to its a huge loss for the community albeit only a temporary one that will result in some big migration numbers to other markets for those loyal agora only users without accounts anywhere elseat least they made the correct decision to take the market off line rather than potentially putting all users of the site at risk thats what youd expect the admin s to do well done to them for doing the right thing a rare trait in today world i wouldnt blame them if they didnt come back in fact i would argue that it would be wise of them not to return theyve had an excellent run of it without being hacked or busted and this streak of luck will not endure forever which i am sure they are well aware of i would even be so bold as to venture that some of the most vociferous arguments against their retirement will come from law enforcement connected accounts lea will be passed that all their work to date will very likely be for nought if agra disappears and does not return zaphod . its sad knowing theyll be taking the market off line for the immediate future but its a sensible thing to do if the information they have is

accurate which it probably is at least the agra admin s put their opsec and the safety of all those involved above the greed shown by other past market admins indeed this is the same trait that earned backopy his reputation quote from the jigsaw puzzle on august pmi certainly hope they do return some day soon but the reality of it all is that potentially agora may never return and who could blame them if they decided not to its a huge loss for the community albeit only a temporary one that will result in some big migration numbers to other markets for those loyal agora only users without accounts anywhere elseat least they made the correct decision to take the market off line rather than potentially putting all users of the site at risk thats what youd expect the admin s to do well done to them for doing the right thing a rare trait in today world i wouldnt blame them if they didnt come back in fact i would argue that it would be wise of them not to return theyve had an excellent run of it without being hacked or busted and this streak of luck will not endure forever which i am sure they are well aware of i would even be so bold as to venture that some of the most vociferous arguments against their retirement will come from law enforcement connected accounts lea will be passed that all their work to date will very likely be for nought if agra disappears and does not return zaphod . quote from deepdotweb on february pmthis a paste of the elegant partcool thanks muchquote from barter on february pmi also read a list of the top rated markets agora is rated no and sr no but druglist was listed no so that will tell you how useful that list it was hehee . i find myself wondering if this is going to be azores backopy moment i e where they close down and retire obviously i have no idea just how much money theyve made but i suspect that its more than sufficient for them to retire on it might be a good idea just to retire while they can so they can quietly disappear into the sunset with their booty as long as theyre operating theyre going to be a prime target for lea and others and one of these days either lea or some hacker types are gon na get lucky in this game longevity is never guaranteed someone at some time is gon na get lucky and youll either be ripped off or worse yet busted the chances of this happening increase the longer you are in existence thats where ross and blake both sucked up they didnt have an exit strategy i have to give this to the agora admins at least they were navvy enough to see the handwriting on the wall like the song says you got ta know when to hold em know when to fold em know when to walk away know when to run zaphod . welcome to deepdotweb come change this page upload a new index html to your private html folder . what ever happened to ddw last i checked the site was also is there an dated list of all markets . i was reading on deep dot web about ramp russian anonymous market place i had heard of it before but never had the url i also read a list of the top rated markets agora is rated no and sr no but druglist was listed no so that will tell you how useful that list it was . i dont know if it was yesterday or the day before but it seemed like every time i tried it was i was trying links for lists of markets pgp guides a bunch of things could access anything all day looked at your subreddit
