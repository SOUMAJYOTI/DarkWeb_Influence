anymore according to the tor bandwidth port doesnt generate any bandwidth therefore i assume is the right one since it works . since all the onion servers stopped working for me and apparently a few

working folder and do ls lat the command line you will in part get something like rwxr xr x amnesia amnesia mar electrum rwxr xr x are the permissions amnesia amnesia is the user and group respectively in order to execute the script you need both the read and execute bits set if the permissions are incorrect they can be fixed by doing chmod electrumif the ownership is wrong you will have to open a root terminal and dochown amnesia amnesia electrum you can also ignore the execute bit if you simply runpython electrum arguments go here . i would need to know much more about your persistence set up to be able to answer those questions if you are downloading the electrum tarball every time then its likely that the source you got it from changed if you are packaging it up and storing it in the persistence partition its likely it was packages into a format that didnt support file permissions if you have a persistence partition that you are using its far more easy to use either the dotfiles persistence to store the electrum information and run it directly from the folder unpackaged in the partition or to run it in portable mode and not use dotfiles at all if you are storing it somewhere that is not your persistence partition then its very likely you are not storing it securely as to your second question i can not parse it to make sense are you encrypting files to yourself even if you are with the secret key you can make the public key being able to decrypt messages means that you must have the secret key the only thing that would possibly explain the behavior as you described is if you deleted your subkey for encrypting messages to you but then the prior messages were encrusted with the wrong key with the key that is supposed to be only used to verify your identity exactly what are you trying to do with gpg what are the actions you take what is the output that you get what is the expected output . heyim storing the unpacked electrum tarball was download about month ago and extracted in the persistent partition copying and pasting everytime i need it in top files but it probably messed up when i did an backup of the persistent partition onto an other

can happenim using tails on us stick and it worked fine in the beginning using the stick after having the problem i tried with the dvdhaving the same problem on two different non interconnected

anymore decrypting was still possible all in tails regards . heyi have been using electrum in tails pasting electrum in folder tpmcd tmp electrum electrum s ckl obj gypcu onion t p socks localhost
