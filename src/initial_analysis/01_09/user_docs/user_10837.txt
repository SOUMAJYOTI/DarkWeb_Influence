i have download the multibit client onto both a windows laptop and also a separate download onto a atop running ubuntu linux my questions are for both operating systems and they are when i am online and start the multibit client is my in address broadcast at anytime within the client when i am using it such as when it syncs with the btc network if i create say wallets in the client and issue one receiving address from each wallet to ten different people so they can pay me is it possible to see that all those addresses and wallets reside within the same multibit client like visiting blockchain and checking there can those addresses or wallets be traced back to either of my laptops and if so how and what can i do to stop this from happening cheers in advance . i have download the multibit

bit is powered by bitcoinj so thats really where you should be looking for answers first multibit doesn support the features of bitcoinj that allow pray support that means that every node you directly talk to in the network knows your ip and knows if you broadcast at transaction the only way to get around that current is to use something like whoonix which will enforce tor connections for all outgoing traffic by running in a virtual machine second multibit will use bloom filters to speed up block chain sync bloom filters are a potential privacy leak because they can tie addresses together a node that knows your bloom filter will be able to say know that certain transactions may be related to you altho it isnt proved if you want nothing in your wallet tied together via almost any means it will take some work keep your wallet completely office plate balances for each address using separate tor exit nodes and really several different public blockchain sites never tie two of your addresses together into a single tx or send or recieve money from the same address in your wallet if you need to spend grab the outputs from your address to be spent using an online computer sign offline and then push the tx out using an anonymous method like which will push the tx out to eligiuss pool . mufti bit is powered by bitcoinj so thats really where you should be looking for answers
