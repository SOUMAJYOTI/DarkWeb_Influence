quote from the real sigaint on january pmfor anything sensitive do not use a mobile phone look at the snowdon leaks mobile is sucked burners are sucked yes even signal on android has metadata leaks and the phones memory itself can be sifted through using a baseband backdoor the setup i prefer is buy a fast good vpn with mixed bitcoin use tor to do this chain your vpn to the end of a tor tunnel and purchase a voip account with mixed bitcoin this will hide the fact that you are using tor from the voip company it will make them nervous use fake details that would look real at first glance line up the fake address and geo with the vpn for extra points install a softphone on your laptop or wifi only adroit tablet laptop is likely more secure and it wont have a gps snip off the wires for the mid and camera use a headset that you have to physically plug in unplug when not in use use vpn to connect to voip provider use zrtp if possible as it will encrypt right to the pstn now you have a working encrusted phone it should protect where you physically are locked within reason you could chain many vpns together from many companies to obfuscate things more tor isnt robust enough yet to carry phone calls when it is use that instead its not perfect if you call people you know you will build up a social graph which will deanonymize you again the nsa has voice recognition systems that can likely figure out who you are if you are target by the nsa you will probably lose anyway if you are always calling a handful of people and can control both ends of the call you should forego all of this and build your own private encrusted voip network the tools already exist and its not terribly expensive zrtp is the way to go you could even do this directly from a cellar phone with the right voip client like zoiper on adroit end to end crypto with pfs but as you indicate cellar devices are owned by their baseband at least voip over tor does work though yes with some latency but it works sometimes you need to try a few different circuits until you get a fast one though voice latency as low as ms if you get a good onion circuit ending call create new tor identity and call again is the easiest non technical way to do this we have deplored onion sip servers using both asterisk and freeswitch in the past and enjoyed end to end zrtp goodness with the added pique of onion sauce you can even register a hidden service as your sip address and receive calls directly without having to relay through the server if you dont want to run a hidden service then you just maintain a connection to the onion sip gateway never tried it on i p although maybe in the future maybe we will try it . for anything sensitive do not use a mobile phone look at the snowdon leaks mobile is

you for your input do you have any opinions on using satellite phones occasionally for highly sensitive tasks several satellite phones have gas which can be disabled as far as i know i think that the most information a satellite itself would know about a phone is which antenna it is communicating to it with is this correct or should i not bother maybe satellite phones are also in the more trouble than its worth and looking strange to any observers category . does anyone know of a way to rotate a phones imei without buying a new phone is there a phone which allows programmable imeis swapping him cards is easy swapping imei is a complete annoyance cheers . thank you for your input do you have any opinions on using satellite phones occasionally for highly sensitive tasks several satellite

places avoid it if you are trying to keep a low profile there have been cell phones on the market before that cycle the imei but unless you swap sins prior to powering up then again they are just a red flag also some are badly implements and do stupid things like just increment the imei at each power cycle again a big flag the rule should be one imsi to one imei given the high likelihood for operator error or a technical malfunction it is probably better to buy cheap burners with contract free sims . for anything sensitive do not use a mobile phone look at the snowdon leaks mobile is

signal over a random wifi network how might that effect packet timing attacks i dont do anything real or important with my adroit devices but sometimes its nice to see how far we can take it as a pseudo anonymous platform its true google framework needs to be installed but afwall is a great firewall . quote from the real sigaint on january pmyes even signal on android has metadata leaks and the phones memory itself can be sifted through using a baseband backdoor can you elaborate here can you link to documentation that supports this i dont doubt signal metadata leaks simply would like to understand it in greater detail . quote from bishop on january man you elaborate here can you link to documentation that supports this i dont doubt signal metadata leaks simply would like to understand it in greater detail ill assume i can skip over the baseband being able to peek at the ram of the application processor and peel session keys out if you want me to elaborate i can well signal has to transmit your encrusted audio to the other person or use signals servers to relay it simple statistical analysis of the packet timing sizes and content instantly reveal who you are calling by lining up the caller and callees ip addresses look at signals source code its all the documentation you need in this regard btw this also the same reason why a vpn is not enough to thwart those sky intelligence agencies you need a mix mix networks such as tor and i p use things like padding onion gaelic routing and random is circuit selection to thwart these kinds of attacks im not saying that signal is horrible its really not it has its place it is easy to use and you gain some security with animal effort it is better than using a plain pstn call by far but you cant assume that you are anonymous your call contents will be private as long as you havent been target if you are target you are toast the baseband and adroit ios exploits are the usual suspects here not to mention on android you have to have the google framework installed and there doesn appear to be source code for it maybe there is source for some of it i could be wrong . quote from bishop on january man you
