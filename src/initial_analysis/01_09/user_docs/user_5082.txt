recording english speaking players use the letter k for king q for queen r for rook b for bishop and n for knight since k is already used pawns are not identified by uppercase letter but rather by the absence of one distinguishing between pawns is not necessary for recording moves since only one pawn can move to a given square pawn captures are an exception and indicated differently as explained below notation for moveseach move of a piece is indicated by the piece s uppercase letter plus the coordinate of the destination square for example be move a bishop to e of move a knight to f c move a pawn to c no piece letter in the case of pawn moves when a piece makes a capture an x is inserted immediately before the destination square for example bxe bishop captures the piece on e when a pawn makes a capture the file from which the pawn departed is used to identify the pawn for example exd pawn on the e file captures the piece on d en passant captures are indicated by specifying the capturing pawn s file of departure the x the destination square not the square of the captured pawn and rationally the suffix e p indicating the capture was en passant for example exd e p when two or more identical pieces can move to the same square the moving piece is unique identified by specifying the piece s letter followed by in descending order of preference the file of departure if they differ or the rank of departure if the files are the same but the ranks differ or both the file and rank if neither alone is sufficient to identify the piece which occurs only in rare cases where one or more pawns have promoted resulting in a player having three or more identical pieces able to reach the same square for example with knights on g and d either of which might move to f the move is specific as ngf or ndf as appropriate with knights on g and g the moves are n f or n f as above an x can be inserted to indicate a capture for example n xf another example two rooks on d and h either one of which may move to d if the rook on d moves to d it is possible to disambiguate with either rdd or r d but the file takes precedence over the rank so red is correct and likewise if the move is a
