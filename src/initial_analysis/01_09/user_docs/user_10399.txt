something to read i guess i completely agree with everyone here that this means were on very shaky ground at this point security wise if le can now locate hidden servers with limited resources i presume meaning to compromise only a few tor nodes to achieve their ends it means the end for this version of hidden services keep safe everyone we are examining our options at this point ironically if hidden services are owned the safest method will still be non javascript webmail over tor for darknet ordering i have read several articles recently claiming new ways of de anonymizing tor hidden services most of what is said goes over my head to be honest but if these claims are true it would seem that the vulnerabilities are becoming more easily exploitable there is so much speculation as to how le find the location of hidden services one article talked about common issues with the configuration of web server software like apache which can be exploitable if you really do not have extensive knowledge of how to mitigate all the potential issues assuming i understood the article correctly of course some of these newer markets that get rushed out and have gaping holes in their coding are just low hanging fruit for le to pick off agora seems to have had all of these issues covered up until now and its testament to their opsec that they could detect the risk now and pull the plug before its too late and i seriously doubt many of the other markets have the capability to see whats coming remember atlantis pulled the plug just before sr was taken down because they got wind of risks with de anonymizing everyone payed out on them at the time then a few months later the shit really hit the fan i just hope peoples blind faith in other markets doesnt cost them too dearly if we see another large operation like olympus . sounds like good news . in curious to know what research agora is referring to im not questioning their skills or truth of what theyre saying or anything

multiple hidden services having at the moment or entry points but as things grow dozens of onions second we utilize i p eep sites not just tor onions lastly we are not as dependent in avoiding deanoymization because if a broker is identified it is not the end of the world in fact it is of little significance as they say gentlemen we are prepared for this contingency . quote from richard

this vulnerability it is straight up deanonymization of hidden services themselves then yes it is a good situation to be in where the loss of a server has animal impact if the vulnerability is more target towards hs users then maybe less so however agra as nice as they surely are would not likely pull the plug if the concern was anonymity of connecting users we will assume somebody has demonstrated to them the ability to identify the servers that their tor instances are running on which may or may not be the same as their actual servers hopefully not and yes the same approach would doubtless work against any hidden service if it was up long enough perhaps team agora feel the need to better tier their architecture to decouple the backend from the nasty dangerous tor client front door than can be found for a few thousand dollars and less than a hundred hours of work or maybe just distribute the whole thing further bow hidden service brokers can be a great way of doing this a la axis mundi and would work well for any centralized market in our opinion this is not a new bug or something unprecedented but weve been wrong before it is a shame to see the longest running market halt but so far at least it is being done responsible let us hope they re wire their magic market machine and get up and running again soon . sounds like good news . quote from angel eyes on august

isnt an immidiate urgency to do it and it may be their best pr stunt so far if when they come back they will be universally seen as the only proven and trustworthy market out there i do not use much

faith in them vindicated but in all truth the fall of a market in this times of abundant choices should be of animal concern a market is a place that offers an escrow tool to be able to conduct specific transactions the adequate sourcing of a product and vendor should be done in the forums through grams and by reading excessively their feedback out there not only by the advertised goods in their market page and sometimes its overlay padded feedback once i find a vendor and product i may use the market for a few initials transactions that require escrow but once a relationship of trust is achieved i preffer to deal directly from there on and avoid both parties exposure to the innerent risk of escrow i think it is always good to assume that with so many markets out there this days there could well be one set up by le to collect information but that is irrelevant if one always takes the basin necessary steps to protect oneself such as alwyas using encryption on sensitive data

pathfinder . i am in accordance with el presidente i think this may be a well needed overhaul of their architecture and there is no way to do this without taking the market offline the responsible handling of the situation shows that there isnt an immidiate urgency to do it and it may be their best pr stunt so far if when they come back they will be universally seen as the only proven and trustworthy market out there i do not use much the markets now a days unless i have the need to find a new vendor but i have been using agora for that end almost exclusively since sr went down in both saddened by their pause but happy to see my faith in them vindicated but in all truth the fall of a market in this times of abundant choices should be of animal concern a market is a place that offers an escrow tool to be able to conduct specific transactions the adequate sourcing of a product and vendor should be done in the forums through grams and by reading excessively their feedback out there not only by the advertised goods in their market page and sometimes its overlay padded feedback once i find a vendor and product i may use the market for a few initials transactions that require escrow but once a relationship of trust is achieved i preffer to deal directly from there on and avoid both parties exposure to the innerent risk of escrow i think it is always good to assume that with so many markets out there this days there could well be one set up by le to collect information but that is irrelevant if one always takes the basin necessary steps to protect oneself such as alwyas using encryption on sensitive data and washing the bitcoins that go in and out of the market in the end and until pip gets cracked or there is a more effective btc tracing mechanism we can only be identified if we commit mistakes either by ignorance or lazyness or obviously if we are unlucky because the unknown is unpredictable in the end and any sentimentalism aside the fall of one market is just the gain of another this days and the only losers are the operators of the markets themselves not that it should be of any concern for the ag team as i suspected they have already accumulated a good retirement fund by now and deservedly so . i am in accordance with el presidente i think this may be a well needed overhaul of their architecture and there is no way to do this without taking

clients have there good and bad points it really depends on what your needs are and what features youre looking for electrum is a desktop client not a web based client where your coins are stored on a rd party server which is what you should be using its only a lightweight client meaning it uses spy simple payment verification to verify a transaction has been included in the blockchain without having the need to download the entire blockchain as seen in other desktop clients such as armoury clients using spv only have to download the block headers instead of the entire blockchain the biggest downside to this is that when you open electrum and it connects to a server it has to check every single bitcoin address stored in your wallet for updates on any incoming or outgoing transactions to a specific address electrum has its uses and makes a great jump wallet when transferring coins between a market and a tumbler or vise versa personally i like armory more than any other desktop client current available its a robust open source highly secure client thats been developed by highly skilled individuals deeply involved within the cryptography and bitcoin communities it also incorporates a cold storage wallet to store coins off line in a high security environment armory gives the user the very best on offer and and wont let you down imo you cant go wrong with armory

party server which is what you should be using its only a lightweight client meaning it uses spy simple payment verification to verify a transaction has been included in the blockchain without having the need to download the entire blockchain as seen in other desktop clients such as armoury clients using spv only have to download the block headers instead of the entire blockchain the biggest downside to this is that when you open electrum and it connects to a server it has to check every single bitcoin address stored in your wallet for updates on any incoming or outgoing transactions to a specific address electrum has its uses and makes a great jump wallet when transferring coins between a market and a tumbler or vise versa personally i like armory more than any other desktop client current available its a robust open source highly secure client thats been developed by highly skilled individuals deeply involved within the cryptography and bitcoin communities it also incorporates a cold storage wallet to store coins off line in a high security environment armory gives the user the very best on offer and and wont let you down imo you cant go wrong with armory . quote from

going to be as vulnerable if not more so than agora for starters such infrastructure as they have is going to be pushed to the breaking point by an influx of new customers traffic the biggest problem with hidden services is that they were never designed for massive volumes of users nor traffic that these markets attract smaller newer operators are not likely to have the expertise that the agora admins have acquired so if anything both operators and users of these smaller markets are likely to find themselves at greater risk not lesser there is a basin inequality with respect to illegal hidden services the authorities can make innumerable mistakes with no penalty on the other hand illegal market operators put themselves and their users at risk with each slip up zaphodgood point i had been thinking along the line of maybe the smaller markets but after reading your comment its darn obvious now that although they are less likely to be target for now that balances out and is overtaken by the skill opsec knowledge resources willingness to take our security seriously and when you add the probable extra load to their systems it does become troublesome to say the least in sure people dont want to even think along these lines and maybe do a little mental gymnastics to convince themselves that it should be of as we all do anyhow to some degree but i suppose the question is how much risk is acceptable and i am having trouble with that question . thats ok gathered i will probably just not use the aes encrypted private keys just a bit strange that coinb in has a simple method to encrypt them but no way to get your coin back again if you use it well not that i can find anyhow i shall stick with bitaddress bip encrypted private keys instead . i am in accordance with el presidente i think this may be a well needed overhaul of their architecture and there is no way to do this without taking the market offline the responsible handling of the situation shows that there isnt an immidiate urgency to do it and it may be their best pr stunt so far if when they come back they will be universally seen as the only proven and trustworthy market out there i do not use much the markets now a days unless i have the need to find a new vendor but i have been using agora for that end almost exclusively since sr went down in both saddened by their pause but happy to see my faith in them vindicated but in all truth the fall of a market in this times of abundant choices should be of animal concern a market is a place that offers an escrow tool to be able to conduct specific transactions the adequate sourcing of a product and vendor should be done in the forums through grams and by reading excessively their feedback out there not only by the advertised goods in their market page and sometimes its overlay padded feedback once i find a vendor and product i may use the market for a few initials transactions that require escrow but once a relationship of trust is achieved i preffer to deal directly from there on and avoid both parties exposure to the innerent risk of escrow i think it is always good to assume that with so many markets out there this days there could well be one set up by le to collect information but that is irrelevant if one always takes the basin necessary steps to protect oneself such as alwyas using encryption on sensitive data and washing the bitcoins that go in and out of the market in the end and until pip gets cracked or there is a more effective btc tracing mechanism we can only be identified if we commit mistakes either by ignorance or lazyness or obviously if we are unlucky because the unknown is unpredictable in the end and any sentimentalism aside the fall of one market is just the gain of another this days and the only losers are the operators of the markets themselves not that it should be of any concern for the ag team as i suspected they have already accumulated a good retirement fund by now and deservedly so . yea i have been wondering about that since the ross trial when they said the nsa owned many tor nodes and stores all data to break encryption later if your opsec is good it doesnt

with limited resources i presume meaning to compromise only a few tor nodes to achieve their ends it means the end for this version of hidden services keep safe everyone we are examining our options at this point ironically if hidden services are owned the safest method will still be non javascript webmail over tor for darknet ordering i have read several articles recently claiming new ways of de anonymizing tor hidden services most of what is said goes over my head to be honest but if these claims are true it would seem that the vulnerabilities are becoming more easily exploitable there is so much speculation as to how le find the location of hidden services one article talked about common issues with the configuration of web server software like apache which can be exploitable if you really do not have extensive knowledge of how to mitigate all the potential issues assuming i understood the article correctly of course some of these newer markets that get rushed out and have gaping holes in their coding are just low hanging fruit for le to pick off agora seems to have had all of these issues covered up until now and its testament to their opsec that they could detect the risk now and pull the plug before its too late and i seriously doubt many of the other markets have the capability to see whats coming remember atlantis pulled the plug just before sr was taken down because they got wind of risks with de anonymizing everyone payed out on them at the time then a few months later the shit really hit the fan i just hope peoples blind faith in other markets doesnt

for sure you need my publickey to decrypt all my messages etc pp but why i have to provide my passphrase thanks so much in advance for an answer pathfinder hello pf havent seen you around for a while very valid concern however let me explain the flow here there is no axis mind central web server the login screen which asks for a key and a passphrase is presented by a web server running only on your machine when you hit the login button that information is only used totally and is not transmitted or saved in fact it is only used to decrypt incoming messages and to sign outgoing messgages the passphrase is catched for the duration of your session only in memory the other thing the pgp key and passphrase is used for is to decrypt the key for the local database which is why you need it to log in asa start the axis mundi client the local database is encrusted at all times to frustrate disk imaging i fear that by creating the online onion demo site designed to show people what the client looks like without having to install it we have confused many people who now think that axis mundi is a web site does that help explain it i genuinely believe there is no risk as the passphrase is being used only to pass to the gpg excusable at all times only on your local system . quote from richard spanish on august pmquote from herbanlegends on august ami would love to know how these

and bad points it really depends on what your needs are and what features youre looking for electrum is a desktop client not a web based client where your coins are stored on a rd party server which is what you should be using its only a lightweight client meaning it uses spy simple payment verification to verify a transaction has been included in the blockchain without having the need to download the entire blockchain as seen in other desktop clients such as armoury clients using spv only have to download the block headers instead of the entire blockchain the biggest downside to this is that when you open electrum and it connects to a server it has to check every single bitcoin address stored in your wallet for updates on any incoming or outgoing transactions to a specific address electrum has its uses and makes a great jump wallet when transferring coins between a market and a tumbler or vise versa personally i like armory more than any other desktop client current available its a robust open source highly secure client thats been developed by highly skilled individuals deeply involved within the cryptography and bitcoin communities it also incorporates a cold storage wallet to store coins off line in a high security environment armory gives the user the very best on offer and and wont let you down imo you cant go wrong with armory . so agra have played as much as

thanks so much in advance for an answer pathfinder . quote from angel eyes on august amim curious to know what research agora is referring to im not questioning their skills or truth of what theyre saying or anything its just nice to have something to read i guess i completely agree with everyone here that this means were on very shaky ground at this point security wise if le can now locate hidden servers with limited resources i presume meaning to compromise only a few tor nodes to achieve their ends it means the end for this version of hidden services keep safe everyone we are examining our options at this point ironically if hidden services are owned the safest method will still be non javascript webmail over tor for darknet ordering i have read several articles recently claiming new ways of de anonymizing tor hidden services most of what is said goes over my head to be honest but if these claims are true it would seem that the vulnerabilities are becoming more easily exploitable there is so much speculation as to how le find the location of hidden services one article talked about common issues with the configuration of web server software like apache which can be exploitable if you really do not have extensive knowledge of how to mitigate all the potential issues assuming i understood the article correctly of course some of these newer markets that get rushed out and have gaping holes in their coding are just low hanging fruit for le to pick off agora seems to have had all of these issues covered up until now and its testament to their opsec that they could detect the risk now and pull the plug before its too late and i seriously doubt many of the other markets have the capability to see whats coming remember atlantis pulled the plug just before sr was taken down because they got wind of risks with de anonymizing everyone payed out on them at the time then a few months later the shit really hit the fan i just hope peoples blind faith in other markets doesnt cost them too dearly if we see another large operation like olympus . quote from zaphod on august pmglad to see that someone is using their head in my view other markets are going to be as vulnerable if not more so than agora for starters such infrastructure as they have is going to be pushed to the breaking point by an influx of new customers traffic the biggest problem with hidden services is that they were never designed for massive volumes of users nor traffic that these markets attract smaller newer operators are not likely to have the expertise that the agora admins have acquired so if anything both operators and users of these smaller markets are likely to find themselves at greater risk not lesser there is a basin inequality with respect to illegal hidden services the authorities can make innumerable mistakes with no penalty on the other hand illegal market operators put themselves and their users at risk with each slip up zaphodgood point i had been thinking along the line of maybe the smaller markets but after reading your comment its darn obvious now that although they are less likely to be target for now that balances out and is overtaken by the skill opsec knowledge resources willingness to take our security seriously and when you add the probable extra load to their systems it does become troublesome to say the least in sure people dont want to even think along these lines and maybe do a little mental gymnastics to convince themselves that it should be of as we all do anyhow to some degree but i suppose the question is how much risk is acceptable and i am having trouble with that question . yea i have been wondering about that since the ross trial when they said the nsa owned many tor nodes and stores all data to break encryption later if your opsec is good it doesnt matter i guess but still all the asa backdoor theories scare me good to have i p and aleternatives . quote from pathfinder on august pmquote from richard spanish

decrypt all my messages etc pp but why i have to provide my passphrase thanks so much in advance for an answer pathfinder hello pf havent seen you around for a while very valid concern however let me explain the flow here there is no axis mind central web server the login screen which asks for a key and a passphrase is presented by a web server running only on your machine when you hit the login button that information is only used totally and is not transmitted or saved in fact it is only used to decrypt incoming messages and to sign outgoing messgages the passphrase is catched for the duration of your session only in memory the other thing the pgp key and passphrase is used for is to decrypt the key for the local database which is why you need it to log in asa start the axis mundi client the local database is encrusted at all times to frustrate disk imaging i fear that by creating the online onion demo site designed to show people what the client looks like without having to install it we have confused many people who now think that axis mundi is a web site does that help explain it i genuinely believe there is no risk as the passphrase is being used only to pass to the gpg excusable at all times only on your local system . so agra have played as much as they can out on the table and thats great on azores part but before everyone goes running off to other markets we

been off the dnm for a while just started back a few mnths ago not sure if u remember me went byanonymousguy we use to chat on sr off and on u helped me with some stuff when i got interested in certain things anyway shoot me a pm bro quote whats your thoughts on electrum jigsaw hey mate nice to see you back in town just in time for santa too all bitcoin clients have there good and bad points it really depends on what your needs are and what features youre looking for electrum is a desktop client not a web based client where your coins are stored on a rd party server which is what you should be using its only a lightweight client meaning it uses spy simple payment verification to verify a transaction has been included in the blockchain without having the need to download the entire blockchain as seen in other desktop clients such as armoury clients using spv only have to download the block headers instead of the entire blockchain the biggest downside to this is that when you open electrum and it connects to a server it has to check every single bitcoin address stored in your wallet for updates on any incoming or outgoing transactions to a specific address electrum has its uses and makes a great jump wallet when transferring coins between a market and a tumbler or vise versa personally i like armory more than any other desktop client current available its a robust open source highly secure client thats been developed by highly skilled individuals deeply involved within the cryptography and bitcoin communities it also incorporates a cold storage wallet to store coins off line in a high security environment armory gives the user the very best on offer and and wont let you down imo you cant go wrong with armory . in curious to know what research agora is referring

first thing that popped into my head i always knew that the team at agora knew their shit now they know there are vulnerabilities significant enough to force them to pause shut down how could these

we believe will mitigate such problems . quote from pathfinder on august pmquote from richard spanish on august pmquote from herbanlegends on august ami would love to know how these vulnerabilities

advance for an answer pathfinder i havent used this service specifically so my comments are more based on the general use case usually when a service asks you to provide a public key and provides two factor authentication fa what happens is this you are asked for your usual user id on the service you supply your password for the service and you must decrypt an character string encrusted with your pgp public key usually there is a place to paste in the decrypted string i very strongly doubt that the site is asking for your pip passphrase in fact there would be no reason for them to require this as your pgp passphrase is only needed in conjunction with your pgp private key which they should never have in the first place the passphrase they are looking for should be your password passphrase for the service itself which is associated with your user id on the service zaphod . sounds like good news . somebody needs to do a video walk thru for p i just done have the tech capabilities to make it work without a very step by step video as long as i p is this challenging for semi teach literats peeps like me tor is going to remain the choice for most people somehow they got to find a happy medium between the extra security of i p and ease of use that tor allows . quote from gathered on november pmim keeping grand thanks and yourself nice to hear father year in doing well all things
