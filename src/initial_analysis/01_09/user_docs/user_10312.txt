paper by security researchers a piece of software in html the technology used to let people read sites on the web tells websites how much battery is left in a users phone and is intended to allow websites to help preserve battery if phones are running low but that same information can be used to identify phones as they move around the internet allowing people to be tracked websites and the scripts that run on them don t have to ask users permission to see how much charge is left so phones will respond to the request to say how much charge they have and how long it will take them to power back up that information can then be used as a way of identifying the phones themselves without their users ever knowing a website could put those two numbers together and watch for a phone with an identical or similar profile appearing on other pages for instance malicious people could then put those two events together and work out that the same phone had accesse both websites which can
