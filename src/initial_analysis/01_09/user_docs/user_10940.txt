a stupid question but if the malware is being infected through the browser when visiting certain onion sites also having something to do with the packet header does this mean le is setting up on nodes

to judge anyway the point is that it was very hard trying to get some hard facts out of that mess of stoned writing but i managed to get something out of itanyway this doesnt appear to be something that passively attacks whoever happens to be on its way it rather sounds like a targetted attack if you get what it means my guess is someone with a good budget used a firmware backdoor used only for special targets and installed some nasty malware and that it doesnt have to require visiting some nice onion to do its joball those writings remind me of some people who went paranoid after such attacks and again who am i to judge afterall paranoia never killed anyone and so on my point is that i suspect most of firmwares these days offer factory installed backdoors and these backdoors are not used widely so that the users wont destroy the industry especially that nasty intel with vero and the like but there are special occasions some poor victim gets selected so that the nasties can practice their nasty rootkitsnow why would you browse some hidden drug sites on your phone that orbot is supposed to help you have some privacy against nose isp while browsing some cat sites and not

dropping response reaction to the malware over at cryptostorm do you all think this malware was cooked up by anyone other than a government agency . quote from knuckles on april pmcould be fed as its well known agora banned tsc a while back i very much doubt that tsc is behind the cryptostorm site where the original article s were posted zaphod . quote from t s c on april amyeah what really made me take a step back was when i read something on i think it was the deepdotweb forums or perhaps reddit right around the time that it happened to me a bunch of users were complaining about an error message they were getting when trying to access the site through their phones i think using orbot and firefox or something it was right around the time when the web server for agora was throwing up the file not found error people that accessed using their phones were getting a download dialogue box as if the server was throwing up a file that wasnt visible as a seperate download from the pc s all these people were clicking download as if it would somehow magical serve up the agora page after it was at that moment i realised we were truly sucked lol did you see the leaned asa slides from last year about deanonymising tor users there was one slide there saying the majority of users were so stupid that the effort required to deanonymise would be animal after seeing this wave of users actually try to connect using their phones just to get the same download prompt man the nsa got it right that time were you accessing tor from a phone or a computer did you download a file from the agora market . quote from goodiegumdrops on april amwe are not computer experts by any means this could be troubling for hidden services if true forgive if this is a stupid question but if the malware is being infected through the browser when visiting certain onion sites also having something to do with the packet header does this mean le is setting up on nodes and able to target certain visited urls in simpler terms would they be able to see from monitoring an exit node that a tor user is visiting a target url such as the seperate vendor urls and then inject this malware for all users coming out the le controlled exit node and connecting to the target uri reading the guys seemingly jaw dropping response reaction to the malware over at cryptostorm do you all think this malware was cooked up by anyone other than a government agency this kind of multi stage computer invasion is definitely asa level spookery the way i think it works is that when you make a request to tor for a hidden service url a compromise tor node that sees handles that request can rascally hijack your request sending you not just the data from the hidden onion server but also some devious code that somehow breaks out of your browser into your os writing the first stage of the malware onto your hard drive in a way that you cant really see it and then it can own your system this means that turning off javascript like many of us do in our tor browser will not save you from this attack you have to be unlucky enough to have your request to the hidden service get sent to a compromise tor node but we really have no idea how many tor nodes are compromise do we . good fellows the original writeup on cryptostorm is something someone would write while very high now who am i to judge anyway the point is that it was very hard trying to get some hard facts out of that mess of stoned writing but i managed to get something out of itanyway this doesnt appear to be something that passively attacks whoever happens to be on its way it rather sounds like a targetted attack if you get what it means my guess is someone with a good budget used a firmware backdoor used only for special targets and installed some nasty malware and that it doesnt have to require visiting some nice onion to do its joball those writings remind me of some people who went paranoid after such attacks and again who am i to judge afterall paranoia never killed anyone and so on my point is that i suspect most of firmwares these days offer factory installed backdoors and these backdoors are not used widely so that the users wont destroy the industry especially that nasty intel with vero and the like but there are special occasions some poor victim gets selected so that the nasties can practice their nasty rootkitsnow why would you browse some hidden drug sites on your phone that orbot is supposed to help you have some privacy against nose isp while browsing some cat sites and not be some ultimate security solution . good fellows the original writeup on cryptostorm is something someone would write while very high now who am i to judge anyway the point is that it was very hard trying to get some
