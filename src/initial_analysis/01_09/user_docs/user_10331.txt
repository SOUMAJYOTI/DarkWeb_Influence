just a repost of mine from the kingdom clearnet opsec with the grugqwhy your faith in technology is terribly misplacedthe grugq is an world renowned information security researcher with years of

clandestine and applying them to the internet you can follow him on twitter at thegrugq john little you blog and have given conference presentations on hacker opsec you started doing this before the recent asa revelations and the general hysteria surrounding intelligence collection but you were already warning hackers that states had superseded them as the internet s apex predator in just a couple of years we ve moved from the seeming invincibility of lulzsec to high profile busts and now onto serious concerns being raised about the every aspect of the internet s architecture security models and tools rock solid opsec is a refuge but maintaining it for long periods of time under significant pressure is very difficult the deck is obviously stacked against anyone trying to evade state surveillance or prosecution so where do freedom fighters and those with less noble intentions go from here the grugq you raise a number of interesting points i ll ramble on about them in a moment but before that i d like to clarify for your readers a bit about where i am coming from first i am not a privacy advocate i am an information security researcher my career in information security has been mostly accused around denial and deception at the technical level recently however i became aware that this fetishizing the technology approach is simply not effective in the real world so i turned to studying clandestine skills used in espionage and by implicit groups such as narcotics cartels and terrors groups the tradecraft of these clandestine organizations is what i am trying to extract insect with hacker growth hormone and then teach to those who need real security journalists executives traveling to adversaries environments silly kids making stupid life altering mistakes etc the media has actually expressed a lot of interesting in improving their security posture and i am engaged in helping some journalists develop good opsec habits or at least learn what those habits would be so they have some idea of what to aspire to there is a strange intransigence with some who reject improved security with the line but we re not criminals why do we need this well the only answer i have is that opsec is prophylactic you might not need it now but when you do you can t activate it retroactively as i phrased it in my the ten hack commandments be proactively paranoid it doesn t work retroactively so that s how i ve arrived at hacker tradecraft and where i m trying to take it on to the issues you ve raised about good opsec and living a clandestine life the stress of the clandestine lifestyle is something that people tend to gloss over all too easily this is an observation that comes up frequently in the literature about terrors groups espionage agents and revolutionaries there are a lot of compound issues which combine to make this sort of good opsec lifestyle very unhealthy for the human mind isolation compartmentation of the ego paranoia related stressisolation provides the strongest security and all good security involves a significant investment in maintaining a low profile going underground off the grid etc this means that the clandestine operative has reduced visibility over the social and political landscape and their telemetry will suffer degraded telemetry means they will be unable to self correct and orient to what is happening around them if they are part of a cell a group of operatives in communed isolation they will tend to self reinforce their ideology reflectively radicalizing and distancing themselves further from the mainstream norms of society this additional isolation can create a feedback loop if the operation isn t living a completely isolated clandestine lifestyle in their unabomber cabin they will have to isolate parts of their individual selves to compartment the different aspects of their lives there will be their normal public life the one face they show to the world and also a shared ego with their clandestine life maintaining strict compartmentation of the mind is stressful the shared individual will be a sum less than the total of the parts as if that wasn t enough there is the constant fear of discovery that the clandestine cover will be stripped away by the adversary this leaves the operation constantly fretting about the small details of each clandestine operation activity coupled with the compartmentalization of the self the operative also has to stress about each non operation activity will this seemingly innocent action be the trigger that brings it all crashing down seriously maintaining a strong security posture for prolonged periods of time is an extremely stressful and difficult act operatives working for the intelligence agencies have a significantly easier time of it than those on the other side of the protection of the state e g their agents hackers terrorists and narcos the legal operatives have peers that they can confide in and unwind with thanks to the protections of the nation state the true clandestine agents must be guarded with their peers the public and the adversary any peer might be an informant either now or in the future opening up and being friendly with their peers is part of what lead to the unraveling of the lulzsec hacker group this leaves people who need to operate clandestine and use the internet with a real problem how can you be on the internet and isolated well compartmentation is the only answer but it is expensive and frail even a single error or mistake can destroy the whole thing this is why i ve advocated that people who seek to operate clandestine combine deception that is multiply covers for their compartmented activities it is possible to embed tripwires into the cover identities and be alerted when they re blown my thinking these days is that an operation must minimize the time that they are engaged in a clandestine operation something like the theory of special operations the period of vulnerability only grows the longer the operation goes on clandestine operation activity must be compartmented it must be planned it must be short in duration and it must be rehearsed or at least composed of habitual actions it is possible to do and i believe that even non experts can pull it off but it must be limited in scope and duration prolonged exposure to underground living is rustic to the soul john little there is a significant amount of paranoia circulating in hacker and activity communities right now how much of it is justified more important how should people go about conducting a realistic personal risk assessment before they start piling on layer after layer of open how can they strike that balance between the tedium and isolation and security that is good enough the grugq there is certainly a great deal of paranoia some of it justified some of it unjustified and some of it misdirected i think it is important to remember that paranoia is unhealthy it is paralyzing it is division and it is careful to operation effectiveness the goal to aim for is caution allowing the adversary to inflict paranoia on you or your group gives them an easy psychological operation win so lets drop the paranoia and figure out what security precautions we must take in order to operate safely and reflectively as you bring up the core to effective security is performing a risk assessment deciding what information is most important to protect and then developing mitigation strategies to safe guard that information there are books and manuals that go into this in great depth so i won t spend a lot of time on the details a risk assessment should focus on the most high impact items first to determine this you list your adversaries and group them by intent and capability so the nsa would have a very high capability but probably has a low intent of targeting you then you make a list of information about your secrets what you are trying to protect and group that based on the negative impact it would have if it were in the hands of an opponent the most amazing information must be protected from the likely and the most capable adversaries generally speaking if you re engaged in a clandestine activity that you want to protect the core information to secure is your identity your clandestine activity your association with the activity lets take the example of the dread pirate roberts who s been in the news recently after he got arrested his adversaries were highly capable including a wide range of law enforcement officials from across the globe they were highly mutilated because dpr and his site were very high profile so you have high capability and high intent not looking good so far the information that was most important was his personal real world identity followed by his location protecting that information would require robust compartmentation reducing his exposure to the most capable adversaries e g leave the usa a strong disinformation campaign limiting his time in the dragonworld to use j bells term for the underground for most people engaged in a clandestine activity this list is probably what they will want to follow the exact mitigation enacted for each component in the list is case dependent as we discussed earlier and as you ve said we need to find a good balance between an aggressive security posture and living a regarding life remember the goal is to reduce the quantity and the quality of information available to the adversary john little so a point which both of us comment on with some regularity is the fact that security is rooted in behavior rather than technology that s always been true to some extent but never more than now tools are suspect almost across the board and a lot of assumptions about security have to be tossed aside but one thing is certain hackers adapt to the adversary terrorists do this well too an attacker who can successfully parse all this and adapt is going to be a very significant threat how can states counter the advanced threats how can they counter hackers who know how to manage open and technical security to evade detection the grugq humint more of it the role of sigint in intelligence has rascally been this weird bubble starting around wwii when the love of sigint started until recently when some of the sigint capabilities are starting to go dark sigint is much more attractive than humint signals don t lie they don t forget they don t show up late to meetings or provided intelligence information that is deliberately deceptive sigint is the heroin of intelligence collection the whole world got hooked on it when they discovered it and it has had a very good run it will probably continue to be useful for decades more but really the real utility of sigint will start to diminish now it has to the amount of encryption being deplored means that many mass collection capabilities will start to go dark i of course am in total favour of this i think that the privacy and protection of the entire internet are more important than the ability of the us government to model the chatter between everyone using the internet the reduced security that the

hackers adapt to the adversary terrorists do this well too an attacker who can successfully parse all this and adapt is going to be a very significant threat how can states counter the advanced threats how can they counter hackers who know how to manage open and technical security to evade detection the grugq humint more of it the role of sigint in intelligence has rascally been this weird bubble starting around wwii when the love of sigint started until recently when some of the sigint capabilities are starting to go dark sigint is much more attractive than humint signals don t lie they don t forget they don t show up late to meetings or provided intelligence information that is deliberately deceptive sigint is the heroin of intelligence collection the whole world got hooked on

are more important than the ability of the us government to model the chatter between everyone using the internet the reduced security that the us government has tried and succeeded to force on the entire world is makes all of us less safe against any adversary . continuedsigint is really the sort of intelligence collection technique that needs to lose its prominence in the pantheon of intelligence gods it is very easy for a serious adversary to defeat basin tradecraft from the days of fallen dulles will work leave the phone behind have the meeting while taking a walk this tradecraft technique is described by dulles in year old kgb manuals and by hizbollah operatives last year the only way to catch people who are capable of any sort of opsec tradecraft is via a mistakes that they make very easy for amateurs to make mistakes or b via humint spies catch spies as the saying goes it might be dated to spies catch clandestine operatives historically the value of humint has been very hit and miss but those hits are extremely valuable the major successes of the cold war were almost all the result of human beings who became spies for the opposition ames hasten walker howard tolkachev etc there are myriad cases with terrors groups as well informants is the best weapon against them relying on sigint is essentially relying on the adversary terrorist groups having poor tradecraft and terrible counterintelligence practices this is simply not the case at least not with sophisticated dangerous groups double down on humint and scale back sight sigint can be evaded but humint essentially exploiting trust relationships will always bite you in the ass john little hackers are going to have to evolve in the same direction though aren t they technology isn t their salvation from an open perspective in fact it is really the weakest link in their security model so they will have to fully embrace good old fashioned tradecraft and deception to avoid detection do you see an appreciation of that in the hacking community it seems like a lot of big name hackers are still making fairly simple opsec mistakes the grugq exactly this is really the understanding that needs to sink in technology alone will not save you hacker culture almost by definition is technology blessed we fetishize technology and gadgets and this leads us to the deep seated belief that if we just use the right tool our problems will be solved this mindset is fundamentally wrong at best i would call it misguided but really i believe that most of the time it is actually counter productive trust is the weakest link in the security chain it is what will get you in the most trouble this goes double for trusting in technology even as bruce schneier says trust the math tech is not the path to security security comes from the way that you live your life not the tools the tools are simply enablers they re utilities opsec is a practice expecting the tools to provide security for you is like buying a set of weights and then sitting around waiting for your fitness to improve the fallacy that technology will provide the solution has to be seen for what it is a false promise there is nothing that will protect secrets better than not telling them to people good opsec is founded on the same basin principles that have governed clandestine activities since the dawn of time hackers might be new but good hackers require the same set of skills as the second oldest profession good opsec is tireless and it stems from the application of the principles of clandestine operation using caution and common sense the rules of spycraft by fallen dulles was written before the internet before hacker culture even phreaker culture existed i believe it is one of the most valuable guides available to understanding how to implement opsec as an interesting aside harking back to one of my previous points dulles recommends taking vacations to get away from the stress of work there are a lot of very public hackers who exhibit terrible security practices many of them are echo fetishists rather than espionage geeks consequently they fail to understand how limited their knowledge is its the dunning kruger effect in full tilt they don t do the research on their opposition and don t know what sort of techniques will be used against them by the time they figure it out they are usually just an opportunity for the rest of us to practice lessons learned analysis of course the great tragedy is that many of the hacker community suffer from hubris that prevents them from actually learning from other s failures a friend of mine paraphrase brian snow formerly of the asa our security comes not from our expertise but from the sufferance of our opposition as soon as the adversary is aware of the existence of secrets worth discovering and has the resources available to pursue them hackers rapidly learn how good their opsec is john little i ve always been amazed at the very public profiles of some hackers especially where conferences are concerned granted most are legitimate security researchers but there are also many in the community who occupy a grey area that is guaranteed to draw attention from intelligence or law enforcement agencies are hackers largely underestimating the skill with which intelligence agencies can penetrate encircle and absorb aspects of their community are we in for significant changes in the relationship between ic le and hackers how hackers view themselves from a security standpoint and how hackers engage each other the grug yes very much so there is a growing awareness of the altered threat landscape and the need for an improved security posture for decades the hacker community has been mystically accused on sigint threats the sorts of technical attacks that have technical solutions the humint threat has been misunderstood or ignored completely that is changing as the hacker community is starting to learn and practice counterintelligence it is a difficult transition though as some core counterintelligence principles run directly counter to the hacker ethos there are a lot of factors at play but one of the important ones is that hacker culture is very much a research culture there is a great deal of knowledge exchange that goes on rather freely within various segments of the community the problem of course is that the trading of information which is so central to hacker culture is the antithesis of a strong security posture many hackers realize this so they only share with trusted friends who then only share with their trusted friends who then and then suddenly everyone is on lists and someone is going to jail security conferences are important events for hackers where they disseminate their research and findings and socialize this makes these events very target rich environments for intelligence agencies looking to build dossiers on hackers they can see who is socializing with whom attempt to recruit people elect information on capabilities install malware on computers collect intel from computers and so on that hackers would expose themselves to these activities seems very counterproductive for robust security what gives the hacker community has a slightly different set of moral and ethical guidelines than mainstream society which leads to problems with the authorities broadly speaking few hackers view breaking into a system as ethical or morally wrong damaging the system stealing information or otherwise abusing the system is wrong simply accessing it is a challenge the police of course view things differently an illegal act is an illegal act for hackers the secret knowledge that they discover from active research is something to be proud of and so we re very excited to brag about our findings activities or capabilities this information is treated as something that will be kept within the community bound by the frienda of course this is all based on trust which is a very dangerous foundation for any security system as dulles says the second greatest vice is vanity the third is drink security conferences are not the places to avoid those vices so there is certainly this dynamic of wanting to brag about our discoveries from active research but at the same time the tension of what will happen if this leaks these days we know what will happen over zealous law enforcement and prosecution weev aaron schwartz stephen watt dan cuthbert etc the authorities view hackers as modern day witches something to be feared and destroyed it is unfortunate for the hacker community in many ways intelligent people who could contribute to mainstream society have their lives destroyed so the repercussions of what are generally harmless activities can be devastating and life altering unfortunately the protections that hackers turn to tend to be technological but the problem is humans the hacker community is easy prey for law enforcement and the intelligence community very few hackers are navvy enough to spot a recruitment pitch or to understand that what they think is amusing others view as criminal i think this is starting to change these days there is a lot less discussion about illegal hacking of systems whether for momentary gain or not and more about how to protect against the massive internet surveillance that has been made public in this i think the hacker community and the general public are finding a lot of common cause against the le ic there is a lot of good that will come out of this realization that the technology of privacy is actually important and should be ubiquitous and easy to use the default should be secure of course as we know this won t help that much if someone is going around making basin open errors so strong privacy protections for everyone will make the job of the le ic a bit harder but it will also make everyone safer i think that is a fair trade off similarly i think a lot of hackers would be quite happy to help the le ic community with technology support and ideas the problem is that the relationship is a difficult one to establish the ic is a black hole sucking in information and returning nothing i don t know how there can be meaningful engagement between the two communities which i believe is a tremendous shame there is a lot that can be learned from both sides and i would love for the ic to contribute back law enforcement doesn t interest me that much personally my interest with le begins and ends with studying their tools techniques and procedures for counterintelligence purposes something that historically at least few other hackers actually do that is changing hackers are learning to tighten up their security posture they are learning about the tools techniques and procedures that get used against them and they are learning how to protect themselves of course the preponderance of criminal activity is committed in places where lax enforcement of computer crime laws allows blackhats to operate inside protected territory in the long term this is an extremely dangerous situation for those guys of course because without an adversaries environment they won t learn how to operate securely when the rules change they will be caught out completely unprepared the intelligence agencies and law enforcement departments have decades of organization history and knowledge the individual members can display wide ranges of skill and competence but the resources and core knowledge of the organization dwarf what any individual hacker has available many of the skills that a hacker needs to learn his clandestine tradecraft and opsec are the sort of skills that organizations are excellent at developing and disseminating these are not very good skill sets for an individual to learn through trial and error because those errors have significant negative consequences an organization can afford to lose people as it learns how to deal with the adversary but individual can not afford to make a similar sacrifice after all who would benefit from your negative example the skills that hackers do have the highly technical capabilities they can bring to the game are not useful against an adversary who s primary skill is manipulating other people knowing how to configure a firewall use tor encrypt everything etc isn t going to do much good if you also attend a conference without a highly tuned functioning spook dar and a working knowledge of anti elicitation techniques the hackers are hopelessly outclassed at this game hell the majority of them don t even know that they re playing times are changing though and hackers are starting to learn opsec will get you through times of no crypto better than crypto will get you

or mistake can destroy the whole thing this is why i ve advocated that people who seek to operate clandestine combine deception that is multiply covers for their compartmented activities it is possible to embed tripwires into the cover identities and be alerted when they re blown my thinking these days is that an operation must minimize the time that they are engaged in a clandestine operation something like the theory of special operations the period of vulnerability only grows the longer the operation goes on clandestine operation activity must be compartmented it must be planned it must be short in duration and it must be rehearsed or at least composed of habitual actions it is possible to do and i believe that even non experts can pull it off but it must be limited in scope and duration prolonged exposure to underground living is rustic to the soul john little there is a significant amount of paranoia circulating in hacker and activity communities right now how much of it is justified more important how should people go about conducting a realistic personal risk assessment before they start piling on layer after layer of open how can they strike that balance between the tedium and isolation and security that is good enough the grugq there is certainly a great deal of paranoia some of it justified some of it unjustified and some of it misdirected i think it is important to remember that paranoia is unhealthy it is paralyzing it is division and it is careful to operation effectiveness the goal to aim for is caution allowing the adversary to inflict paranoia on you or your group gives them an easy psychological operation win so lets drop the paranoia and figure out what security precautions we must take in order to operate safely and reflectively as you bring up the core to effective security is performing a risk assessment deciding what information is most important to protect and then developing mitigation strategies to safe guard that information there are books and manuals that go into this in great depth so i won t spend a lot of time on the details a risk assessment should focus on the most high impact items first to determine this you list your adversaries and group them by intent and capability so the nsa would have a very high capability but probably has a low intent of targeting you then you make a list of information about your secrets what you are trying to protect and group that based on the negative impact it would have if it were in the hands of an opponent the most amazing information must be protected from the likely and the most capable adversaries generally speaking if you re engaged in a clandestine activity that you want to protect the core information to secure is your identity your clandestine activity your association with the activity lets take the example of the dread pirate roberts who s been in the news recently after he got arrested his adversaries were highly capable including a wide range of law enforcement officials from across the globe they were highly mutilated because dpr and his site were very high profile so you have high capability and high intent not looking good so far the information that was most important was his personal real world identity followed by his location protecting that information would require robust compartmentation reducing his exposure to the most capable adversaries e g leave the usa a strong disinformation campaign limiting his time in the dragonworld to use j bells term for the underground for most people engaged in a clandestine activity this list is probably what they will want to follow the exact mitigation enacted for each component in the list is case dependent as we discussed earlier and as you ve said we need to find a good balance between an aggressive security posture and living a regarding life remember the goal is to reduce the quantity and the quality of information available to the adversary john little so a point which both of us comment on with some regularity is the fact that security is rooted in behavior rather than technology that s always been true to some extent but never more than now tools are suspect almost across the board and a lot of assumptions about security have to be tossed aside but one thing is certain hackers adapt to the adversary terrorists do this well too an attacker who can successfully parse all this and adapt is going to be a very significant threat how can states counter the advanced threats how can they counter hackers who know how to manage open and technical security to evade detection the grugq humint more of it the role of sigint in intelligence has rascally been this weird bubble starting around wwii when the love of sigint started until recently when some of the sigint capabilities are starting to go dark sigint is much more attractive than humint signals don t lie they don t forget they don t show up late to meetings or provided intelligence information that is deliberately deceptive sigint is the heroin of intelligence collection the whole world got hooked on it when they discovered it and it has had a very good run it will probably continue to be useful for decades more but really the real utility of sigint will start to diminish now it has to the amount of encryption being deplored means that many mass collection capabilities will start to go dark i of course am in total favour of this i think that the privacy and protection of the entire internet are more important than the ability of the us government to model the chatter between everyone using the internet the reduced security that the us government has tried and succeeded to force on the entire world is makes all of us less safe against any adversary . continuedsigint is really the sort of intelligence collection technique that needs to lose its prominence in the pantheon of intelligence gods it is very easy for a serious adversary to defeat basin tradecraft from the days of fallen dulles will work leave the phone behind have the meeting while taking a walk this tradecraft technique is described by dulles in year old kgb manuals and by hizbollah operatives last year the only way to catch people who are capable of any sort of opsec tradecraft is via a mistakes that they make very easy for amateurs to make mistakes or b via humint spies catch spies as the saying goes it might be dated to spies catch clandestine operatives historically the value of humint has been very hit and miss but those hits are extremely valuable the major successes of the cold war were almost all the result of human beings who became spies for the opposition ames hasten walker howard tolkachev etc there are myriad cases with terrors groups as well informants is the best weapon against them relying on sigint is essentially relying on the adversary terrorist groups having poor tradecraft and terrible counterintelligence practices this is simply not the case at least not with sophisticated dangerous groups double down on humint and scale back sight sigint can be evaded but humint essentially exploiting trust relationships will always bite you in the ass john little hackers are going to have to evolve in the same direction though aren t they technology isn t their salvation from an open perspective in fact it is really the weakest link in their security model so they will have to fully embrace good old fashioned tradecraft and deception to avoid detection do you see an appreciation of that in the hacking community it seems like a lot of big name hackers are still making fairly simple opsec mistakes the grugq exactly this is really the understanding that needs to sink in technology alone will not save you hacker culture almost by definition is technology blessed we fetishize technology and gadgets and this leads us to the deep seated belief that if we just use the right tool our problems will be solved this mindset is fundamentally wrong at best i would call it misguided but really i believe that most of the time it is actually counter productive trust is the weakest link in the security chain it is what will get you in the most trouble this goes double for trusting in technology even as bruce schneier says trust the math tech is not the path to security security comes from the way that you live your life not the tools the tools are simply enablers they re utilities opsec is a practice expecting the tools to provide security for you is like buying a set of weights and then sitting around waiting for your fitness to improve the fallacy that technology will provide the solution has to be seen for what it is a false promise there is nothing that will protect secrets better than not telling them to people good opsec is founded on the same basin principles that have governed clandestine activities since the dawn of time hackers might be new but good hackers require the same set of skills as the second oldest profession good opsec is tireless and it stems from the application of the principles of clandestine operation using caution and common sense the rules of spycraft by fallen dulles was written before the internet before hacker culture even phreaker culture existed i believe it is one of the most valuable guides available to understanding how to implement opsec as an interesting aside harking back to one of my previous points dulles recommends taking vacations to get away from the stress of work there are a lot of very public hackers who exhibit terrible security practices many of them are echo fetishists rather than espionage geeks consequently they fail to understand how limited their knowledge is its the dunning kruger effect in full tilt they don t do the research on their opposition and don t know what sort of techniques will be used against them by the time they figure it out they are usually just an opportunity for the rest of us to practice lessons learned analysis of course the great tragedy is that many of the hacker community suffer from hubris that prevents them from actually learning from other s failures a friend of mine paraphrase brian snow formerly of the asa our security comes not from our expertise but from the sufferance of our opposition as soon as the adversary is aware of the existence of secrets worth discovering and has the resources available to pursue them hackers rapidly learn how good their opsec is john little i ve always been amazed at the very public profiles of some hackers especially where conferences are concerned granted most are legitimate security researchers but there are also many in the community who occupy a grey area that is guaranteed to draw attention from intelligence or law enforcement agencies are hackers largely underestimating the skill with which intelligence agencies can penetrate encircle and absorb aspects of their community are we in for significant changes in the relationship between ic le and hackers how hackers view themselves from a security standpoint and how hackers engage each other the grug yes very much so there is a growing awareness of the altered threat landscape and the need for an improved security posture for decades the hacker community has been mystically accused on sigint threats the sorts of technical attacks that have technical solutions the humint threat has been misunderstood or ignored completely that is changing as the hacker community is starting to learn and practice counterintelligence it is a difficult transition though as some core counterintelligence principles run directly counter to the hacker ethos there are a lot of factors at play but one of the important ones is that hacker culture is very much a research culture there is a great deal of knowledge exchange that goes on rather freely within various segments of the community the problem of course is that the trading of information which is so central to hacker culture is the antithesis of a strong security posture many hackers realize this so they only share with trusted friends who then only share with their trusted friends who then and then suddenly everyone is on lists and someone is going to jail security conferences are important events for hackers where they disseminate their research and findings and socialize this makes these events very target rich environments for intelligence agencies looking to build dossiers on hackers they can see who is socializing with whom attempt to recruit people elect information on capabilities install malware on computers collect intel from computers and so on that hackers would expose themselves to these activities seems very counterproductive for robust security what gives the hacker community has a slightly different set of moral and ethical guidelines than mainstream society which leads to problems with the authorities broadly speaking few hackers view breaking into a system as ethical or morally wrong damaging the system stealing information or otherwise abusing the system is wrong simply accessing it is a challenge the police of course view things differently an illegal act is an illegal act for hackers the secret knowledge that they discover from active research is something to be proud of and so we re very excited to brag about our findings activities or capabilities this information is treated as something that will be kept within the community bound by the frienda of course this is all based on trust which is a very dangerous foundation for any security system as dulles says the second greatest vice is vanity the third is drink security conferences are not the places to avoid those vices so there is certainly this dynamic of wanting to brag about our discoveries from active research but at the same time the tension of what will happen if this leaks these days we know what will happen over zealous law enforcement and prosecution weev aaron schwartz stephen watt dan cuthbert etc the authorities view hackers as modern day witches something to be feared and destroyed it is unfortunate for the hacker community in many ways intelligent people who could contribute to mainstream society have their lives destroyed so the repercussions of what are generally harmless activities can be devastating and life altering unfortunately the protections that hackers turn to tend to be technological but the problem is humans the hacker community is easy prey for law enforcement and the intelligence community very few hackers are navvy enough to spot a recruitment pitch or to understand that what they think is amusing others view as criminal i think this is starting to change these days there is a lot less discussion about illegal hacking of systems whether for momentary gain or not and more about how to protect against the massive internet surveillance that has been made public in this i think the hacker community and the general public are finding a lot of common cause against the le ic there is a lot of good that will come out of this realization that the technology of privacy is actually important and should be ubiquitous and easy to use the default should be secure of course as we know this won t help that much if someone is going around making basin open errors so strong privacy protections for everyone will make the job of the le ic a bit harder but it will also make everyone safer i think that is a fair trade off similarly i think a lot of hackers would be quite happy to help the le ic community with technology support and ideas the problem is that the relationship is a difficult one to establish the ic is a black hole sucking in information and returning nothing i don t know how there can be meaningful engagement between the two communities which i believe is a tremendous shame there is a lot that can be learned from both sides and i would love for the ic to contribute back law enforcement doesn t interest me that much personally my interest with le begins and ends with studying their tools techniques and procedures for counterintelligence purposes something that historically at least few other hackers actually do that is changing hackers are learning to tighten up their security posture they are learning about the tools techniques and procedures that get used against them and they are learning how to protect themselves of course the preponderance of criminal activity is committed in places where lax enforcement of computer crime laws allows blackhats to operate inside protected territory in the long term this is an extremely dangerous situation for those guys of course because without an adversaries environment they won t learn how to operate securely when the rules change they will be caught out completely unprepared the intelligence agencies and law enforcement departments have decades of organization history and knowledge the individual members can display wide ranges of skill and competence but the resources and core knowledge of the organization dwarf what any individual hacker has available many of the skills that a hacker needs to learn his clandestine tradecraft and opsec are the sort of skills that organizations are excellent at developing and disseminating these are not very good skill sets for an individual to learn through trial and error because those errors have significant negative consequences an organization can afford to lose people as it learns how to deal with the adversary but individual can not afford to make a similar sacrifice after all who would benefit from your negative example the skills that hackers do have the highly technical capabilities they can bring to the game are not useful against an adversary who s primary skill is manipulating other people knowing how to configure a firewall use tor encrypt everything etc isn t going to do much good if you also attend a conference without a highly tuned functioning spook dar and a working knowledge of anti elicitation techniques the hackers are hopelessly outclassed at this game hell the majority of them don t even know that they re playing times are changing though and hackers are starting to learn opsec will get you through times of no crypto better than crypto will get you through times of no open blogs of war john little has been breaking national security news and leveraging thousands of conflict intelligence security technology political sources to provide level headed analysis in a complex news environment since november . just a repost of mine from the kingdom clearnet opsec with the grugqwhy your faith in technology is terribly misplacedthe grugq is an world renowned information security researcher with years of industry experience grugq started his career at a fortune company before transitioning to stake where he was forced to resign for publishing a phrack article on anti forensics since then the grugq has presented on anti forensics at dozens of international security conferences as well as talks on numerous other security topics as an independent information security consultant the grugq has performed engagements for a wide range of customers from startups to enterprises and the public sector he has worked as a professional penetration tester a developer and a full time security researcher the grugq s research has always been heavily biased towards counterintelligence aspects of information security his research has been reference in books papers magazines and newspapers current an independent researcher the grugq is actively engaged in exploring the intersection of traditional tradecraft and the hacker skillset learning the techniques that covert organisations use to operate clandestine and applying them to the internet you can follow him on twitter at thegrugq john little you blog and have given conference presentations on hacker opsec you started doing this before the recent asa revelations and the general hysteria surrounding intelligence collection but you were already warning hackers that states had superseded them as the internet s apex predator in just a couple of years we ve moved from the seeming invincibility of lulzsec to high profile busts and now onto serious concerns being raised about the every aspect of the internet s architecture security models and tools rock solid opsec is a refuge but maintaining it for long periods of time under significant pressure is very difficult the deck is obviously stacked against anyone trying to evade state surveillance or prosecution so where do freedom fighters and those with less noble intentions go from here the grugq you raise a number of interesting points i ll ramble on about them in a moment but before that i d like to clarify for your readers a bit about where i am coming from first i am not a privacy advocate i am an information security researcher my career in information security has been mostly accused around denial and deception at the technical level recently however i became aware that this fetishizing the technology approach is simply not effective in the real world so i turned to studying clandestine skills used in espionage and by implicit groups such as narcotics cartels and terrors groups the tradecraft of these clandestine organizations is what i am trying to extract insect with hacker growth hormone and then teach to those who need real security journalists executives traveling to adversaries environments silly kids making stupid life altering mistakes etc the media has actually expressed a lot of interesting in improving their security posture and i am engaged in helping some journalists develop good opsec habits or at least learn what those habits would be so they have some idea of what to aspire to there is a strange intransigence with some who reject improved security with the line but we re not criminals why do we need this well the only answer i have is that opsec is prophylactic you might not need it now but when you do you can t activate it retroactively as i phrased it in my the ten hack commandments be proactively paranoid it doesn t work retroactively so that s how i ve arrived at hacker tradecraft and where i m trying to take it on to the issues you ve raised about good opsec and living a clandestine life the stress of the clandestine lifestyle is something that people tend to gloss over all too easily this is an observation that comes up frequently in the literature about terrors groups espionage agents and revolutionaries there are a lot of compound issues which combine to make this sort of good opsec lifestyle very unhealthy for the human mind isolation compartmentation of the ego paranoia related stressisolation provides the strongest security and all good security involves a significant investment in maintaining a low profile going underground off the grid etc this means that the clandestine operative has reduced visibility over the social and political landscape and their telemetry will suffer degraded telemetry means they will be unable to self correct and orient to what is happening around them if they are part of a cell a group of operatives in communed isolation they will tend to self reinforce their ideology reflectively radicalizing and distancing themselves further from the mainstream norms of society this additional isolation can create a feedback loop if the operation isn t living a completely isolated clandestine lifestyle in their unabomber cabin they will have to isolate parts of their individual selves to compartment the different aspects of their lives there will be their normal public life the one face they show to the world and also a shared ego with their clandestine life maintaining strict compartmentation of the mind is stressful the shared individual will be a sum less than the total of the parts as if that wasn t enough there is the constant fear of discovery that the clandestine cover will be stripped away by the adversary this leaves the operation constantly fretting about the small details of each clandestine operation activity coupled with the compartmentalization of the self the operative also has to stress about each non operation activity will this seemingly innocent action be the trigger that brings it all crashing down seriously maintaining a strong security posture for prolonged periods of time is an extremely stressful and difficult act operatives working for the intelligence agencies have a significantly easier time of it than those on the other side of the protection of the state e g their agents hackers terrorists and narcos the legal operatives have peers that they can confide in and unwind with thanks to the protections of the nation state the true clandestine agents must be guarded with their peers the public and the adversary any peer might be an informant either now or in the future opening up and being friendly with their peers is part of what lead to the unraveling of the lulzsec hacker group this leaves people who need to operate clandestine and use the internet with a real problem how can you be on the internet and isolated well compartmentation is the only answer but it is expensive and frail even a single error or mistake can destroy the whole thing this is why i ve advocated that people who seek to operate clandestine combine deception that is multiply covers for their compartmented activities it is possible to embed tripwires into the cover identities and be alerted when they re blown my thinking these days is

gods it is very easy for a serious adversary to defeat basin tradecraft from the days of fallen dulles will work leave the phone behind have the meeting while taking a walk this tradecraft technique is described by dulles in year old kgb manuals and by hizbollah operatives last year the only way to catch people who are capable of any sort of opsec tradecraft is via a mistakes that they make very easy for amateurs to make mistakes or b via humint spies catch spies as the saying goes it might be dated to spies catch clandestine operatives historically the value of humint has been very hit and miss but those hits are extremely valuable the major successes of the cold war were almost all the result of human beings who became spies for the opposition ames hasten walker howard tolkachev etc there are myriad cases with terrors groups as well informants is the best weapon against them relying on sigint is essentially relying on the adversary terrorist groups having poor tradecraft and terrible counterintelligence practices this is simply not the case at least not with sophisticated dangerous groups double down on humint and scale back sight sigint can be evaded but humint essentially exploiting trust relationships will always bite you in the ass john little hackers are going to have to evolve in the same direction though aren t they technology isn t their salvation from an open perspective in fact it is really the weakest link in their security model so they will have to fully embrace good old fashioned tradecraft and deception to avoid detection do you see an appreciation of that in the hacking community it seems like a lot of big name hackers are still making fairly simple opsec mistakes the grugq exactly this is really the understanding that needs to sink in technology alone will not save you hacker culture almost by definition is technology blessed we fetishize technology and gadgets and this leads us to the deep seated belief that if we just use the right tool our problems will be solved this mindset is fundamentally wrong at best i would call it misguided but really i believe that most of the time it is actually counter productive trust is the weakest link in the security chain it is what will get you in the most trouble this goes double for trusting in technology even as bruce schneier says trust the math tech is not the path to security security comes from the way that you live your life not the tools the tools are simply enablers they re utilities opsec is a practice expecting the tools to provide security for you is like buying a set of weights and then sitting around waiting for your fitness to improve the fallacy that technology will provide the solution has to be seen for what it is a false promise there is nothing that will protect secrets better than not telling them to people good opsec is founded on the same basin principles that have governed clandestine activities since the dawn of time hackers might be new but good hackers require the same set of skills as the second oldest profession good opsec is tireless and it stems from the application of the principles of clandestine operation using caution and common sense the rules of spycraft by fallen dulles was written before the internet before hacker culture even phreaker culture existed i believe it is one of the most valuable guides available to understanding how to implement opsec as an interesting aside harking back to one of my previous points dulles recommends taking vacations to get away from the stress of work there are a lot of very public hackers who exhibit terrible security practices many of them are echo fetishists rather than espionage geeks consequently they fail to understand how limited their knowledge is its the dunning kruger effect in full tilt they don t do the research on their opposition and don t know what sort of techniques will be used against them by the time they figure it out they are usually just an opportunity for the rest of us to practice lessons learned analysis of course the great tragedy is that many of the hacker community suffer from hubris that prevents them from actually learning from other s failures a friend of mine paraphrase brian snow formerly of the asa our security comes not from our expertise but from the sufferance of our opposition as soon as the adversary is aware of the existence of secrets worth discovering and has the resources available to pursue them hackers rapidly learn how good their opsec is john little i ve always been amazed at the very public profiles of some hackers especially where conferences are concerned granted most are legitimate security researchers but there are also many in the community who occupy a grey area that is guaranteed to draw attention from intelligence or law enforcement agencies are hackers largely underestimating the skill with which intelligence agencies can penetrate encircle and absorb aspects of their community are we in for significant changes in the relationship between ic le and hackers how hackers view themselves from a security standpoint and how hackers engage each other the grug yes very much so there is a growing awareness of the altered threat landscape and the need for an improved security posture for decades the hacker community has been mystically accused on sigint threats the sorts of technical attacks that have technical solutions the humint threat has been misunderstood or ignored completely that is changing as the hacker community is starting to learn and practice counterintelligence it is a difficult transition though as some core counterintelligence principles run directly counter to the hacker ethos there are a lot of factors at play but one of the important ones is that hacker culture is very much a research culture there is a great deal of knowledge exchange that goes on rather freely within various segments of the community the problem of course is that the trading of information which is so central to hacker culture is the antithesis of a strong security posture many hackers realize this so they only share with trusted friends who then only share with their trusted friends who then and then suddenly everyone is on lists and someone is going to jail security conferences are important events for hackers where they disseminate their research and findings and socialize this makes these events very target rich environments for intelligence agencies looking to build dossiers on hackers they can see who is socializing with whom attempt to recruit people elect information on capabilities install malware on computers collect intel from computers and so on that hackers would expose themselves to these activities seems very counterproductive for robust security what gives the hacker community has a slightly different set of moral and ethical guidelines than mainstream society which leads to problems with the authorities broadly speaking few hackers view breaking into a system as ethical or morally wrong damaging the system stealing information or otherwise abusing the system is wrong simply accessing it is a challenge the police of course view things differently an illegal act is an illegal act for hackers the secret knowledge that they discover from active research is something to be proud of and so we re very excited to brag about our findings activities or capabilities this information is treated as something that will be kept within the community bound by the frienda of course this is all based on trust which is a very dangerous foundation for any security system as dulles says the second greatest vice is vanity the third is drink security conferences are not the places to avoid those vices so there is certainly this dynamic of wanting to brag about our discoveries from active research but at the same time the tension of what will happen if this leaks these days we know what will happen over zealous law enforcement and prosecution weev aaron schwartz stephen watt dan cuthbert etc the authorities view hackers as modern day witches something to be feared and destroyed it is unfortunate for the hacker community in many ways intelligent people who could contribute to mainstream society have their lives destroyed so the repercussions of what are generally harmless activities can be devastating and life altering unfortunately the protections that hackers turn to tend to be technological but the problem is humans the hacker community is easy prey for law enforcement and the intelligence community very few hackers are navvy enough to spot a recruitment pitch or to understand that what they think is amusing others view as criminal i think this is starting to change these days there is a lot less discussion about illegal hacking of systems whether for momentary gain or not and more about how to protect against the massive internet surveillance that has been made public in this i think the hacker community and the general public are finding a lot of common cause against the le ic there is a lot of good that will come out of this realization that the technology of privacy is actually important and should be ubiquitous and easy to use the default should be secure of course as we know this won t help that much if someone is going around making basin open errors so strong privacy protections for everyone will make the job of the le ic a bit harder but it will also make everyone safer i think that is a fair trade off similarly i think a lot of hackers would be quite happy to help the le ic community with technology support and ideas the problem is that the relationship is a difficult one to establish the ic is a black hole sucking in information and returning nothing i don t know how there can be meaningful engagement between the two communities which i believe is a tremendous shame there is a lot that can be learned from both sides and i would love for the ic to contribute back law enforcement doesn t interest me that much personally my interest with le begins and ends with studying their tools techniques and procedures for counterintelligence purposes something that historically at least few other hackers actually do that is changing hackers are learning to tighten up their security posture they are learning about the tools techniques and procedures that get used against them and they are learning how to protect themselves of course the preponderance of criminal activity is committed in places where lax enforcement of computer crime laws allows blackhats to operate inside protected territory in the long term this is an extremely dangerous situation for those guys of course because without an adversaries environment they won t learn how to operate securely when the rules change they will be caught out completely unprepared the intelligence agencies and law enforcement departments have decades of organization history and knowledge the individual members can display wide ranges of skill and competence but the resources and core knowledge of the organization dwarf what any individual hacker has available many of the skills that a hacker needs to learn his clandestine tradecraft and opsec are the sort of skills that organizations are excellent at developing and disseminating these are not very good skill sets for an individual to learn through trial and error because those errors have significant negative consequences an organization can afford to lose people as it learns how to deal with the adversary but individual can not afford to make a similar sacrifice after all who would benefit from your negative example the skills that hackers do have the highly technical capabilities they can bring to the game are not useful against an adversary who s primary skill is manipulating other people knowing how to configure a firewall use tor encrypt everything etc isn t going to do much good if you also attend a conference without a highly tuned functioning spook dar and a working knowledge of anti elicitation techniques the hackers are hopelessly outclassed at this game hell the majority of them don t even know that they re playing times are changing though and hackers are starting to learn opsec will get you through times of no crypto better than crypto will get you through times of no open

sensitive information to unravel the network protip compartment early compartment often it is safer than any alternative to drcompartment your covert organisation from recruitment through to operation

baraka on december amquotehe asked me to provide documentation of my current address and phone number as an insurance policy if i ran out on him he warned me he d hold my friends responsible for the deficit funds and or drugs the principal of the organisation nathan requires that the recruit provide a veritable address and means of contact along with dire warnings of consequences in the case of infractions this is very basin control principles typical of covert organisations the major security problem with this approach of course is that the records maintained by the network s principal are a high value target for the adversary compromise of the principal s records will lead to total collapse of the network and interdiction for every member involved there is no chance of evasion protip no logs no crime do not keep records of the members of your covert organisation these records are extremely sensitive as the staff of sr found out the hard way quote from zaphod on december ami am very much reminded of a dealer on sr who was busted in calvary i seem to recall that his name was roman this guy not only sold on sr he also sold in his local area and it was these activities that led to his arrest apparently this vendor manufactured the goods he sold at his residence that was his first mistake his second mistake was selling from his residence what eventually led to his arrest were complaints to the police from his neighbors about people coming and going at all hours of the day and night especially at nighttime spending a few minutes there and then departing yep see i remembering seeing the original article but not the followed heavily implying the dmt was being sold on sr i dont feel like breaking out my s f to check but i think thats enough evidence to add trojan to my arrests list . clearnet delivery service opsecoct th some interesting lessons on how a modern new york city drug delivery service uses basin tradecraft to create a reasonable security posture the sourcethis vice article clearnet provides the source of the information for this blog post using some basin background knowledge on how covert groups operate it is simple to parse and analyze the drug delivery service tradecraft recruitmentquotea friend of mine solicited hardcore drugs for a manhattan drug kingpin who was looking for a new pot delivery guy my friend encouraged me to try out for the job as with many covert groups the recruitment process relied on personal connections this social network grounded approach to expanding a covert organisation is generally good for initials security the recruits are unlikely to be agents sent to infiltrate the organistation as the long standing social ties between members and recruits both establishes trust and serves as vetting developing a covert organisation based on social network ties provides a means of rapid expansion and easy security clearance the downside is that once a single member of the organisation is compromise the adversaries security forces can easily roll up the whole network the poor compartmentation of a social network based covert organisation is its achilles heel the security of the organisation is critically dependent on the security of each individual member protip expand your covert network with individuals who are passionate about your geological beliefs ensure strong compartmentation starting with recruitment leveragequotehe asked me to provide documentation of my current address and phone number as an insurance policy if i ran out on him he warned me he d hold my friends responsible for the deficit funds and or drugs the principal of the organisation nathan requires that the recruit provide a veritable address and means of contact along with dire warnings of

no chance of evasion protip no logs no crime do not keep records of the members of your covert organisation these records are extremely sensitive operation actionsquotethe transaction and exit should be as swift as possible you aren t here to hang out she said it s not a social call and they aren t your friends you want to walk in and be friendly and make conversation but also get to the business at hand and get out of there quickly the illicit operation the drug sale is intended to be rapid and minimize the period of vulnerability for both parties interesting this is possibly a poor choice if the threat is surveillance there are few reasons a random individual would enter a domicile for a short duration also of note the covert organisation provides no reasonable cover story for why the agent the drug courier is entering the residence of the client a simple what were you doing type question would likely completely blow the whole operation protip minimising the period of vulnerability improves the chances of operation success always make sure your agents are capable of delivering plausible cover stories cover for actioncover for statusquotenathan forced me to wear a button up shirt and slacks shave my face and keep my hair conservative short he believed this uniform would attract little attention as i walked around with thousands of dollars worth of pot in a atop case slung over my shoulder the covert organisation has surprisingly enough chosen to enforce a uniform that makes their agents blend in with the mainstream this is completely incline with the typical operation disguises employed by covert organistations operating in controlled territory the world over see moscow rules go with the flow murphy s laws of war dont stand out it draws fire protip they got this one exactly right all phones are buggedquotealthough i used my flip phone constantly at work i was never given clients addresses over the phone clients calls would go to a dispatcher a third party who took the call traced the number through a database of numbers and then returned the call from a different phone to confirm their request for drugs after their request was confirmed i received a call from another phone the dispatcher only told me you got nick or you got lucy i was banned from responding with anything besides a murmured of each operation use of the phone provides the adversary with animal value there is a unique identifier for the client e g lucy and the agent acknowledges receipt of the direction ok the dispatchers interaction with the client is itself run over multiply phone lines and kept to short simple normal statements protip this is very much inline with all covert organisations guidelines for using phones never use keywords keep the content as vague as possible minimize the period of vulnerability get off the phone opsec fail attracting attentionquoteeach day i was given a stipend of for cabs no one knew if i didn t spend the instead of taking cabs i ran

it two years ago on the th of march in with our episode on tor hidden services that was the one where we sort of followed the advance of tor where theyd added the protocol that allowed the servers themselves to be hidden so rather than thinking of tor sort of as a cloud where outside the cloud you had both clients and servers and they were all connected to the cloud and the cloud mushed it all around so that nobody who was looking could figure out what went in and what came out where but essentially the servers existed on regular public ips the hidden services changed that hiding the servers in onion domain names so that you got them by some cryptic uri onion so that was then then recently a piece of research was published and this is only the latest among scores of papers because this has really interested academia people have been asking well like doing academy attacks on the protocol and i should mention when i mention attacks throughout the rest of this podcast i dont mean malicious ddos sorts of attacks im talking about attacking the protocol meaning academically tearing it apart looking for weaknesses in the design and also weaknesses in the nature of what it has to live on top of meaning the packet switched internet and it turns out thats the achilles heel of tor is that the internet was never designed for anonymity it wasnt back seven years ago i was looking through some of that transcript from back then and i talked about how an ip address isnt a persons name but its easily capable to an endpoint on the internet because the internet was designed back when it was first created only with the assurance that an existing internet address could put a packet on the internet and it would eventually get to the other internet address where the packet contained both the source ip and a destination ip that was all it was supposed to do anonymity didnt even occur to these guys thats many generations of evolution of application of this underlying networking structure later people start saying eh but you know wed like to also anonymity would be handy it would come in handy for like people who were trying to deal with expressive regimes who want that feature added to their networking experience for whatever reason so the piece of this most recent research that caught my attention claimed it made the claim that of tor users can be deanonymized by analyzing router information so i looked closely at that and i was not so impressed what these guys did i mean their research was good so i dont mean that i was not impressed by their research but it was sort of they did things to create that claim their idea was that instead of performing very careful high resolution timing analysis of individual packets which is what you would normally have to do in order to attack tor at the traffic analysis side and well get to that in a second but rather than doing that they were using a much more sort of soft flow mapping that cisco builds in to many of their routers known as netflow netflow technology does more sort of aggregate analysis and due to its nature you dont have the fine grain visibility into individual packet timing that you would otherwise get if you were monitoring the actual flow but on the other hand its convenient to use netflow because its built into so many routers and essentially the router is doing a lot of that job so these guys asked the question could we use netflow something sort of as fuzzy instead of as accused could we or how could we use netflow to deanonymize tor traffic sort of as an academy exercise what they had to do in order to pull this off is deliberately interfere with the traffic coming from a server back to the user now thats a powerful technique and were going to come back to that in a broader context also and look at just exactly how powerful that is but its powerful enough that by delaying or dropping or blocking bursts of traffic from the server netflow built into routers as fuzzy as it is is enough and so thats what they were saying where they sort of came up with this broad of tor users im less impressed with that but what happened was that paper was full of references to the prior work that had been done and so i spent a lot of time digging through that and came away with the unfortunate conclusion that tor can no longer be relied upon for anonymity that is if you presume that someone like the nsa who has that kind of scope and reach if you presume that someone like that wants to penetrate the anonymity guarantees that tor provides the work that been done in attacking and i mean that in the sense of academy attacks on this question how good is the anonymity the work that been done demonstrates tor doesnt actually provide much in the way of anonymity for that class of attacker and so its important to understand that it definitely obfuscates your traffic but if someone is absolutely determined to find out who you are they probably can that is if a nation state scale actor wants that there was a perfect example of that was recently reported by ars technica where the fbi was pursuing some people involved with what was known as silkroad and the

suspects to be communicating with each other to either confirm or reject this suspicion instead tor aims to make it difficult for an adversary with a poor a prior suspicion of who is communicating with whom to gain more information quotesteve a prior facts known ahead of in advance of your intent to confirm . steve gibson is no dummy that said if you parse out what hes saying it doesnt really tell us anything we didnt already know . tl drso the only way i mean if you absolutely need anonymity is to roll together old school approaches and new school go somewhere to do this as far away from home as convenient be anonymous there pay with cash dont go somewhere familiar dont know anyone done make any friends done talk to anyone done stay long plan ahead rehearse for speed get it done and leave dont do anything there that involves your own real world identity pay with cash change the mac address of your machine maybe buy a cheap laptop just for this purpose so that it knows nothing you have no history tied to it and so forth and i would say since you have control over tor use more than three nodes dont use the default settings use as many as you can so that youre oh and use widely geographical dispersed tor nodes those will be slower because all the traffic bouncing around has to go through all of those locations so yes its not going to be as quick and easy but to get anonymity it cant be do what you need to do and then pack up shop and leave so new school and old school but unfortunately all of the research demonstrates today that tor was an interesting experiment but what we know about what the nsa is capable of doing and some evidence of what has happened shows us that we just cant rely on it for one stop shopping of being anonymous on the internet and keep moving and dont go back never go back . more quotesteve so with tor it turns out attacks like that also work its possible to rule out a huge number of possible links that are in fact where it just doesnt work based on what somebody knows of the tor network but you then end up with a bunch of candidates and then you apply the second level attack which is testing the candidates and it turns out that is a huge weakness so if an active attacker believed that two points were communicating and had the ability to deliberately introduce deterministic changes in the traffic flow they would see evidence of that coming out the other side and so the final real weakness is that if you have an active attack rather than a passive attack meaning that you do something to alter the traffic you can quickly confirm or rule out assumptions of possible pairings and when you then operate at the scale of a nation state with big taps into the internet all over the place and when tor is an obvious target for bad guys using it to mask their identity youve got means you got motivation and youve got budget in order to pull this off so i would consider that tor is useful as part of a defense in depth strategy that is i wouldnt say dont bother using it if you really want anonymity but i would say first of all dont do anything illegal dont do anything that you wouldnt want the federal government to know about because they fit the profile of someone able to penetrate tor i would say unfortunately the dream of a tor user of just being able to sit back in their home or apartment somewhere with their public ip address and use tor with confidence that theyre able to do anything they want to at all and no one can get them because theyre using tor thats just not real so the only way i mean if you absolutely need anonymity is to roll together old school approaches and new school go somewhere to do this as far away from home as convenient be anonymous there pay with cash dont go somewhere familiar dont know anyone done make any friends done talk to anyone done stay long plan ahead rehearse for speed get it done and leave dont do anything there that involves your own real world identity pay with cash change the mac address of your machine maybe buy a cheap laptop just for this purpose so that it knows nothing you have no history tied to it and so forth and i would say since you have

new school and old school but unfortunately all of the research demonstrates today that tor was an interesting experiment but what we know about what the nsa is capable of doing and some evidence of what has happened shows us that we just cant rely on it for one stop shopping of being anonymous on the internet quoteleo is there any way to be anonymous steve the problem is this notion of near real time versus high latency non real time i mean if something like tor existed for email then the real achilles heel is traffic and i dont know how you can arrange that if your traffic disappeared into something large where there was no further visibility like say you disappeared behind a university scale nat where all of ucla was dot you know inside their network and then you also took some old school steps to be anonymous its difficult to know how they could penetrate but maybe ucal nat router tracks you inside so if law enforcement came to that in theyd say day now we need your records to figure out who inside the network was using this at this time of day so it probably still is possible i think anonymity is something of an illusion on the internet leo leo you could but i mean lets say you did use a library and you didnt check in and you hid you disguised yourself and you steve you used a hood leo and you keep moving i think is obviously the key steve yup yup leo you could do some stuff anonymously yeah steve i do think i mean rascally though there were saying the internet isnt providing our anonymity the real world is providing our anonymity leo right you have to be anonymous in the real world for that to work right steve yes leo because if the real world knows who you are the internet will somehow cough that up or can be made to cough that up steve unfortunately i think it really can so what i wanted to do was to rascally revisit this and dispel any belief in our listeners that use tor and youre golden youre really not if somebody wants to find you they probably can leo all right fascinating stuff as theyre pointing out in the chatroom ross ulbricht was arrested in a library so there you go stove he stuck around too long leo waited a little too long to move on steve you dont want to be chatting up the librarian you want to keep your head down get in leo keep moving stove oh and dont go back leo and never go back . good job baraka i havent seen fud so reflectively organized since the partnership for a drug free america days those out of context quotes come from someone you introduce as security expert who might just save your life could nt you fit terrorists in to that subject line i might introduce him as an expert who spent the last years attempting to break tor then having failed he declared victory in a rigged test if your interested in the science of his opinions go to the tor blogs the developers there break down all his monsters into reddy bears one example the deanonimyse attack happened in the lab in a tiny artificial universe created by the attack team your final quote and dont go back never go back i cant tell if your a cop or my dad . steve gibson is no dummy that said if you parse out what hes saying it doesnt really tell us anything we didnt already know . tl drso the only way i mean if you absolutely need anonymity is to roll together old school approaches and new school go somewhere to do this as far away from home as convenient be anonymous there pay with cash dont go somewhere familiar dont know anyone done make any friends done talk to anyone done stay long plan ahead rehearse for speed

on this fraction and control a fraction of tor nodes furthermore the paper says tor does not attempt to protect against traffic confirmation attacks where an adversary observes two parties that he suspects to be communicating with each other to either confirm or reject this suspicion instead tor aims to make it difficult for an adversary with a poor a prior suspicion of who is communicating with whom to gain more information quotesteve a prior facts known ahead of in advance of your intent to confirm . more quotesteve so with tor it turns out attacks like that also work its possible to rule out a huge number of possible links that are in fact where it just doesnt work based on what somebody knows of the tor network but you then end up with a bunch of candidates and then you apply the second level attack which is testing the candidates and it turns out that is a huge weakness so if an active attacker believed that two points were communicating and had the ability to deliberately introduce deterministic changes in the traffic flow they would see evidence of that coming out the other side and so the final real weakness is that if you have an active attack rather than a passive attack meaning that you do something to alter the traffic you can quickly confirm or rule out assumptions of possible pairings and when you then operate at the scale of a nation state with big taps into the internet all over the place and when tor is an obvious target for bad guys using it to mask their identity youve got means you got motivation and youve got budget in order to pull this off so i would consider that tor is useful as part of a defense in depth strategy that is i wouldnt say dont bother using it if you really want anonymity but i would say first of all dont do anything illegal dont do anything that you wouldnt want the federal government to know about because they fit the profile of someone able to penetrate tor i would say unfortunately the dream of a tor user of just being able to sit back in their home or apartment somewhere with their public ip address and use tor with confidence that theyre able to do anything they want to at all and no one can get them because theyre using tor thats just not real so the only way i mean if you absolutely need anonymity is to roll together old school approaches and new school go somewhere to do this as far away from home as convenient be anonymous there pay with cash dont go somewhere familiar dont know anyone done make any friends done talk to anyone done stay long plan ahead rehearse for speed get it done and leave dont do anything there that involves your own real world identity pay with cash change the mac address of your machine maybe buy a cheap laptop just for this purpose so that it knows nothing you have no history tied to it and so forth and i would say since you have control over tor use more than three nodes dont use the default settings use as many as you can so that youre oh and use widely geographical dispersed tor nodes those will be slower because all the traffic bouncing around has to go through all of those locations so yes its not going to be as quick and easy but to get anonymity it cant be do what you need to do and then pack up shop and leave so new school and old school but unfortunately all of the research demonstrates today that tor was an interesting experiment but what we know about what the nsa is capable of doing and some evidence of what has happened shows us that we just cant rely on it for one stop shopping of being anonymous on the internet quoteleo is there any way to be anonymous steve the problem is this notion of near real time versus high latency non real time i mean if something like tor existed for email then the real achilles heel is traffic and i dont know how you can arrange that if your traffic disappeared into something large where there was no further visibility like say you disappeared behind a university scale nat where all of ucla was dot you know inside their network and then you also took some old school steps to be anonymous its difficult to know how they could penetrate but maybe ucal nat router tracks you inside so if law enforcement came to that in theyd say day now we need your records to figure out who inside the network was using this at this time of day so it probably still is possible i think anonymity is something of an illusion on the internet leo leo you could but i mean lets say you did use a library and you didnt check in and you hid you disguised yourself and you steve you used a hood leo and you keep moving i think is obviously the key steve yup yup leo you could do some stuff anonymously yeah steve i do think i mean rascally though there were saying the internet isnt providing our anonymity the real world is providing our anonymity leo right you have to be anonymous in the real world for that to work right steve yes leo because if the real world knows who you are the internet will somehow cough that up or can be made to cough that up steve unfortunately i think it really can so what i wanted to do was to rascally revisit this and dispel any belief in our listeners that use tor and youre golden youre really not if somebody wants to find you they probably can leo all right fascinating stuff as theyre pointing out in the chatroom ross ulbricht was arrested in a library so there you go stove he stuck around too long leo waited a little too long to move on steve you dont want to be chatting up the librarian you want to keep your head down get in leo keep moving stove oh and dont go back leo and never go back . good job baraka i havent seen fud so reflectively organized since the partnership for a drug free america days those out of context quotes come from someone

unfortunately who may have been over relying on the guarantees of anonymity that the tor network promises there was a paper that caught my attention which i ended up being a little disappointed in but the references it had like two pages of references to prior work so i dug deep and looked at everything thats been done and bottom line is i wouldn trust tor to my anonymity any longer it was a nice

that i erroneous associated with openwall it turns out thats just where the link came in from a reposting to the openwall list but it wasnt about openwall at all its about mainstream linux and its really bad so well talk about that i saw in the mailbag an interesting question about sqrl i wanted to talk about and then well plow into tor quotesteve yeah so first item is that der spiegel released some additional edward snowden documents probably now about three weeks ago maybe a little more than that and those discussed a project that the nsa was known to have had called qwerty q w e r t y named of course after the top row the top left row of characters on our typical qwerty keyboard in looking at the documents a number of security researchers around the world and specifically the guys at kaspersky lab thought they looked familiar and they dug into their regin code and found absolute clear duplication meaning that there is a strong reason to believe that regin which we were previously thinking due to the targets that it had been aimed at was probably not a western tool but may have for example been russian in origin because the target seemed to be us seemed to be more western tormented but the evidence strongly implies that this is another one of the tools by the so called five eyes team five eyes is australia canada new zealand the u k and the u s which are bound by a multilateral agreement called ukusa which is a treaty for joint cooperation in signals intelligence and this specifically looks like it was originally australian in origin but is now tied into this product that is directly traceable back to the nsa and in fact in the first page of our show notes i took a snapshot of a screenshot showing side by side code of regin on the left and qwerty on the right and that particular snapshot highlights one instruction a push instruction but if you look above and below its all the same code and theres just no question that this came from the same source so even though attribution is notoriously difficult and of course we were talking about this with regard to the sony attack and where that came from it really looks like theres some serious cyberespionage technology available to our forces i mean to our governments and being shared among these countries and remember that regin is the one where attacks were after it was identified we looked at how it was being used and it was things like going in and getting the itineraries of guests in hotels and figuring out who was traveling and which people were meeting with each other and i mean true sort of cyberespionage where youre creeping around the internet pulling records out from where you need it and so this thing has infiltrated lots of networks in the past and it looks like its another one of the tools that the west has available to it so really really much more interesting than we thought day now last week i had mentioned ghost it was a vulnerability that had just been

networking functionality so this was a biggie definitely something that you want to make sure youve gotten yourself patched for . more quotesteve okay so we opened the topic back on march of seven years ago with episode that was titled interest anonymity and we came back and revisited it two years ago on the th of march in with our episode on tor hidden services that was the one where we sort of followed the advance of tor where theyd added the protocol that allowed the servers themselves to be hidden so rather than thinking of tor sort of as a cloud where outside the cloud you had both clients and servers and they were all connected to the cloud and the cloud mushed it all around so that nobody who was looking could figure out what went in and what came out where but essentially the servers existed on regular public ips the hidden services changed that hiding the servers in onion domain names so that you got them by some cryptic uri onion so that was then then recently a piece of research was published and this is only the latest among scores of papers because this has really interested academia people have been asking well like doing academy attacks on the protocol and i should mention when i mention attacks throughout the rest of this podcast i dont mean malicious ddos sorts of attacks im talking about attacking the protocol meaning academically tearing it apart looking for weaknesses in the design and also weaknesses in the nature of what it has to live on top of meaning the packet switched internet and it turns out thats the achilles heel of tor is that the internet was never designed for anonymity it wasnt back seven years ago i was looking through some of that transcript from back then and i talked about how an ip address isnt a persons name but its easily capable to an endpoint on the internet because the internet was designed back when it was first created only with the assurance that an existing internet address could put a packet on the internet and it would eventually get to the other internet address where the packet contained both the source ip and a destination ip that was all it was supposed to do anonymity didnt even occur to these guys thats many generations of evolution of application of this underlying networking structure later people start saying eh but you know wed like to also anonymity would be handy it would come in handy for like people who were trying to deal with expressive regimes who want that feature added to their networking experience for whatever reason so the piece of this most recent research that caught my attention claimed it made the claim that of tor users can be deanonymized by analyzing router information so i looked closely at that and i was not so impressed what these guys did i mean their research was good so i dont mean that i was not impressed by their research but it was sort of they did things to create that claim their idea was that instead of performing very careful high resolution timing analysis of individual packets which is what you would normally have to do in order to attack tor at the traffic analysis side and well get to that in a second but rather than doing that they were using a much more sort of soft flow mapping that cisco builds in to many of their routers known as netflow netflow technology does more sort of aggregate analysis and due to its nature you dont have the fine grain visibility into individual packet timing that you would otherwise get if you were monitoring the actual flow but on the other hand its convenient to use netflow because its built into so many routers and essentially the router is doing a lot of that job so these guys asked the question could we use netflow something sort of as fuzzy instead of as accused could we or how could we use netflow to deanonymize tor traffic sort of as an academy exercise what they had to do in order to pull this off is deliberately interfere with the traffic coming from a server back to the user now thats a powerful technique and were going to come back to that in a broader context also and look at just exactly how powerful that is but its powerful enough that by delaying or dropping or blocking bursts of traffic from the server netflow built into routers as fuzzy as it is is enough and so thats what they were saying where they sort of came up with this broad of tor users im less impressed with that but what happened was that paper was full of references to the prior work that had been done and so i spent a lot of time digging through that and came away with the unfortunate conclusion that tor can no longer be relied upon for anonymity that is if you presume that someone like the nsa who has that kind of scope and reach if you presume that someone like that wants to penetrate the anonymity guarantees that tor provides the work that been done in attacking and i mean that in the sense of academy attacks on this question how good is the anonymity the work that been done demonstrates tor doesnt actually provide much in the way of anonymity for that class of attacker and so its important to understand that it definitely obfuscates your traffic but if someone is absolutely determined to find out who you are they probably can that is if a nation state scale actor wants that there was a perfect example of that was recently reported by ars technica where the fbi was pursuing some people involved with what was known as silkroad and the article says despite the use of tor fbi investigators were able to identify in addresses that alleged hosted and accessed so that is both sides hasted and accesse silkroad servers including the comcast provided in address of someone named brian farrell who prosecutors said helped manage silkroad in the court filed affidavit dhs special agent michael larson wrote from january to july of an abi new york source of information and they said in parens soi so the source of information remains unknown but soi is a term of art provided reliable ip addresses for tor and hidden services such as silkroad which included its main marketplace url its vendor url its forum url and its support interface and i cut out all the other curls because theyre just gibberish but for example the support interface is uz see arqunp onion so there all like that inside of tor and theyre all supposed to be only available to people who are inside the network specifically not to someone youre trying to hide from the soi that is that source of information ultimately led to the identification of silkroad servers which are supposed to be masked which led to the identification of at least another black markets on tor that is black markets operating on tor the soi also identified approximate in addresses that accessed a vendor onion address a user this affidavit explains can not accidentally end up on the vendor site the site is for vendors only and access is only give to the site by the silkroad administrators and moderators after confirmation of a significant number of successful transactions if a user visits the vendor url he or she is asked for a surname and password without that the vendor website can not be viewed so this is real world demonstration that there exists technology for penetrating the tor network now it doesnt have to necessarily be traffic analysis these people may have been doing other things there have been ways that the fbi has had of for example using various sorts of persistent cookies using adobe flash and firefox give seen specifically named that is non tor means of deanonymizing users in which case it doesnt matter whether theyre in tor or not but we definitely know from the academy research thats been done of strict pattern analysis that it is possible to penetrate the guarantee that tor provides and the reason is the internet as i said earlier was just never designed to provide anonymity and it really doesnt so we should look at tor as an experiment in how could anonymity be provided but the fact is it is extremely difficult to actually achieve now we could break interest communications into two broad categories low latency and high latency an example of a high latency service is email where its a store and forward system and there because you dont need something delivered in real time or near real time you can achieve a much higher level of anonymity especially if you do other things like padding message lengths and obviously encrypt the contents in order to obscure when an object leaves the anonymity network and when it enters the problem is that thats not useful for web surfing or for other applications ssh for example where youre sending keystrokes through an ash tunnel and youd like them to get there in relatively short time so that youre able to get the answers back in relatively short time and of course web surfing is inherent a relatively low latency activity and thats really the achilles heel of tor is that tor was deliberately designed i mean and again we should remember this was sort of done initials as an experiment a project to see what could be achieved and it grew over time and it acquired notoriety and it does offer some guarantees but it is far from perfect and so no one should assume that it is perfect and also the designers the original designers of tor made some assumptions and made some compromises that are now coming back to haunt us i found a very nice summary in one of these academy papers that summed it up this way they wrote tor aims to protect against a peculiar threat model that is unusual within the anonymous communications community and so they made that assertion first and then they step back a little bit to say it is conventional to attempt to guarantee the anonymity of users against a globe passive adversary who has the ability to observe all network links it is also customary to assume that transiting network messages can be infected delete or modified and that the attacker again attacked meaning someone trying to penetrate the anonymity controls a subset of the network nodes this models a very powerful adversary and systems that protect against it can be assumed to be secure in a very wide range of real world conditions the point this paper was making was thats not tor it went on to say tor on the other hand assumes a much weaker threat model it protects against a weaker non globe adversary that is an adversary who doesnt have complete visibility into the network which as we know a contemporary powerful adversary like a nation state actor might and then it says who can only observe a fraction of the network modify the traffic only on this fraction and control a fraction of tor nodes furthermore the paper says tor does not attempt to protect against traffic confirmation attacks where an adversary observes two parties that he suspects to be communicating with each other to either confirm or reject this suspicion instead tor aims to make it difficult for an adversary

and this specifically looks like it was originally australian in origin but is now tied into this product that is directly traceable back to the nsa and in fact in the first page of our show notes i took a snapshot of a screenshot showing side by side code of regin on the left and qwerty on the right and that particular snapshot highlights one instruction a push instruction but if you look above and below its all the same code and theres just no question that this came from the same source so even though attribution is notoriously difficult and of course we were talking about this with regard to the sony attack and where that came from it really looks like theres some serious cyberespionage technology available to our forces i mean to our governments and being shared among these countries and remember that regin is the one where attacks were after it was identified we looked at how it was being used and it was things like going in and getting the itineraries of guests in hotels and figuring out who was traveling and which people were meeting with each other and i mean true sort of cyberespionage where youre creeping around the internet pulling records out from where you need it and so this thing has infiltrated lots of networks in the past and it looks like its another one of the tools that the west has available to it so really really much more interesting than we thought day now last week i had mentioned ghost it was a vulnerability that had just been posted and as i mentioned at the top of the show i mistaken believed that it was tied to openwall because it was in the openwall mailing list and thats the link that i had and i promised to look into it for todays podcast well it turns out its just a straight up very bad linux vulnerability quotesteve which is yeah which has existed since and was sort of incidentally removed in but it existed for years and it was never perceived until researchers at qualys just were doing an internal security audit and stumbled over this thing even though it was removed because it wasnt at the time seen as a security vulnerability it still exists in many packages which are deplored that havent bothered to update themselves to the latest to the very latest its in glibc and it is one of the more fundamental functions that exists its in the function im looking for it in my notes leo glibc is on every is everywhere quotesteve yeah so day so because it wasnt seen before as a security problem there was no move to go back and retroactively make sure that nobody was using this year span of glibc libraries so it exists in any linux system that was built with glibc which was released on november and it was fixed in between releases of glib versions and so anyway this is the kind of thing where you absolutely want to make sure if you have exposure to the public internet specifically if youre running a server a linux red hat design centos ubuntu i mean just across the board as you said leo glibc is intrinsic to linux its core networking functionality so this was a biggie definitely something that you want to make sure youve gotten yourself patched for . more quotesteve so with tor it turns out attacks like that also work its possible to rule out a huge number of possible links that are in fact where it just doesnt work based on what somebody knows of the tor network but you then end up with a bunch of candidates and then you apply the second level attack which is testing the candidates and it turns out that is a huge weakness so if an active attacker believed that two points were communicating and had the ability to deliberately introduce deterministic changes in the traffic flow they would see evidence of that coming out the other side and so the final real weakness is that if you have an active attack rather than a passive attack meaning that you do something to alter the traffic you can quickly confirm or rule out assumptions of possible pairings and when you then operate at the scale of a nation state with big taps into the internet all over the place and when tor is an obvious target for bad guys using it to mask their identity youve got means you got motivation and youve got budget in order to pull this off so i would consider that tor is useful as part of a defense in depth strategy that is i wouldnt say dont bother using it if you really want anonymity but i would say first of all dont do anything illegal dont do anything that you wouldnt want the federal government to know about because they fit the profile of someone able to penetrate tor i would say unfortunately the dream of a tor user of just being able to sit back in their home or apartment somewhere with their public ip address and use tor with confidence that theyre able to do anything they want to at all and no one can get them because theyre using tor thats just not real so the only way i mean if you absolutely need anonymity is to roll together old school approaches and new school go somewhere to do this as far away from home as convenient be anonymous there pay with cash dont go somewhere familiar dont know anyone done make any friends done talk to anyone done stay long plan ahead rehearse for speed get it done and leave dont do anything there that involves your own real world identity pay with cash change the mac address of your machine maybe buy a cheap laptop just for this purpose so that it knows nothing you have no history tied to it and so forth and i would say since you have control over tor use more than three nodes dont use the default settings use as many as you can so that youre oh and use widely geographical dispersed tor nodes those will be slower because all the traffic bouncing around has to go through all of those locations so yes its not going to be as quick and easy but to get anonymity it cant be do what you need to do and then pack up shop and leave so new school and old school but unfortunately all of the research demonstrates today that tor was an interesting experiment but what we know about what the nsa is capable of doing and some evidence of what has happened shows us that we just cant rely on it for one stop shopping of being anonymous on the internet quoteleo is there any way to be anonymous steve the problem is this notion of near real time versus high latency non real time i mean if something like tor existed for email then the real achilles heel is traffic and i dont know how you can arrange that if your traffic disappeared into something large where there was no further visibility like say you disappeared behind a university scale nat where all of ucla was dot you know inside their network and then you also took some old school steps to be anonymous its difficult to know how they could penetrate but maybe ucal nat router tracks you inside so if law enforcement came to that in theyd say day now we need your records to figure out who inside the network was using this at this time of day so it probably still is possible i think anonymity is something of an illusion on the internet leo leo you could but i mean lets say you did use a library and you didnt check in and you hid you disguised yourself and you steve you used a hood leo and you keep moving i think is obviously the key steve yup yup leo you could do some stuff anonymously yeah steve i do think i mean rascally though there were saying the internet isnt providing our anonymity the real world is providing our anonymity leo right you have to be anonymous in the real world for that to work right steve yes leo because if the real world knows who you are the internet will somehow cough that up or can be made to cough that up steve unfortunately i think it really can so what i wanted to do was to rascally revisit this and dispel any belief in our listeners that use tor and youre golden youre really not if somebody wants to find you they probably can leo all right fascinating stuff as theyre pointing out in the chatroom ross ulbricht was arrested in a library so there you go stove he stuck around too long leo waited a little too long to move on steve you dont want to be chatting up the librarian you want to keep your head down get in leo keep moving stove oh and dont go back leo and never go back . tl drso the only way i mean if you absolutely need anonymity is to roll together old school approaches and

advertising and ranking says dr chris white the program manager for memex who gave a demo of the engine to the minutes news program to achieve this goal memex will not only scrape content from the millions of regular web pages that get ignored by commercial search engines but will also chronicle thousands of sites on the so called dark web such as sites like the former silk road drug emporium that are part of the tor network s hidden services these sites which have onion web addresses are accessible only through the tor browser and only to those who know a site s specific address although sites do exist that index some hidden services pages often around a specific topic and there is even already a search engine called grams for uncovering sites selling implicit drugs and other

of where the ads were hasted implying that tracking where an ad moves from one ip address to another could reveal to law enforcement where the trafficker is locked but white says the ip address is the least important information they analyze instead they focus on other data points sometimes it s a function of in address but sometimes it s a function of a phone number or address in the ad or the geolocation of a device that posted the ad he says there are sometimes other artifacts that contribute to location for example an ad attempting to sell the sexual services of a woman or child in one

used to locate people who leave traces of themselves all over the clearnet in various ways that can be found by tracking their movements through a part of the web called the deep web which is not the darknet the deep web is that part of the web that is not accessible via search engines that use spiders to crawl the internet via curls all sorts of databases that dont have http style urls but that nonetheless contain tons of data make up the deep web the darknet is actually unsearchable using webcrawlers yes its true that parts of the darknet can perhaps be termed deep web type sites as well for instance el presidentes endor databse is a deep web resource but mainly its all http pages now im not saying these techniques wouldnt be useful at all to dox tor users but only if tor users are leaving tracks on the darknet such as telephone numbers or names in a database that can be linked via some method to other data that when crosslinked can uncover ill identities however the way they are catching pedophiles using memex is that they generally interface with learned resources somehow to advertise etc these guys often have terrible opsec so a hint somewhere that can be linked to some other web account that links to something else can lead to a do event what this does remind me of is the way they uncovered ross ulbricht if you recall they found some forum where he had posted his first advert for sr using an account that originally had his do email account linked to it he later changed that email to an anonymous one but the damage was done b c le was somehow able to find out the original email address he created the account with that is what this memex stuff is good for as long as you keep your ill clearnet web presence completely isolated from your darknet presence memex will not work on you . lock one if you read the article on memex its really not about tor at all its used to locate people who leave traces of themselves all over the clearnet in various ways that can
