pm if youre messaging a vendor if you want to train you can pm me or post to this thread if you did it right nobody else will be able to get anything out of it anyway most important edit i noticed that you included a gmail account in your key im not going to try and google it but if this is an account that you use at all outside of tor or tied in any way to your other identities offline or online delete your key and make a new one without it seriously edit hm wait did you encrypt your message with my key or yours if you encrypted the message with your own public key its useless for communication because only you can decrypt it with the corresponding private key of the pair if youre using pip us and want to message someone me for example you need to follow the link to my key select the text in your browser right click and copy or ctrl c go to pgp us click import key in upper right side and import from clipboard alternatively you can paste into the editor and import from there write your message in the editor check a box next to my key to the right and encrypt once you have done it you will not be able to decrypt it again paste it in this threadedit heres a message for you see if you can decrypt it copy into editor decrypt begin pip message version gnupg v gnu linux hqima zzo ogajr araaqve vo mgqg ahn qykvnouazsgjz m sfnbyb dsqez kgv n h ca jngajhgxcfczq b xozs
