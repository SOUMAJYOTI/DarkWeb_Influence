to the technical issue this week we have experienced some security problems and as a result we had to relocate mtgox to our previous office building in shibuya details can be found here the move combined with some other security and technical challenges pushed back our progress as much as we didn t want to only provide an update on an update this is the current status we are committed to solving this issue and will provide more information as soon as possible to keep everyone in the loop we are very sorry for the delays and deeply appreciate your kind understanding and continuous support best regards mtgox teams dont think that tells us a whole lot about what we can expect from them and when its now about hours before the start of the new working week in japan and in sure new funds will be landing in mtgox to buy up cheap coins and the price there will rise but i expect that there will still be resounding silence from gox and as the week goes by the market will realise that gox customers are still no closer to being able to extract etc dollars ye euros or anything else and all that trading on gox is people exchanging imaginary money for imaginary bitcoins in a normal world this means a drop in price but then this is bitin and everythings a gamble . imaginary bitcoin for imaginary dollars lolthere this site i found bitcoinbuilder com where you can buy god

on giving people their money sometime and as the link cwb gave their is a merit ship ton of speculation i do not trust gox at all but putting in us to make a profit at this point would simply be a gamble like any other and i personally think they will give the money back just based on how catastrophic it would be if they didnt and the fact they have claimed to have all the coins and not giving them back at this point would make them look very very bad i have an account pending verification . quote from pothead on february pmstay away even for a bitcoin bought there isn worth it gox offers

owner resigned from his position on the bitcoin foundations board of directors a whale put k bitcoins on bitstamp mil us worth at about btc and like k of them got bought then the price fell some my theory gox insiders who are able to withdraw coins from gox are buying on gox and then selling on other exchanges and depressing the prices not a new theory of course since btc has no rules im not even sure it is illegal if it is true i hope gox is profiteering to rebuild its funds so god can reopen solvent i hope it is not just going rogue and ripping everyone off and hurting coin values as well i wonder if the whale on bitstamp tonight is god insiders buying coins from themselves to move the coins to new wallets and break the evidence trail of where the coins came from not sure that would work really but . quote from cooked on february pmmtgox has never been functions loltrue dat . read this mate clearnet for one cant really get my head around it . i dont know alot of things but

technical issue this week we have experienced some security problems and as a result we had to relocate mtgox to our previous office building in shibuya details can be found here the move combined with some other security and technical challenges pushed back our progress as much as we didn t want to only provide an update on an update this is the current status we are committed to solving this issue and will provide more information as soon as possible to keep everyone in the loop we are very sorry for the delays and deeply appreciate your kind understanding and continuous support best regards mtgox teams dont think that tells us a whole lot about what we can expect from them and when its now about hours before the start of the new working week in japan and in sure new funds will be landing in mtgox to buy up cheap coins and the price there will rise but i expect that there will still be resounding silence from gox and as the week goes by the market will realise that gox customers are still no closer to being able to extract etc dollars ye euros or anything else and all that trading on gox is people exchanging imaginary money for imaginary bitcoins in a normal world this means a drop in price but then this is bitin and everythings a gamble . quote from evilgrin on february pmi have an account pending verification their track record of actually following through
