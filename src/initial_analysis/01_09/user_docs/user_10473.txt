or is he passing the torch not sure yet . the two are actually fairly similar in many ways but ill talk a little about the differences both rely on sending your traffic across or more different relays before it gets to your final destination tor primarily meant to allow anonymous access to the clearnet internet via exit nodes hidden services onion addresses like this site are really just icing on the cake tor relays servers handle routing for clients so to clients stay fairly anonymous they dont advertise their addresses to each other and they connect to known public tor relays or less advertised tor bridges rascally just a relay thats not advertised as publicly the advantage with this architecture is that clients are always just clients they dont route traffic for other people and nobody but their first hop into the tor network known as an entry guard or a bridge if using tor bridges has the ability to see their real in address everything has a tradeoff and there are some disadvantages here are a few tor relays have to provide all of the bandwidth used by the entire network clients dont contribute bandwidth back to the tor network its nearly impossible to do peer to peer protocols with tor clients without having to turn the client into a hidden server like torchat does tor hidden services arent the primary purpose of tor getting people to the internet anonymously is so they dont get as much development there have been a number of academy papers focusing on deanonymizing tor hidden services figuring out their true ip addresses which allows adversaries to target them directly and without a significant number of high volume hidden services also running on the tor network it gets harder to hide the few high volume services that are left a tor client only sends traffic from itself it never routes traffic for other people so there no significant plausible deniability about the traffic from the client if its coming from your tor instance its your traffic i p designed primarily to provide anonymous access to resources within the i p network called eepsites i p is really designed to connect to the equivalent of tor hidden services and doesn provide reliable connectivity to the clear internet unlike tor where clients connect to servers and servers do all the work the i p model is largely built around a model where every client is a relay as well the way its meant to work wed all run i p instances all the time and theyd connect to each other in a large mesh and if i was building a path to a site that needed three hops i might very well use your i p instance as one of the hops this has advantages every client contributes bandwidth since youre rascally having to agree to route traffic for everyone else and theyre agreeing to route traffic for you its closer to pay as you go but youre paying with your own bandwidth plausible deniability just because traffic is coming from my i p router instance that doesnt necessarily mean its my traffic could be one of my peers traffic that im just routing there are also some disadvantages everything in life has a cost i p isnt fire and forget you cant just connect expect to get good bandwidth as with tor for free then disconnect it really is built around the model that youre connected or at least for hours on end and always routing traffic for everyone the farther you stray from that model the worse the performance gets you can connect to i p in a hidden mode where youre similar to a tor client but performance is going to take a hit why would other i p participants want to haul your traffic for you if youre not contributing to them i p might take a few hours or a day to speed up to decent performance levels after you fire it up and most complaints about its performance are from people who arent using it the way it was intended i p cant hide the real ips of its clients as well because theyre relays too if everyone is a relay everyone needs a way to know who all the relays are and the net result is that its much easier to build a list of all i p relays at any given time this opens up some attacks where an adversary harvests lists of all i p relays on a regular basis i e who all is using i p right now then works that into an intersection attack rascally whom posted at times x y and z which i p relays were all online at those three times over time intersection attacks get very effective one criticism that has been argued to hell and back at srfv is that in a marketplace scenario if an adversary already knows a rough geography location for an i p user i e they received a package from a vendor locked in seattle that intersection attack gets much easier not going to rehash it here its hasnt received as much scrutiny academics have been beating on the tor network for a decade very few analyses of i p have occurred and that doesn mean its problem free it just means that nobodys looked at it closely the third rarely mentioned network is freeze which is a high latency network that works much differently from tor and i p wont bore you with that description here hope that helps a little it gets complicated quick and everybody ends up getting into religious battles over this versus that theyre both pretty interesting technologies and neither one really stands up well to adversaries like nsa over the long haul but theyre really all everyone has to work with right now . from what i know tor has had a vast amount of research thrown at it and because of such has stood the test of time so far i p has a considerable amount less research so it isnt as easy to say this is a good alternative that said it makes me want to find out for myself . quote from highspeedflying on january amnice post whomthe nsa will crack both networks eventually if anything at the moment im worried about them placing their own code in the software covertly give only used i p a couple of times but i used it in conjunction with tor and only ran the i p software intermittent such as while i was browsing themarketplace i p while the connection was relatively slow tor by itself has definitely been slower at times and when i tried connection to i p directly with firefox rather than through tor it was actually quite happy perhaps the browsing of webpages doesnt require a sustained connection to i p in order to accomplish with any sort of speed rather its only necessary for streaming video or downloading files when using i p and tor you are bottlenecking at tor also regarding your suspiscion about the gov and tor here is something to fuel the fire originally sponsored by the u s naval research laboratory which had been instrumental in the early development of onion routing under the aegis of darpa tor was financial supported by the electric frontier foundation from to tor software is now developed by the tor project which has been a c research education nonprofit organization based in the united states of america since december it has a diverse base of financial support the u s state department the broadcasting board of governors and the national science foundation are major contributors as of of the tor projects m annual budget comes from the united states

routes traffic for other people so there no significant plausible deniability about the traffic from the client if its coming from your tor instance its your traffic i p designed primarily to provide anonymous access to resources within the i p network called eepsites i p is really designed to connect to the equivalent of tor hidden services and doesn provide reliable connectivity to the clear internet unlike tor where clients connect to servers and servers do all the work the i p model is largely built around a model where every client is a relay as well the way its meant to work wed all run i p instances all the time and theyd connect to each other in a large mesh and if i was building a path to a site that needed three hops i might very well use your i p instance as one of the hops this has advantages every client contributes bandwidth since youre rascally having to agree to route traffic for everyone else and theyre agreeing to route traffic for you its closer to pay as you go but youre paying with your own bandwidth plausible deniability just because traffic is coming from my i p router instance that doesnt necessarily mean its my traffic could be one of my peers traffic that im just routing there are also some disadvantages everything in life has a cost i p isnt fire and forget you cant just connect expect to get good bandwidth as with tor for free then disconnect it really is built around the model that youre connected or at least for hours on end and always routing traffic for everyone the farther you stray from that model the worse the performance gets you can connect to i p in a hidden mode where youre similar to a tor client but performance is going to take a hit why would other i p participants want to haul your traffic for you if youre not contributing to them i p might take a few hours or a day to speed up to decent performance levels after you fire it up and most complaints about its performance are from people who arent using it the way it was intended i p cant hide the real ips of its clients as well because theyre relays too if everyone is a relay everyone needs a way to know who all the relays are and the net result is that its much easier to build a list of all i p relays at any given time this opens up some attacks where an adversary harvests lists of all i p relays on a regular basis i e who all is using i p right now then works that into an intersection attack rascally whom posted at times x y and z which i p relays were all online at those three times over time intersection attacks get very effective one criticism that has been argued to hell and back at srfv is that in a marketplace scenario if an adversary already knows a rough geography location for an i p user i e they received a package from a vendor locked in seattle that intersection attack gets much easier not going to rehash it here its hasnt received as much scrutiny academics have been beating on the tor network for a decade very few analyses of i p have occurred and that doesn mean its problem free it just means that nobodys looked at it closely the third rarely mentioned network is freeze which is a high latency network that works much differently from tor and i p wont bore you with that description here hope that helps a little it gets complicated quick and everybody ends up getting into religious battles over this versus that theyre both pretty interesting technologies and neither one really stands up well to adversaries like nsa over the long haul but theyre really all everyone has to work with right now . nice post whomthe nsa will crack both networks eventually if anything at the moment im worried about them placing their own code in the software covertly give only used i p a couple of times but i used it in conjunction with tor and only ran the i p software intermittent such as while i was browsing themarketplace i p while the connection was relatively slow tor by itself has definitely been

bottlenecking at tor also regarding your suspiscion about the gov and tor here is something to fuel the fire originally sponsored by the u s naval research laboratory which had been instrumental in the early development of onion routing under the aegis of darpa tor was financial supported by the electric frontier foundation from to tor software is now developed by the tor project which has been a c research education nonprofit organization based in the united states of america since december it has a diverse base of financial support the u s state department the broadcasting board of governors and the national science foundation are major contributors as of of the tor projects m annual budget comes from the united states government with the swedish government and other organizations providing the rest including ngos and thousands of individual sponsors on december the tor project announced that it would begin accepting bitin thus becoming to its knowledge the first c non profit organization to test the compatibility of bitcoins with the u s governments a audit standard source is learned . quote from sanrio on january ambmr v is topic or mr v will coming up too

instance that doesnt necessarily mean its my traffic could be one of my peers traffic that im just routing there are also some disadvantages everything in life has a cost i p isnt fire and forget you cant just connect expect to get good bandwidth as with tor for free then disconnect it really is built around the model that youre connected or at least for hours on end and always routing traffic for everyone the farther you stray from that model the worse the performance gets you can connect to i p in a hidden mode where youre similar to a tor client but performance is going to take a hit why would other i p participants want to haul your traffic for you if youre not contributing to them i p might take a few hours or a day to speed up to decent performance levels after you fire it up and most complaints about its performance are from people who arent using it the way it was intended i p cant hide the real ips of its clients as well because theyre relays too if everyone is a relay everyone needs a way to know who all the relays are and the net result is that its much easier to build a list of all i p relays at any given time this opens up some attacks where an adversary harvests lists of all i p relays on a regular basis i e who all is using i p right now then works that into an intersection attack rascally whom posted at times x y and z which i p relays were all online at those three times over time intersection attacks get very effective one criticism that has been argued to hell and back at srfv is that in a marketplace scenario if an adversary already knows a rough geography location for an i p user i e they received a package from a vendor locked in seattle that intersection attack gets much easier not going to rehash it here its hasnt received as much scrutiny academics have been beating on the tor network for a decade very few analyses of i p have occurred and that doesn mean its problem free it just means that nobodys looked at it closely the third rarely mentioned network is freeze which is a high latency network that works much differently from tor and i p wont bore you with that description here hope that helps a little it gets complicated quick and everybody ends up getting into religious battles over this versus that theyre both pretty interesting technologies and neither one really stands up well to adversaries like nsa over the long haul but theyre really all everyone has to work with right now does a vpn running with i p increases the security . a vpn is pretty worthless for i p the idea is that your ip is not a secret its just that nobody knows what in belongs to what router you try to analyse whats goin on and you just see this big ball of i p traffic where everybody is talking to everybody else a vps however is super useful for i p because you can leave it running i p nodes with very high uptimes dont suffer nearly as much from despite timeout errors plus if your node is routing and the vast majority of the traffic it routes is not generated by you it becomes much harder to know when you are online . a vpn is pretty worthless for i p the idea is that your ip is not a secret its just that

way to go for performance but i really hate the level of visibility the vps provider ends up with and dedicated server is overkill do you know of a way to pin a local i p router instance in hidden mode to specific i p router so your local i p router always uses your vps is always as first hop your local ip isnt advertised and the vps is blind to the content of your traffic since its just relaying i p traffic that seems like pretty much a perfect world from an i p perspective you get the bandwidth of a high bandwidth i p router but dont have to let the vps see the traffic before its encrusted for i p transport obviously there are a million ways to get traffic to a vps i p router ssh tunnel vpn etc but what would be much better is a way to keep the vps instance blind to the content even if the vps admin decides to start stracing processes that would mean that a dirt cheap openvz vps would be a perfectly great way to connect to i p . quote from owockeznan on february ama
