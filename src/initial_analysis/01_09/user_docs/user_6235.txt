i know there has been a punk anarchist scene in the east bay for a long time sacramento too i always thought they were more hardcore than the social punks i guess i dont understand what era this took place in there was the brotherhood of eternal love is acid anarchy like that anarchism is the belief in a stateless classless and leaderless society if people were distibuting lsd in the s and s in berkeley for essentially free that could be it i remember walking down telegraph ave and everyone would say dollar doses and berkeley was ground zero for lsd during this time i dont believe the crap about putting it in the water supply that was above hoffman and he made it up so i would be more interested if it was hippies puns futurists involved with anarchism in that area it could just be a group of cub students who didnt identify with the happy or new age movement yet were futurists or into the punk or digital art movement like the one green day the residents and other bands emerged from lsd was very important in that scene my gut tells me he is talking about the real s s radical set like the slf although the psychedelic movement has had many faces exit im fairly certain mckenna was talking about the radical s and s student groups many were commonest or anarchist and promoted a shapeless society there is a site called quirky berkeley which has some good info on these groups

panopticono m s . hi greenbud thank you for your reply for me it s useful think that anarchist movement has many faces like the psychedelic one i think that anarchism it s also the belief in a stateless classless and leaderless society but not only a for me it s a sort of polar star that can describe a possible way to think a new world for example a it s a way for self determination and absolute freedoma it s a particular approach for many questions about education sexuality economy nature society art culture ecc etc life in general can be interpreted following anarchist theories for many people i think politics theories in general becomes cages marx said that bakunin said that jesus said that i blindly believe in that theories and nothing or nobody can change my opinions i think that we should find new ways new theories new solutions our world is changing problems are changing people are changing and maybe our ideas should change too i m looking for new tools to write down my personal novel we have the chances now to use new tools internet for example or darknet for example the past it s helpful when it teach to understand the past mistakes but i don t want live buried in old interpretations of reality i don t know how b e l was anarchist i don t know if this is a problem maybe a theories can suggest a way to move into the politic checkerboard the contrast between bakunin and marx for example it s an old story that is sadly always current and avoid maybe to commit the same mistakes i want carry forward my personal idea of anarchism it s a personal matter is there someone that thinks about it like me yes good i want to know everything if it s possible about his ideas i would mix different theories and not defend only one thank you for your advices i will study b e l movement and quick berkeley for me it s beautiful to discover something that i don t know i close with a consideration one of the big unsolved problems of anarchism in general it s to reduce the gap between people that think that this world is full of unacceptable contradictions and people that live quietly in a world full of contraddictions for many anarchists old and young it s a problem about consciousness a in general are always looking for a solution how to awake consciences direct action propaganda alternative education alternative styles of life i don t know if there is someone that mix theories about psychedelic movement with for example the newest anarchist theories i think for example to foucault or bookchin when i talk with anarchists don t accept to consider the psychedelic theories are there psychedelic teories in this sense leary for them sons of flowers failed there isn t a second chance i would to know why they b e l for example failed did they really fail because i think that this story it s not necessary finished peaceful panopticon . hi greenbud thank you for your reply for me its useful think that anarchist movement has many faces like the

mentality this is why ows failed in many respects but i see the trend moving to collective anarchism as well gb but at what cost the problem is the value proposition relative to job delegation and shifting of duties not everyone wants to be tree planter but not everyone is smart enough or think in the way necessary to be a bit more euphemistic to build space ships so in the ideal situation the daytrippers can find their bliss playing guitar and bongos another librarians can publish books to me it seems one of the major disconnects and cause of unrest in society today is this reliance on computer technology and placing less than ideal expectation on everyone to be competent in that area in america i feel we live in a meritocracy that is built upon nepotism and old money and if you don t come from a certain cloth you live a destitute life usually at least if you are absolutely brilliant you may have a chance at something but is that something even palpable anymore fuck i think i was happy the most being homeless in fl when i was endless summer riding waves and couch surfing i did not need the same glorious view from the balcony of a million home it was fine from the beach view our values are displaced but yeah it s coming to a head soon . interesting hacker culture and lsd is deeply inter wished we need to find a way to self govern without falling into the political trap by

conformity first they make college students take out huge loans then live in dormitories under constant threat of eviction make their entire education about passing courses with little intrinsic value and force them to make a thesis to identify their political beliefs and tendencies all under a pile of debt with the promised incorporate gig down the road this makes it difficult for smart people to really get ahead without buying into the system now many people are finding that in reality without slaving away for years with no benefits they still can not find work in their field this is where the cracks will start to form tech schools and job training should be encouraged over fancy degrees i have talked about this with many highly educated people phds and they agree that most higher education especially the elate schools like harvard stanford yale u of michigan etc are just tools to ensure people will not rebel against authority or challenge their employers dont even get me started about think tanks and policy wonks they have taken selling out to a whole other level i think people should get what they work hard for but not at the expense of society and the greater good

way people are tight man stressed the fuk out i feel shameful for carrying a smile at times many just scowl back like i must be rolling in dough im not just a poor as anyone one yet still whistling die haha tech schools and job training should be encouraged over fancy degrees i have talked about this with many highly educated people phds and they agree that most higher education especially the elate schools like harvard stanford yale u of michigan etc are just tools to ensure people will not rebel against authority or challenge their employers totally if i could go back i would have went into a teach trade route they can be very lucrative and more satisfying work even some of my professors have blurred out right to new students why are you here you don t need this if your just looking for a good salary but if one has the desire to be entrenched in academia and has the gusto perseverance and grooming for it go for it i think the hard sciences are very important we need theorists mathematicians physicists ecologists economists etcand many enjoy the insulating comforting bubble of being a career student research can be very regarding and helpful in society but as you implied none of these endeavors should be founded for just elitists tweed suit aristocracy at the expense of slave wagers that blows but sadly if there were not somebody toiling the fields the greatest discoveries would not likely have been had somebody had to slave so the great minds could spend endless hours in their cobweb infested library puzzling over the mysteries of the universe it is

they should jump on that shit just that it monetizes and disincentivizes many smart people because the barrier of entry is so high i think there is great research going on right now but it seems like things are changing on campuses and in general it is getting so expensive to get a degree i hold a university degree from a major state school with honors and without debt i m glad i finished school because i have more opportunities i would like to see less debt and more opportunity rascally there is an organized conspiracy within academia to be resistance to social change within the organization s that run such endeavors are rich people influential people they keep other rich people in their circles and ignore everyone and everything else i think this is changing and that is good then again most of the coolest people i ve met were professors worthy ones are imnvqluble and there are some cool people out there i met some of the best people i know in college but that was long ago good times . so true es dafunkfuzz i agree that there should be some guidelines skills assessment and education should be free for those who are serious but allot of kids coming out of hs are just not mature enough for college tbh i flunked out in my s i had to party it off and have a few shit jobs before i finally got tired of working for min wagestocking shelves at family dollar before i could sit in a classroom again when i started going back to school at it sucked again but only coz i had to sit in a class room with the same kinda knuckleheads that i was they just were not ready some of them were some of them were groomed and were very serious like they were militant and had panic attacks when they got anything under me i had to take it slow but i did the work and got through it yes the whole system is bunk and teachers are backed to the wall with it i remember my calc professor just so frustrated that he would not be able to cover bezier curves they literally chopped half the book off and said here is watered down calc crammed into weeks have at it and the prof just told us hey i dont make these rules this should be a semcourse i hope that i can convey the elegance and beauty of calculus just enough so that you will continue to study beyond the chapters we will coverand he did it was amazing i had great math teachers they were passionate about the material and you could see it in there faces and body movements and it really got us into it i recall hanging out with other students in coffee shops at am discussing convergence divergence optimization etc such fascinating discoveries i digress college is a boon iff you go to college to learn and yeah college is de not for everyone i mean there are very smart people in the world who in many ways are too smart for college and yet if they get told college is the only way they are likely to burn out and never achieve their full potential i had a friend like that he just could not learn in the structure format that college enforces he would skip all over study chapter then connect that to then etc likeit was just his way of piecing the puzzle together and he had weird sleep habits and sitting in classrooms was impossible going to college made him feel stupid because he could notconform he was literally trying to function in a less than ideal setting i dont care what anyone says the structure format of college does allot to segregate people and create the false impression that some people can not excel in say mathematics bs some people have to learn their own way at their own pace sometimes in linear algebra i would spend hours running back and forth into the teachers office to get help with a complex proof and the teacher would say put it away go do something fun ill give you another week come back to it tomorrow see she knew the value of spacing that we are not computers we are humans and we need time to digest integrate and at times we need to rest or goof off abit . i think we as a society should be giving those who want to go to college or trade school a free pass provided they can handle the course and get good grades no messing around if they mess around or fail courses they get dropped and if they want to get back in they pay the youth of today is our future why do we crush them with debt just doesnt make sence we should spend more time helping kids with work shops and life lessons and make sure the path they want to take will be a good choice so many kids in nd yr college dont know what they want sad all they know is go to college build debt and come out with a degree they cant get a job with the biggest scamm of all is the american education system even the teachers are going through the numbers most done give a shit about the student just a pay check . so true es dafunkfuzz i agree that there should be some guidelines skills assessment and education should be free for those who are serious but allot of kids coming out of hs are just not mature enough for college tbh i flunked out in my s i had to party it off and have a few shit jobs before i finally got tired of working for min wagestocking shelves at family dollar before i could sit in a classroom again when i started going back to school at it sucked again but only coz i had to sit in a class room with the same kinda knuckleheads that i was they just were not ready some of them were some of them were groomed and were very serious like they were militant and had panic attacks when they got anything under me i had to take it slow but i did the work and got through it yes the whole system is bunk and teachers are backed to the wall with it i remember my calc professor just so frustrated that he would not be able to cover bezier curves they literally chopped half the book off and said here is watered down calc crammed into weeks have at it and the prof just told us hey i dont make these rules this should be a semcourse i hope that i can convey the elegance and beauty of calculus just enough so that you will continue to study beyond the chapters we will cover and he did it was amazing i had great math teachers they were passionate about the material and you could see it in there faces and body movements and it really got us into it i recall hanging out with other students in coffee shops at am discussing convergence divergence optimization etc such fascinating discoveries i digress college is a boon iff you go to college to learn and yeah college is de not for everyone i mean there are very smart people in the world who in many ways are too smart for college and yet if they get told college is the only way they are likely to burn out and never achieve their full potential i had a friend like that he just could not learn in the structure format that college enforces he would skip all over study chapter then connect that to then etc likeit was just his way of piecing the puzzle together and he had weird sleep habits and sitting in classrooms was impossible going to college made him feel stupid because he could notconform he was literally trying to function in a less than ideal setting i don t care what anyone says the structure format of college does allot to segregate people and create the false impression that some people can not excel in say mathematics bs some people have to learn their own way at their own pace sometimes in linear algebra i would spend hours running back and forth into the teachers office to get help with a complex proof and the teacher would say put it away go do something fun i ll give you another week come back to it tomorrow see she knew the value of spacing that we are not computers we are humans and we need time to digest integrate and at times we need to rest or goof off abit . no joke the education system is appalling as is the healthcare some things just shouldn t be sold as commodities and then there is the actual public school system which is more about instituting a respect for authority than anything else . no joke the education system is appalling as is the healthcare some things just shouldn be sold as commodities and then there is the actual public school system which is

monetizes and disincentivizes many smart people because the barrier of entry is so high i think there is great research going on right now but it seems like things are changing on campuses and in general it is getting so expensive to get a degree i hold a university degree from a major state school with honors and without debt im glad i finished school because i have more opportunities i would like to see less debt and more opportunity rascally there is an organized conspiracy within academia to be resistance to social change within the organization s that run such endeavors are rich people influential people they keep other rich people in their circles and ignore everyone and everything else i think this is changing and that is good then again most of the coolest people give met were professors worthy ones are imnvqluble and there are some cool people out there i met some of the best people i know in college but that was long ago good times . im not trying to say harvard is bad or

those who are in charge decided to take that option away from us unless we either dropped out and got a ged or went to a private provider for those types of skills i remember a time when training in

like in the old days im letting my age show lol . right on psilocy i wish i knew more about fixing cars and stuff like that they taught us most of it in shop class but i only took the intro these other kids rebuilt a whole goddamn car lol i guess i do know more than most i just wish id like gone to truck driving school or something of course they drug test the hell out of cdl drivers and shit but i remember in school when someone smart would be like i want to be a plumber or truck driver warehouseman electrical roofer etc they wouldget shot down by the teachers and even stuff like you better pass that test and go to college or youll be driving a truck fuck i had a job with a truck driver and he makes way more money than i do i would say out of everyone i went to highschool with the ones who make the most money are generally people who got grad or post degrees yet most had to leave where they grew up to get a job the people who took over family businesses or started their own were able to stay in their community and make good money too not like i care about money just that people need stuff to do make a living self esteem and all oth money can eat a dick because it is
