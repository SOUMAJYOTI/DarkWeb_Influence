bridges will help disguise your tor usage from your isp so it wont stand out like dogs balls however if you come to the attention of le and they subsequently take a closer inspection of your internet usage then tor bridges wont be of much help at all if any tor bridges over hacked i fi or even a public wi fi hotspot is you must will help your cause however staying out of the attention of all le agencies in the first instance is what you should be aiming to do to setup the use of obis tor bridges in tails when connecting to the tor network first in an already open session of tails go to click on step get bridges scroll down the page to the advanced options ensure do you need a pluggable transport is set to obfs it is by default however its now possible to use obis bridges with tails if you choose to do so and then click on get bridges just below correctly fill out the displayed captcha and hit enter on your keyboard if the captcha is correct you will be given two obis bridges to use save them to your encrusted persistent folder for use when you next boot up tails close your current tails session and reboot tails when the tails greeter appears enter your password to access your persistent folder below in the welcome to tails window click on the yes button then click on the forward button on the next page enter in an admin password in case you ever need admin privledges then in the network configuration section below click on the following option this computers interest connection is censured faltered or promised then click on the button at the bottom right of screen i think it says login but i could be mistaken then after re starting your session of tails and connecting to the internet at the bottom right of screen an assistant will appear on screen to guide you through the configuration of tor click on the network manager applet tails uses different icons depending on if you choose to use the windows camouflague option in the tails greeter choose the network you wish to connect to if connecting tirelessly and enter in the password when requested to do so if youre using a wired connection tails will connect to the network automatically once your connected to the network of your choosing a network configuration utility will appear on your screen youl need to click on yes to the first question which is something like does your isp censor your internet connections or words to that effect then youl need to post either one or both of the saved obfs tor bridges from your persistent folder into the utility where required and hit enter on your keyboard thats it the network configuration utility will then use those obis bridges to connect you to the tor network its good practice imo to visit and obtain new bridges prior to closing your current session of tails to save in your persistent folder for use when you next connect to the tor network its not a necessity but its a good idea to use new fresh bridges which arent publicly listed as much as possible and not keep connecting to the tor network using older bridges it depends on factors like how often youre connecting to the tor network etc etc if youre connecting to tor and shutting down your sessions of tails numerous times a day then you could re use those bridges more than once however its a topic of discussion with a variety of opinions from a broad range of individuals so please read all you can before choosing what to do so you can make an educated and informed decision on what approach to take please feel free to add delete amend any steps where you feel like you have something constructive to add . hello everyone im creating this thread in the hopes that advice can be shared here in order to steer someone in the right direction from the beginning rather than let them make their own mistakes in the end that could have been avoided possibly cost them their freedom i understand the topic of vending isnt talked about too much the dnm forums are more accused around staying safe as a buyer its also not the smartest thing to post all the steps that may have led to you becoming a legendary vendor with just anyone being able to access the forums but i know the people who access this forum are very security conscious people who are more than willing to lend a helping hand to someone who is trying to make themselves feel safer anonymous in our ever growing surveillance state i know there are people here much more experienced knowledgeable than myself and any information you decide to share is greatly appreciated be smart and stay safe much love

samples eat and to at the very least know which city county state said vendor is shipping and most likely operating from and now the dea has a record of at least one return address said vendor used in the process so it is common understanding that return addys should either besides being printed and not at least always be handwritten that a use a fake name or fake home business type name with a real address preferable from a local apartment complex with the apartment unit omitted as to not unintentionally get someone else who might be a friend ally in trouble or b use the name addy of a small local retail store which one could safely assume is not likely involved in illegal activities and using their name addy shouldn unwittingly compromise anyones freedom although the feds are well aware the majority of vendors use a fake return addy this has not always been the case as the recent busts of those s vendors doctors in the boston area i believe prove they used a po box registered using their real world credentials as a return address really regardless a mistake i truly hope never to see repeated again what im getting at is in my opinion i feel until a long term trust has been built with a specific customer a vendor should always use a brand new return address for each and every letter package they send out yes this is an extra tedious time consuming process but its nothing a phone book the internet and a ox program like snailmail wont make much easier to accomplish because remember assume at least one of your packages was indeed ordered by the feds and contained a return address a return address that is now flagged in the uses system and in the future could be used to track your packages if used again to identify your customers and even compromise your own safety by allowing them to narrow down the hopefully various multiply drops you use and many articles referenced that the feds did indeed pose as buyers to collect such data before the fall of sr so this is now fact and beyond theory at this point and i feel personally it is your responsibility as a vendor to take this extra precaution until a certain level of trust has been built with individual

cover my tracks please or simply i dont want american lawyers up my ass because i just seeded the revenant i am not certain how concerned isps are with vpon usage its one area of security that does not seem to get too much attention besides your isp really is not going to be interested in your vpn use or tor use unless they have been directed to be interested by a leo i tried using bridges a while back from that tor project page that gives you three random ones i stopped after i kept getting american ones i done trust anything that is on american soil technology wise . interesting what do the bridges use for connection a standard ssl with the obfusproxy i would suppose connection or are you just obfus proxying a normal tor encrypted connection i have used tor on an off for a few years now but apart from my recent experiment mentioned above i have not used bridges . thanks normal network entry points are servers that have established trust over time bridge are entry points that are not listed in the normal manner are these bridges required to gain the same sort of trust as the standard entry points to the network or simply can anyone just set up one straight up and then just let the tor people know about it . so any bad actor can set a bridge up and have it running almost instantly whereas a bad actor who wanted to set up their own normal entry point to the network could do this but time would be needed before the server gained its trust and could convert from being a middle man server to an entry it almost seems as if bridges should be trusted less given that they are not subjected to the same long term trust gaining that entry points are or am i mis interperting things . further to my query above if you put a number of these bridges into the tbb config at start up are they selected at random each time the browser is used or are they just used in order are the bridges changed automatically like a normal entry server or will you just use the same bridge for all of your tbb session no matter how long that session is . another information post from mirage in regards to sending packs at vendors please read recycling return addys and more important that the

protection you have that you will ever have is to be and remain anonymous if your anonymous you can not be locked raised like you ive seen endless posts threads about encrypting ones hard drive destroying ones data etc by the time time theyve locked you and kick your door down youre already done its certain that they already have enough to convict you as it is whatever they get from your computer is just the icing on the cake the grugq has a video on youtube hitb kul d t the grugq opsec because jail is for wuftpd this is a video of his talk at the hackinthebox security conference held in indonesia in in this video he talks about the importance of doing just as you describe setting up fake user ids that will lead the authorities nowhere you can view it at the following uri normally would not recommend youtube videos but this one is an exception the grugq knows his ship zaphod and another post from x m this is an excellent post and a great video opsec is one of those things you need to learn as much as you can about then never discuss revealing details can help your enemy trace you or as i said above reveal if you might be a professional or someone with experience this means you should learn as much as you can implement it in private never discuss it and never fuck up even once because that is all it takes your highly secure setup can work for years and only needs to fail once to land you in prison i too think people should focus on security and anonymity rather than defense defense is a reactionary measure one taken after you are already caught and either will not work will make things worse or you simply wont be there to implement it defensive measures can also be held against you in court or if you are like the dumbass who wanted to be playing with vats of acid while under gunpoint probably shot if your defense is anything more than cutting power to your laptop and allowing encryption and plausible deniability to do the rest you are probably caught anyway your encryption and browsing habits should be enough assuming you practice them if they raid your house they might already have enough evidence to convict you stop revealing so much information online and the police should never end up at your house in the first place its best to prevent a problem than to keep it away for seconds longer after it shows up at your house stop telling others details of your security setup details about your password encrypt your ship encrypt your shit d c from tor when you are done use public access wifi dont use traceable nicknames or public keys segregate the private keys obey those and you will be fine . just wanted to add to bootmaxs post about cell towers and you being triangulated not sure if others have mentioned this in other posts but

then you shouldnt have a problem incorporating bridges into your setup the only issue you might have would be compatability issues with using obis bridges if you encounter this problem and cant connect to the tor network using obis bridges simply go back to using obis bridges for the time being until any compatability issues are finally resolved its a work in progress if you are still having issues using obis bridges then you must be overlooking one or more of the steps in the process bm or perhaps choosing an incorrect option in one of the steps used to incorpoate tor bridges into your

post above is still an applicable guide to follow in order to setup a bridge yes obis bridges will replace the soon to be discontinued obis bridges they are the latest release and supposed more secure than the existing obfs bridges one thing to note though is that obfs bridges still have compatibility issues with some network setups however this is still a work in progress some issues have finally been rectified yet some are still being worked on so if you find you have some issues connecting to the tor network using the obis bridges just ditch them for the time being and continue to use the

to follow suitit also puzzles me as to why so many active vendors are still using asa bit keys or worse still bit keys seriously its not like there is a cost involved to generate a new bit key so other than sheer laziness or just complacency i cant see any reason as to why vendors are still using bit keys theres also the fact that late last year the nsa stated that amongst others the asa bit

this is the point give been trying to drive home for years in other words that the only protection you have that you will ever have is to be and remain anonymous if your anonymous you can not be locked raised like you ive seen endless posts threads about encrypting ones hard drive destroying ones data etc by the time time theyve locked you and kick your door down youre already done its certain that they already have enough to convict you as it is whatever they get from your computer is just the icing on the cake the grugq has a video on youtube hitb kul d t the grugq opsec because jail is for wuftpd this is a video of his talk at the hackinthebox security conference held in indonesia in in this video he talks about the importance of doing just as you describe setting up fake user ids that will lead the authorities nowhere you can view it at the following uri normally would not recommend youtube videos but this one is an exception the grugq knows his ship zaphod and another post from x m this is an excellent post and a great video opsec is one of those things you need to learn as much as you can about then never discuss revealing details can help your enemy trace you or as i said above reveal if you might be a professional or someone with experience this means you should learn as much as you can implement it in private never discuss it and never fuck up even once because that is all it takes your highly secure setup can work for years and only needs to fail once to land you in prison i too think people should focus on security and anonymity rather than defense defense is a reactionary measure one taken after you are already caught and either will not work will make things worse or you simply wont be there to implement it defensive measures can also be held against you in court or if you are like the dumbass who wanted to be playing with vats of acid while under gunpoint probably shot if your defense is anything more than cutting power to your laptop and allowing encryption and plausible deniability to do the rest you are probably caught anyway your encryption and browsing habits should be enough assuming you practice them if they raid your house they might already have enough evidence to convict you stop revealing so much information online and the police should never end up at your house in the first place its best to prevent a problem than to keep it away for seconds longer after it shows up at your house stop telling others details of your security setup details about your password encrypt your ship encrypt your shit d c from tor

that have established trust over time bridge are entry points that are not listed in the normal manner are these bridges required to gain the same sort of trust as the standard entry points to the

page tor bridges are bridges tor relays that arent listed in the main tor directory since there is no complete public list or record of them even if your isp is filtering connections to all the known tor relays they probably wont be able to block any of the bridges youre current using yes you can create your own tor bridge tor relay and help out the tor network in the process . quote from sldk on

this regularly or at least learn how to do it i suppose we all should be doing this on a regular basis however in the grand scheme of things and in this dnm environment its most important that market vendors adopt this practice and encourage others to follow suitit also puzzles me as to why so many active vendors are still using asa bit keys or worse still bit keys seriously its not like there is a cost involved to generate a new bit key so other than sheer laziness or just complacency i cant see any reason as to why vendors are still using bit keys theres also the fact that late last year the nsa stated that amongst others the asa bit algorithm is no longer safe to use in the era of quantum computing personally i wouldnt go near any vendor who does . quote from bootiusmaximus on april

will help disguise your tor usage from your isp so it wont stand out like dogs balls however if you come to the attention of le and they subsequently take a closer inspection of your internet usage then tor bridges wont be of much help at all if any tor bridges over hacked i fi or even a public wi fi hotspot is you must will help your cause however staying out of the attention of all le agencies in the first instance is what you should be aiming to do to setup the use of obis tor bridges in tails when connecting to the tor network first in an already open session of tails go to click on step get bridges scroll down the page to the advanced options ensure do you need a pluggable transport is set to obfs it is by default however its now possible to use obis bridges with tails if you choose to do so and then click on get bridges just below correctly fill out the displayed captcha and hit enter on your keyboard if the captcha is correct you will be given two obis bridges to use save them to your encrusted persistent folder for use when you next boot up tails close your current tails session and reboot tails when the tails greeter appears enter your password to access your persistent folder below in the welcome to tails window click on the yes button then click on the forward button on the next page enter in an admin password in case you ever need admin privledges then in the network configuration section below click on the following option this computers interest connection is censured faltered or promised then click on the button at the bottom right of screen i think it says login but i could be mistaken then after re starting your session of tails and connecting to the internet at the bottom right of screen an assistant will appear on screen to guide you through the configuration of tor click on the network manager applet tails uses different icons depending on if you choose to use the windows camouflague option in the tails greeter choose the network you wish to connect to if connecting tirelessly and enter in the password when requested to do so if youre using a wired connection tails will connect to the network automatically once your connected to the network of your choosing a network configuration utility will appear on your screen youl need to click on yes to the first question which is something like does your isp censor your internet connections or words to that effect then youl need to post either one or both of the saved obfs tor bridges from your persistent folder into the utility where required and hit enter on your keyboard thats it the network configuration utility will then use those obis bridges to connect you to the tor network its good practice imo to visit and obtain new bridges prior to closing your current session of tails to save in your persistent folder for use when you next connect to the tor network its not a necessity but its a good idea to use new fresh bridges which arent publicly listed as much as possible and not keep connecting to the tor network using older bridges it depends on factors like how often youre connecting to the tor network etc etc if youre connecting to tor and shutting down your sessions of tails numerous times a day then you could re use those bridges more than once however its a topic of discussion with a variety of opinions from a broad range of individuals so please read all you can before choosing what to do so you can make an educated and informed decision on what approach to take please feel free to add delete amend any steps where you feel like you have something constructive to add .
