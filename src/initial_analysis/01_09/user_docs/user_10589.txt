btc and transferred it for illegal purposes person x was taken into custody with evidence of the illegal activities steps and are the ones most thought about and are dealt with by coin washing and pip encryption of address among other things ensuring safe delivery i think this post should emphasize point and the options for buying btc on here are mostly ones that can trace the purchase directly back to an individual i e to a credit card or bank account i endorse finding ways to purchase the btc using cash transfer in the most anonymous fashion possible for instance i have seen listings on localbitcoin com for cash in the mail transfers however one must have a high level of trust in said vendor for this to be a liable option another localbitcoin trick is the other online payment optioin where you purchase something like a greendot card in cash at a grocery store or convenience store and then unload images of said card and reciept showing it was purchased in cash if you choose this option it is vital that you know the metadata of the images you will be sending do not send images taken on a cell phone be sure there is no accurate time or location data retrievable from the image this can be accomplished through a function in tails or you could upload the images to imgur and then use those images for the transfer since most vendors who work this way request an image of the receipt as well i highly suggest using a pen or marker to remove all location time identification from the receirpt e g fold it to hide the label of the store you purchased it from write over the letters and numbers that could be used as identifiable information finally when you purchase the cash to coin intermediate e g vanilla reload card i suggest you wear heavy clothing such that no images of your face can be taken while you purchase the card i e hoddie and sun glasses and something to cover your chin gloves dont hurt either i also suggest you purchase cards from more than one location as this makes it more difficult to isolate where the purchases are taking place remember always act as if you are already compromise by leo as an extra step of precautions i would suggest parking your car a little ways aways from the purchase location so that no cameras could get a picture of you entering your car and getting your license plate number the only better way to buy coin is to buy it in cash from a friend of yours with a decent stock pile then there are no traces whatsoever this way if leo ever does hit you with scenario being caught with evidence of illegal activity they will not be

expresscoin and subpoenas them finds a record with an id that isnt you but they will follow up on that person what does this mean well for le it means a lot of work they now need to prove ownership of each wallet by the person whose id it is apocalypse scenario they are able to prove ownership of each wallet by the same person i dont know how this apocalypse scenario would happen but i am not the most technologically navvy person either if this happens the person whose id it is could get a visit from police but most likely not say at this point the person drops your name it certainly seems short of grounds for a warrant so i think they would probably do a knock and talk police stop by without warrant to try to get you to say something that is grounds for a warrant so police show up at your door hey muttley we have you linked to illegal purchases online we need to talk to you about this downtown sorry officer i wouldnt know anything about that sounds like some crazy shit though hope you officers have a good day bye bye now and that is where it ends the only downside is if your person with the id is compromise you can never again use your own address to receive anything and will need to use someone to catch packages for you from then on it is impossible to get to the level of police ever showing up if you mix coins properly there are a sufficient number of failsafes though for me to use this method with regularity and in large amounts certain steps do need to be taken though to prevent expresscoin or similar services from getting suspicious though do not order from multiply ids and send them all at the same time from the same location stagger by a few days if possible make sure the ids are not all from the same location if you live in a small town orders for two thousand bucks a piece within a week from the middle of kansas will raise eyebrows vary amounts slightly you can do up to k at a time i think so this isnt a huge deal any input or suggestions . i would expect this post to have advice on buying your coins in an anonymous fashion that is in order for leo to convict you they need all the pieces of the following puzzle person x purchased btc with y method same person x then transfered said purchased btc and transferred it for illegal purposes person x was taken into custody with evidence of the illegal activities steps and are the ones most thought about and are dealt with by coin washing and pip encryption of address among other things ensuring safe delivery i think this post should emphasize point and the options for buying btc on here are mostly ones that can trace the purchase directly back to an individual i e to a credit card or bank account i endorse finding ways to purchase the btc using cash transfer in the most anonymous fashion possible for instance i have seen listings on localbitcoin com for cash in the mail transfers however one must have a high level of trust in said vendor for this to be a liable option another localbitcoin trick is the other online payment optioin where you purchase something like a greendot card in cash at a grocery store or convenience store and then unload images of said card and reciept showing it was purchased in cash if you choose this option it is vital that you know the metadata of the images you will be sending do not send images taken on a cell phone be sure there is no accurate time or location data retrievable from the image this can be accomplished through a function in tails or you could upload the images to imgur and then use those images for the transfer since most vendors who work this way request an image of the receipt as well i highly suggest using a pen or marker to remove all location time identification from the receirpt e g fold it to hide the label of the store you purchased it from write over the letters and numbers that could be used as identifiable information finally when you purchase the cash to coin intermediate e g vanilla reload card i suggest you wear heavy clothing such that no images of your face can be taken while you purchase the card i e hoddie and sun glasses and something to cover your chin gloves dont hurt either i also suggest you purchase cards from more than one location as this makes it more difficult to isolate where the purchases are taking place remember always act as if you are already compromise by leo as an extra step of precautions i would suggest parking your car a little ways aways from the purchase location so that no cameras could get a picture of you entering your car and getting your license plate number the only better way to buy coin is to buy it in cash from a friend of yours with a decent stock pile then there are no traces whatsoever this way if leo ever does hit you with scenario being caught with evidence of illegal activity they will not be able to add on extra charges that would be possible if they can trace the purchase all the way back to the purchase of the btc washing your coins is important do it early and do it alot but there is another step before washing the coins that can be just as important as washing the coins and that is anonymous purchase of the coins please

through bitcoin fog with delivery to your clean wallet and you are good to go . hi guys just joined here i tried posting this on sr forum but ended up with karma in a couple hours hopefully people will be more receptive constructive here love sr but some customers suck dick i suggest using expresscoin or cashforcoin they offer several methods for acquiring coins one of which is sending a uses money order to buy a money order does not require id and costs less than like for every money order up to this means you can purchase several thousand dollars worth of money orders at different post offices in a very short period and keep returning to them benefits of using money orders are that banks do not see large transactions you can take your money from selling and turn it right into bitcoins no intermediary of a bank is involved also your name is not on the money order now these sites do require you to send a picture of an id with the money order this does not seem like the largest deal though most resourceful people should be able to come up with valid id from several different people not themself i mean jesus just pay some junkies a piece for pictures of their id and in an hour you will have ids just take a picture print that shit and mail it off with your money order you also need to email them a copy of pictures of id and money order wipe exif data and you are beno they will keep this id on file as they are a money transfer service but le will never get that far why you ask because you arent a dumbass and you mixed your coins of course fallbacks are necessary though i suggest tumbling or mixing or whatever twice before depositing it into any market wallet this redundancy will cost only a very small percentage and by the time you are done it is possible to get money into your marketplace wallet for only more than market value in huuuuge quantities here is how this all looks expression wallet a mixing wallet b mixing marketplacebad scenario

in potentially illegal activities and for lea as well forbes even went so far as to write an article at the end of january about safe mail wherein they were described as the email provider of choice for the darknet a forces reporter even interviewed the ceo who stated he was unaware of the problem until forbes called that is as far as safe mails ceo is concerned this is both a personal as well as professional black eye in any other context in sure they would be absolutely delighted to be the subject of a forces article not so much in this case i suspect now they will have the eyes of lea on them and in order to show they have not been turning a blind eye to illegal activity of necessity they must begin to crack down emails will be scrutinized as never before quote from fugazzi on april pmplease what did i miss about safe mail i mean if you encrypt sensitive anyway whats the down side to it encrypt sensitive you should be encrypting everything also bear in mind that while you can control what you do you can not control what others do you cant do anything about people sending you unencrypted email or if there dumb enough to use learned email providers without tor that said pgp does not protect the metadata i e the email headers these contain a lot of information of interest to the authorities right now you can login to safe mail through tor what if they suddenly start blocking known tor exit nodes if you only option is to logon through a clearnet i e non tor session then they can capture your ip address remember this point pgp protects your message content tor

public the idea seems to be that people who would not be willing to take the fairly short amount of time to learn to use pip encryption would be able to secure their e mail by trusting a third party in this case the folks at safe mail net we reject that idea on several grounds first the company that provides internet services for hosting the safe mail net system is barak net il based on our review of the domain registration for safe mail net barak net il is one of three companies with a license from the israel government for providing similar internet services according to the english language version of their web site as we understand it perhaps it is merely a coincidence that ehud barak was once head of the israel defense forces intelligence branch second the safe mail net system is an in trap our anonymous friend indicates that your ip address is linked to your e mail account the user agreement indicates that it is a violation of the user agreement to employ an anonymous proxy or otherwise attempt to mask your true ip address so while no identifying information name address phone is requested when you set up an account your in address may be traced to your physical location or at least to your specific internet service provider even if dynamite ip addresses are used thus your location and possibly your identity would be exposed also in addresses are not stripped from e mails you send from your safe mail account so your recipients see this information and of course you may be tempted to identify yourself to your correspondents within your purportedly encrusted e mails third safe mail net makes the usual disclosure that they may disclose your account activity stored e mails and other information upon court order or law enforcement request they make the unusual variation of this disclosure by stating that they may disclose these things whenever it is in their interest to do so this vague contract clause should scare anyone who thinks about it even briefly given that barak net il is licensed by the israel government it would seem quite likely that the israel government could command that the data from all safe mail net accounts be provided to the government and it would clearly be in the best interests of barak net il and conceivably by extension safe mail net to make such disclosure then it would seem to become a question of whether you have reason to trust the israel government we found no details about the encryption algorithms used to provide for security with safe mail net an investigation of israel law suggests that there is a mandate that encryption have back doors or key escrow for use by israel authorities so again it would appear to be a matter of whether you have reason to trust the israel government we dont have anything against the israel government that we dont also hold against nearly all other governments worldwide it is widely known that israel security and intelligence services have comparative relationships with the related services of other countries for example if a us government agency wanted information on someone who happens to use a safe mail net account it seems logical to suppose that a request formal or informed might be made to the israel government while it is impossible to know whether or not safe mail net accounts are tossed transparent or a kind of intelligence sting operation run by the mossad or others within the israel government what is publicly stated about the system seems to be closely reigned with what one would expect to find in that case we have no information presently at hand that would tend to disprove the hypothesis that safe mail net is an intelligence sting operation there is always free meat in a bear trap be careful whether you believe

knows who the truecrypt developer s are in the first place even matthew green who conducted phase one of the security audit only corresponded by email with the developer . quote from playground on

do not trust forks if it aint broke done fix it i say all i do know is that i have a backup copy of tc and will use it with a strong password until i die luck off microsoft fuck off le use a over the short haul whether you like it or not there are damn good reasons for a project fork the code grew organically over the last years and is likely unmaintainable furthermore the older the maintained code gets the more chance there is for vulnerabilities of one sort or another to be found it s a bit like people who still insist on using pgp a because they were convinced phil zimmermann put a backdoor in later versions of pgp while superb for its time that code is now showing its age it relies on the idea cipher and most ominously the md hash algorithm which has been broken for quite some time zaphod . quote from axa on june pmnot going to happen no one really knows who the truecrypt developer s are in the first place even matthew green who conducted phase one of the security audit

on june pmquote from firelight on june pmits also on github light of recent events you might want to wait for that security audit to complete before using it but there have been cases where le was unable to decrypt truecrypt containers was reading about a brazilian businessman who was under investigation for fraud brazilian le gave his truecrypt encrypted hard drive to the fbi and they tried for a year to crack it but couldnt so its probably safe still really weird that the devs would just drop the project saying its unsecure use bitlocker which is backdoored btw i agree that sounds very fishy the devs have presumably invested vast number of hours and gallons of creative juices into truecrypt so why orphan the project maybe because they were tired of it a decade is a long time to have to work on a free project that eats up a lot of your spare time and pays none of your bills all of the developers would have to have day jobs in order to eat and keep a roof over the heads quote from playground on june ami cant help thinking of the guy that ran lavabit when leo nobbled him for access to his users private keys he appealed to the courts since it violates citizens right to privacy but he lost the appeal so he shut down the operation in disgust hes clearly a high quality principle individual who deserves our respect i wonder if a similar scenario has occurred with truecrypt have a nice day and be happyplayground not likely what the authorities would have likely done assuming that they could find and somehow pressure the developers would be to put a backdoor in the code perhaps a way of leaking some of the key bits through a side channel attack of some sort i think the developers just were tired and wanted to bail they were also a little bit possession about the code and really didn t like the idea of anyone forking the code so they tried to discredit it zaphod . quote from playground on june amquote from axa on june pmnot going to happen no one really knows who
