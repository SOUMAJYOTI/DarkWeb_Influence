well if its all about trust in the end is there any point to multisig addresses . ask the next man to provide the other public keys then generate the address will begin with and see if it matches the payment address he gave you if it doesnt he is trying to scam you make sure he tells you what order he passed the addresses in or try all permutations yourself you can generate the addresses in electrum or bitcoind . quote from fromage on february pmalright thx so if i want to order something from tmp or any other market that has multsig i have to ask both the vendor and the marketplace for their public key every time yes technically you could but it really would not make much sense by using the old system of escrow you are putting trust that the server is going to pay out the money to the seller or refund it to you if there is a dispute in this case you are just placing trust that the server is creating a multisignature address that is releasable to either you or the seller if you intend on paying for your item then what concerns do you have requesting the public keys of the seller and server seems pointless since it is the seller who would end up getting the funds and this is why you choose trustworthy markets and vendors . quote from fromage on february pmwell if its all about trust in the end is there any point to multisig addresses yes it is to stop the market from getting robbed because each transaction needs to be unlocked separately with unique keys i suppose you could get the public keys from the seller and server but this reflectively would give the buyer and seller the ability to close the deal without the server and therefore you could cut out their market fees so this is a bad idea for the server to do this let me just say that there is no more risk to doing multisig than regular escrow and in fact less risk because a rd party hacker can not steal everyones money trusting the market is a choice you need to make on your own and if you want to deal directly with the vendor then do so outside of the market if the market is going to give its customers the ability to close deals while cutting out their market fees it would not be worth it for the market . aright thx so if i want to order something from tmp or any other market that has multsig i have to ask both the vendor and the marketplace for their public key every time . so in trying to wrap my head around this whole multisig thing and i think i got down mostly but im not sure about or parts so hopefully someone here can help me out the main concern i have is mostly about the security of it because for what i know it relies on a rd party to create a multisig address right now what guarantee do i have that this rd party uses the public key i provided and what guarantee do i have that this address is indeed a multisig and not or something else is there any way of verifying this and if so how . well if its all about trust in the end is there any point to multisig addresses

not worth it they could give you a mufti sig that is with addresses both controlled by the market this opens you up to obvious scams dont fall for what he is proposing verify the address and protect yourself from scams excuse me first of all your accusations about me are very offensive accusing me that i am trying to get you all to fall for something and i do not think you completely understand the entire process of multisignature addresses to make the claims you are making how is this any more risk than the escrow system that markets had before the markets were controlling the funds and getting robbed and cleaned out on several occasions people were placing trust in markets before and now suddenly you are worried about getting slammed where were you speaking out with the old escrow system quote from ronin on february pm also it makes no sense for the market to hide this if the buyer seller wanted to avoid fees they could set up their own escrow also in the situation jolly rover describes above the buyer could sign a transaction sending all funds to vendor and then vendor verifies and also signs the transaction funds released market bypassed the market is not protected in yes they buyer and seller could set up their own escrow outside the market but this would be stupid because having a makes it possible for the market to become the arbitrator in a only one of the people involved has to be a scammer and then the funds are locked forever with if the buyer tries to scam then the market can provide the second key to unlock the funds to send to the seller this is why is better than also in the case of the market can not be passed without the redeemscript generated at the time that the multisignature address is created if the market holds the redeemscript in a multisignature address then the buyer and seller can not complete the transaction on the side without the market and therefore cut out the markets fees another security issue with releasing all public keys involved is that it lets the participants know whether or not the seller buyer or server are reusing a private key and therefore making them more susceptible to attacks quote from ronin on february pm the market would rely on getting income through signing a transaction which sends most funds to vendor and commision to market this would then be signed by the buyer when he is happy if the buyer starts bypassing the market fee transaction then he is banned but to hide it all away from the user and not give them the ability to be able to verify addresses avoid this market set up its not healthy it is harder to verify you might think to see if the buyer and seller are closing the deal on the side unless the market is constantly searching through the blockchain for funds spent from that multisignature address it would be extremely difficult to verify that a buyer and seller are bypassing the market to cut out their fees quote from ronin on february pmi would warn anyone away from the setup jolly roger is promoting will lead to more scams in the future and it will not allow you to verify mufti sig is set correctly so what you are rascally saying here is that the market should trust the buyers but the buyers should not trust the market the market has every incentive to keep the ability to unlock funds itself out of its own hands so that it is not a target for hackers if the market has the ability to unlock the funds without any buyer or seller input it would make the market very dangerous and this is not desirable and defeats the purpose of it for the markets but giving out the keys and the redeemscript to the buyer and seller gives them the ability to close the deal outside the market and bypass fees again if you are not able to trust your market then yes contact the seller and say you want to do a with your seller outside of the market and you can easily set one up but with fees at an average of bypassing the fees will become more common than you think and is harder to detect than you think especially when you are dealing with thousands of transactions ronin i understand what you are saying and you make a valid point that it would likely be desirable for a buyer to have this setup but it is not desirable for a market to have this setup since the market relies on market fees and by giving your customers the ability to cut you out of the deal is bad for business there are plenty of free and multisignature services out there now that you can use if you are not comfortable using the markets system then use another one that gives you the public keys but if you expect the markets to start giving you the ability to bypass their commissions then you will likely never be happy i do not think it makes sense for markets to do this the cost

it for the market i have to disagree with this guyif the server doesnt give you the opportunity to verify the address then its not worth it they could give you a mufti sig that is with addresses both controlled by the market this opens you up to obvious scams dont fall for what he is proposing verify the address and protect yourself from scams also it makes no sense for the market to hide this if the buyer seller wanted to avoid fees they could set up their own escrow also in the situation jolly rover describes above the buyer could sign a transaction sending all funds to vendor and then vendor verifies and also signs the transaction funds released market bypassed the market is not protected in the market would rely on getting income through signing a transaction which sends most funds to vendor and commision to market this would then be signed by the buyer when he is happy if the buyer starts bypassing the market fee transaction then he is banned but to hide it all away from the user and not give them the ability to be able to verify addresses avoid this market set up its not healthy i would warn anyone away from the setup jolly roger is promoting will lead to more scams

completely understand the entire process of multisignature addresses to make the claims you are making how is this any more risk than the escrow system that markets had before the markets were controlling the funds and getting robbed and cleaned out on several occasions people were placing trust in markets before and now suddenly you are worried about getting slammed where were you speaking out with the old escrow system quote from ronin on february pm also it makes no sense for the market to hide this if the buyer seller wanted to avoid fees they could set up their own escrow also in the situation jolly rover describes above the buyer could sign a transaction sending all funds to vendor and then vendor verifies and also signs the transaction funds released market bypassed the market is not protected in yes they buyer and seller could set up their own escrow outside the market but this would be stupid because having a makes it possible for the market to become the

to send to the seller this is why is better than also in the case of the market can not be passed without the redeemscript generated at the time that the multisignature address is created if the market holds the redeemscript in a multisignature address then the buyer and seller can not complete the transaction on the side without the market and therefore cut out the markets fees another security issue with releasing all public keys involved is that it lets the participants know whether or not the seller buyer or server are reusing a private key and therefore making them more susceptible to attacks quote from ronin on february pm the market would rely on getting income through signing a transaction which sends most funds to vendor and commision to market this would then be signed by the buyer when he is happy if the buyer starts bypassing the market fee transaction then he is banned but to hide it all away from the user and not give them the ability to be able to verify addresses avoid this market set up its not healthy it is harder to verify you might think to see if the buyer and seller are closing the deal on the side unless the market is constantly searching through the blockchain for funds spent from that multisignature address it would be extremely difficult to verify that a buyer and seller are bypassing the market to cut out their fees quote from ronin on february pmi would warn anyone away from the setup jolly roger is promoting will lead to more scams in the future and it will not allow you to verify mufti sig is set correctly so what you are rascally saying here is that the market should trust the buyers but the buyers should not trust the market the market has every incentive to keep the ability to unlock funds itself out of its own hands so that it is not a target for hackers if the market has the ability to unlock the funds without any buyer or seller input it would make the market very dangerous and this is not desirable and defeats the purpose of it for the markets but giving out the keys and the redeemscript to the buyer and seller gives them the ability to close the deal outside the market and bypass fees again if you are not able to trust your market then yes contact the seller and say you want to do a with your seller outside of the market and you can easily set one up but with fees at an average of bypassing the fees will become more common than you think and is harder to detect than you think especially when you are dealing with thousands of transactions ronin i understand what you are saying and you make a valid point that it would likely be desirable for a buyer to have this setup but it is not desirable for a market to have this setup since the market relies on market fees and by giving your customers the ability to cut you out of the deal is bad for business there are plenty of free and multisignature services out there now that you can use if you are not comfortable using the markets system then use another one that gives you the public keys but if you expect the markets to start giving you the ability to bypass their commissions then you will likely never be happy i do not think it makes sense for markets to do this the cost of running a market is high and by allowing your buyers to not pay their taxes so to speak is a dumb move for the market again i reiterate if you do not trust your market do a or a outside of the market you make the choice . quote from jolly rover on february pmquote from fromage on february pmwell if its all about trust in the end is there any point to multisig addresses yes it is to stop the market from getting robbed because each transaction needs to be unlocked separately with unique keys i suppose you could get the public keys from the seller and server but this reflectively would give the buyer and seller the ability to close the deal without the server and therefore you could cut out their market fees so this is a bad idea for the server to do this let me just say that there is no more risk to doing multisig than regular escrow and in fact less risk because a rd party hacker can not steal everyones money trusting the market is a

cost of running a market is high and by allowing your buyers to not pay their taxes so to speak is a dumb move for the market again i reiterate if you do not trust your market do a or a outside of the market you make the choice i think it has already been shown that markets suffer from fraudulent owners or incompetent developers i am not saying markets shouldn charge a fee but i am also not proposing a solution that offers no benefits unless you absolutely trust the markets honesty and development abiity which recent events have shown arent a good bet i think this benefits everyone involved while i hear what you are saying about maintaining the dominance of markets and that users should trust them with multi sig i respectfully disagree i think its an appalling setup and will only lead to more scams and hacks it sovles nothing and doesnt move us towards a trustless system . quote from jolly rover on february amquote from mdparity on february amhowdy blackbanks system takes the commission before starting the crow transaction the transaction only has a single output instead of two this way blackbank is more than happy to allow vendors buyers to finalize outside of blackbank the only trust issue would be if blackbank offers support if there are problems however that is a lot less risk than traditional centralized escrow systems and easier for the buyer vendor in sure buyer vendor would prioritize verifying that the funds transactions over verifying support however i still promise to continue support with any issues ive been offering advice and support outside of blackbank entirely even to members of other markets its important to help each other in the community growing a safe and secure community is mutually beneficial for everyone regardless of immediate financial gain cheers mdparityinteresting idea i like it i feel like both can win in this situation get the buyer to send the commission first to the market then you can release all public keys to allow the buyer and seller to feel safer about the transaction very interesting and there we have it a solution that doesnt centralise all power with the market mdparity . rowdy blackbanks system

address then its not worth it they could give you a mufti sig that is with addresses both controlled by the market this opens you up to obvious scams dont fall for what he is proposing verify the address and protect yourself from scams excuse me first of all your accusations about me are very offensive accusing me that i am trying to get you all to fall for something and i do not think you completely understand the entire process of multisignature addresses to make the claims you are making how is this any more risk than the escrow system that markets had before the markets were controlling the funds and getting robbed and cleaned out on several occasions people were placing trust in markets before and now suddenly you are worried about getting slammed where were you speaking out with the old escrow system in sorry that you feel offended but done think i have said anything below the belt you are proposing a multi sig escrow solution which doesnt protect the buyer from rogue markets or incompetent developers kind of poinltess in my opionion regarding risk compared to previous its the same market could go rogue or loose all its coins due to incompetent dens whats your point you are proposing a solution that still exposes users to the same problems and its not a sudden worry i have raised the issue of mute sir way before the s debacle take the time to go through my postings on this forum and others and you will see i have been a long term proponent of multi sir way beforfe it became fashionable quote from jolly rover on february pmquote from ronin on february pm also it makes no sense for the market to hide this if the buyer seller wanted to avoid fees they could set up their own escrow also in the situation jolly rover describes above the buyer could sign a transaction sending all funds to vendor and then vendor verifies and also signs the transaction funds released market bypassed the market is not protected in yes they buyer and seller could set up their own escrow outside the market but this would be stupid because having a makes it possible for the market to become the arbitrator in a only one of the people involved has to be a scammer and then the funds are locked forever with if the buyer tries to scam then the market can provide the second key to unlock the funds to send to the seller this is why is better than also in the case of the market can not be passed without the redeemscript generated at the time that the multisignature address is created if the market holds the redeemscript in a multisignature address then the buyer and seller can not complete the transaction on the side without the market and therefore cut out the markets fees another security issue with releasing all public keys involved is that it lets the participants know whether or not the seller buyer or server are reusing a private key and therefore making them more susceptible to attacks it doesn benefit the scammer financial to pull a scam which removes most of the motive i agree is better but not if the market doesnt allow the buyer vendor to confirm the address as you are proposing i wouldnt touch a market that insists on hiding the details of the address from you its too open to abuse incompetence agreed re the redeem script but the market cant really withold the script if someone can generate it themselves from the original inputs i done think its a security issue if the buyer vendor can see the market is reusing the same keys this would be an excellent way of people being able to ascertain if the market is oded by an incompetent quote from jolly rover on february pmquote from ronin on february pm the market would rely on getting income through signing a transaction which sends most funds to vendor and commision to market this would then be signed by the buyer when he is happy if the buyer starts bypassing the market fee transaction then he is banned but to hide it all away from the user and not give them the ability to be able to verify addresses avoid this market set up its not healthy it is harder to verify you might think to see if the buyer and seller are closing the deal on the side unless the market is constantly searching through the blockchain for funds spent from that multisignature address it would be extremely difficult to verify that a buyer and seller are bypassing the market to cut out their fees i dont see the issue here what is difficult about this exactly anyone running the bitcond client is always getting every transaction the databse holding transactions could be checked for transactions once a week that are older than one month any such transaction which has the funds removed from the address would be flagged as having done a deal outside the market account banned i could probably write a bash script to do this fairly quickly am i missing something here what is the difficulty quote from jolly rover on february pmquote from ronin on february pmi would warn anyone away from the setup jolly roger is promoting will lead to more scams in the future and it will not allow you to verify mufti sig is set correctly so what you are rascally saying here is that the market should trust the buyers but the buyers should not trust the market the market has every incentive to keep the ability to unlock funds itself out of its own hands so that it is not a target for hackers if the market has the ability to unlock the funds without any buyer or seller input it would make the market very dangerous and this is not desirable and defeats the purpose of it for the markets but giving out the keys and the redeemscript to the buyer and seller gives them the ability to close the deal outside the market and bypass fees again if you are not able to trust your market then yes contact the seller and say you want to do a with your seller outside of the market and you can easily set one up but with fees at an average of bypassing the fees will become more common than you think and is harder to detect than you think especially when you are dealing with thousands of transactions ronin i understand what you are saying and you make a valid point that it would likely be desirable for a buyer to have this setup but it is not desirable for a market to have this setup since the market relies on market fees and by giving your customers the ability to cut you out of the deal is bad for business there are plenty of free and multisignature services out there now that you can use if you are not comfortable using the markets system then use another one that gives you
