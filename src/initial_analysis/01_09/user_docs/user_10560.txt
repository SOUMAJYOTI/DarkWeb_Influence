everyone thinks ubuntu is ideal for beginners i think most major distros these days are very nice to beginners and offer easy ways to setup a vpon connectioni just find ubuntu easier to use than other linus distributions it is probably due to the tablet like desktop that it has . quote from flashy on august ami really dont know why everyone thinks ubuntu is ideal for beginners i think most major

you are using tor and involved in nefarious activities you really should be using linus for beginner linux users i recommend ubuntu its what i use more experience people might use design or arch linux openvpn is great it provides a free encrusted internet access there are many tutorials on the internet on how to set it up however its pretty straight forward install whatever os on your computer by

linux is safe than windows mate . a vpn doesnt protect your computer from being hacked so choice of os is irrelevant for what vpn you use a more secure os like linux will protect you from being hacked compared to microsoft regardless of whether you access the internet from a vpon service or not a vpn will help keep the nsa and your isp from passively snooping on what sites you are visiting but if the government is actively trying to snoop your online activity a vpn wont protect you no matter what os you are running it on . quote from angel eyes on august ama vpn doesnt protect your computer

wont protect you no matter what os you are running it on while what you say is true about a network in which the only hardware is your single host pc if you run a multi hardware setup ie farewell monitoring vpn multi farewell monitoring tor middlebox windows linus obsd wtfyouwant choice of os could be very important and mixing it up might cause them additional time finding attacks day hopefully meaning if they attack your tor node having your vpn on another box means they cant break out of your network to find your location with out first breaking into your other hardware many people say openbsd is the most secure as a networking vpn device but that makes them a valuable target so perhaps it not wise to completely rely on them to elaborate you shouldnt really be trusting any of this stuff vpn tor i p windows linux etc dont get me started on hardware you should assume that everything is broke better yet dont even assume it make it something you know say it with me everything is broken da dweeb web mantra this way when designing your network you can make security considerations by placing your vpn and your tor on separate boxes so when one inevitably fucks you right up you have at least some fail safes having firewalls and monitoring hardware in between allows you to keep a close eye and make sure your software is connecting to the servers you choose or scrub any information that your software might be leaking nothing wrong with packet sniffing your own shit now and again i have to agree with angle eyes these interenets are a scarf place and if anyone wants you that has a budget larger then your local law enforcement they probably can find someone who knows how this stuff works better then you do good luck in the wild west . quote from
