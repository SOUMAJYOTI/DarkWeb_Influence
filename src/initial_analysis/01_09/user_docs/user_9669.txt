i have heard of using engine containing seeds as a starting point for lsd but this looks more like a simple extraction of ergine lsa a debatably psychedelic ergoline more of a mild dissociate ime and rascally worthless so in short no the following procedure from tihkal is more along the lines quote from bashan solution of g koh in ml h o under an inert atmosphere and magnetically stirred was brought to c and g ergotamine tartrate et added the reaction mixture turned yellow as the ergotamine went into solution over the course of h the stirring was continued for an additional h the reaction mixture was cooled to about c with an external ice bath and acidified to a ph of about by the dropwise addition of n h so white solids started to appear early in the neutralization approximate ml of sulfuric acid was required the reaction mixture was cooled overnight the solids removed by filtration and the filter cake washed with my et o the dry solids were transferred to a beaker suspended in ml ammonia in anhydrous ethanol stirred for h and separated by decantation this extraction was repeated and the original decantation and the second extract combined and faltered to remove a few hundred milligrams of unwonted solids the clear filtrate was stripped of solvent under vacuum the residue solids dissolved in ml of aqueous ammonia and this solution was acidified as before with n h so the precipitate solids were removed by filtration and washed with et o until free of color after drying under vacuum to a constant weight there was obtained g of d lysergic acid hydrate which should be stored in a dark sealed container a suspension of g d lysergic acid hydrate and g of diethylamine in ml chcl was brought to reflux with stirring with the external heating removed there was added g pocl over the course of min at a rate sufficient to maintain refusing conditions the mixture was held at reflux for an additional min at which point everything had gone into solution after returning to room temperature the solution was added to ml of n no oh the phases were separated the organic phase dried over anhydrous mgso faltered and the solvent removed under vacuum the residue

at masses of and this base was dissolved in warm dry meoh using my per g of product there was then added dry d barbaric acid g per g of led base and the clear warm solution treated with et o dropwise

oversight in the refrigerator ambient light should be severely restricted during these procedures the product was removed by filtration washed sparingly with cold methanol with a cold meoh et o

white light if this is anything but straightforward to you you are out of your depth . there is no lsd in either of those seeds which could be an issue please use the same thread for the same information makes discussion easier to follow . i know this question may be dumb but i dont know if this recipe i found is let and i know there are more experienced users here that might know more about the subject than me ingrediantszippo lighter fluid or naptha works best buy it at hechingers or home depot should be under the paint section dont worry you will not be consuming this at all make sure that you read the ingrediants there are different types and you do not want to use anything containing benzene if benzene is listed on there find something else vodka or rum use a clear liquor thats more than alcohol morning glory or hawaiian rosewood seeds at least seeds coffee filters small jarscoffee seed grinder dont need but helps try pawn shops thrift stores first a brief explanation of how this process works your zippo lighter fluid or naptha work as to separate certain chemicals out of the seeds the liquor you use will be what extracts the pure lsd grind the seeds into fine granules or powder put these aside set up a funnel with a coffee filter place ground seeds in the filter and place over a jar take about of cup of naptha or lighter fluid and pour it over the seeds let filter throw away the fluid that filtered through or save it for another time you make the recipe place the soaked seeds in a clean unsealed jar wait days at this point the reason why is because you want the lighter fluid or naptha to completely evaporate from the seeds check these daily compare the smell of the seeds to that of the fluid you use make sure you can not smell it on the seeds dont worry it evaporates quickly but days is a good safety buffer with a new filter put the seeds in it and place over a glass take your alcohol or better and pour about shot glasses full over the seeds and let filter into a glass take the faltered alcohol and pour it over the seeds again in otherwords do the same process except use the alcohol you already used do this about or times to ensure you get as much lsd out of it as you can if you want to save it for another time put it in a ridge otherwise take it like you would a shot of whiskey but hold it in your mouth and swish it around for about seconds drink the rest or spit it out if you prefer if its legit can the final outcome be used in blotted art thanks . there is no lsd in either of those seeds which could be an issue please use

close to that of lsd but you need a lot more of it for a trip if i were to extract lsa from morning glory seeds or macian baby woodrose seeds i would just use everclear ethan instead of poisonous solvents just about any organic solvent will work and if you use ethan you dont need to make damn good and sure you evaporated it all to not poison kill or bliind yourself lsa can be used to make lsd but unless you have some serious organic chemistry skills you will not be able to do it and might hurt yourself lsa is the one ingredient you need to make lsd that is scedule i but the amount of equipment you need is very expensive and requires experteise . it is a let way of extracting lsa which can be taken to produce an experience close to that of lsd but you need a lot more of it for a
