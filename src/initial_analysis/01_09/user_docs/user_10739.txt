usability among the general population is what holds bitcoin back from wider adoption as some digital currency enthusiasts have argued developers will have to focus more on making existing technologies useful to main street consumers drake continued we want to help solve the bitcoin purchasing problem by making it so anyone that wants to try and use bitcoin can just go to a nearly atm and get some with cash the best way to do that is to make bitcoin atms affordable so that anybody can get and use one it s a great way for people to get comfortable using bitcoin small and light the skyhook atm also makes it simple for bitin individual users and businesses of any scale to become an exchange quickly and affordably the atm is sufficiently portable drake said but also provides a durable security mounting plate to permanently attach the unit to something if the user prefers a fixed location and all with the same level of security it also gives merchants the option to generate
