from the address most wallets today do not give an easy interface for users to do that for example it can be done on bitcoind but on the command line and for a non expert would be difficult other wallets have bits and pieces of the necessary functionality but not in a nice bundled way there are python libraries that make it a breeze for developers but that doesnt help much if youre not a developer some services are offering web based escrow and web wallets e g greenaddress it using multisig but they are just using multisig internally to their architecture to give some defence against thefit which is not quite what you need when interacting with a dark net market so the marketplace itself would have to provide you with at least some hand holding by providing you with the payout transaction to sign and then giving you detailed instructions on how to sign it and send it back to them constituting your agreement to the payout thats the problem wallets should be doing that part for you you should be able to click a button sign authorize this transaction but the standard ones done yet darkwallet for example is in development and is apparently offering this feature take what i say with caution though as give only been somewhat involved in bitcoin related development recently and i dont actually know exactly what the various darknet markets are doing thats the main reason im here actually to find out edit in my further reading i found this quotemultisignature addresses are addresses controlled by more than one person they are created with a set of requirements that dictate how the funds in the address can be moved of signature addresses are joint controlled by people say the site operator the buyer and the seller but funds can only be moved if two people authorize and sign a transaction users will be expected to sign transactions for themselves while client s leave much to be desired regarding support for multisignature transactions i believe the best way to increase their adoption is to bring them into day to day life and watch the situation improve from there current the only modified client which supports signing multisignature transactions is bitin core otherwise users can use an office copy of to sign in their browser it sucks that bitcoin core is the only client that lets us do this i m very much looking forward to a light client that supports it out of the box at which more or less seems to confirm what i was saying . i am not able to log in either can anyone log in . its working for me . its working for me . i am not able to log
