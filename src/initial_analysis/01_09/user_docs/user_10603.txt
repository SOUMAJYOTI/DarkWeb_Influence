hot spots do you know in think that hooking something to your usb would be undesirable as opposed to using a hot spot for under dragnet surveillance id think there are limited places without cameras to use them and people tend to not be as random as they think they are wouldn this be easy to closely associate them to the device anyway it would be more likely to be used in some public space and i would assume that would be a bad idea but somewhat unavoidable multiply connections in different spots would be enough to identify that the hot spot is yours would it not could you or anyone else elaborate on the blasting of ssid to other devices and the use of guards and bridges any more information on anti forensics would be great i use tails and would like to know if there is anything extra i could do ill research blacklisting usbkill and under antiforensics but wouldnt using tools like this require root access in tails wouldnt that be a security risk enabling root access does anyone know something about blacklisting kernel modules in tails . how would the dongles be different than the hot spots do you know in think that hooking something to your usb would be undesirable as
