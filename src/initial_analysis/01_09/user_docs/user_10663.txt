impersonate a police officer a federal officer or employee or any other public shithead le type person you posted on here that youve tried and admitted you do various things you shouldnt drolly admit here because maybe they read that and be able to connect the person who made the attempts to sign in to their forums to your rl identity heck it could even be a honeypot just for that exact reason my impression is was this site isnt a honeypot rather its a gathering place for lea to swap information very much like an let version of the hub except with restricted access quote from fork on november pmjust be careful as luck le are crawling all over the darknet forums and reddit right now they always have been but now more than ever ever since we found out that sr was being run by le we have started to get a very real and clear picture that they are here and they are posting for the most part anyone with two working brain cells assumed that sites like silk road were crawling with lea once they discovered its existence the gawker article brought in lots of newbies to sr and doubtless some of them were let investigators quote from fork on november pmwe are never safe and no dnm community is as warm fluffy and welcoming as wed like to think forget what chemcat used to spout about us being a family and all that lovely stuff that sounds great in theory it just aint true now its never been true ever quote from fork on november pmburied amongst the sheep and hilariously funny lunatics in this family are a couple of very ravenous wolves in sheeps clothing or more accurately le in drugg clothing so be careful when you make posts like this on a whim that aside i think the best bet for gaining info on police tactics is read read read not on some special le forum forget that i second that quote from fork on november pmtheres a lot of posts on reddit and other forums on the clearnet made by people whove been busted for drugs and lived to tell the tale le have certain protocol and rules they have to follow so many cases and arrests go down in the famish way or in a similar way just search and read up and continually sharpen up your personal security read about local busts in your local paper to see how it went down you get the picture but avoid anyone who has been busted they could be looking to get a lighter sentence in return for co operating with le fuck reddit the best sources are court filings documents if you can get your hands on them luckily theyre more available now than they were years ago quote from fork on november obviously never sell to anyone you dont know it sounds obvious but many a drug dealer has been caught by an undercover with a pile of cash saying that theyre wanting to make a big buy ross ulbricht curtis green and the kilo of coke are a case in point greed will fuck you over every time quote from fork on november pmwatch documentaries about ll drug cases you can never know or learn too much the main thing to remember is if ever the worst happens and you are arrested done get looked and not think straight and freak out and start confessing everything they will lie and tell you they have incriminating things that they dont have in an attempt to get you to confess calmly ask for a lawyer and remain silent until you get that lawyer no matter how long it takes it can take as long as days i read the other day because you keeping silent and not talking to anyone keeps their defense options open defendants all too often condemn themselves out of their own mouths quote from fork on november pmthere are public defenders in america whose job is to protect and defend make use of one of these should you get caught unless you have a career and a way to prove you have a let income then use one of these public defenders after they read you your rights then ask for a lawyer and remain silent until the lawyer arrives if youre say a high flying broker with piles of money that you can prove you earned legally then keep a decent attorney on a retainer as an insurance policy against arrest and winning your liberty if youre a high flying broker you shouldnt be and dont need to be selling done thats just stupid quote from fork on november pmi think that remembering to keep silent upon arrest and good opsec would get you far further than trying to pose as le on a le forum in the same way they pose as drug users on drug forums i honestly doubt theyd say anything about tactics we dont know already likely so quote from fork on november pmwe all know that they come to the forums on the dnms and try to become or do become valued and respected community members theyll often be the ones dishing out security advice because theyre so wonderful and helpful they couldnt possibly be le right perhaps they be the one whos always there who always or often online making jokes peppered with bits of advice here and there just as rapists dont walk around in t shirts with i am a rapist on them and are charming until they get their claws into their victim undercover officers tend to do all that they can to appear let if you said bad security advice id agree with you snip quote from fork on november the fbi is actively recruiting people with degrees in all kind of computer deepweb pgp btc and crypto type specialists the deepweb is developing real fast and most of the time there catching people using old fashioned police work but in an ideal world they want to be several steps ahead of dnm operators and their dev teams they got ross from a security fail he made using his real email and they got blake through a security fail of hiring several undercover officers as mods and admins plus him using his real email to rent the sr servers well the jurys out they may well have straight up just used asa help if the nsa were ever involved i doubt that the courts will ever be informed about it much less us quote from fork on november pmbut whatever my point is read up as much as you can to protect your best asset your life and your freedom their biggest weapon is human stupidity exploiting peoples trusting natures and social engineering ding ding ding we have a winner quote from fork on november pmlook at how ross ulbricht was yapping away to an undercover agent in the sr irc chatroom at the time he was busted that helped them know he was logged on so they could get him with his laptop open also in the indictment an up asked casually in ira something like does your girlfriend know about you being dread and he replied no no way or something all these seemingly little slips can add up to proof that youre a certain person doing a certain thing when theyre building a case they rely on people maybe being high lonely and chatty that is one of the reasons that i dont use the computer when tired sick or intoxicated that is also why i dont use chat programs of any type one slip and youre screwed just like sabu of lulzsec fame quote from fork on november so keep your mouth shut and your eyes open and always trust your instincts dont ever write something off as paranoia better to be paranoid and free than locked up in a federal open all hours motel words to live by quote from fork on november pmforget this other idea and maybe edit out the details of what you tried to access and when in your original post or better yet maybe delete it give always been of the opinion that once something is posted thats it it wouldnt surprise me to learn that the feds were using bots to scrape sites like this to cache posts for further analysis in addition to having live personnel monitoring the site quote from fork on november pmi do like the idea of you compiling a antics sheet but your time would probably be better spent right now focusing on you and your situation cause no offence but it sounds to me like you need to brush up on your opsec and you might have been stoned when you thought up this idea without thinking it through properly with all the possible consequences

to connect the person who made the attempts to sign in to their forums to your rl identity heck it could even be a honeypot just for that exact reason just be careful as luck le are crawling all over the darknet forums and reddit right now they always have been but now more than ever ever since we found out that sr was being run by le we have started to get a very real and clear picture that they

forget that theres a lot of posts on reddit and other forums on the clearnet made by people whove been busted for drugs and lived to tell the tale le have certain protocol and rules they have to follow so many cases and arrests go down in the famish way or in a similar way just search and read up and continually sharpen up your personal security read about local busts in your local paper to see how it went down you get the picture but avoid anyone who has been busted they could be looking to get a lighter sentence in return for co operating with le obviously never sell to anyone you dont know it sounds obvious but many a drug dealer has been caught by an undercover with a pile of cash saying that theyre wanting to make a big buy watch documentaries about ll drug cases you can never know or learn too much the main thing to remember is if ever the worst happens and you are arrested done get looked and not think straight and freak out and start confessing everything they will lie and tell you they have incriminating things that they dont have in an attempt to get you to confess calmly ask for a lawyer and remain silent until you get that lawyer no matter how long it takes it can take as long as days i read the other day because you keeping silent and not talking to anyone keeps their defense options open there are public defenders in america whose job is to protect and defend make use of one of these should you get caught unless you have a career and a way to prove you have a let income then use one of these public defenders after they read you your rights then ask for a lawyer and remain silent until the lawyer arrives if youre say a high flying broker with piles of money that you can prove you earned legally then keep a decent attorney on a retainer as an insurance policy against arrest and winning your liberty i think that remembering to keep silent upon arrest and good opsec would get you far further than trying to pose as le on a le forum in the

then use one of these public defenders after they read you your rights then ask for a lawyer and remain silent until the lawyer arrives if youre say a high flying broker with piles of money that you can prove you earned legally then keep a decent attorney on a retainer as an insurance policy against arrest and winning your liberty if youre a high flying broker you shouldnt be and dont need to be selling done thats just stupid quote from fork on november pmi think that remembering to keep silent upon arrest and good opsec would get you far further than trying to pose as le on a le forum in the same way they pose as drug users on drug forums i honestly doubt theyd say anything about tactics we dont know already likely so quote from fork on november pmwe all know that they come to the forums on the dnms and try to become or do become valued and respected community members theyll often be the ones dishing out security advice because theyre so wonderful and helpful they couldnt possibly be le right perhaps they be the one whos always there who always or often online making jokes peppered with bits of advice here and there just as rapists dont walk around in t shirts with i am a rapist on them and are charming until they get their claws into their victim undercover officers tend to do all that they can to appear let if you said bad security advice id agree with you snip quote from fork on november the fbi is actively recruiting people with degrees in all kind of computer deepweb pgp btc and crypto type specialists the deepweb is developing real fast and most of the time there catching people using old fashioned police work but in an ideal world they want to be several steps ahead of dnm operators and their dev teams they got ross from a security fail he made using his real email and they got blake through a security fail of hiring several undercover officers as mods and admins plus him using his real email to rent the sr servers well the jurys out they may well have straight up just used asa help if the nsa were ever involved i doubt that the courts will ever be informed about it much less us quote from fork on november pmbut whatever my point is read up as much as you can to protect your best asset your life and your freedom their biggest weapon is human stupidity exploiting peoples trusting natures and social engineering ding ding ding we have a winner quote from fork on november pmlook at how ross ulbricht was yapping away to an undercover agent in the sr irc chatroom at the time he was busted that helped them know he was logged on so they could get him with his laptop open also in the indictment an up asked casually in ira something like does your girlfriend know about you being dread and he replied no no way or something all these seemingly little slips can add up to proof that youre a certain person doing a certain thing when theyre building a case they rely on people maybe being high lonely and chatty that is one of the reasons that i dont use the computer when tired sick or intoxicated that is also why i dont use chat programs of any type one slip and youre screwed just like sabu of lulzsec fame quote from fork on november so keep your mouth shut and your eyes open and always trust your instincts dont ever write something off as paranoia better to be paranoid and free than locked up in a federal open all hours motel words to live by quote from fork on november pmforget this other idea and maybe edit out the details of what you tried to access and when in your original post or better yet maybe delete it give always been of the opinion that once something is posted thats it it wouldnt surprise me to learn that the feds were using bots to scrape sites like this to cache posts for further analysis in addition to having live personnel monitoring the site quote from fork on november pmi do like the idea of you compiling a antics sheet but your time would probably be better spent right now focusing on you and your situation cause no offence but it sounds to me like you need to brush up on your opsec and you might have been stoned when you thought up this idea without thinking it through properly with all the possible consequences indeed quote from fork on november pmpeace out zaphod . quote from morphone on november anyone heard of the the forums xxxxxxxx redacted could they be using shifty opsec could there possibly be some low hanging fruit there for someone that knows there business made this post on a whim i do not expect someone to spend there day breaking into these forums for a complete stranger i was just hoping you guys could point me to someone reliable that i could pay to do this or someone idealistic enough to do this for free so that i may compile a guide of tactics hey bro whilst this sounds like a great idea in theory it could really backfire spectacularly as you know it is a crime to impersonate a police officer a federal officer or employee or any other public shithead le type person you posted on here that youve tried and admitted you do various things you shouldnt drolly admit here because maybe they read that and be able to connect the person who made the attempts to sign in to their forums to your rl identity heck it could even be a honeypot just for that exact reason just be careful as luck le are crawling all over the darknet forums and reddit right now they always have been but now more than ever ever since we found out that sr was being run by le we have started to get a very real and clear picture that they are here and they are posting we are never safe and no dnm community is as warm fluffy and welcoming as wed like to think forget what chemcat used to spout about us being a family and all that lovely stuff that sounds great in theory it just aint true now buried amongst the sheep and hilariously funny lunatics in this family are a couple of very ravenous wolves in sheeps clothing or more accurately le in drugg clothing so be careful when you make posts like this on a whim that aside i think the best bet for gaining info on police tactics is read read read not on some special le forum forget that theres a lot of posts on reddit and other forums on the clearnet made by people whove been busted for drugs and lived to tell the tale le have certain protocol and rules they have to follow so many cases and arrests go down in the famish way or in a similar way just search and read up and continually sharpen up your personal security read about local busts in your local paper to see how it went down you get the picture but avoid anyone who has been busted they could be looking to get a lighter sentence in return for co operating with le obviously never sell to anyone you dont know it sounds obvious but many a drug dealer has been caught by an undercover with a pile of cash saying that theyre wanting to make a big buy watch documentaries about ll drug cases you can never know or learn too much the main thing to remember is if ever the worst happens and you are arrested done get looked and not think straight and freak out and start confessing everything they will lie and tell you they have incriminating things that they dont have in an attempt to get you to confess calmly ask for a lawyer and remain silent until you get that lawyer no matter how long it takes it can take as long as days i read the other day because you keeping silent and not talking to anyone keeps their defense options open there are public defenders in america whose job is to protect and defend make use of one of these should you get caught unless you have a career and a way to prove you have a let income then use one of these public defenders after they read you your rights then ask for a lawyer and remain silent until the lawyer arrives if youre say a high flying broker with piles of money that you can prove you earned legally then keep a decent attorney on a retainer as an insurance policy against

victim undercover officers tend to do all that they can to appear let perhaps theyll even outright joke that there le cause they couldnt be if there joking about it right funnily enough they accidentally slip and refer to drug addicts in a sneering way from time to time they cant help it and they post no practical advice on drug use drug safety measures cause they dont know and they likely want us scumbag junkies all to od anyway once they busted us that is they wont post anecdotes about the time they get really sucked up on acid because of course they didnt ever and they realize their posts are being archive by their superiors theyll also have no real fear or paranoia cirrus was posting during all the sr forum mod busts as if he had no cares in the world because he didnt and was probably on cloud thinking about his soon to be promotion the fbi is actively recruiting people with degrees in all kind of computer deepweb pgp btc and crypto type specialists the deepweb is
