the links end in pdf and dont seem to work on the tor browser any ideas on how to view these i would rather not open and view them on my normal pc what do you reccomend thanks tree . to answer your question yes it is possible to view pdfs in tails and that should be the only place you will be accessing them as you know more on that later first it s important to understand that pdf files can be used maliciously or by an adversary with something called a phone home attack where when you open the file it communicates information back to whoever embedded the attack in the file possibly deanonymizing you and such antics so moving forward with that in mind you should only open the pdf file with your wired tireless connection turned off that way if you do have a malicious file it won t be able to phone home so for your own safety do not connect to the internet tor while viewing these files the safest way to do it would be to first put the files on a seperate us storage device preferable an encrusted one here s how you make one with tails reboot into tails non persistance mode again do not connect activate your wired tireless internet connection in tails go to applications office document viewer this is your pdf viewer use that to view your pdf files or right click on the file and choose open with and select document viewer it s best not to mix your pdf viewing sessions with your activities and sessions on tails so when your done viewing reboot tails that s the safest way to view a pdf file in tails as it was explained to me again the most important thing here is that you don t view pdf files while connected to the internet tor also the reason you are not able to view the pdf files through firefox torbrowser is because scripts javascript etc are disabled as they should be so just view them with the document viewer instead hope that helps . to answer your question yes it is possible to view pdfs in tails and that should be the only place you will be
