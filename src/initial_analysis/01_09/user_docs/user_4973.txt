scammers . hey just wanted to know what everybody is using as operating system to conduct bm business and what opinions on security risks you have i for one use gnu linux ubuntu i was surprised to see so many pgp keys being generated on windows machines you think its save with no one knowing what microsoft actually put in their code and what about macs or should we all just be using tails . yes so true but at the same time i think we gain more by the beauty that comes to us through that fog of anonymity than we lose to those lurking in its shadows . hmm youre probably right nothing within the scope of personal use should normally be interesting enough for le to care about plus you even make yourself suspicious in their eyes by increasing your security efforts etc but then again i hate the thought of making it easy for them if there gon na spy on us at least they should be working their asses off . yes so true but at the same time i think we gain more by the beauty that comes to us through that fog of anonymity than we lose to those lurking in its shadows . sorry to hear that its frustrating that we really cant catch these scammers . yes so true but at the same time i think we

tails is best as far as entry level darknet computing goes a nice package with everything you need for dark net dealings except for bitmessage grrrrr wrapped up in it i really think most people ordering only personal amounts have little to nothing to worry about on the computer security side of things as far as we know the nsa can only unmask a small portion of tor traffic and can not target specific people to unmask besides whens the last time you heard about an investigation into a drug user maybe if someone call in a tip to an overlay bored and vengeful police department in a small town but most police departments just have bigger crimes that take up all of their time oh and cant forget time for writing traffic ticket weather youre on talis or not though if you ever looked up info about cybersecurity tor tails darknet anything and the like from a computer that can be linked to you youre probably on a permanent watchlist shrugs shoulders whaddyagonnado check out this article for more info on tor it will scare you and comfort you all at the same time . im using your mom as an os she gives me a blowjob every time i hit the enter key xdjust kidding truthfully i have a tails liveusb that i use on a laptop that current has lubuntu loaded on as for my pc i use ubuntu and windows only due to my gaming habits but i dont get on the darknet much on my pc i mainly only go into the chatrooms on it the laptop is where i do my business aspect of it all . its funny when you say they youre really only talking about the asa dea most other agencies actually love tor and all its users as it makes their secret communication harder to unmask the more noise in the network the easier it is for them to hide maybe love isnt the right word here need maybe appreciate either way more security is always better especially once you registered on their list as a privacy conscious person best to keep up your security as to not allow them to see even if they are watching . operating systems can and should be openly discussed but openly admiting to using one is a violation of open keep your private information private end users tend to use windows with torbrowervendors and other big fish tend to use tails becuase its a neat package of almost everything needed for the darknet but please note that the previous version to tails has security leaks that have since been patched only download tails iso through tor for the asa attempts to track every download of that os for obvious reasons a lungs distro with a hardened kernel gentoo is more work but being in a completely different pond from one their attempting to fish at has its advantages tor bridges also have their uses all opsec disecions should be throughly researches before being made dont tell me this darknet aint got no hetty info you just got to poke around . i mainly use os x with tor directly installed as a service started as the user at log in i then have different browsers for where i need to go the one i use for dark net dealings use i have what i call dark fox where i am not completely safe but am able to run simple javascripts without compromising security not easy to do but its all there my main reason for using os x is that its the only fully posix compliant unix out there after going through and unlocking all the things they lock to keep stupid people from hurting the os you will find yourself in better control over the entire os just like any other version of linux i also like how pip integrates into the operating system and allows for easy import signature decryption and encryption without the need to open a separate app then i have a regular version of firefox for clearnet use and i have installed chromium not from the one from google for a recommendation to others i would have to say using whonix is a good way to start you dont need to change the os or boot to a different flash live usb just download virtualbox and the different images they have ready for you to use in any os if the settings are the same as the walk through i made to isolate a virtual os behind tor you should be able to use full java flash and anything that doesnt require up to work without risk of exposure . for readie begin pip message version lsd pip v hqima riaq duraq ws b bqvxn sixxh gqir o dezk irsrgkitrkwzdq sqa zinx k pt rkftiftbj frxazc gqyyfwviga

how end pgp message thanks for that into dont put too much thought into what pgp os other people are using as long as the pgp version string says something nothing no either the msg key will still work afaik . i like you dfc good info there . done fool yourselves into thinking that by using tails and washing bitcoins and masking online status and using different passwords that you wont get caught i have had personal experience where a vendor sent me xanax pills in the mail without any stealth just threw a bunch of pills in an envelope and sent them and since then all my mail was being checked without my knowledge except first class mail i believe either way when my order for tabs of lsd was ordered thats when the authorities arrested me and guess what they have everything that was done click by click order by order all my passwords all my orders and history of things i bought i went to jail for this and was let out early for good behavior but as someone once told me dont do the crime if you cant do the time pink flood sheep . they have everything that was done click by click order by order all my passwords all my orders and history of things i bought i went to jail for this and was let out early for good behavior dude this is bombshell ship right here please expand on this more if youre willing or just pm me if youd rather keep this private how in the world would they be able to get your passwords unless they installed a keylogger or something . looks like it time to make sure that you layer up as a normal tor connection may not be enough get a vpn running linux on any anonymous provider that accepts bitcoins it doesnt have to have huge resources all it needs to be able to do is handle ash server and i have seen my vs systems run a tunnel without problems after you get your vps login information all you need to do is set up your client computer to push all traffic through your vps this was a huge pain in the ass before finding shuttle pulling it from git all you need to do is cd to the directory and run suds shuttle dns vvr surname ipofvps enter the password for the vps and its running you can open firefox and go to ipchicken com to check if its working now you can run tor without your isp snooping you can either run tor browser or make another layer of protection by using whonix or making a tor middlebox configuration safe and remember if they want you they will come and take you . is there any market place online right now give tried a few and had no luck with any of them whats going on id be glad for some input cheers freddie . is there any

passwords all my orders and history of things i bought i went to jail for this and was let out early for good behavior dude this is bombshell ship right here please expand on this more if youre willing or just pm me if youd rather keep this private how in the world would they be able to get your passwords unless they installed a keylogger or something first i would like to apologize in replying so late i didnt expect someone to reply or ask something further after i posted on top of that after what happened previously i now use a foolproof method and theres no way in hell i can be tracked i had considered myself one of the smart ones using tails running off encrusted us drive clearing my order history with the sites washing bitcoins before using them etc the worst part about it was the vendor i ordered from was a sweetheart and i should have used the option of paying for product before ship but since we are all trusted members i didnt use that option and would have paid upon delivery bad move not only did i get arrested and wasnt able to pay the vendor many of my friends on here collaborated however and did pay the vendor which i am grateful jor those peoples who did i wont say who for open reasons but i also lost my job and missed the birth of my first child i was fired from my job and my license for that field was taken away as well so i could never again get a job in that position and it was a nice and cushi job which paid amazingly well they didnt exactly give me a file and say hey heres how we did it motherfucka but from what they were willing to show me i believe they used the data flowing through tor to track what i was doing it seemed highly likely that a keylogger may have been involved because the information was just luck like of how did you guys get all this on top of that the tails us os didnt even save so it was a fresh tails everytime it was rooted so nothing was taken from catched info the whole ordeal ruined my career put a huge strain on my marriage and most of all my reputation on dn and with my coworkers and friends now i use a fooproof method which will make your head spin only downside is i can only login when certain auspicious events align and sometimes it can be months before i am able to login if you wan a know what i do now you can pm me and through encrusted msgs i can share what i do but again be patient it may take a wihle for me to be able to login again done email me on my pgp key address as its bogus in the end i brought this upon myself i chose to buy drugs legally and after the idiot vendor just threw xanax in an envelope i was already bleeding in a pool of shark infested water i did the crime and i did the time and more to all those who were affected by my disappearance i apologize and for my friends here who covered my cost of the sheet i am forever grateful as always i did will and do always love this community of my fellow trippers and rainbowland enthusiasts much love and good vibes
