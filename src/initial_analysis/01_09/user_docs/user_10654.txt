allege wasnt configured why didnt anyone else see this on sr assuming your the same you will know a number of people on sr who were teach say and always were checking on security vulnerabilities this does not add up any thoughts . rather than a conspiracy involving asa wiretaps the fbi claims the downfall of silk road begun with a leaky captcha responding to a request for information from former kingpin ross ulbrichts defence lawyers the feds says the captcha left a trail from the tor protected silk road servers to the public internet that revealed the location of the drug marketplace which would otherwise have remained hidden behind tor according to an abi affidavit fti consulting security man christopher tarbell revealed that in june last year during his tenure with the us federal police agency he found the captcha had leaned header information that revealed the in address of the website in order for the in address of a computer to be fully hidden on tor however the applications running on the computer must be properly configured for that purpose otherwise the computer s in address may leak through the traffic sent from the computer tarbell said in the document pdf the ip address leak we discovered came from the silk road user login interface upon examining the individual packets of data being sent back from the website we noticed that the headers of some of the packets reflected a certain ip address not associated with any known tor node as the source of the packets when i typed the subject ip address into an ordinary web browser a part of the silk road login screen the captcha prompt appeared which indicated that the subject ip address was the in address of the silk road server and that it was leaking because the computer code underlying the login interface was not properly configured at the time to work on tor the captcha was the only source of non tor packets but ulbricht had struggled with the complexities of online anonymity tarbell claimed the ex fbi man said ulbrichts computer revealed he doused in leaking spot fires that saw the website subject to distributed denial of service attacks ddos and migrated to new servers but security bod nicholas cubrilovic who spent significant time probing silk road doubted the bust was as simple as a worked captcha on the grounds that the anti spam generator was hasted on the silk road server and alleged the affidavit omitted information regarding more direct application exploitation and fuzzing anybody with knowledge of tor and hidden services would not be able to read that description and have a complete understanding of the process that the agents followed to do what they claim to have done cubrilovic said were the silk road site still live today and in the same state it was as in back in june when the agents probed the server you wouldnt be able to reproduce or recreate what the agents describe in the affidavit the captcha theory does not stand up to scrutiny because the silk road image captcha was hasted on the same server and at the same hidden url as the silk road website the idea that the captcha was being served from a live ip is unreasonable were this the case it would have been noticed not only by me but the many other people who were also scrutinizing the silk road jebusite silk road was one of the most scrutinized sites on the web for white hats because it was an interesting challenge and for black hats since it hosted so many bitcoin with little legal implication if you managed to steal them moreover an eternally hasted image would still be routed over tor and any packet sniffer would be unable to detect the silk roads in address cubrilovic claimed it was more likely the fbi found and exploited a security vulnerability or discovered an information leak in the silk road login page and application those vulnerabilities which revealed the public ip address including a var dump likely from inexperienced live debugging were made public on stack exchange cubrilovic suggested the fbi may have taken advantage of these errors to locate silk road this would explain why the fbi included the statement about typing in miscellaneous entries into the surname password and captcha fields because they needed to enter an exploit command to prompt the server to either dump or produce the ip address variable in this scenario the description of packet sniffers and inspecting each packet is all a distraction from what the fbi really did technically saying that a packet sniffer revealed the true ip address of the server is true what isnt mentioned is the packet sniffer was picking up responses from a request to the login page that was forcing it to spit out the ip address as part of a bug he thanked security bods the the grugq and harisec for

assuming your the same you will know a number of people on sr who were teach say and always were checking on security vulnerabilities this does not add up any thoughts . speculating on the fbi s silk road unmasking techniquefrom the declaration of abi agent christopher tarbell the method that the fbi used to obtain the silk road server s ipv address and by extension the full nature of sr s mistakes is entirely unclean this is important because i think that when the fbi uses exploitation techniques that would otherwise be illegal if it were not being done by them they do a very poor job of describing it accurately in their declarations and affidavits by the time it s read by a judge the process is amplified to the point that it s unrecognizable due to this lack of clarity on twitter i ve now heard what happened variously described in the following different ways all of which are vastly different from a technical standpoint view sourcepacket sniffingsql injectiondatabase errorphpinfo god status var dump or server add leakmisconfigured third party captcha servicei think that if it were really as easy as the agent makes it sound it would have been found and pointed out a lot sooner by someone other than the fbi it s almost inconceivable to me that someone in the community wouldn t have alerted sr to the same elementary vulnerability unless it were a temporary one so something is definitely amiss or the fbi could be lying they re known to do that on occasion now here s how it s described in the declaration we simply were interacting with the jebusite s user login interface which was fully accessible to the public by typing in miscellaneous entries into the surname password and captcha fields contained in the interface when we did so the website sent back data to the computer we were using specifically the silk road homepage when we used valid login credentials for undercover accounts we had on the site or an error message when we used any surname password or captcha entry that was invalid upon examining the individual packets of data being sent back from the website we noticed that the headers of some of the packets reflected a certain ip address not associated with any known tor node as the source of the packets this ip address the subject ip address was the only non tor source ip address reflected in the traffic we examined there s a very important footnote which seems to suggest packet analysis like one would do with tcpdump or wireshark all communications on the internet are broken up into packets when they are transmitted from one computer to another the packets are reassembled when they reach the destination computer each packet contains among other things header information analogous to the outside of a mailing envelope which

feds says the captcha left a trail from the tor protected silk road servers to the public internet that revealed the location of the drug marketplace which would otherwise have remained hidden behind tor according to an abi affidavit fti consulting security man christopher tarbell revealed that in june last year during his tenure with the us federal police agency he found the captcha had leaned header information that revealed the in address of the website in order for the in address of a computer to be fully hidden on tor however the applications running on the computer must be properly configured for that purpose otherwise the computer s in address may leak through the traffic sent from the computer tarbell said in the document pdf the ip address leak we discovered came from the silk road user login interface upon examining the individual packets of data being sent back from the website we noticed that the headers of some of the packets reflected a certain ip address not associated with any known tor node as the source of the packets when i typed the subject ip address into an ordinary web browser a part of the silk road login screen the captcha prompt appeared which indicated that the subject ip address was the in address of the silk road server and that it was leaking because the computer code underlying the login interface was not properly configured at the time to work on tor the captcha was the only source of non tor packets but ulbricht had struggled with the complexities of online anonymity tarbell claimed the ex fbi man said ulbrichts computer revealed he doused in leaking spot fires that saw the website subject to distributed denial of service attacks ddos and migrated to new servers but security bod nicholas cubrilovic who spent significant time probing silk road doubted the bust was as simple as a worked captcha on the grounds that the anti spam generator was hasted on the silk road server and alleged the affidavit omitted information regarding more direct application exploitation and fuzzing anybody with knowledge of tor and hidden services would not be able to read that description and have a complete understanding of the process that the agents followed to do what they claim to have done cubrilovic said were the silk road site still live today and in the same state it was as in back in june when the agents probed the server you wouldnt be able to reproduce or recreate what the agents describe in the affidavit the captcha theory does not stand up to scrutiny because the silk road image captcha was hasted on the same server and at the same hidden url as the silk road website the idea that the captcha was being served from a live ip is unreasonable were this the case it would have been noticed not only by me but the many other people who were also scrutinizing the silk road jebusite silk road was one of the most scrutinized sites on the web for white hats because it was an interesting challenge and for black hats since it hosted so many bitcoin with little legal implication if you managed to steal them moreover an eternally hasted image would still be routed over tor and any packet sniffer would be unable to detect the silk roads in address cubrilovic claimed it was more likely the fbi found and exploited a security vulnerability or discovered an information leak in the silk road login page and application those vulnerabilities which revealed the public ip address including a var dump likely from inexperienced live debugging were made public on stack exchange cubrilovic suggested the fbi may have taken advantage of these errors to locate silk road this would explain why the fbi included the statement about typing in miscellaneous entries into the surname password and captcha fields
