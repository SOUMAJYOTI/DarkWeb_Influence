and the black hat conference i have said it here before but the former head of nsa was at the conference and gave the keynote and the q a he was asked about hacking pcs and he laughed and said we dont need to hack pcs we hack routers this was three years ago since then it has been proved there are physical asa backdoors installed on many routers from the factory i have even seen cheap chinese clothes irons with a hidden pcb and wifi its only purpose is to bruteforce passwords of any nearly device and phish there are keyboards shipping with keyloggers built in mobile anonymity is a complete oxymoron and we might lose all privacy if no checks and balances are placed on our runaway governments and the progressing intrusions into privacy we already know and accept that android and ios are heavily backdoored no one bats an eye there is controversy with system d and tor adopting it there is controversy that the the nsa invented tor itself and is even exploiting the blockchain ill leave you with this fuzzy quote the united states government can t simply run an anonymity system for everybody and then use it themselves only because then every time a connection came from it people would say oh it s another cia agent if those are the only people using the network roger dingledine co founder of the tor network . hello everyone i would like your input on whether i should use tor on my mobile phone which apps are the best for most secure browsing of the dw if i decide to and how much risk does it pose i plan to use it only for going on forums dew flashlight and tor news sites like those two and have no other option but my mobile phone since i wont be in reach of anything else other then my phone for months apologies if in creating yet another thread about this if so feel free

a connection to my current situation with your observations like i wrote i would only access news sites and forums nothing illegal no markets nothing at all that could in any way get me in trouble but

to be occasionally browsing some news sites and forums for a period of just months then im sure that youll be fine just make sure that you dont login to any dark net accounts on your phone over the next weeks and only browse the use of any mobile device to conduct business on any dnm is strongly discouraged and frowned upon by the majority of people in the community its easy to see why when you

used to what you have covering the face in your avatar was when a pedophile wanted world wide kept posting photos of himself and others bastards like him engaging in perverted disgusting sexual encounters with children online and had used some software program the name escapes me at the moment to generate and add these computer generated spirals over any faces in each photo something similar to what some people may use to hypnotize others by watching it go around and around le ended up reverse engineering this software which took quite some time from memory so it would reverse the spirals covering their faces and expose the bastards faces for the world to finally see from memory this prick and his perverted mates were living in thailand and teasing le by covering their faces with computer generated spirals and posting the photos online anyway they finally caught the prick and his co horts who are now all rotting away in prison exactly where they should be .
