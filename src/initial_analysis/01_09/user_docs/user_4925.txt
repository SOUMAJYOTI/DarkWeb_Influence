think i can get a po box here without id do lots of people order small quants to home addy think that would make me paranoid . some people say that small domestic order are fine in your own address if you can keep a clean house a few days before and a few days after and if its not too often abandoned building might look weird if there hasnt been letters there for a while you might want to test it first and why not register for some crap using that name and address consider switching drop point after a few successful drops the mailbox of a family out for holidays can be nice but your package has to come before they come back from holidays and you have to be able to check their mailbox without neighbors seeing you thats a complicated matter . do not send orders anywhere that is associated with you . thanks greenbuddy and lighty these are good points done think i can get a po box here without id do lots of people order small quants to home addy think that would make me paranoid . do not
