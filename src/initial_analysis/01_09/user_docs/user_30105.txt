hi just to say we have had withdraws for the last days and everyone has came through they where only for we only have coins in escrow not saying every things perfect because everyone can see its not but things are working for us regards fred . hi sorry boss nothing is perfect we try to hear ya regards fred . been having some coins in escrow for weeks messaged support a dozen times at first they gave me a auto message the same day saying disputes could take up to weeks and so i waited for that time now i havent gotten any replies for about weeks and i also offered to donate a sum of the escrow funds to speed things up or so i hoped it would my guess or conspiration theory is that vendors might keep disputed coins in escrow without releasing formaybe a couple of months now gathering up resources for a major exit scam as i been reading several other frustrated customers aint getting any response from support and also some claims that fake vendor account are being made might just be for this purpose its a kind of hidden way for a long term scam by the admins which if i am right is well on its way and on a close coming end of the market please be aware everyone and done take any chances on bad vibe vendors and keep it safe with those you only trust i will keep checking in regular to see if i might gotten my coins released but i am loosing hope for my own and fear we might all have lost our screwed funds take care all and be aware . think its time to take this market link down put up an official warning or something at least . quote from arcane on may amive seen so many

his own and changing it then back give reported that pgp key other market admins in future its impossible for fe enabled vendors to change their pgp keys so this cant happen again just stinks of pure

admin might not be able to scam using the funds kept in escrow however some of the vendors not all of them of course would have a field day with every buyer fe trust doesnt exist on the darknet and youd be foolish to trust any vendor regardless of their reputation its all been seen or done before believe me this is nothing personal against any vendor and im sure some vendors are very trustworthy people and would never think of scamming their customers however in this environment where anonymity is the name of the game you simply cant afford to trust anyone unless you have loads cash to burn always use escrow and only fe if you can afford to lose those coins and wont start complaining should something go wrong we need to start focusing on decentralized markets who offer true multi sig transactions for their customers instead of using your standard centralized market using a centralized escrow system progress is really really slow however the transition to all multi sig transactions will eventually happen and become the new standard for all modern day dnms probably after a few more exit scams take place .
