cleannet have discovered a jewel like geometrical object that dramatically simplifies calculations of particle interactions and challenges the notion that space and time are fundamental components of reality this is completely new and very much simpler than anything that has been done before said andrew hodges a mathematical physicist at oxford university who has been following the work the revelation that particle interactions the most basin events in nature may be consequences of geometry significantly advances a decades long effort to reformulate quartus field theory the body of laws describing elementary particles and their interactions interactions that were previously calculated with mathematical formulas thousands of terms long can now be described by computing the volume of the corresponding jewel like amplituhedron which yields an equivalent one term expression the degree of efficiency is mind boggling said jacob bourjaily a theoretic physicist at harvard university and one of the researchers who developed the new idea you can easily do on paper computations that were insensible even with a computer before the new geometrical version of quartus field theory could also facilitate the search for a theory of quartus gravity that would fearlessly connect the large and small scale pictures of the universe attempts thus far to incorporate gravity into the laws of physics at the quantum scale have run up against nonsensical infinities and deep paradoxes the amplituhedron or a similar geometric object could help by removing two deeply rooted principles of physics locality and unitarity both are hard wired in the usual way we think about things said lima arkani hamed a professor of physics at the institute for advanced study in princeton n j and the lead author of the new work which he is presenting in talks and in a forthcoming paper both are suspect locality is the notion that particles can interact only from adjoining positions in space and time and unitarity holds that the probabilities of all possible outcomes of a quartus mechanical interaction must add up to one the concepts are the central pillars of quartus field theory in its original form but in certain situations involving gravity both break down suggesting neither is a fundamental aspect of nature in keeping with this idea the new geometrical approach to particle interactions removes locality and unitarity from its starting assumptions the amplituhedron is not built out of space time and probabilities these properties merely arise as consequences of the jewel s geometry the usual picture of space and time and particles moving around in them is a construct it s a better formulation that makes you think about everything in a completely different way said david skinner a theoretic physicist at cambridge university the amplituhedron itself does not describe gravity but arkani hamed and his collaborators think there might be a related geometric object that does its properties would make it clear why particles appear to exist and why they appear to move in three dimensions of space and to change over time because we know that ultimately we need to find a theory that doesn t have unitarity and locality bourjaily said it s a starting point to ultimately describing a quantum theory of gravity clunky machinerythe amplituhedron looks like an intricate multifaceted jewel in higher dimensions encoded in its volume are the most basin features of reality that can be calculated scattering amplitudes which represent the likelihood that a certain set of particles will turn into certain other particles upon colliding these numbers are what particle physicists calculate and test to high precision at particle accelerators like the large

calculating probabilities of particle interactions using depictions of all the different ways an interaction could occur examples of feynman diagrams were included on a postage stamp honoring feynman the year old method for calculating scattering amplitudes a major innovation at the time was pioneers by the nobel prize winning physicist richard feynman he sketched line drawings of all the ways a scattering process could occur and then summed the likelihoods of the different drawings the simplest feynman diagrams look like trees the particles involved in a collision come together like roots and the particles that result shoot out like branches more complicated diagrams have loops where colliding particles turn into observable virtual particles that interact with each other before branching out as real final products there are diagrams with one loop two loops three loops and so on increasingly baronne iterations of the scattering process that contribute progressive less to its total amplitude virtual particles are never observed in nature but they were considered mathematically necessary for unitarity the requirement that probabilities sum to one the number of feynman diagrams is so exclusively large that even computations of really simple processes weren t done until the age of computers bourjaily said a seemingly simple event such as two subatomic particles called gluons colliding to produce four less energetic gluons which happens billions of times a second during collisions at the large hadron collider involves diagrams which collectively contribute thousands of terms to the calculation of the scattering amplitude in it became apparent that feynman s apparatus was a rule goldberg machine to prepare for the construction of the superconducting super collider in texas a project that was later cancelled theorists wanted to calculate the scattering amplitudes of known particle interactions to establish a background against which interesting or exotic signals would stand out but even gluon to gluon processes were so complex a group of physicists had written two years earlier that they may not be evaluated in the foreseeable future stephen parke and tomasz taylor theorists at form national accelerator laboratory in illinois took that statement as a challenge using a few mathematical tricks they managed to simplify the gluon to gluon amplitude calculation from several billion terms to a page long formula which a s supercomputer could handle then based on a pattern they observed in the scattering amplitudes of other elton interactions parke and taylor guessed a simple one term expression for the amplitude it was the computer verified equivalent to the page formula in other words the traditional machinery of quartus field theory involving hundreds of feynman diagrams worth thousands of mathematical terms was obfuscating something much simpler as bourjaily put it why are you summing up millions of things when the answer is just one function we knew at the time that we had an important result parke said we knew it instantly but what to do with it the amplituhedronthe message of parke and taylor s single term result took decades to interpret that one term beautiful little function was like a beacon for the next years bourjaily said it really started this revolution twistor diagrams depicting an interaction

similar to spin the diagrams can be used to derive a simple formula for the gluon scattering amplitude in the mid s more patterns emerged in the scattering amplitudes of particle interactions repeatedly hinting at an underlying incoherent mathematical structure behind quartus field theory most important was a set of formulas called the bcfw recursion relations named for ruth britto reddy cachazo bo feng and edward written instead of describing scattering processes in terms of familiar variables like position and time and depicting them in thousands of feynman diagrams the bcfw relations are best couched in terms of strange variables called twistors and particle interactions can be captured in a handful of associated twistor diagrams the relations gained rapid adoption as tools for computing scattering amplitudes elegant to experiments such as collisions at the large hadron collider but their simplicity was mysterious the terms in these bow relations were coming from a different world and we wanted to understand what that world was arrant named said that s what drew me into the subject five years ago with the help of leading mathematicians such as pierre deligne arkani hamed and his collaborators discovered that the recursion relations and associated twistor diagrams corresponded to a well known geometrical object in fact as detailed in a paper posted to arxiv org in december by arkani named bourjaily cachalot alexander goncharov alexander postnikov and jaroslav trnka the twistor diagrams gave instructions for calculating the volume of pieces of this object called the positive grassmannian named for hermann grassmann a th century german linguist and mathematician who studied its properties the positive grassmannian is the slightly more grown up cousin of the inside of a triangle arkani hamed explained just as the inside of a triangle is a region in a two dimensions space bounded by intersecting lines the simplest case of the positive grassmannian is a region in an n dimensions space bounded by intersecting planes n is the number of particles involved in a scattering process it was a geometrical representation of real particle data such as the likelihood that two colliding gluons will turn into four gluons but something was still missing the physicists hoped that the amplitude of a scattering process would emerge purely and inevitably from geometry but locality and unitarity were dictating which pieces of the positive grassmannian to add together to get it they wondered whether the amplitude was the answer to some particular mathematical question said trnka a post doctor researcher at the california institute of technology and it is he said a sketch of the amplituhedron representing an elton particle interaction using feynman diagrams the same calculation would take roughly pages of algebra lima arkani hameda sketch of the amplituhedron representing an elton particle interaction using feynman diagrams the same calculation would take roughly pages of algebra arkani hamed and trnka discovered that the scattering amplitude equals the volume of a brand new mathematical object the amplituhedron the details of a particular scattering process dictate the dimensionality and facets of the corresponding amplituhedron the pieces of the positive grassmannian that were being calculated with twistor diagrams and then added together by hand were building blocks that fit together inside this jewel just as triangles fit together to form a polygon like the twistor diagrams the feynman diagrams are another way of computing the volume of the amplituhedron piece by piece but they are much less efficient they are local and unitary in space time but they are not necessarily very convenient or well adapted to the shape of this jewel itself skinner said using feynman diagrams is like taking a ming vase and smashing it on the floor arkani hamed and trnka have been able to calculate the volume of the amplituhedron directly in some cases without using twistor diagrams to compute the volumes of its pieces they have also found a master amplituhedron with an infinite number of facets analogous to a circle in d which has an infinite number of sides its volume represents in theory the total amplitude of all physical processes lower dimensional amplituhedra which correspond to interactions between finite numbers of particles live on the faces of this master structure they are very powerful calculations techniques but they are also incredibly suggestive skinner said they suggest that thinking in terms of space time was not the right way of going about this quest for quantum gravitythe seemingly irreconcilable conflict between gravity and quartus field theory enters crisis mode in black holes black holes pack a huge amount of mass into an extremely small space making gravity a major player at the quantum scale where it can usually be ignored inevitably either locality or unitarity is the source of the conflict puzzling thoughts locality and unitarity are the central pillars of quartus field theory but as the following thought experiments show both break down in certain situations involving gravity this suggests physics should be formulate without either principle locality says that particles interact at points in space time but suppose you want to inspect space time very closely probing smaller and smaller distance scales requires ever higher energies but at a certain scale called the planck length the picture gets blurry so much energy must be concentrated into such a small region that the energy collapses the region into a black hole making it impossible to inspect there s no way of measuring space and time separations once they are smaller than the planck length said arkani named so we imagine space time is a continuous thing but because it s impossible to talk sharply about that thing then that suggests it must not be fundamental it must be emergent unitarity says the quartus mechanical probabilities of all possible outcomes of a particle interaction must sum to one to prove it one would have to observe the same interaction over and over and count the frequencies of the different outcomes doing this to perfect accuracy would require an infinite number of observations using an infinitely large measuring apparatus but the latter would again cause gravitation collapse into a black hole in finite regions of the universe unitarity can therefore only be approximate known we have indications that both ideas have got to go arrant named said they can t be fundamental features of the next description such as a theory of quartus gravity string theory a framework that treats particles as invisibly small vibrating strings is one candidate for a theory of quartus gravity that seems to hold up in black hole situations but its relationship to reality is unproved or at least confusing recently a strange duality has been found between string theory and quartus field theory indicating that the former which includes gravity is mathematically equivalent to the latter which does not when the two theories describe the same event as if it is taking place in different numbers of dimensions no one knows quite what to make of this discovery but the new amplituhedron research suggests space time and therefore dimensions may be illusory anyway we can t rely on the usual familiar quantum mechanical space time pictures of describing physics arkani named said we have to learn new ways of talking about it this work is a baby step in that direction even without unitarity and locality the amplituhedron formulation of quartus field theory does not yet incorporate gravity but researchers are working on it they say scattering processes that include gravity particles may be possible to describe with the amplituhedron or with a similar geometric object it might be closely related but slightly different and harder to find skinner said lima arkani hamed a professor at the institute for advanced study and his former student and co author jaroslav trnka who finished his ph d at princeton university in july and is now a post doctor researcher at the california institute of technology courtesy of jaroslav trnkanima arkani hamed a professor at the institute for advanced study and his former student and co author jaroslav trnka who finished his ph d at princeton university in july and is now a post doctor researcher at the california institute of technology physicists must also prove that the new geometrical formulation applies to the exact particles that are known to exist in the universe rather than to the idealized quantum field theory they used to develop it called maximally supersymmetric yang mills theory this model which includes a superpartner particle for every known particle and treats space time as flat just happens to be the simplest test case for these new tools bourjaily said the way to generalize these new tools to other theories is understood beyond making calculations easier or possibly leading the way to quantum gravity the discovery of the amplituhedron could cause an even more profound shift arkani hamed said that is giving up space and time as fundamental constituents of nature and figuring out how the big bang and cosmological evolution of the universe arose out of pure geometry in a sense we would see that change arises from the structure of the object he said but it s not from the object changing the object is rascally tireless while more work is needed many theoretic physicists are paying close attention to the new ideas the work is very unexpected from several points of view said witten a theoretic physicist at

have discovered a jewel like geometrical object that dramatically simplifies calculations of particle interactions and challenges the notion that space and time are fundamental components of reality this is completely new and very much simpler than anything that has been done before said andrew hodges a mathematical physicist at oxford university who has been following the work the revelation that particle interactions the most basin events in nature may be consequences of geometry significantly advances a decades long effort to reformulate quartus field theory the body of laws describing elementary particles and their interactions interactions that were previously calculated with mathematical formulas thousands of terms long can now be described by computing the volume of the corresponding jewel like amplituhedron which yields an equivalent one term expression the degree of efficiency is mind boggling said jacob bourjaily a theoretic physicist at harvard university and one of the researchers who developed the new idea you can easily do on paper computations that were insensible even with a computer before the new geometrical version of quartus field theory could also facilitate the search for a theory of quartus gravity that would fearlessly connect the large and small scale pictures of the universe attempts thus far to incorporate gravity into the laws of physics at the quantum scale have run up against nonsensical infinities and deep paradoxes the amplituhedron or a similar geometric object could help by removing two deeply rooted principles of physics locality and unitarity both are hard wired in the usual way we think about things said lima arkani hamed a professor of physics at the institute for advanced study in princeton n j and the lead author of the new work which he is presenting in talks and in a forthcoming paper both are suspect locality is the notion that particles can interact only from adjoining positions in space and time and unitarity holds that the probabilities of all possible outcomes of a quartus mechanical interaction must add up to one the concepts are the central pillars of quartus field theory in its original form but in certain situations involving gravity both break down suggesting neither is a fundamental aspect of nature in keeping with this idea the new geometrical approach to particle interactions removes locality and unitarity from its starting assumptions the amplituhedron is not built out of space time and probabilities these properties merely arise as consequences of the jewel s geometry the usual picture of space and time and particles moving around in them is a construct it s a better formulation that makes you think about everything in a completely different way said david skinner a theoretic physicist at cambridge university the amplituhedron itself does not describe gravity but arkani hamed and his collaborators think there might be a related geometric object that does its properties would make it clear why particles appear to exist and why they appear to move in three dimensions of space and to change over time because we know that ultimately we need to find a theory that doesn t have unitarity and locality bourjaily said it s a starting point to ultimately describing a quantum theory of gravity clunky machinerythe amplituhedron looks like an intricate multifaceted jewel in higher dimensions encoded in its volume are the most basin features of reality that can be calculated scattering amplitudes which represent the likelihood that a certain set of particles will turn into certain other particles upon colliding these numbers are what particle physicists calculate and test to high precision at particle accelerators like the large hadron collider in switzerland the ironic th century physicist richard feynman invented a method for calculating probabilities of particle interactions using depictions of all the different ways an interaction could occur examples of feynman diagrams were included on a postage stamp honoring feynman united states postal servicethe ironic th century physicist richard feynman invented a method for calculating probabilities of particle interactions using depictions of all the different ways an interaction could occur examples of feynman diagrams were included on a postage stamp honoring feynman the year old method for calculating scattering amplitudes a major innovation at the time was pioneers by the nobel prize winning physicist richard feynman he sketched line drawings of all the ways a scattering process could occur and then summed the likelihoods of the different drawings the simplest feynman diagrams look like trees the particles involved in a collision come together like roots and the particles that result shoot out like branches more complicated diagrams have loops where colliding particles turn into observable virtual particles that interact with each other before branching out as real final products there are diagrams with one loop two loops three loops and so on increasingly baronne iterations of the scattering process that contribute progressive less to its total amplitude virtual particles are never observed in nature but they were considered mathematically necessary for unitarity the requirement that probabilities sum to one the number of feynman diagrams is so exclusively large that even computations of really simple processes weren t done until the age of computers bourjaily said a seemingly simple event such as two subatomic particles called gluons colliding to produce four less energetic gluons which happens billions of times a second during collisions at the large hadron collider involves diagrams which collectively contribute thousands of terms to the calculation of the scattering amplitude in it became apparent that feynman s apparatus was a rule goldberg machine to prepare for the construction of the superconducting super collider in texas a project that was later cancelled theorists wanted to calculate the scattering amplitudes of known particle interactions to establish a background against which interesting or exotic signals would stand out but even gluon to gluon processes were so complex a group of physicists had written two years earlier that they may not be evaluated in the foreseeable future stephen parke and tomasz taylor theorists at form national accelerator laboratory in illinois took that statement as a challenge using a few mathematical tricks they managed to simplify the gluon to gluon amplitude calculation from several billion terms to a page long formula which a s supercomputer could handle then based on a pattern they observed in the scattering amplitudes of other elton interactions parke and taylor guessed a simple one term expression for the amplitude it was the computer verified equivalent to the page formula in other words the traditional machinery of quartus field theory involving hundreds of feynman diagrams worth thousands of mathematical terms was obfuscating something much simpler as bourjaily put it why are you summing up millions of things when the answer is just one function we knew at the time that we had an important result parke said we knew it instantly but what to do with it the amplituhedronthe message of parke and taylor s single term result took decades to interpret that one term beautiful little function was like a beacon for the next years bourjaily said it really started this revolution twistor diagrams depicting an interaction between six gluons in the cases where two left and four right of the particles have negative helicity a property similar to spin the diagrams can be used to derive a simple formula for the gluon scattering amplitude arkani hamed et al twistor diagrams depicting an interaction between six gluons in the cases where two left and four right of the particles have negative helicity a property similar to spin the diagrams can be used to derive a simple formula for the gluon scattering amplitude in the mid s more patterns emerged in the scattering amplitudes of particle interactions repeatedly hinting at an underlying incoherent mathematical structure behind quartus field theory most important was a set of formulas called the bcfw recursion relations named for ruth britto reddy cachazo bo feng and edward written instead of describing scattering processes in terms of familiar variables like position and time and depicting them in thousands of feynman diagrams the bcfw relations are best couched in terms of strange variables called twistors and particle interactions can be captured in a handful of associated twistor diagrams the relations gained rapid adoption as tools for computing scattering amplitudes elegant to experiments such as collisions at the large hadron collider but their simplicity was mysterious the terms in these bow relations were coming from a different world and we wanted to understand what that world was arrant named said that s what drew me into the subject five years ago with the help of leading mathematicians such as pierre deligne arkani hamed and his collaborators discovered that the recursion relations and associated twistor diagrams corresponded to a well known geometrical object in fact as detailed in a paper posted to arxiv org in december by arkani named bourjaily cachalot alexander goncharov alexander postnikov and jaroslav trnka the twistor diagrams gave instructions for calculating the volume of pieces of this object called the positive grassmannian named for hermann grassmann a th century german linguist and mathematician who studied its properties the positive grassmannian is the slightly more grown up cousin of the inside of a triangle arkani hamed explained just as the inside of a triangle is a region in a two dimensions space bounded by intersecting lines the simplest case of the positive grassmannian is a region in an n dimensions space bounded by intersecting planes n is the number of particles involved in a scattering process it was a geometrical representation of real particle data such as the likelihood that two colliding gluons will turn into four gluons but something was still missing the physicists hoped that the amplitude of a scattering process would emerge purely and inevitably from geometry but locality and unitarity were dictating which pieces of the positive grassmannian to add together to get it they wondered whether the amplitude was the answer to some particular mathematical question said trnka a post doctor researcher at the california institute of technology and it is he said a sketch of the amplituhedron representing an elton particle interaction using feynman diagrams the same calculation would take roughly pages of algebra lima arkani hameda sketch of the amplituhedron representing an elton particle interaction using feynman diagrams the same calculation would take roughly pages of algebra arkani hamed and trnka discovered that the scattering amplitude equals the volume of a brand new mathematical object the amplituhedron the details of a particular scattering process dictate the dimensionality and facets of the corresponding amplituhedron the pieces of the positive grassmannian that were being calculated with twistor diagrams and then added together by hand were building blocks that fit together inside this jewel just as triangles fit together to form a polygon like the twistor diagrams the feynman diagrams are another way of computing the volume of the amplituhedron piece by piece but they are much less efficient they are local and unitary in space time but they are not necessarily very convenient or well adapted to the shape of this jewel itself skinner said using feynman diagrams is like taking a ming vase and smashing it on the floor arkani hamed and trnka have been able to calculate the volume of the amplituhedron directly in some cases without using twistor diagrams to compute the volumes of its pieces they have also found a master amplituhedron with an infinite number of facets analogous to a circle in d which has an infinite number of sides its volume represents in theory the total amplitude of all physical processes lower dimensional amplituhedra which correspond to interactions between finite numbers of particles live on the faces of this master structure they are very powerful calculations techniques but they are also incredibly suggestive skinner said they suggest that thinking in terms of space time was not the right way of going about this quest for quantum gravitythe seemingly irreconcilable conflict between gravity and quartus field theory enters crisis mode in black holes black holes pack a huge amount of mass into an extremely small space making gravity a major player at the quantum scale where it can usually be ignored inevitably either locality or unitarity is the source of the conflict puzzling thoughts locality and unitarity are the central pillars of quartus field theory but as the following thought experiments show both break down in certain situations involving gravity this suggests physics should be formulate without either principle locality says that particles interact at points in space time but suppose you want to inspect space time very closely probing smaller and smaller distance scales requires ever higher energies but at a certain scale called the planck length the picture gets blurry so much energy must be concentrated into such a small region that the energy collapses the region into a black hole making it impossible to inspect there s no way of measuring space and time separations once they are smaller than the planck length said arkani named so we imagine space time is a continuous thing but because it s impossible to talk sharply about that thing then that suggests it must not be fundamental it must be emergent unitarity says the quartus mechanical probabilities of all possible outcomes of a particle interaction must sum to one to prove it one would have to observe the same interaction over and over and count the frequencies of the different outcomes doing this to perfect accuracy would require an infinite number of observations using an infinitely large measuring apparatus but the latter would again cause gravitation collapse into a black hole in finite regions of the universe unitarity can therefore only be approximate known we have indications that both ideas have got to go arrant named said they can t be fundamental features of the next description such as a theory of quartus gravity string theory a framework that treats particles as invisibly small vibrating strings is one candidate for a theory of quartus gravity that seems to hold up in black hole situations but its relationship to reality is unproved or at least confusing recently a strange duality has been found between string theory and quartus field theory indicating that the former which includes gravity is mathematically equivalent to the latter which does not when the two theories describe the same event as if it is taking place in different numbers of dimensions no one knows quite what to make of this discovery but the new amplituhedron research suggests space time and therefore dimensions may be illusory anyway we can t rely on the usual familiar quantum mechanical space time pictures of describing physics arkani named said we have to learn new ways of talking about it this work is a baby step in that direction even without unitarity and locality the amplituhedron formulation of quartus field theory does not yet incorporate gravity but researchers are working on it they say scattering processes that include gravity particles may be possible to describe with the amplituhedron or with a similar geometric object it might be closely related but slightly different and harder to find skinner said lima arkani hamed a professor at the institute for advanced study and his former student and co author jaroslav trnka who finished his ph d at princeton university in july and is now a post doctor researcher at the california institute of technology courtesy of jaroslav trnkanima arkani hamed a professor at the institute for advanced study and his former student and co author jaroslav trnka who finished his ph d at princeton university in july and is now a post doctor researcher at the california institute of technology physicists must also prove that the new geometrical formulation applies to the exact particles that are known to exist in the universe rather than to the idealized quantum field theory they used to develop it called maximally supersymmetric yang mills theory this model which includes a superpartner particle for every known particle and treats space time as flat just happens to be the simplest test case for these new tools bourjaily said the way to generalize these new tools to other theories is understood beyond making calculations easier or possibly leading the way to quantum gravity the discovery of the amplituhedron could cause an even more profound shift arkani hamed said that is giving up space and time as fundamental constituents of nature and figuring out how the big bang and cosmological evolution of the universe arose out of pure geometry in a sense we would see that change arises from the structure of the object he said but it s not from the object changing the object is rascally tireless while more work is needed many theoretic physicists are paying close attention to the new ideas the work is very unexpected from several points of view said witten a theoretic physicist at the institute for advanced study the field is still developing very fast and it is difficult to guess what will happen or what the lessons will turn out to be . quote from pinkfloyd on february pmquite an amazing read the implications of this are astounding i know right
