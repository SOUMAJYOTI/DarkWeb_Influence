hi so in about the tumble some bitcoins again and want to ask a few questions to ensure my method is still safe i have been sending coins from my coinbase account to an address on my blockchain wallet from which i use shared coin to either send it to my personal wallet on my virtual machine or to another tumbler though lately my laziness and uncertainty about tumbling services has removed this step now my questions are is this an effective technique should i be creating new blockchain wallets regularly to add anonymity or are new addresses good enough and if i should use another tumbler what service do you guys suggest thanks so much for the help ellie . hey so i just saw a link posted in a respected vendors profile on agora to a new market called the darknet heroes league does anyone
