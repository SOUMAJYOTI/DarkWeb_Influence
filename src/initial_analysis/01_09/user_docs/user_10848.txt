at this point isnt fly ideal so i dunno i just might look into it maybe ill try parade to a more recent osx i have snow leopard . hey i need alot of help setting up tails on snow leopard osx im just as the stage where i need to verify the iso file and i cant do it for the life of me i cant barely use terminal is anyone able to help thanks in advance . take my advice it will never ever work i tried for hours upon hours to get it to work and i couldnt you will need a non mac computer to run tails . would about a mavericks macbook on a usb would that work . quote from mirage on february

in the instructions something retarded like dev at the end of a certain command after about hours of trying i figured this out and got it to successfully install next you need a bootloader because mac has an eli loader instead for this they say you need refind which is an older version of refit i could not get it to install because i already had remit on there with no hopes to remove it when i

choosing it in get a black screen forever on my old imac i can boot tails from my macbook pro with no problems except the retina display makes stuff super tiny perhaps its your hardwares age . quote

macbook pro with no problems except the retina display makes stuff super tiny perhaps its your hardwares age probably i consider myself a veteran troubleshooter so if i cant solve an issue i figure it cant possibly be solved everyone who has said tails works on their apple product its a macobook pro i unfortunately dont have one im in the market for a crap laptop i can use solely for tails i am too i hate using the mac keypad and linux together . use terminal to mount the iso to the drive heres the proccess i use howto burn an iso to a us drive on your macinsert your thumbdrive you should see it pop up on your desktop all nice and mounted ready for you to use only it isn t if you can see it on your desktop you can t use it the way we need to diskutil listyou should see something like this de disk type name size identifier guid partition scheme gb disk efi my disk s apple corestorage go disk s apple boot recovery hd mb disk s de disk type name size identifier apple hfs macintosh hd gb disk dev disk type name size identifier guid partition scheme tb disk efi my disk s apple hfs my passport gb disk s de disk type name size identifier disk partition scheme gb disk dos fat entitled gb disk s in the instance above i ve noted my thumbdrive dev disk it happened to be entitled but it could be whatever name you may have given it anyhow we essentially need to unmount everything on that disk but not remove it completely from the system distil unmountdisk dev disk unmount of all volumes on disk was successfulthat solves that now where is that is image you have you need to know where it is so you can copy it to that thumbdrive by the way do this on a thumbdrive that is either backed up or in other ways not useful like old and small whatever you ll note the one i m using is g lol i got it with a cisco router that i bought it came with management software on it that sucks but i digress that thumbdrive when it s all over will have nothing on it but the iso you re burning to it on to the destructive part sudo dd if desktop crunchbang i iso of dev rdisk bs k records in records out bytes transferred in seas bytes sec i should note you won t see any activity more on that in a second you hit return and the computer goes to work not telling if it s working or not dd is one of those classic commands it ain t fancy or pretty or all high falutin it does one thing and it does exactly what you told it to do or it errors i should also note if you screw up an point that to something important like in my disk list above disk well you ll have the joy of reinstalling the os on your mac most likely breakdown sudo most of you know what this is i hope it allows you to do things as the superuser on your mac i e superuser do do command to convert and copy a file i don t know why it s named that if put file of output file bs n block size you can use m k k you get the idea i like k there s not much speed gained by anything bigger some of you are looking at that output file location and thinking where in the heck did he get rdisk from well it s the same location as disk only it s a raw device connection we re stepping outside the rules a little bit taking a little known shortcut that doesn t have any stoplights if you will or speed limits you ll essentially move the same data in about th of the time if you dev risk n the last thing that you should do is eject it but how do you do that since you can t drag it to the trash diskutil still has you covered distil eject disk disk disk ejectedif you really need to see something you ll need to have or install pipe viewer unless you already have some system like macports or homebrew have it working and know how to use it just suck it up and deal with not seeing something really i mean it anyhow maybe you re a dork like me and you have pipe viewer instead of the do command we used initials we re going to modify it vp peter desktop crunchbang i iso suds dd of dev rdisk bs k mib s eta there you go a nice little visual guide for elapsed time how fast and an estimate for how long it s going to take if you want to know more about pipe viewer there s a great article on it here well this turned out longer than i expected anyhow i hope it helps one of you out there someway maybe pm me if you need is answered what mac do you have an older macbookpro . yeah i was having great difficulty with one of the strings i think it

nice and mounted ready for you to use only it isn t if you can see it on your desktop you can t use it the way we need to diskutil listyou should see something like this de disk type name size

to that thumbdrive by the way do this on a thumbdrive that is either backed up or in other ways not useful like old and small whatever you ll note the one i m using is g lol i got it with a cisco

part sudo dd if desktop crunchbang i iso of dev rdisk bs k records in records out bytes transferred in seas bytes sec i should note you won t see any activity more on that in a second you hit return and the computer goes to work not telling if it s working or not dd is one of those classic commands it ain t fancy or pretty or all high falutin it does one thing and it does exactly what you told it to do or it errors i should also note if you screw up an point that to something important like in my disk list above disk well you ll have the joy of reinstalling the os on your mac most likely

since you can t drag it to the trash diskutil still has you covered distil eject disk disk disk ejectedif you really need to see something you ll need to have or install pipe viewer unless you already have some system like macports or homebrew have it working and know how to use it just suck it up and deal with not seeing something really i mean it anyhow maybe you re a dork like me and you have pipe viewer instead of the do command we used initials we re going to modify it vp peter desktop crunchbang i iso suds dd of dev rdisk bs k mib s eta there you go a nice little visual guide for elapsed time how fast and an estimate for how long it s going to take if you want to know more about pipe viewer there s a great article on it here well this turned out longer than i expected anyhow i
