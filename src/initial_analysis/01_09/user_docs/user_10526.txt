apt transport tor box will cause a new circuit to be created via tor maybe apt transport tor attempts to figure out if its coming from an exit node or not it would seem that either leaving apts

via tor youll see developers talking about how they havent fully understood the ramifications of doing so and will likely prevent it in future . does anyone know whether or not having a tor router in
