it looks like its main use for now is likely to be for safety critical embedded systems given general dynamics ae behind it and looking at the target architectures in say there pitching it to run intenet of things type devices and secure sensing applications maybe even stuff like self driving cars autonomous aircraft etc where you dont want a crash in one bit of software bringing down the whole show literally i think their claims are maybe just a little bit overflown about it being unshakable after all it is just a micro kernel not a full os much less have any applications of any real scale developed for it my nutsack is waterproof but that doesn mean i wont drown if you hold me underrated . so i apologize if someone has already brought this up i looked around an bit and didnt see anything here but by all means blast me if i missed it so some developers have done a buncha work with algorithms and supposed developed an unshakable kernal they named the project sel the code and build info is available on github ive started my own build done everything short of assembling as i dont want to do it correctly so in still doing my research id be interested to hear if anyone has heard of it knows much about it or has built one of their own yet . so i apologize if someone has already brought this up i looked around an bit and didnt see anything here but by all means blast me

other peoples opinions besides what the documentation about it says to me the idea of something being unshakable means its not connected to a network period since as we all know anything on a network theoretically can be remotely accesse and manipulated still interesting nonetheless . ah i could see that it makes alot of sense im still sceptical about the unshakable part as well which is why i

it is itself unshakable most likely however it doesnt prevent hardware layer bypasses such as row hammering and yes it is only unshakable at the kernel layer but it is meant to be used as an isolation hypervisor essentially think of it more like xen than a kernel . its formally verified but it can be passed with things like row hammer its primarily for isolation think of it like a virtual machine
