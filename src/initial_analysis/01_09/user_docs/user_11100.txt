from sect n on may pmhey guys what email service would you say is the best most reliable right now im thinking riseup but in open to other suggestions sigaint is probably the best choice available right now regardless of which email provider you end up choosing use of pip encryption is a must please also bear in mind tht riseup are by and large political activists they likely would take a dim view of their service being used for the purchase or sale of contraband if discovered they would likely delete your account bearing that in mind i like riseup a lot but also bear in mind the words of ladar levison the former owner operator of lavabit who shut down his service rather than betray all his customers to the fbi he said this experience has taught me one very important lesson without congressional action or a strong judicial precedent i would strongly recommend against anyone trusting their private data to a company with physical ties to the united states i would remind you that riseup likely has servers in the united states for those of you who are not familiar with it here is the lavabit story may th my fellow citizens my legal saga started last summer with a knock at the door behind which stood two federal agents ready to serve me with a court order requiring the installation of surveillance equipment on my company s network my company lavabit provided email services to people and thrive by offering features specifically designed to protect the privacy and security of its customers i had no choice but to consent to the installation of their device which would have provided the government with access to all of the messages for all of my customers as they travelled to and from other providers on the internet but that wasn t enough the federal agents also said their court order required me to surrender the company s private encryption keys and i balked what they claimed to need were customer passwords which were sent securely so they could access the plain text of messages for users taking advantage of my company s encrypted storage feature the government would later claim they only demanded the encryption keys because of my noncompliance i didn t realize until i retained an attorney that what the agents proposed would have exceeded their authority bothered by what the agents were saying i informed them i would first need to read the order they had just delivered and then consult with an attorney the feds seemed surprised by my hesitation what ensued was a flurry of legal proceedings that would last days when the dust settled i found myself the owner of a civil contempt fine my business shut down and bit by bit the very principle upon which i founded it that we all have a right to personal privacy slipping quickly away to appreciate just how fast the case moved consider the median timeframe for a similar proceedings was months in the government lawyers tried to overwhelm me in the first two weeks i was served court orders a total of seven times leading to contact with the fbi every other day this was the stretch a prosecutor would later characterize as the long period of silence it took a week for me to identify an attorney who could adequately represent me given the complex issues involved and we were in contact for less than a day when agents served me with a summons ordering me to appear in a virginia courtroom over miles from home two days later after admitting their demand to my lawyer i was served a subpoena for the encryption keys also marking the first time they put their demand in writing with such short notice my first attorney was unable to appear alongside me in court because the whole case was under seal i couldnt admit to anyone who wasnt a lawyer that i needed help let alone why in the days before my appearance i would spend hours repeating the facts of the case to a dozen attorneys as i sought someone else that was qualified to represent me i also discovered that as a third party in a federal criminal indictment i had no right to counsel thus my pleas for more time were denied after all only my property was in jeopardy not my liberty my right to a fair hearing was treated as a nuisance easily trampled by a team of determined prosecutors in the end i was forced to choose between appearing alone or face a bench warrant for my arrest when i appeared in virginia the government replaced their subpoena for the encryption key with a search warrant and a new court date i retained a small local law firm before returning home and they took on the task of assembling a legal strategy and filing briefs in the few short days available the court barred them from consulting outside experts making it difficult to understand the complex legal and technological issues involved even a request to discuss the case with members of congress was denied to make matters worse the court wouldn t deliver transcripts for my first appearance for another two months my legal team was forced to proceed without access to information they needed then a federal judge entered an order of contempt against me without even a hearing let me be clear i did not devoted years of my life to building lavabit with its focus on privacy only to become complicit in a plan which would have meant the wholesale violation of my customers right to privacy thus with my options in court exhausted the decision was easy i had to shut down my service placing my faith in the integrity of the appeals process when the judge granted the contempt charge unopposed ignoring my attorney s request to dispute the government s claims he created a loophole i was never given an opportunity to object let alone provide a meaningful defense an important point since the contempt charge endorsed new legal claims reversing what the court had previously indicated without an objection on the record the appellative court would rule that my right to an appeal had been waited since the charges hadn t been disputed in district court given the supreme court s tradition of declining to review cases decided on procedure grounds i will likely be denied justice forever the most important question raised by my appeal was what constitutes a search i e whether law enforcement may demand the encryption keys of a business and use those keys to inspect the private communications of every customer when they are only authorized to access information belonging to a select few the problem here is technological until a communication has been decrypted and the contents parsed it is impossible for a surveillance device to determine which network connections belong to the target accounts the government argued that since the inspection would be carried out by a machine they were exempt from the normal search and seizure protections of the fourth amendment more important the prosecution argued the exemption was because my users had no expectation of privacy even though the encryption they were trying to break was created specifically to ensure a users privacy if my experience serves any purpose it is to illustrate what most already know our courts must not be allowed to consider matters of great importance in secret lest we find ourselves summarily deprived of meaningful due process if we allow our government to continue operating in secret it is only a matter of time before you or a loved one find yourself in a position like i was standing in a secret courtroom alone and without any of the inalienable rights that are supposed to protect us from an abuse of the state s authority sincerely adar
