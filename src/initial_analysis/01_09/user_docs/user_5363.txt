is used by many good people if the network is affected we will immediately inform users via this blog and our twitter feed torproject along with more information if we become aware of any related

twitter feeds will be tracked and used against them later millions more also use the tor network at their local internet cafe to stay safe for ordinary web browsing tor is also used by banks diplomatic officials members of law enforcement bloggers and many others attempts to disable the tor network would interfere with all of these users not just ones disliked by the attacker every person has the right to privacy this right is a foundation of a democratic society for example if members of the british parliament or us congress can not share ideas and opinions free of government spying then they can not remain independent from other branches of government if journalists are unable to keep their sources confidential then the ability of the press to check the power of the government is compromise if human rights workers cant report evidence of possible crimes against humanity it is impossible for other bodies to examine this evidence and to react in the service of justice we

yasha makes a lot of accurate statements and a little speculation regarding tor funding yes it came from the government and received a lot of government funding but so what so did the internet both have become very powerful tools to the government both for delivering generic propaganda and also for facilitating anonymous communications for grass roots activists asa agents of regime change perhaps now that the bulk of the revolutions are completed there is less need for tor in some government quarters we have been using tor since and have watched it evolve from a small hideously slow network for masking source addresses to a large much faster network providing both source address masking and now as of hidden services it is a low latency system and as such was only ever intended to provide moderate anonymity when used to access clear net sites it provides much better anonymity when only onion sites are accesse but sure it is not absolute anonymity by a long way our thinking in the early days was that it was potentially unlearned on the public as a way of creating choke points for naughtiness at a time when wide scale monitoring of the internet was not feasible it being far easier to monitor and potentially insect traffic into a hundred exit nodes if that than the whole internet bear in mind there was no tor browser back then so you hooked up your regular browser and put it through privoxy which partially dealt with stripping unwonted content still unless you were very navvy it was very easy to leak information through your browser or for your browser to get owned thus revealing your ip as for govt agencies running nodes were sure they do but equally a very large number of nodes are run by random people many of whom are definitely not afflicted with any government each and everyone of you reading could run relays maybe some of you do the problem is nobody knows the true ratio most professionally run hidden services employ their own guard nodes or use private bridges probably deployed some time before the hidden service servers themselves it is a problem and the only real solution is to ensure that as many relays as possible are not run by the government a month is enough for a decent relay non exit there are other platforms besides tor but as has been said a hundred times they have not received a satisfactory level of scrutiny so short of developing a new platform and the thousands of man days required to make that happen tor is the best we have for now for mass use and as roger suggested back in mass use is an important part of the anonymity model we believe that the best thing to do is deploy more relays ensuring that they can never be attributed to you which is not that difficult in the scheme of things assuming you have the necessary technical skills to do this safely you can pay people like torservers to do it for you but that seems like very much second best another key thing and we have said it many times before is using a trusted guard node given that any guard node will always have visibility of your real in address or your vpn address then there seems like not a lot to be lost from also having your own relay just big enough an stable enough to attract guard status this guard relay would be easier to associate with you given the fact that you would be using it yes tor use is a flag but so will the use of any anonymity service and really does anyone have any better ideas at this stage that are ready to go the blog post in the op is a wake up call to deal with a current architectural weakness that becomes a major vulnerability should the government decide that tor has outlived its usefulness perhaps that was the point of rogers post . quote from baraka on december pmjnf is totally right search

shows brought up ross ulbricht and his current predicament this lead to a discussion of the dnm and tor ultimately the host mentioned i p and how it is a i hesitate to use this word safer alternative to tor perhaps more secure anyways i did a bit of research it seems more complicated and i think that is the point but complication security i was wondering if anyone else had experience with i p or any the markets that reside there btw you can donate to ross ulbrichts defense fund via bitcoin . quote from baraka on december pm a hack which was probably done by our own government so it can grow even larger and get even more power over the people exactly right the us federal government has grown in size and scope since its inception years ago with the most massive and rapid expansion being since under george bush and now our fearless leader king obama waving his pen and phone around like a power hungry dictator starting with the ndaa and the patriot act then moving forward with the expansion of the police state and the explosive growth of homeland security why does that monicker conjure up images of mother russia now the president doesn even have to approach congress to force his unilateral edicts on his subjects not that it would matter we no longer have a representative government and have been living in a oligarchy for a decade or more so to my point anytime i see things like this even though people will often toss you into the tinfoil hat category i believe much of these events are by design to do exactly what baraka said grow the government . quote from

messaging to apps like whatsapp and snapchat there are plenty of possibilities to chat on the web and many social media platforms are already available which allows you to create a chat room for group conversation now we have got one more similar but a great option in our list i e hack chat which allows its users to chat anonymously this new web based chat room is unique in its own way it allows everyone participating in the chatroom to remain anonymous absolutely no sign ups and no sign ins whats fascinating about this new platform is that the chatroom you create is disposal which means whatever you discuss or chat on this platform will never be saved on their servers in addition to that the setup of this chatroom is quick and dead easy and can be thrown away once you are done with the anonymous discussion all you have to do is simply create your own chatroom url by adding followed by the name if you want better anonymity then use some hard to guess alphanumeric string and then share that uri with your friends so they can join the discussion the creator has played well with the coding and theres a possibility of late markup while the ms dos style theme gives it that geeky look the hack chat platform was built by andrew belt who is physics and a mathematics student at the university of tennessee according to belt its servers dont save any chat histories thats reassuring enough but we will recommend you to act with cautiousness you think it is a safe service and do you see potential on it i find the share simplicity of it absolutely brilliant . i guess that if your machine has already been compromise than probably not even pip offers great protection i do appreciate sometimes to connect with others in real time and use pidgin with otr enabled which with my limited knwoledge of this things offers good protection for the effect the vulnerability with this is trusting the authors assertion that no chats are logged and no historry is kept but i love the simplicity of the tool you can just create a chat room at any time that instantly evaporates once the last participant leaves and at the same time have an address that can be shared within a group and is always available for people to meet and converge when they are online not sure if such a service will last long if it falls unders us jurisdiction though . quote from brahman on july pmi guess that

comes to encryption you could use an air gapped machine for the sole purpose of crypto and then transfer the encrusted messages to your pc connected to the tor network via a us flash drive or a cd to send them off as required its like those websites such as igolder who reported take care of encrypting and decrypting messages for you in a web browser when youre entering sensitive information in plain text onto a web page hasted on a rd party server which then encrypts that data using an obsolete insecure public key usually only bits in strength youre taking unnecessary risks which have the potential to one day come back and bite you in the ass never trust the encrypting or decrypting of messages containing sensitive date to anyone but yourself . i guess that if your machine has already

people to meet and converge when they are online not sure if such a service will last long if it falls unders us jurisdiction though . some sound advice there and i completely agree with you on it would you consider safe using such a service if you use tails for example nowadays i access tor almost exclusively through tails running on a us and so such a service seems to me mostly safe i guess one of the weak points is in the fact that one can just create a surname as it joins the room and there is no way to verify in ira one can register a nick and keep it private with a password with this service as long as someone has access to the rooms url it can just log in using any surname potentially impersonating someone else funny that you mention igolder as when i first found out about the dw i actually used it to encrypt info with it as i couldnt be bothered at the time to learn about pgp for someone with limited it kwoledge if was a frightening beast to deal with and it felt most people at the time weren even bothered to encrypt their address at all wasnt untill later i actually got interested in it and the tools available to protect ones privacy im personally fortunate enough to live in a country where i dont have to worry much about opsec as nothing i do in here including the buying recreation drugs for my own consumption can be considered reason enough to prosecute or even dedicate resources to i learned pgp tails or mostly because i recognise that in today world it is an important knowledge to have i dont feel at all that i am a person of interest to le or to anyone else not any more than the next guy however knowledge is power and one can never be sure that in or years time im not living under a totalitarian and oppressive regime specially with the politics of this days i completely agree with edward snowden when he said arguing that you don t care about the right to privacy because you have nothing to hide is no different than saying you don t care about free speech because you have nothing to say . quote from brahman on july pmi just came across a really interesting new tool to chat anonymously online and thought it would be of interest to some in

brilliant anything web based running through a browser is going to be vulnerable to attackers just how vulnerable remains to be seen but browsers offer a large attack surface for an attacker to exploit especially if there are plug ins or extensions being used they obviously shouldnt be theres also a possibility of a zero day exploit being used which is a concern in itself you still cant beat pgp encrypted messages sent privately on a forum or from an email provider operating a tor hidden service however i can understand the need some people may have to communicate in a secure real time

from instant messaging to apps like whatsapp and snapchat there are plenty of possibilities to chat on the web and many social media platforms are already available which allows you to create a chat room for group conversation now we have got one more similar but a great option in our list i e hack chat which allows its users to chat anonymously this new web based chat room is unique in its own way it allows everyone participating in the chatroom to remain anonymous absolutely no sign ups and no sign ins whats fascinating about this new platform is that the chatroom you create is disposal which means whatever you discuss or chat on this platform will never be saved on their servers in addition to that the setup of this chatroom is quick and dead easy and can be thrown away once you are done with the anonymous discussion all you have to do is simply create your own chatroom url by adding followed by the name if you want better anonymity then use some hard to guess alphanumeric string and then share that uri with your friends so they can join the discussion the creator has played well with the coding and theres a possibility of late markup while the ms dos style theme gives it that geeky look the hack chat platform was built by andrew belt who is physics and a mathematics student at the university of tennessee according to belt its servers dont save any chat histories thats reassuring enough but we will recommend you to act with cautiousness you think it is a safe service and do you see potential on it i find the share simplicity of it absolutely brilliant anything web based running through a browser is going to be vulnerable to attackers just how vulnerable remains to be seen but browsers offer a large attack surface for an attacker to exploit especially if there are plug ins or extensions being used they obviously shouldnt be theres also a possibility of a zero day exploit being used which is a concern in itself you still cant beat pgp encrypted messages sent privately on a forum or from an email provider operating a tor hidden service however i can understand the need some people may have to communicate in a secure real time environment . some sound advice there and i completely agree with you on it would you consider safe using such a service if you use tails for example nowadays i access tor almost exclusively through tails running on a us and so such a service seems to me mostly safe i guess one of the weak points is in the fact that one can just create a surname as it joins the room and there is no way to verify in ira one can register a

encrypting messages and sending them to certain individuals via forum pms or an email service provider configured as a tor hidden service i just done have a need to engage in any real time chats in this environment especially when i have many real life conversations each and every day . to be clear what hack chat means by anonymous is different that what many of us here mean by anonymous they are rascally saying that the chat room will not log your ip there are several of those implementations floating around theres a sample terrified implementation of one that does not require javascript here chatrapi fkbzczrthe site has a link to its code project as well it uses http refresh instead of javascript and doesnt log or correlate ips you can use it to easily add real time chat to your site for instance tox had it on his crowdfunded ransomware site with that said i think what most of us mean by anonymous is really more along the lines of untraceable that chat does nothing for that but then again neither does the hub or nearly any other onion site for that matter again personal opsec is more important than anything look at the whole situation with ping right now someone took that fact that they knew he was canadian and correlated it with his online behaviour him missing for awhile now his whole shit blew up most cases of doxing whether by le or someone else will happen like that real time chat my friend is generally an opsec nightmare as far as im concerned it was a abner conversation that fucked ping sometimes emotions in a conversation can take over your reasoning skills and it only takes one dumb word to fuck yourself when i first logged on to the hub irc i caught flack for not using irc i said give only used it once or twice and there were a bunch of comments i dont believe you what kind of hacker doesnt use irc well the kind that stay anonymous . hi everyone i use gpg usb within tails to store keys encrypt and decrepit messages i like the simplicity of the program and i was using it before migrating to tails so i just naturally kept using it after moving os i always assumed the program to be secure however as i was recently exchanging messages with a user i notice in the header of the message created by gpg usb that is using snug v while my contact is using snug v mingw i went to check if there is any plate to the program but i seem to be using the latest version released v which by the way has been released almost a year ago further reading brought me to the gnupg page and the release which seems to be a security fix latest stable version reccommended seems to be the with the new already released i do notice that v is the classic portable version and there doesnt seem to be any warning against using it would you reccommend using gog us and is it a safe program as i always assumed is the fact that it still seems to use the gnupg v something to be concerned and what would you reccommend as an alternative the openpgp applet within tails doesnt seem to create any header with the gnupg version used but i assume that due to the frequent releases of the os this has been kept dated i look forward to hearing your thoughts and thanks
