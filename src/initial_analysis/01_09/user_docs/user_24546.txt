iphone through the wifi as a security camera when i have time first added i had recently been interested in turning an old iphone into a tireless security camera i found a very helpful program video streaming image snapshots built in webserver motion detection ftp unload text and image overlays password protection online announcements for communities scheduler for online time time lapse movies run as a windows service multi languagesnow this app was selected for primary reasons you can connect it to an ip based camera stream which is great for using an old iphone connected to the wifi it is free it has motion detection i will not get into details at this moment on setting these up but this program can also be used to access your security camera from the web i am sure there is a much more extensive tutorial for this that i can save time copy pasting to be continued . advanced vial tek using inert gas by psilocybin dated with pictureshere is my tek for long term storage vials liquid this method is totally suitable for long term storage the vials should last for decades you will need laer adapter balloon syringe needles sealed sterile vials sleeve stopper septum as cheaper alternative transfer pipettes or syringe hq vodka grey goose inert gas can use private reserve wine preserverraw xtal is shipped within a small container baggy the method i use to retrieve every last bit of xtal from the container is to mix the solution inside the container it comes in once the stal dissolves i use a transfer pipette to draw the liquid from the container baggy this ensures that every last mcg of xtal is utilized i perform around washes on each container i do this to make sure nothing is lost b if the zipper is full of stal from left to right right to left release the solvent in the upper zipper section of the baggy allow it to puddle in there with the zipper open slightly shake agitate allow to dissolve say i have my i will be making x my vials each containing mg of raw xtal i prefer this concentration because it allows for precise dose measurements i also done have to handle expose a vial of hits each time i would like to dose in my glass measuring beaker i add ml of vodka i use transfer pipettes to transfer the liquid into and from the container the stal comes in i then add back to the measuring beaker i transfer the ml of led soda solution into x ml holds serug vials and seal with a crimper or a sleeve stopper i now like to use solvent right out of the bottle with a sleeve attached i have a habit of working sterile it is a good habit creating an inert atmosphere this step is important if you want to keep the vials for long term storage select a septum stopper that fits tightly onto the neck of the bottle or vial that you wish to seal insert a needle through the septum to act as a vent add soda solution to the bottle or vial after fitting the septum or valve minimizing exposure of the liquid to the atmosphere quickly flush inert gas into the bottle or vial using a needle connected to an inert gas line balloon by a luer adapter once the bottle or vial has been thoroughly purged with inert gas remove the vent or syringe and then the inert gas needle long term storage the septum should be secured with copper wire or zip tie for extra protection another septum of the same size without any needle holes in it can be turned upside down and pulled over the one that is attached to the container the second septum is removed before syringing liquid from the vessel store in a refrigerator or freezer always allow it to warm up to room temperature and make sure to remove any condensation from the outside of the container before unsealing it tips always pay attention to measurements of led d lsd when transferring liquid into and from the container baggy be careful not to puncture a hole in the plastic follow step if using sealed sterile vialscheers psilocybin . bridges i had gotten from torproject that worked both in and out

and business completely separated biggie smalls counterintelligence theory and practice for crack dealersguerrillas terrorists narcos spooks and youguerrillas terrorists narrow and spooks the world over have learned the hard way how to keep their illicit activity safe from their opponents the same principles of counterintelligence ci that help protect them from death can be applied to protect you from your adversary if you engage in behavior that carries the risk of negative consequences from an adversary you will need to develop and implement a robust ci program this post will explain the foundations of strong opsec a critical part of just such a program establish cells or live in nether cornerstone of any solid counterintelligence program is compartmentation compartmentation is the separation of information including people and activities into discreet cells these cells must have no interaction access or knowledge of each other enforcing ignorance between different cells prevents any one compartment from containing too much sensitive information if any single cell is compromise such as by an informant the limitats of the damage will be at the boundaries of the cell now compartmenting an entire organisation is a difficult feat and can seriously impede the ability of the organisation to learn and adapt to changing circumstance however these are are not concerns that we need to address for an individual who is compartmenting their personal life from their illicit activity spooks such as cin case officiers or go illegals compartment their implicit activity spying from their regular lives the first part of this is of course keeping their mouths shut about their implicit activities there are many other important parts of tradecraft which are beyond the scope of this post but remember when you are compartmenting your life the first rule is to never discuss your illicit activities with anyone outside of that compartment compartmentation for dummiesthis will cover a basin set of guidelines for compartmenting a particular online activity in our hypothetically scenario there are two people alice and bob natch who want to exchange information with each other they are deathly afraid that the adversary will learn in ascending order of risk to alice two people have been in contact low risk bob has been in contact with someone medium risk alice has been in contact with someone high risk alice has been in contact with bob extreme risk while this guideline is a starting point for someone who seeks to conduct implicit activity under hostile internet surveillance it is not concrete set of rules when developing a ci program you must evaluate the threats and risks to yourself and create a custom set of tools and procedures that address your needs the specific sop that you develop for will differ from the outline below but if it is to be resilient against the adversary it must be based on some form of compartmentation step cleanliness is next to not being in jailiness alice must purchase new dedicated equipment used exclusively for communicating with bob this means buy a new atop don t bother with a new virtual machine that isn t sufficiently compartmented any existing equipment that alice owns might already be compromise and is therefore not safe against potential monitoring the software installed should be the bare minimum of generic utilities required to do the communications here is an example setup atop cover the webcam with tape disable the mid if possible virtualization software vbox vmware parallels etc ubuntu installed in the vm disable all the logging reporting recommended software tor browser bundle pgp generate and store new keys on a us drive otr enabled chat client snapshot the vmthis is the base platform that alice will use when contacting bob obviously bob should go through the same process if he faces similar risks or is concerned about alice s wellbeing the usernames and hostnames used should be generic not associated with alice s real name location place of work etc if the vm is compromise there will be no identifying information or keys that can be used to decrypt previous comms if the vm is escaped and the adversary has access to the host again there will be no identifying information the host machine has only the virtualization software on it use full disk encryption on the host machine probably on the vm use different passwords between the two and keep the machine fully powered off when not in immediate active use step take a tripquote number never sell no crack where you rest at i don t care if they want a ounce tell em bounce biggie smalls counterintelligence theory and practice for crack dealersalice must ensure that every single time she contacts bob or checks for contact from bob she is in a location which is not linked to her additional she must use an internet connection which is not linked to her for example a public wifi or a repaid g card when alice goes to contact bob she must ensure that she does not carry any device which will transmit her physical location for example her mobile phone s leave it at home step unlinkedinafter alice has used her dedicated machine to communicate with bob she should revert the vm snapshot to the pristine state from right after she installed this should limit the ability of the adversary to persist after a compromise provided they didn t escape the vm the converse with bob machine must be used with new accounts created specifically for and exclusively to converse with bob these accounts must be created from the new machine and never be used for anything else except bob related activity alice must create new accounts that don t have any links to her real identity for email one option is a tormail account for instant messaging there is either cryptocat over tor or create a new jabber account such as with jabber ccc de concluding thoughtsthe core concept to take away here is separate identity with equipment and accounts used only for one activity the essense of compartmentation is separation without contamination my strong recommendation is to use a virgin machine with virgin accounts to contact the target this machine is used exclusively for this one activity it is compartmented associating the activity of that online entity even with full and complete globe internet monitoring and day attacks with a specific individual should be difficult note don t count on this if you happen to be the new al quaida . survival in an extremely adversaries environment if your secure communications platform isn t being used by terrorists and pedophiles you re probably doing it wrong redacted a few years ago a group of child pornographers was infiltrated by police who were able to monitor interest and aggressively investigate the members despite engaging in a month undercover operation only one in three of the pedophiles were successfully apprehended the majority including the now infamous leader yardbird escaped capture the dismal success rate of the law enforcement officials was due entirely to the strict security rules followed by the group this post will examine those rules the reasons for their success and the problems the group faced which necessitated those rules an examination of the group s security from a slightly different perspective was conducted by baal and is available here covert organizations seen one seen em allall covert organizations face a similar set of problems as they attempt to execute on their fundamental mission to continue to exist a covert organization in an adversaries environment faces a number of organization challenges and constraints fundamentally how it handles trade offs between operation security and efficiency mandates how group members perform their operation activities strong open means low efficiency while high efficiency necessitates weak opsec the strength of the opposition forces dictate the maximum security requirements of the covert organization examining the operation activities those actions the organization must engage in to self perpetuate allows us to evaluate their operation security decisions within their environment context operation activities the yardbird child abuse content group hereafter also called the enterprise had a number of core goals that had to be addressed to continue operation they needed to distribute their child abuse content to members communicate between members raise funds to acquire new content recruit new members presumably for access to additional child abuse content implicitly stated this is an enumerated list of the operation activities that the group had to engage in to self perpetuate distribution of child abuse content communication and coordinate action fund raising recruitment and vettingexcept for the first issue strategically significant only to this group these are pretty typical activities for a clandestine organization besides their defiling operation activity they need a communications channel fund raising capability and membership management processes opposition success the penetrationthe law enforcement authorities caught a pedophile distribution child abuse content he is a member of the yardbird group and offers up complete access to the group along with arrival logs in exchange for leniency all of the information about this group comes from the castleman affidavit the baal analysis and some baal follow ups a frustrating infiltrationthe law enforcement authorities were about to completely penetrate the enterprise for a month period from through during that time the group s posted images and videos the enterprise had approximate active members although independent observers have claimed this is low with the real membership anywhere from to the total number of arrests was or somewhere around rd a fully stuffed highly mutilated well trained adversaries force with complete penetration of a large complacent group was only about to achieve a one in three success rate the majority of those successes were achieved due to group members being insufficiently cautious and violating the enterprise security rules obviously these security rules are extremely resilient against adversaries assault the members who were caught were those who violated the security sop of the group accessing a newsgroup server without using tor e g vpn or directly revealing personal details about themselves contacting each other outside the group s secure comes channeloperational activity distributionthe enterprise was careful to ensure that the location of the encrusted files containing child abuse images was a different newsgroup from the communications newsgroup one possible reason is to unlink the obvious encrusted group discussion from the larger encrusted content posts that is they compartmented their commo from their file sharing as an additional although superfluous step the enterprise would apparently alter the sequence number of the split binary uploads so that reassembly would be hammered what this cumbersome step added beyond the existing pgp encryption is unclean if your adversary can break pgp they can probably figure out the order some files operation activity communicationsthe enterprise would use the primary newsgroup at the start of the investigation all anonymous messages to announce the location of a media cache for group members the communications newsgroup is always reserved strictly for communications the announcements regarding new downloads provided detailed instructions as to the location of the child abuse content plus how to download assemble and decrypt it the group used a single shared pgp key for all members on the one hand this would completely negate the security provided by pgp if the key falls into the wrong hands it also limits the groups ability to expel a member who transgresses the rules and needs to be punished on the other hand the use of a shared key makes key management significantly easier which is a serious concern when you need to rekey every few months additional using only one key reduces the ability of the adversary to determine group size by examining the pgp packets it also removes the potential for a group member to reuse a key that is linked to their real identity see this excellent presentation for more details on those attacks operation activity recruitmentthe enterprise expanded by allowing new members to join there were clear guidelines procedures and rules for expansion first there was a background check to ensure that the respective member was an established and active participant in the wider community of child abuse image traders then an existing member has to invite the prospect to the group finally to demonstrate both their deep involvement in the activity and to prove they are not an undercover cop they must pass a timed written test on the minutiae of various child abuse victims and media vetting demonstrate active participation in the trading scene invited by existing member must exhibit deep domain specific knowledge via timed written testsecurity rules that work never reveal true identity to another member of the group never communicate with another member of the group outside the sent channel group membership remains strictly within the confines of the internet no member can positively identify another members do not reveal personally identifying information primary communications newsgroup is migrate regularly if a member violates a security rule e g fails to encrypt a message periodically to reduce chance of law enforcement discovery on each newsgroup migration create new pgp key pair unlinking from previous messages each member creates a new nickname nickname theme selected by yardbirdroot of successive reason the majority of the group was able to avoid capture was in a small way due to the technology they were using tor but primarily it was adherence to the security rules of the group they had very good opsec and they followed it consistently fundamentally they had complete compartmentation within the group they did not reveal information to each other the law enforcement authorities were able to get logs of all their communications traffic plus logs of their ip addresses they used for posting everyone that used tor as per the recommendation of yardbird was anonymous at the ip layer this protected them from a subpoena revealing their identity as long as there was no additional information that they had revealed about themselves in their messages they were secure against the opposition the use of pgp was essentially a no op in this case it excluded the general public from accessing the content of the communications traffic and the child abuse videos and images it did not protect the traffic against analysis by the opposition who had successfully infiltrated the group the encryption was not a factor in their successful evasion rather it was the content of the messages controlled and dictated by the security rules which protected their secrets lessons learnedguarding secrets involves not sharing them encryption can only ever protect the content of a communique real security must start with the content itself and then use encryption as an additional layer . i have sent you an edit hope yall l find it useful . procedure preheat your oven to degrees get cups of strawnet this stuff is compressed and expands it is compressed wheat grass pellets it has a binder that you need to rinse out this is easy put them in a bowl in a separate bucket place your coco fiber brick submerged in tap water let the coir sit for minutes meanwhile fill your pot that has the strawnet in it with hot water make sure you put the water to the top as this strawnet will expand place it on the stove and begin to boil it after about minutes it will start to boil and bubble turn the heat to medium now allow it to boil for about more minutes at medium temperature you need to stir it with the big spoon every minutes or so turn the stove off and get your strainer over the sink and ready strain the strawnet and be careful it gets clumsy sometimes and can splat and burn you strain it you can just pour it into the fine metal strainer and rinse it with cold water thoroughly let it strain for about minutes and go smoke a bowl come back after your high as fuck and expand your coir with some gloves on add about vermiculite by volume of your coir that means mix it about of the total volume of the coir now after your strawnet has cooled a bit and your stoned just flip the strainer of strawnet right on top of your mix of verm and coir in your bucket or mixing box now with gloves mix it up nice and smooth make sure you get out any clumps of strawnet and make sure it looks like every little piece is touching some coir it will stick it will be a nice and fluffy mix eventually you will have this green brown sandy looking mix that has a nice fluff to it like this squeeze between fingers and do the field capacity test add water as needed what we want is just above moisture content so about two drops out of a field capacity test reason being that the oven pasteurization will cause some moisture to escape due to evaporation once moisture content is perfect add your mix into turkey tins one x brick of coir should be enough for iris bins worth of substrate this makes the substrate level about when full colonization occurs place foil over your turkey tins and stack them in the oven for hours start your timer and then turn off the oven when hours is up allow the tins to cool oversight or use them in a few hours use your clean area and start making your tubs clean out your tub with rubbing alcohol and get some polyfil to place in the holes of your tub you can also put micropore tape on the outside of the holes this works very well and later on you can actually use a hairdryer to push positive air into your chamber through this tape clean your tub lid as well and then place your trash bag on bottom now use a gallon black trashbag with no hooks or strings just plain bag unfold it once and you are rascally placing your substrate on the outside of the bag once flushed out you can flip it inside out and it serves as a garbage bag and throws out your dead substrate added pointer when you birth your bin you can use the black trash bag and press it up against the edges of the chamber where the condensation is dripping this seems to help from all tests sometimes you can even spray disinfectant in the tub all over and let it sit for around minutes and come back and do your work leave the lid on and bring your turkey tins to your clean area get two quarts for each turkey tin this will be total quarts of spawn because we have turkey tins and bins this mix is for iris bins now you can use er tek to get quick clones to start this tek off with if not you can use multispore it will work however your hit or miss with multispore sometimes so good genetics are always welcomed the pics you will see have examples of a tasmania strain clone from a previous rd flush we wont go into detail but you can lookup er tek to see what is being said also you can lookup tango and check out some of his liquid cloning methods as well as some of fahtsters liquid cloning methods these are all solid methods that will help you along the way and allow you to get the genetics you need if you are starting multispore do that next round after you have a flush clone it then move on then when you find your clone follow the lc methods listed above and you should be able to run your clone into the ground you can use vacutainers and even preserve your clone for years and years give had plain distilled water and stem tissue stay good in a fridge for two years straight it didnt perform well after those two years but it did still fruit two flushes and then contaminated so it can be done dump each turkey tin into each chamber closing the lid after each dump get your clean spoon and breakup two quarts and dump them in one bin close the lid do this over and over till you finish all bins now get two gloves and mix in your spawn with your substrate make the mix nice and even and make your substrate as level as possible do this for each bin and close the lid place your bins in a dark closet or you can use some black plastic and place them directly in your writing closet just make sure they care covered by black plastic wait a week or until full colonization occurs generally days with strawnet and coir it can colonize in days or it can sometimes take up to depending on the temps and such once your beds are colonizes you can birth them get out your press n seal the bed should look something like this take your lid off of your bin place a double wide roll of press n seal over your bin get a needle and poke as many holes as you want more than and usually you can just do a bunch for seconds with an osciallating fan in the room this can help with your fae you can also get a hairdryer or cpu fan to use for air exchange if you need it it isnt necessary but it never hurts to do it once a week or even once a day the pics below were not fanned the only time the top was opened was to take pics you can also get the green stability rods for plants at walmart that are cents each and are long here you cancriss cross stacking method rotation cyclein between flush maintenancebin with satan wrapventing during fruiting stacking method using plant stability rods this fits nicely over each bin two per bin you can then stack bins one on top of the other the bars will lay across each bin this allows you to not have to criss cross stack your boxes i think some people call this rez effect when you place coir in the substrate pointer if you use press n seal you wont need to tilt the boxes at all the tilting combats excess moisture on you r lids so it isnt necessary with holes poked in the press n seal if there are no holes in it you will have trouble excess co buildup and too much moisture on the lid that will begin to drip so if you cant tilt or done want to poke holes in your press n seal the idea is to not fan at all and dunk between flushes it speeds up your flush time by about half reynolds rose seal tight is the new stuff being used this was pointed out by set poop and tested and it doesnt even get condensation on the tops and no fanning is required this is probably going to be the next best thing it has the best properties of both press n seal and saran wrap without the tape good stuff . eatyus how first of all i want to say that this tek is derived from many other teks it is just my little twist on it this is simply put millets tekwith eats adaptivity to it it doesnt mean it is better or worse it is just a little different with ratios and utensils the basis ratio for this tek is rascally dung verm the casing is also coin verm you can use eat moss but one pound coir brick equals the entire casing for one quart bin recipe for quart clear bins for double tubs ratios per turkey tins turkey tins total cups screened worm castings cups vermiculite quart distilled water quarter pressure cooker bag full of straw per turkey tinsso your total for turkey tins would be cups dung cups verm and gallon distilled water we will mix these ratios later but for now we will just tell you these ratios supplies needed long sterilized spoons long enough to break up mycelia in quart spawn jars turkey tinsvermiculitedry worm castingsplastic gloves powder free painting maskozium or disinfecting sprayrubbing alcoholfinely chopped straw preferable chopped with a food processor or wood chipper thick foilterrarium lid for filtering available at any pet store quarts of colonizes spawnextra distilled water large glass jars made for pcing gallon size preferably these are available at any asia market that sells kim chee which is a borean cabbage dish the lids also come autoclaveable these large jars will be used to make the casing soilproceduresall pre steps done the night beforepre step screen your worm dung with a terrarium lid for a reptile aquariumpre step finely chop your straw until it is almost to powder size the smaller the better pre step soak straw hours strain then pc for two hours explanation the finer the straw is the better it mixes into the spawn run also the spawn run is much shorter when the mix is more even now presoak this straw for hours then pc the straw for hours at si remember though you dont have to do this straw step until the night before you decide you want to do the spawning also it isnt advisable to keep straw sitting too long even after it has been paced be straw is very quick to contam i would suggest keeping it in the pc until you decide it is time to spawn or it would be better to just pc it the night before you spawn i often tend to do this in a few steps which make it a little easier i cook everything the night before and then spawn everything the next day just make sure you have a clean working area everything can be done open air it is advisable to run air filters and spray disinfectant spray in the air before you spawn it is even a good idea to drop the house temp about degrees a few hours before you do the spawning then turn the ac off while you do this spawning below is a picture of the texture the straw should be this has been chopped with a food processor from wallmart after that picture is a picture of the straw after it is soaked and paced here is another picture of the straw pre soaking notice in the picture that the larger pieces of straw are right next to the finer pieces this is for comparison you do not want anything over pieces in fact powder straw is even better this will be pointed out when we get to the spawning section process add cups screened dung and cups vermiculite to each turkey tin we do turkey tins with this same ratio in each you also need your gallon of distilled water for this step as you can see the vermiculite and dung are piled in the turkey tin straw amount after being soaked and paced this is about the amount of straw you need i would say this is about a turkey tin full once it is laid out there is no ratio just fill a large bowl and soak the straw then when you pc it try and get about the amount in the picture below the key to this tek is speedy colonization straw contams hella fast so you want the straw to colonize asap the other principle of this is that you want the dung to soak up the extra water from the straw if you have overlay wet straw you will have microbes growing up the wazoo i purposely make my mix in the dung straw a little dry to soak up this extra straw water now take note that if you think this ratio seems a little too dry wait till it is pastuerized it is definitely the right ratio add quart distilled water or th gallon per turkey tin you want to mix this using gloves and make it light and fluffy and very soft it will be pea size particals just like your of mix but just add a little at a time you may add a little more water than a quart but a quart works perfectly of now one of the keys to this entire tek is this mix you have to make sure this mix is so light and fluffy it wants to float out of your hands you can use the drop squeeze between the finger method to make the moisture correct but this mix actually speeds the colonization look yummy all nice and shitty the shittier it looks the better had to add the ship humor this is what the mix should look like after you are done mixing by hand nice and fluffy it is very similar in moisture content as the pf jars that i explain how to make in this journal area brf the mixthis just explains a little more about moisture content the flushes with this tek are incredible and done need more than the correct moisture content the condensation that is created in these chambers is so high that it renourishes the water back into the substrate for post st flushes now place the thick large tin foil over the tray so that it is air tight make sure the type of foil you use is very wide so that it fits directly over the turkey tin and keeps all the moisture in now you have to pastuerize the dung very mix in the oven preheat your oven to degrees place the trays in your oven and cook them for hours at the temp may vary dpending on your oven but for the most part you want the inner temp of the mix to be about for a steady two hours i always cook them for hours but friends have had success with you can time this where you can start pcing the straw now it will take two hours so cooking time is perfect after the turkey tins are done cooking leave them in the oven to cool oversight here is a picture perfect example of the best shifty mix on earth please feel free to copy this picture to your desktop and print it for framing on your wall at home this is a snake cage lid for an aquarium you can get these at any pet store this is used to screen the dung also look in the archives for this from am processing dung now you must prep everything for spawning i usually run an air filter and spray disinfectant or ozium in the air you need a mask gloves pced spoon quarts of spawn and an extra tub for a mixing box clean your work area and prep all materials i use rubbing alcohol to clean each bin inside by hand then stuff the holes with fresh polyfil make sure you clean the top of the lid also because from here on out each lid stays on until the spawn is transferred from the mixing box into each chamber once the transfer is complete you dont open the bins again until it is time to case the polyfil allows enough fresh air and co buildup for the perfect spawn run the spawn run has always been no more than days with this tek if this doesnt happen you must have consumed something it will probably smell sour but that is a different lesson lets concentrate on the tek for now now i use gallon black plastic trashbags and open the bags halfway i then place them on the bottom of the chamber where the sides creep up the sides of the chamber once you place the plastic bag in the tub put the sterile lid on top pay close attention spawning must be done very quickly this is open air and you must not breathe on it so wear a mask the straw is also very vulnerable to contamination so we must use a lid on the mixing box use another trash bag lined in a quart bin for a mixing box make sure you rub the bin and lid down with alcholol before use then close the lid here it is in a nutshell rascally dump all turkey tins very quickly in the mixing box and then add the straw begin mixing the mix with your glove covered hands this mix will be light and fluffy and you want to make sure that you break up any clumps of straw make sure all the straw is completely covered by the dung also make sure the extra water is soaked up by the dunghere the straw and dung are jumped into the mixing box the mix is then mixed by hand consistency until it is almost the same texture as the previous mix you want this light and fluffy feel to it everytime works like a charm it is easier to do this with two people however you can do it alone just make sure everytime you are done mixing close the lid keep as little air exposure as possible to prevent contamination now you have to break up your quart spawn jars and dump them right on top of this mix now after that break up any seed that is stuck together by hand make sure each piece of wbs is broken up so that the spawn mixes better you then make a twisting and turning moition and make sure you get the bottom of the mix try and mix it to where the spawn looks evenly mixed throughout the entire dung straw look closely and you can see the little white dots in the mix this mix is almost done it looks very even and consistent another view of the mix another i stress these pictures because they are very important this is the final product and the mix is done finally transfer handfulls of the mix into each separate chamber in all the sub level should lineup just about an inch under where the polyfil holes are the depth is about inches spread the mix evenly and smoothly around the bottom of the chamber as if you were going to make a casing let this incubate somewhere dark for days then when it is fluffy whie it is time to case casing casing is prepared exactly like the dung very mix except the dung is substituted with coir then it is paced for hour this casing is the exact moisture content of all the mixes in this tek once you get this ratio down it is a breeze because it is rascally doing the same repetitiveness this is what the colonizes sub bed will look likeexplanation the problem many people have is the part where the casing comes in now ten stresses the fine ground straw because it mixes in perfectly and doesnt leave any big pieces of uncolonized straw to get consumed so the substrate should look like this in a few days the best part of the clear bins is that they allow you to see when the bed is colonizes before you give it air exposure incubation can be helped by placing a dark black plastic sheet over the bins or a sleeping bag once the spawn has been colonizes case it and incubate it for about more days sometimes the casing will colonize in days but is ideal after the casing has colonizes it will look like this on the outside of the chamber notice all that condensation it may look like too much but it isnt this plays a key role in the later flushes it actually has enough moisture for a few flushes without rehydrating between flushes now once the casing is colonizes just place the other sterile bin on top and let it sit in the light for about a week and you will begin to see pins and walla the final product also take note that this chamber has only been opened two times once to add casing and once to pick the fruits the top chamber is then replaced after picking if the casing is torn up patch small spots but done add any extra water you will fuck the environment notice the sides of the chamber this condensation is created it will build up and lower at the appropriate times of pinning fruiting and harvesting then repinning it is almost too perfect you dont have to do shit for all you lazy mofos out there go sit on the couch and rip the bong long rippas this entire process probably takes close to one month but it lasts at least months of fruiting if you play your cards right the average yield for these chambers is about of dry but it has been reported to have ll flushes dry from each tub so next time your friend says they know all this shit and try and run you into the ground you know you didnt do nearly as much work ll mature canopy see the suns rays it isnt advisable to have direct sunlight on the chamber this may raise the temps in the chamber use dim light but this is a nice little shot of the morning sun on the crop you can see in this picture how fluffy and white the casing is below the mushrooms look at the bottom left this is what the ideal casing looks like z strain oh yeah and just cause im a pro dont mean you cant do this the above pics are my first try at this tek and this is how i did it i hope you have enjoyed eat us how to ya ll come back now ya hear treasure coastall of these pictures are done using a double tub with polyfil inserted into holes that are drilled at level with the casing layer so that co expells the top tub is then placed over the bottom and has holes drilled near the top of that bin these are also filled with polyfil this creates air circulation in the tub without fanning these tubs are never fanned except when the mushrooms are harvester each tub consists of a dung straw mix that is spawned with wbs and then cased with sterilized coir verm the straw is paced and the dung is pasteurized in the oven the ratio is rascally turkey tins of dung verm ratio to every th polyeurothane bag of presaged his straw everything is done in open air with filters running and masks covering the mouth this mix usually makes about quart bins each picture above is a quart bin and the harvests yield from around ounces dry a flush depends on ratio mixtures genetics substrate depth casing depth and other factors but sometimes you get a ounce flush occasionally depending on the depth of the sub and casing generally these bins have a sub depth with a casing casing depths of sometimes produce pounds but this hasnt been a consistent result z strainmalabarupdate there are ways to get a full canopy flush using no casing layer here is an example of the entire process used to do this you need good genetics texan strain and tasmania strain are excellent and very consistently flush full canopy flushes even with multi spore regardless of substrates and ratios it is achievable but this is a simple method that foaf follows a word about cloninggrowing out a flush on your substrate then cloning directly from stem tissue via er tek cloning method using an osterizer blender is by far the fastest method add this method with tvcasualtys slurry in a hurry tek found at mycotopia net and you have as many jars as you want colonizes in days of a clone its quite simply amazing its best to grow your clone off the substrate your going to use multiply times then use this same substrate over and over and your grows can be maximized cloning can be done using this thing its called a shmuvbox invented by molester at the nook greatest invention of all time in this case i use a shmuvbox it is a hepa with a big clear trash bag over it you place all your clean tools fruits for cloning and beno torch to sterilize your blades in this bag usually i will wipe down every single part of this hepa with rubbing all be canal spray it with disinfecting spray this thing will pour plates and take clones easily holmes brand hepa filters with a small ionizer built in are a great size you only need a small room size filter and it should be around at walmart once you put the bag around the filter tape it down to the table your working on this will in turn allow the bag to stay put now blow your bag up that has all your cooled utensils and sterile equipment in it turn on the hepa and when it blows up cut two holes in it for your hands one for each and if you cant find large lawn bags for the bag you can cut eye holes as well this produces positive air pressure and forces out the bad stuff its real simple clones can be taken and it stores nicely its efficient and takes up little space and hides easily you can also just do all this work in front of a flowhood or in a glovebox or whatever you use for sterile work materials big bowl strawnet vermiculite coco fiber quarts spawn iris liter storage bins press n seal

for looking out for the community a great service you are providing . i see a lot of people not doing . thanks for this tek its great i plan on giving it a try soon a couple questions first i have needle sizes g and g will the g be too big and damage the rubber stopper on the cap after repeated use it looks like quite a big needle and will the g be too small and get clogged up from any dissolved particles or should the stal dissolve enough to always pass through the g needle also give got some ethanol from a chemistry lab but i have heard that they add something to lab grace ethanol to stop people drinking it will this addition effect the lsd molecule at all i dont plan on using these vials with a dropper only for lays however i do have grey goose so maybe that is a better alternative thanks . quote from treebean on march amalso give got some ethanol from a chemistry lab but i have heard that they add something to lab grace ethanol to stop people drinking it will this addition effect the lsd molecule at all i dont plan on using these vials with a dropper only for lays however i do have grey goose so maybe that is a better alternative thanksthere is another member who can give you a much better response than i but i will take a shot grey goose being water ethanol is best for liquid using a high proof alcohol such as moonshine or graves grain alcohol which is ethan water would be best for making sheets as it would evaporate much quicker . quote from treebean on march amalso give got some ethanol from a chemistry lab but i have heard that they add something to lab grace ethanol to stop people drinking it in my country ethanol sold from chemical lab suppliers is pure ethan absolute alcohol non denatured ethanol for lab testing also there is also a neutral dehydrated anhydrous ethanol i do not think the remaining to or percent ingredients would cause some nasty side effect though you will only use a few milliliters not to drink it as an aperitifi think youre talking about natured alcohol also called methylated spirits is ethan that has additives to make it poisonous somewhat bad tasting foul smelling or nauseating to discourage recreation consumption in some cases it is also dyed natured alcohol is used as a solvent and as fuel for alcohol burners and camping stoves because of the diversity of industrial uses for natured alcohol hundreds of additives and denaturing methods have been used the main additive has untraditionally been methanol giving rise to the term methylated spirits other typical additives include isopropyl alcohol acetone methyl ethyl ketone methyl isobutyl ketone and denatonium . a cheap flexible plastic glovebox and inert gas can do the same thing you can get the glovebox for and it is reliable you dont have to replace the tops either a tank of gas lasts a long time too it all depends on how many you are making .
