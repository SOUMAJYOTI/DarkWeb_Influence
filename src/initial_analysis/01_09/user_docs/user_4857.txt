burning tails on a cd rather than a us where youre not using persistance at least as i understand it will prevent or reduce the possibility of certain exploits . i know that tails is something to have for tor do any of you think other services like vpns are a good idea to add in for extra security ive been trying to look up if there are possible ways for going on websites that may use javascript through tor without leaking info like my in etc any tips info . yeah i got tails up and running only thing that sucks is that there are a ton of sites you cant use due to javascript etc it would be nice to run tor then a vpn or proxies seems like cloudflare blocks tor as well . i here you it does suck theres so many times that folks around here share a youtube link or something of the like that in love to check out but nope its not safe then other times in love to check it out on the clearnet later but never do due to healthy paranoia some of the links people share are in my opinion way to specific or niche for me to feel safe checking them out i remember reading somewhere that simply downloading tor software may land a person on a list not that most of us would be of interest anyway but at the sametime i dont think dragnet browser fingerprinting or something of that nature is beyond the scope of the enemy but im no expert sometimes i have to disable js just for a second though in order to use a couple essential sites hate it but dont know what else to do i definitely feel your pain there was a post on r darknetmarkets yesterday with a length and information discussion about approches to vpn tor if you can wade through the reddit bullshit p clearnet link . i highly reccomend this thread from evilzone if you decide to do something illegal on the internet the people on that forum really know their shit always keep your browser up to date problem is that the feds are heavily buying day exploits wich might be a disaster if you are not being carefull or you get too big .

quit this cold turkey i thought i was doing pretty good then the past day or two i have started noticing negative thinking that ive been able to just shrug off has been back for hours at a time its back into the thought mode of everything is useless and it all leads to nothing even though i know its wrong i just cant get it out my head most of the time yeah right now im not even worried about tripping i may microdose though i feel that microdosing might get the gears going in my head perhaps led might work since i do feel like my brain is cloudy for the past couple weeks have any of you had that its making work a bit difficult cause it feels like my brain is empty but him im going to take what you said and start looking into making sure these substances wont further draw me down a deeper hole with withdrawal i just have been doing very good tapering off i thought i was good i cant tell you how much i fucking hate anti depressants for some people it can be a blessing but im not a fan the only thing i liked about it is that i was able to have closed eye visuals which i no longer have not sure if its due to stopping the anti depressants or the lack that i havent got a filter for my water supply and have been taking in flourish dardush i will look into sang meetings never heard about those but i will see if there are any near my area . i would be wary about distinguishing about actual withdrawal and the fact that you probably started to psychologically rely on them to function so that when you quit it is hard to function dependence of a different kind i cant say i would recommend taking orator everyday if you switch up the strains and mix them the tolerance built is eligible however taking it everyday you can become addicted and you will face real withdrawal from that i would recommend not taking a single psychoactive to combat it try to deal with it with the help of friends and meditation it may be hard but i think its the only way otherwise you will risk becoming dependent on one thing or another best of luck brother . dafunkfuzz im trying to just take kratom on really bad days and on other days some kava i have taken alot of kratom before have always been able to quit cold turkey give never had withdrawals of any kind besides anti depressants i guess the way i look at trying to use psychedelics to help my problem is a way to get back to baseline as quickly as possible sort of like when you take steroids after your done with the cycle you take pct in order to get everything back to normal asap this is the way i think about psychedelics not doing full trips but small microdoses just to get my system jump started cause right now i feel brain dead i am getting back into meditation but i cant lie its been a huge struggle since i still cant clear my mind of the past regrets future worries i also cut off rascally all my friends so in also stuck in an extremely lonely spot which further intensifies my negative thoughts i may just go to a local coffee place and do some drawings in order to hopefully meet some people but in my current state its hard to hold conversations and i tried drawing the other day and all i could do is circles and got frustrated scroat some of what you describe is why i dont like all these prescription meds one doctor said to me that they dont know exactly how anti depressants work and that they just throw one after another to see how it works this is what worried the fuck out of me here on one hand they are saying psychedelics are horrible drugs that should be avoided at all costs yet they are also telling me they dont know exactly how these drugs they are giving me work but are telling me to take it anyways ive also seen other friends or people i knew that have been on meds for years still have major problems they still have their problems with meds yet without the meds they would be worse kinda like they never confront the cause of their problems cause they rely on meds banana jack i actually have been eating cacao not cocoa nibs i also got back on taking more vitamins and bought an eraser marker board so everyday i have a checklist of how many exercises i need to do and by the end of the day i want all the marks erased sadly i think the closed eye visuals are done with but i will see once i get my filters back in and flourish chlorine is cut out of my water supply again if it brings it back that along with meditation if it is from the prescriptions then that is the side effect i really loved music is also starting to not sound as good but then at night it sounded to almost get that cb sound to it so i think my senses are going a bit haywire what i will say about this horrible experience is that it did shock my brain you ever read about those types of events where a person has an accident or whatever it practically changes their personality that is what i felt like has happened to me it took me till just a few days ago to realizethat my personality is almost to the point as how i am on lsd i still have a few ways to go but man i wish i could of been like this for a while oh well at least i actually am reaching this point i just talked to a few people this weekend who said they realized a lot of the same things but it took them well into their late s early s to find that out i do thank all of you for helping me out give tried some social support but honestly most of the people i talked to have had the same generic horrible advice while they dont mean anything in a bad way none of it is helpful its always the same its all in your mind get over it you need to be like this this or that if i could do it so can you etc i really wish there was more i could do to help all of you out only thing i can say is that if i ever strike it rich or win the lotto i m gon a be like oprah in this bitch and starting tossing out bitcoins to everyone in the community then with my luck one of you will be some fed s my bitcoins will get tied to you and i will spend the rest of my life in jail lol besides that tmg rocks it truly does . i had a friend that was on a varying cocktail of anti depressants and anti psychotics throughout the time i knew him a few times he tried to go off them he do good for a while then eventually he slip up and end up with his shoes on his hands babbling on about he was the st century moses this is not an exaggeration this very scenario actually happened he been on wellbutrin since he was years old but i didnt meet him until he was around maybe it was the drugs he had been on that caused the trouble in the first place maybe he really needed them but one thing was for sure if he went off his meds he would be a wreck within months one of the things that really helped him was to stop smoking weed it really exacerbated a lot of the problems he was having and hes actually doing well now working on a masters degree he wasnt schizophrenic he was polar nowadays hes found a a good combination of meds that actually work and done make him into a zombie going through this ordeal with him was what convinced me that these drugs do actually have some benefit to some people the biggest issue i have with them is that it took his doctors years to get the right combination for him all the while hes suffering trying to keep his head on straight with many of his problems being amplified or added to by the effective drugs he was being given it was like the doctors didnt even care that he was essentially a vegetable for months or that some batch of meds was making him feel like offing himself after going through this with him i learned that these drugs can help some people but the doctors that prescribe them need to be a lot more careful and attentive with what effects they are having on their patient what i really took away from all this was finding the right doctor is crucial especially if you have mental issues i know that i fit the bill for a number of disorders and some shifty doctors would likely dose me right up and many many normal folks if they started acting out but most people keep a lid on their insanity just enough to keep up appearances your not so different man and i wish you the best with your current struggle i only ask that if you feel yourself slipping into the void that you reach out to someone that can help find an understanding doctor there are a handful of public psychedelic communities and ill bet you can find a doctor among their ranks i still haven found a doctor i can really trust not any fault of theirs just there rent too many people that understand the sorts of things we do here shit even pm me if you want in no doctor but give been around it enough to know whats up best of luck friend . you should be in the time frame when negative symptoms are more frequent depending how you tapered you may have crossed a threshold dose and now your body realizes it does not have enough it is going to not be fun i am sorry your mood will be worse because of physical reasons can not avoid it not sure if microdosing with any psychedelics would help your mood receptors will still be blocked but why not try no negatives except cost you should even be able to take a larger amount with no effect if wanted if you think it helps it may dark chocolate seems to have potential in small daily amounts several studies came out can get the less professed kind with less sugar saw in another thread you were getting hppd like symptoms in january was that the closed eye visuals you no longer get quote from dafunkfuzz on april ami would be

dont like all these prescription meds one doctor said to me that they dont know exactly how anti depressants work and that they just throw one after another to see how it works this is what worried the fuck out of me here on one hand they are saying psychedelics are horrible drugs that should be avoided at all costs yet they are also telling me they dont know exactly how these drugs they are giving me work but are telling me to take it anyways ive also seen other friends or people i knew that have been on meds for years still have major problems they still have their problems with meds yet without the meds they would be worse kinda like they never confront the cause of their problems cause they rely on meds banana jack i actually have been eating cacao not cocoa nibs i also got back on taking more vitamins and bought an eraser marker board so everyday i have a checklist of how many exercises i need to do and by the end of the day i want all the marks erased sadly i think the closed eye visuals are done with but i will see once i get my filters back in and flourish chlorine is cut out of my water supply again if it brings it back that along with meditation if it is from the prescriptions then that is the side effect i really loved music is also starting to not sound as good but then at night it sounded to almost get that cb sound to it so i think my senses are going a bit haywire what i will say about this horrible experience is that it did shock my brain you ever read about those types of events where a person has an accident or whatever it practically changes their personality that is what i felt like has happened to me it took me till just a few days ago to realizethat my personality is almost to the point as how i am on lsd i still have a few ways to go but man i wish i could of been like this for a while oh well at least i actually am reaching this point i just talked to a few people this weekend who said they realized a lot of the same things but it took them well into their late s early s to find that out i do thank all of you for helping me out give tried some social support but honestly most of the people i talked to have had the same generic horrible advice while they dont mean anything in a bad way none of it is helpful its always the same its all in your mind get over it you need to be like this this or that if i could do it so can you etc i really wish there was more i could do to help all of you out only thing i can say is that if i ever strike it rich or win the lotto i m gon a be like oprah in this bitch and starting tossing out bitcoins to everyone in the community then with my luck one of you will be some fed s my bitcoins will get tied to you and i will spend the rest of my life in jail lol besides that tmg rocks it truly does . been about weeks of tapering off i didnt quit this cold turkey i thought i was doing pretty good then the past day or two i have started noticing negative thinking that ive been able to just shrug off has been back for hours at a time its back into the thought mode of everything is useless and it all leads to nothing even though i know its wrong i just cant get it out my head most of the time yeah right now im not even worried about tripping i may microdose though i feel that microdosing might get the gears going in my head perhaps led might work since i do feel like my brain is cloudy for the past couple weeks have any of you had that its making work a bit difficult cause it feels like my brain is empty but him im going to take what you said and start looking into making sure these substances wont further draw me down a deeper hole with withdrawal i just have been doing very good tapering off i thought i was good i cant tell you how much i fucking hate anti depressants for some people it can be a blessing but im not a fan the only thing i liked about it is that i was able to have closed eye visuals which i no longer have not sure if its due to stopping the anti depressants or the lack that i havent got a filter for my water supply and have been taking in flourish dardush i will look into sang meetings never heard about those but i will see if there are any near my area . you might want to play some high adrenaline sport which requires lot of running i dont know how much it may help you but whenever i feel depressed for more than days i go out and run and make myself busy playing football it help trusts me i have been through some shifty time emotional over the past couple of years or so when my long time girl left me i went into serve depression i was hooked onto ssris for more than year and got addicted to opiates i had to fight the pain off but once i took to the field things started to take a positive turn i lost some kilos i had become oversight kilos for a guy is oversight i also have stop smoking cannabis regularly been a smoker for years it had become a liability i had started to suffer from cannabis related anxiety as well i personally think canaris isnt fun if smoked regularly spare it for tripping or in combination with folly quitting weed charas helped me immensely as well to get out of this depressed phase and of course hitting the field and running my ass off cutting off from friends i hear you on that one bro actually im in the same boat all my so called friends are working outside i dont have someone i can call friend here totally as well many have moved on to better lifes those who havent usually done interact also being a drug geek here in a conservative society doesnt help apart from little work i have i daily give hours in the field and this way i also meet new people spending some time outside exercising is immense for anyone suffering from depression and sex trust me it helps pop a cb pill and enjoy the ride cheer up bud . you should be in the time frame when negative symptoms are more frequent depending how you tapered you may have crossed a threshold dose and now your body realizes it does not have enough it is going to not be fun i am sorry your mood will be worse because of physical reasons can not avoid it not sure if microdosing with any psychedelics would help your mood receptors will still be blocked but why not try no negatives except cost you should even be able to take a larger amount with no effect if wanted if you think it helps it may dark chocolate seems to have potential in small daily amounts several studies came out can get the less professed kind with less sugar saw in another thread you were getting hppd like symptoms in january was that the closed eye visuals you no longer get quote from dafunkfuzz on april ami would be wary about distinguishing about actual withdrawal and the fact that you probably started to psychologically rely on them to function so that when you quit it is hard to function dependence of a different kind quote from scroat on april pmafter going through this with him i learned that these drugs can help some people but the doctors that prescribe them need to be a lot more careful and attentive with what effects they are having on their patient what i really took away from all this was finding the right doctor is crucial especially if you have mental issues your long term mental balance can not be helped with substances for most people if you have a major organic disorder can be another case this is an endless train ride with many changes take the train where you need to go and get off rely on social support . you might want to play some high adrenaline sport which requires lot of running i dont know how much it may help you but whenever i feel depressed for more than days i go out and run and make myself busy playing football it help trusts me i have been through some shifty time emotional over the

for anyone suffering from depression and sex trust me it helps pop a cb pill and enjoy the ride cheer up bud . scroat i dont know if i came off as saying meds never work that want my intention cause i know that some people shouldnt even go anywhere near psychedelics for many reasons i agree with you on many things especially the culture part ive tried explaining it to people as to how am i the crazy one in this culture when i was him somewhere lets say i was very frustrated that the doctors were giving me false information that only put the blame on psychedelics which i damn well knew was not the damn problem you know that our values are sucked when the crazy person is telling the mental health professionals that i dont want to watch tv cause i find it to be non stimulating to my mind and the fact that they are showing jerry springer shows makes absolutely hero sense to me i done understand why watching horrible ship tv shows are a better alternative over book reading they said i was a drug addict and psychedelics would ruin my life i said no psychedelics wont ruin my life the prohibitionist laws are what will ruin my life i can do lsd mushrooms dmt and hold jobs relationships etc its these ship laws people and sucked culture values that will be the end of me i even had to explain to the doctors how psychedelics have no addictive tendencies to them ok i know everything be addictive but you know what i mean i said i have no withdrawal symptoms im not craving any lsd mushrooms dmt alcohol etc its just a shifty person that fucked me really bad but they just kept saying nope it has to be psychedelics cause they are illegal ll wtf sorry i got off on a story right there i just hate the laziness now a days from people and their strongly held preconceptions of things no matter what evidence is shown well i learned not to give a fuck anymore about changing peoples minds in just trying to get off my anti depressants cause they really havent done shit besides give me more side effects i know what causes my depression i know that no drug psychedelic prescription can fix it the only person that can fix it is me but what i will say is that for me at least prescriptions work in dumbing the senses down so you dont focus on the problems but thats the huge problem of it all your just a slave to the pills at that point cause now you think they are what helps you which some people may need but i dont i really love having these talks with all of you i cant imagine the day when we can freely talk about this in public . i know what youre saying theres a lot of doctors that dont know their head from a hole in the ground it was shocking to see how flippancy they gave my friend various meds and then just told him to come back in a few months motherfucker he might off himself in a few months hes not a fucking lab rat they even gave him risperidol the shit that made guys grow books fortunately this didnt happen to my friend but it had other awful side effects however i feel very strongly about this subject and its because my mind was changed by personal experience my friend could not handle his shit for more than a month or if he wasnt taking his meds and i was his closest friend during these couple years i watched him try smoking weed and eating shrooms for the first time and the changes it wrought in him after about months of it it wasnt good i encouraged him numerous times to go off his meds to get healthy and every time he would decend into madness within a couple months maybe if he had managed his eating and health better it would have helped maybe we may not perfectly understand how these subatances work but one thing is for sure for some people they do work and i personally believe theres no shame in taking them if they do help if they improve your life for my friend its the only way he can keep from believing that cars are following him that government agents are trying to kill him or that god himself is calling him to be the moses of the st century give stood by his side as he tried every other way he could to live a happy life and after years of seeing this first hand my mind was changed the right combo really did turn him from a babbling madman to a normal guy i know that many people use these subatances as a crutch as with many other substances it is a shame when people go to their doctor for help are given a pill and told this will make it all better and they just go about their lives never fixing or facing what actually ails them i heard a really interesting quote earlier today it had to do with the dynamic between teachers and kids something along the lines of when kids act out in class are hyperactive disruptive etc its generally accepted that they need to conform to the system they are placed in to be like the other kids and just do what theyre told even if that takes meds to accomplish whos to say its not the system thats broken how come we never question the system that kids are put into what if their acting out is just a symptom of a system problem with how we structure society im certain that it is the world is broken and many of the systems we have in place are the cause of many social and personal ills a lot of mental health care is directed at fixing the natural reactions of people to our sucked up world and that bothers me deeply especially when people cant understand that ive also come to understand that a certain degree of conformity is necessary to appease those who would if they knew the depth of our loathing for some of the sucked up structures that govern our world seek to poison our conscousness we need to fight the good fight buck the power structures of this world and do everything we can to awaken poeple to the great power they have inside themselves to connect those who have peered beyond the veil and create a network of poeple who operate based on love however if you cant keep your head on straight what good are you going to do anyone i dont know you or your situation but i do have a bit of experience with mental illness psychadelics and the opinions common to people in our shoes i wish you all the best and if you can handle your shit off meds more power to you get over that hump and live happy all i want to say is that if they help you theres no shame on taking them bless you brother . i know what youre saying theres a lot of

brother i trust you know whats right for you sorry if i came off too strong i just know that theres a widely held belief that i personally used to hold that these drugs are only a method of control used by the state and everyone on them would be better off without through some very hard lessons i have learned that they are simply drugs that when used properly can be helpful but when wantonly distributed by ignorant doctors cause innumerable suffering often piled on to currrent suffering the other side of this is that i know someone who did successfully buck what doctors were telling him and became very successful in life at one point he was hearing voices and would stay up for days on end completely sober he got off all the meds doctors were giving him and learned to harness whatever was in him to drive him in life what youre describing seems much milder than what my friends have gone through and im sorry if i came off too preach in your case it might be beneficial to keep quiet about the psychadelics at least to the doctors one avenue you might consider checking out is examine i know were not allowed to trade it on this board but i feel it is appropriate in this case to discuss it as there is significant research into using it to treat depression it has effects unlike any other anti expressive medication in that it works nearly instantly to relieve many symptoms of depression and the effects can last for months after a single dose im not advocating for blowing lines of k all day every day but i see no issue with occasional use i personally tend to do a bit too much k if i have it its really the only drug ive done where my use exceeded what i would have proffered so treat it with respect for its power but done discount it altogether as it has unique benifits in certain settings heres a great article about it if you google ketamine depression youll find a wealth of information about it including clinics where doctors will administer thereputic doses tailor for depression . i feel you knuckles i have always liked to dabble with xanax and about months ago i got some powder from a dnm its so ridiculous cheap that i just went for it i ended up taking it for the better part of that month period but started to get some side effects that were not very pleasant i felt it was in my best interest to quit but benzo withdrawl is pretty damn awful i tried to self administer a taper and i suppose it did the trick but man was it uncomfortable about days of sleepless nights headaches sweating random and feeling generally frizzled i made sure to start exercising which ive seen you started it really does help cleanse the body a bit and improves the mood mine at least the microdosing of ketamine does seem like it may help but the bladder issues can be detriment have you tried micro dosing mxe since it lasts longer and was created with the intention of being a ketamine replacement the chemist who created it used ketamine for his own medical needs and seemed to help him out although his issue was more physiological other than whats been recommended here all good thoughtful responses i would just try to be as healthy as possible take vitamins drink plenty of water and perhaps some melatonin for sleep would be helpful melatonin is a wonderful anti oxidant as well so that may eliminate some free radicals left over from the opioid use good luck man it shouldnt last much longer and then you will be free of the opiate shackles sending vibes your way . a substance that causes both instant and long term mental relief with a measurable recreation use

came in from drinking all week and complained about feeling more depressed than usual part of that is limiting substances they have not been tested besides ones they know have negative effects this

dissociatives trigger more diverse types of receptors than psychedelics each have different methods of action and done profiles in every way not sure if micah dosing would work if it even does with psychedelics maybe psychedelics work can not see the success rate being much higher than antidepressants but with a huge decrease in negative effects your condition may be severe enough to try est if

a young man and his family and to think someone can be proud of that well the goal is to scare you put someone in jail because thats a way to create a jail in the consciousness of the people outside authoritarianism accepts many ideologies . well this is no different than isis executing people for having different beliefs its just wrapped in a nice package called the law of a free country he was

notorious online marketplace for the sale of heroin butt plugs lsd and other illegal drugs was sentenced to life in prison on friday in federal district court in manhattan mr ulbricht was sentenced by the judge katherine b forrest for his role as what prosecutors described as the kingpin of a worldwide digital drug trafficking enterprise mr ulbricht had faced a minimum of years in prison on one of the counts for which he was convicted in handing down a much longer sentence judge forrest told mr urlbricht that what you did in connection with silk road was terribly destructive to our social fabric mr ulbricht s high teach drug bazaar was novel and full of intrigue operating in a hidden part of the internet known as the dark web which allowed deals to be made anonymously and out of the reach of law enforcement in silk road s nearly three years of operation over million transactions were carried out on the website involving several thousand seller accounts and more than buyer accounts the authorities have said transactions were paid for using the virtual currency bitcoin and mr ulbricht operating under the pseudonym dread pirate roberts took in millions of dollars in

brilliant scientist there are very few people like him maybe in k or even k leonard pickard is another brilliant man whose services to our society will go unfulfilled ross could be doing more work on thin film solar other projects that can save our planet and help mankind and as for the message they are sending reflectively they are saying that ross is worse than charles manson because manson has been eligible for parole for a while now he gets hearings once in a while but doesnt get it because hes a psychopath and danger to society you can conceivably believe that ross if offered a parole hearing in yr would work his ass off making amends and educating other prisoners etc to get it and wouldnt reoffend oth all leaders of revolutionary movements usually spend long amounts of time in prison look at nelson mandela he was a terrorist for the right reasons a militant for sure he did or and became president of sa i hope ross can see how this could be his time to live in exile and refine his revolution because he is a smart motherfucker i think he made many dumb mistakes like allowing selling come or fentanyl keeping logs records of every transaction ever on the site not quitting after dhs visited him over the fake ids not trying the land passage to canada mexico best way to flee us by far not to mention running a market in a public library after being under surveillance for days straight he had a tail following him at all times etc if he had been on a rooftop alone he could have checked the laptop if he been in portland ore he could have used city wide wifi if he been in tijuana he could have been untouchable he took it too far the dude played a gangster on the interest very different from real life gangsters ive met them and ross would piss himself in some places ive been or not my prediction is that in yr sr will be old news a curiosity and he will be set free until then stay safe ross one more thing i am sick of all the people saying he is going to get buttered this is silly that stuff happens more to certain groups in state prisons more often than federal penitentiaries prison does suck but he documented what he did and it did legitimize bitcoin so he is still a major inspiration for some people and cognitive liberty dont do what he did people . imagine now take ross and times him by how many people that are in jail for long sentences or even life over drug use or even small sales i cant imagine being in prison for having led weed dmt etc remember kids drugs ruin your life and if you can live a normal life we will make sure we ruin your life murica the freedom guy these prohibition laws are so sucked just in my city alone give seen killers rapists child molesters get more lenient sentences than people selling weed . to those folks worried about js being enabled on mem i vend there and just want to clear something up something no one is mentioning is that at least for me the enable javascript check box on

that but with these ddos attacks are they take overs for servers i always thought enabling js was a huge no no im not a security guy so i dont know if this is really just a do protection or if its some other way to track users i completely fail to understand how nailing js can do anything to blunt a do attack when middle earth was originally launched the site required js to function the admin hobbitt was told point blank that this was a non starter that anyone with even a modicum of security savvy would avoid the site as a result the admin stuck to his guns and insisted that the javascript on his site was safe some time later he finally gave in and allowed logins without js it would appear he may have changed his mind again using the ddos attacks as an excuse to once again require js i just tried logging in without js and now get the error message dos protect please enable js in browser my only response to that would be no sucking way in hell in my opinion this raises a huge red flag over the site better to walk away even if it means losing some coins better to lose some coins business and remain free than wind up in a jail cell there is precedent for feds taking over sites and pulling shit like this in an attempt to id the users spitfire . to those folks worried about js being enabled on mem i vend there and just want to clear something up something no one is mentioning

fighter such as ross ulbricht in the process . judge forrest told mr ulbricht that what you did in connection with silk road was terribly destructive to our social fabric year more destructive than sending men with guns and badges to kidnap people and throw them into rape cages for years on end because they had a plant or chemical safer than most over the counter meds being sane in an insane world means were all doomed or blessed with a certain degree of alienation and persecution by the mad rulers of our time remember this is the kali yuga . judge forrest told mr ulbricht that what you

can t imagine being in prison for having led weed dmt etc remember kids drugs ruin your life and if you can live a normal life we will make sure we ruin your life murica the freedom guy these prohibition laws are so sucked just in my city alone i ve seen killers rapists child molesters get more lenient sentences than people selling weed . imagine now take ross and times him by how many

enable javascript check box on the log in page is completely rational lol i have yet to click it and have stopped and ended there no worries any of you folks try logging in without checking that box if you mean the new message that appears before the log in screen on the top of your otherwise blank loading pages saying something like dos protect enable js well i just ignored that too and my forbid scripts globablly button on my browser remains actuated hope to see you there if you can t reach me here and you will find other friendly positive vendors of led c b and mdma etc there too have fun stay safe and much love morninglight . the cost to society is huge not only from the million it will cost to imprison ross but because he is brilliant scientist there are very few people like him maybe in k or even k leonard pickard is another brilliant man whose services to our society will go unfulfilled ross could be doing more work on thin film solar other projects that can save our planet and help mankind and as for the message they are sending reflectively they are saying that ross is worse than charles manson because manson has been eligible for parole for a while now he gets hearings once in a while but doesnt get it because hes a psychopath and danger to society you can conceivably believe that ross if offered a parole hearing in yr would work his ass off making amends and educating other prisoners etc to get it and wouldnt reoffend oth all leaders of revolutionary movements usually spend long amounts of time in prison look at nelson mandela he was a terrorist for the right reasons a militant for sure he did or and became president of sa i hope ross can see how this could be his time to live in exile and refine his revolution because he is a smart motherfucker i think he made many dumb mistakes like allowing selling come or fentanyl keeping logs records of every transaction ever on the site not quitting after dhs visited him over the fake ids not trying the land passage to canada mexico best way to flee us by far not to mention running a market in a public library after being under surveillance for days straight he had a tail following him at all times etc if he had been on a rooftop alone he could have checked the laptop if he been in portland ore he could have used city wide wifi if he been in tijuana he could have been untouchable he took it too far the dude played a gangster on the interest very different from real life gangsters ive met them and ross would piss himself in some places ive been or not my prediction is that in yr sr will be old news a curiosity and he will be set free until then stay safe ross one more thing i am sick of all the people saying he is going to get buttered this is silly that stuff happens more to certain groups in state prisons more often than federal penitentiaries prison does suck but he documented what he did and it did legitimize bitcoin so he is still a major inspiration for some people and cognitive liberty dont do what he did people . quote from knuckles on may pmehh i just went to go log on to middle earth its the nd site today that i ve seenthat want s to enable js i haven t done that but with these ddos attacks are they take overs for servers i always thought enabling js was a huge no no i m not a security guy so i don t know if this is really just a do protection or if its some other way to track users i completely fail to understand how nailing js can do anything to blunt a do attack when middle earth was originally launched the site required js to function the admin hobbitt was told point blank that this was a non starter that anyone with even a modicum of security savvy would avoid the site as a result the admin stuck to his guns and insisted that the javascript on his site was safe some time later he finally gave in and allowed logins without js it would appear he may have changed his mind again using the ddos attacks as an excuse to once again require js i just tried logging in without js and now get the error message dos protect please enable js in browser my only response to that would be no sucking way in hell in my opinion this raises a huge red flag over the site better to walk away even if it means losing some coins better to lose some coins business and remain free than wind up in a jail cell there is precedent for feds taking over sites and pulling shit like this in an attempt to id the users spitfire . quote from knuckles on may pmehh i just went to go log on to middle earth its the nd site today that ive seenthat wants to enable js

with tails or using whonix or a similar system it wouldn t be possible to deanonymise you with javascript but who knows and some users still run tub in their usual insecure os so better safe than sorry better keep javascript disabled in all circumstances if you have founds to get out of that market though a whonix like system or better yet physical isolation is probably what would be needed to do so with the maximum amount of risk still worth it to try to login with javascript disabled in both torbutton noscript and the browser itsel stay safe friends . year seriously ml you never know if

chapter those who are on tiptoes can not stand those who straddle can not walk those who flaunt themselves are not clear those who presume themselves are not distinguished those who praise themselves have no merit those who boast about themselves do not last those with the tao call such things leftover food or tumors they despise them thus those who possesses the tao do not engage in them chapter there is something formless created born before heaven and earth so silent so ethereal independent and changeless circulating and ceaseless it can be regarded as the mother of the world i do not know its name identifying it i call it to forced to describe it i call it great great means passing passing means receding receding means returning therefore the tao is great heaven is great earth is great the sovereign is also great there are four greats in the universe and the sovereign occupies one of them humans follow the laws of earth earth follows the laws of heaven heaven follows the laws of tao tao follows the laws of nature chapter heaviness is the root of lightness quietness is the master of restlessness therefore the sages travel an entire day without leaving the heavy supplies even though there are luxurious sights they are composed and transcend beyond how can the lords of ten thousand chariots apply themselves lightly to the world to be light is to lose one s root to be restless is to lose one s mastery chapter good traveling does not leave tracks good speech does not seek faults good reckoning does not use counters good closure needs no bar and yet can not be opened good knot needs no rope and yet can not be untied therefore sages often save others and so do not abandon anyone they often save things and so do not abandon anything this is called following enlightenment therefore the good person is the teacher of the bad person the bad person is the resource of the good person those who do not value their teachers and do not love their resources although intelligent they are greatly confused this is called the essential wonder chapter know the masculine hold to the feminine be the watercourse of the world being the watercourse of the world the eternal virtue does not depart return to the state of the infant know the white hold to the black be the standard of the world being the standard of the world the eternal virtue does not deviate return to the state of the boundless know the honor hold to the humility be the valley of the world being the valley of the world the eternal virtue shall be sufficient return to the state of plain wood plain wood splits then becomes tools the sages utilize them and then become leaders thus the greater whole is undivided chapter those who wish to take the world and control it i see that they can not succeed the world is a sacred instrument one can not control it the one who controls it will fail the one who grasps it will lose because all things either lead or follow either blow hot or cold either have strength or weakness either have ownership or take by force therefore the sage eliminates extremes eliminates excess eliminates arrogance chapter the one who uses the tao to advise the ruler does not dominate the world with soldiers such methods tend to be returned the place where the troops camp thistles and thorns grow following the great army there must be an unsuspicious year a good commander achieves result then stops and does not dare to reach for domination achieves result but does not brag achieves result but does not flaunt achieves result but is not arrogant achieves result but only out of necessity achieves result but does not dominate things become strong and then get old this is called contrary to the tao that which is contrary to the tao soon ends chapter a strong military a tool of misfortune all things detest it therefore those who possess the tao avoid it honorable gentlemen while at home value the left when deploying the military value the right the military is a tool of misfortune not the tool of honorable gentlemen when using it out of necessity calm detachment should be above all victorious but without glory those who glorify are delighting in the killing those who delight in killing can not achieve their ambitions upon the world auspicious events favor the left unsuspicious events favor the right the lieutenant general is position to the

chaoticwhen people have many clever tricksmore strange things occurthe more laws are postedthe more robbers and thieves there aretherefore the sage says i take attached action and the people transform

scathingincorruptible without being piercingstraightforward without being ruthlessilluminated without being flashychapter in governing people and serving heaventhere is nothing like conservationonly with conservation is it called submitting earlysubmitting early is called emphasis on accumulating virtuesaccumulating virtues means there is nothing one can not overcomewhen there is nothing that one can not overcomeones limits are unknownthe limitations being unknown one can possess sovereigntywith this mother principle of power one can be everlastingthis is called deep roots and firm

powerits gods do not harm peoplenot only do its gods not harm peoplethe sages also do not harm peoplethey both do no harm to one anotherso virtue merges and returnschapter the large country is like the lowest riverthe converging point of the worldthe receptive female of the worldthe female always overcomes the male with serenityusing serenity as the lower positionthus if the large country is lower than the small countrythen it can take the small countryif the small country is lower than the large countrythen it can be taken by the large countrythus one uses the lower position to takethe other uses the lower position to be taketh large country only wishes to gather and protect peoplethe small country only wishes to join and serve peopleso that both obtain what they wishthe larger one should assume the lower positionchapter the tao is the wonder of all thingsthe treasure of the kind personthe protection of the unkind personadmirable words can win the publics respectadmirable actions can improve peoplethose who are unkindhow can they be abandoned therefore when crowning the emperorand installing the three ministersalthough there is the offering of jade before four horsesnone of it can compare to being seated in this taowhy did the ancients value this tao so much is it not said that those who seek will find and those with guilt will not be vaulted therefore it is the greatest value in the worldchapter act without actionmanage without meddlingtaste without tastinggreat small many fewrespond to hatred with virtueplan difficult tasks through the simplest tasksachieve large tasks through the smallest tasksthe difficult tasks of the worldmust be handled through the simple tasksthe large tasks of the worldmust be handled through the small taskstherefore sages never attempt great deeds all through lifethus they can achieve greatnessone who makes promises lightly must deserve little trustone who sees many easy tasks must encounter much difficultytherefore sages regard things as difficultso they never encounter difficulties all through lifechapter when it is peaceful it is easy to maintainwhen it shows no signs it is easy to plan when it is frail it is easy to breakwhen it is small it is easy to scatteract on it when it has not yet begun treat it when it is not yet chaotic tree thick enough to embracegrows from the tiny saplinga tower of nine levelsstarts from the dirt heapa journey of a thousand milesbegins beneath the seethe one who meddles will failthe one who grasps will losetherefore sages do not meddle and thus do not failthey do not grasp and thus do not losepeople in handling affairsoften come close to completion and failif they are as careful in the end as the beginningthen they would have no failuretherefore sages desire not to desirethey do not value goods that are hard to acquirethey learn to unlearnto redeem the fault of the peopleto assist the nature of all thingswithout daring to meddle . since this seems heavily recommended i thought it would be a good idea to put up a post of tao te ching enjoy tao ching to classic chapters to chapter the tao that can be spoken is not the eternal tao the name that can be named is not the eternal name the nameless is the origin of heaven and earth the named is the mother of myriad things thus constantly without desire one observes its essence constantly with desire one observes its manifestations these two emerge together but differ in name the unity is said to be the mystery mystery of mysteries the door to all wonders chapter when the world knows beauty as beauty ugliness arises when it knows good as good evil arises thus being and non being produce each other difficult and easy bring about each other long and short reveal each other high and low support each other music and voice harmonize each other front and back follow each other therefore the sages manage the work of detached actions conduct the teaching of no words they work with myriad things but do not control they create but do not possess they act but do not presume they succeed but do not dwell on success it is because they do not dwell on success that it never goes away chapter do not glorify the achievers so the people will not squabble do not treasure goods that are hard to obtain so the people will not become thieves do not show the desired things so their hearts will not be confused thus the governance of the sage empties their hearts fills their bellies weakens their ambitions strengthens their bones let the people have no cunning and no greed so those who scheme will not dare to meddle act without contrivance and nothing will be beyond control chapter the tao is empty when utilized it is not filled up so deep it seems to be the source of all things it blunts the sharpness unravels the knots dims the glare mixes the dusts so indistinct it seems to exist i do not know whose offspring it is its image is the predecessor of the emperor chapter heaven and earth are impartial they regard myriad things as straw dogs the sages are impartial they regard people as straw dogs the space between heaven and earth is it not like a bellows empty and yet never exhausted it moves and produces more too many words hasten failure can not compare to keeping to the void chapter the valley spirit undying is called the mystic female the gate of the mystic female is called the root of heaven and earth it flows continuously barely perceptible utilize it it is never exhausted chapter heaven and earth are everlasting the reason heaven and earth can last forever is that they do not exist for themselves thus they can last forever therefore the sages place themselves last but end up in front are outside of themselves and yet survive is it not due to their selflessness that is how they can achieve their own goals chapter the highest goodness resembles water water greatly benefits myriad things without contention it stays in places that people dislike therefore it is similar to the tao dwelling with the right location feeling with great depth giving with great kindness speaking with great integrity governing with great administration handling with great capability moving with great timing because it does not contend it is therefore beyond reproach chapter holding a cup and overfilling it can not be as good as stopping short pounding a blade and sharpening it can not be kept for long gold and jade fill up the room no one is able to protect them wealth and position bring arrogance and leave disasters upon oneself when achievement is completed fame is attained withdraw oneself this is the tao of heaven chapter in holding the soul and embracing oneness can one be steadfast without straying in concentrating the energy and reaching relaxation can one be like an infant in cleaning away the worldly view can one be without imperfections in loving the people and ruling the nation can one be without manipulation in the heavenly gate s opening and closing can one hold to the feminine principle in understanding clearly all directions can one be without intellectuality bearing it rearing it bearing without possession achieving without arrogance raising without domination this is called the mystic virtue chapter thirty spokes join in one hub in its emptiness there is the function of a vehicle mix clay to create a container in its emptiness there is the function of a container cut open doors and windows to create a room in its emptiness there is the function of a room therefore that which exists is used to create benefit that which is empty is used to create functionality chapter the five colors make one blind in the eyes the five sounds make one deaf in the ears the five flavors make one tasteless in the mouth racing and hunting make one wild in the heart goods that are difficult to acquire make one cause damage therefore the sages care for the stomach and not the eyes that is why they discard the other and take this chapter favor and disgrace make one fearful the greatest misfortune is the self what does favor and disgrace make one fearful mean favor is high disgrace is low having it makes one fearful losing it makes one fearful this is favor and disgrace make one fearful what does the greatest misfortune is the self mean the reason i have great misfortune is that i have the self if i have no self what misfortune do i have so one who values the self as the world can be given the world one who loves the self as the world can be entrusted with the world chapter look at it it can not be seen it is called colorless listen to it it can not be heard it is called noiseless reach for it it can not be held it is called formless these three can not be completely untravelled so they are combined into one above it not bright below it not dark continuing endlessly can not be named it returns back into nothingness thus it is called the form of the formless the image of the imageless this is called enigmatic confront it its front can not be seen follow it its back can not be seen wield the tao of the ancients to manage the existence of today one can know the ancient beginning it is called the tao axiom chapter the tao masters of antiquity subtle wonders through mystery depths that can not be discerned because one can not discern them therefore one is forced to describe the appearance hesitant like crossing a wintry river cautious like fearing four neighbors solemn like a guest loose like ice about to melt genuine like plain wood open like a valley opaque like muddy water who can be muddled yet desist in stillness gradually become clear who can be serene yet persist in motion gradually come alive one who holds this tao does not wish to be overfilled because one is not overfilled therefore one can preserve and not create anew chapter attain the ultimate emptiness hold on to the truest tranquility the myriad things are all active i therefore watch their return everything flourishes each returns to its root returning to the root is called tranquility tranquility is called returning to one s nature returning to one s nature is called constancy knowing constancy is called clarity not knowing constancy one recklessly causes trouble knowing constancy is acceptance acceptance is impartiality impartiality is sovereign sovereign is heaven heaven is to tao is eternal the self is no more without danger chapter the highest rulers people do not know they have them the next level people love them and praise them the next level people fear them the next level people despise them if the rulers trust is insufficient have no trust in them proceeding calmly valuing their words task accomplished matter settled the people all say we did it naturally chapter the great tao fades away there is benevolence and justice intelligence comes forth there is great deception the six relations are not harmonious there is filial piety and kind affection the country is in confused chaos there are loyal ministers chapter end sagacity abandon knowledge the people benefit a hundred times end benevolence abandon righteousness the people return to piety and charity end cunning discard profit bandits and thieves no longer exist these three things are superficial and insufficient thus this teaching has its place show plainness hold simplicity reduce selfishness decrease desires chapter cease learning no more worries respectful response and scornful response how much is the difference goodness and evil how much do they differ what the people fear i can not be afraid so desolate how limitless it is the people are excited as if enjoying a great feast as if climbing up to the terrace in spring i alone am quiet and involved like an infant not yet smiling so weary like having no place to return the people all have surplus while i alone seem lacking i have the heart of a fool indeed so ignorant ordinary people are bright i alone am muddled ordinary people are scrutinizing i alone am obtuse such tranquility like the ocean such high wind as if without limits the people all have goals and i alone am stubborn and lowly i alone am different from them and value the nourishing mother chapter the appearance of great virtue follows only the tao the tao as a thing seems indistinct seems unclean so unclean so indistinct within it there is image so indistinct so unclean within it there is substance so deep so profound within it there is essence its essence is supremely real within it there is faith from ancient times to the present its name never departs to observe the source of all things how do i know the nature of the source with this chapter yield and remain whole bend and remain straight be low and become filled be worn out and become renewed have little and receive have much and be confused therefore the sages hold to the one as an example for the world without flaunting themselves and so are seen clearly without presuming themselves and so are distinguished without praising themselves and so have merit without boasting about themselves and so are lasting because they do not contend the world can not contend with them what the ancients called the one who yields and remains whole were they speaking empty words sincerity becoming whole and returning to oneself chapter sparse speech is natural thus strong wind does not last all morning sudden rain does not last all day what makes this so heaven and earth even heaven and earth can not make it last how can humans thus those who follow the tao are with the tao those who follow virtue are with virtue those who follow loss are with loss those who are with the tao the tao is also pleased to have them those who are with virtue virtue is also pleased to have them those who are with loss loss is also please to have them those who do not trust sufficiently others have no trust in them . the tao that can be spoken is not the eternal tao this has to be the best opening line of any scripture straight to the point looking to the eternal it s only possible to say what it is not never what it is although words can t capture it it s great to have words in the form of scripture that point this out as seeing that words are inadequate at conveying the nature of being it can allow us to be less dependent on thoughts to define ourself and so remain true to ourself . chapter those who are on tiptoes can not stand those who straddle can not walk those who flaunt themselves are not clear those who presume themselves are not distinguished those who praise themselves have no merit those who boast about themselves do not last those with the tao call such things leftover food or tumors they despise them thus those who possesses the tao do not engage in them chapter there is something formless created born before heaven and earth so silent so ethereal independent and changeless circulating and ceaseless it can be regarded as the mother of the world i do not know its name identifying it i call it to forced to describe it i call it great great means passing passing means receding receding means returning therefore the tao is great heaven is great earth is great the sovereign is also great there are four greats in the universe and the sovereign occupies one of them humans follow the laws of earth earth follows the laws of heaven heaven follows the laws of tao tao follows the laws of nature chapter heaviness is the root of lightness quietness is the master of restlessness therefore the sages travel an entire day without leaving the heavy supplies even though there are luxurious sights they are composed and transcend beyond how can the lords of ten thousand chariots apply themselves lightly to the world to be light is to lose ones root to be restless is to lose ones mastery chapter good traveling does not leave tracks good speech does not seek faults good reckoning does not use counters good closure needs no bar and yet can not be opened good knot needs no rope and yet can not be untied therefore sages often save others and so do not abandon anyone they often save things and so do not abandon anything this is called following enlightenment therefore the good person is the teacher of the bad person the bad person is the resource of the good person those who do not value their teachers and do not love their resources although intelligent they are greatly confused this is called the essential wonder chapter know the masculine hold to the feminine be the watercourse of the world being the watercourse of the world the eternal virtue does not depart return to the state of the infant know the white hold to the black be the standard of the world being the standard of the world the eternal virtue does not deviate return to the state of the boundless know the honor hold to the humility be the valley of the world being the valley of the world the eternal virtue shall be sufficient return to the state of plain wood plain wood splits then becomes tools the sages utilize them and then become leaders thus the greater whole is undivided chapter those who wish to take the world and control it i see that they can not succeed the world is a sacred instrument one can not control it the one who controls it will fail the one who grasps it will lose because all things either lead or follow either blow hot or cold either have strength or weakness either have ownership or take by force therefore the sage eliminates extremes eliminates excess eliminates arrogance chapter the one who uses the tao to advise the ruler does not dominate the world with soldiers such methods tend to be returned the place where the troops camp thistles and thorns grow following the great army there must be an unsuspicious year a good commander achieves result then stops and does not dare to reach for domination achieves result but does not brag achieves result but does not flaunt achieves result but is not arrogant achieves result but only out of necessity achieves result but does not dominate things become strong and then get old this is called contrary to the tao that which is contrary to the tao soon ends chapter a strong military a tool of misfortune all things detest it therefore those who possess the tao avoid it honorable gentlemen while at home value the left when deploying the military value the right the military is a tool of misfortune not the tool of honorable gentlemen when using it out of necessity calm detachment should be above all victorious but without glory those who glorify are delighting in the killing those who delight in killing can not achieve their ambitions upon the world auspicious events favor the left unsuspicious events favor the right the lieutenant general is position to the left the major general is position to the right we say that they are treated as if in a funeral those who have been killed should be mourned with sadness victory in war should be treated as a funeral chapter the tao eternally nameless its simplicity although imperceptible can not be treated by the world as subservient if the sovereign can hold on to it all will follow by themselves heaven and earth together in harmony will rain sweet dew people will not need to force it it will adjust by itself in the beginning there were names names came to exist everywhere one should know when to stop knowing when to stop thus avoiding danger the existence of the tao in the world is like streams in the valley into rivers and the ocean chapter those who understand others are intelligent those who understand themselves are enlightened those who overcome others have strength those who overcome themselves are powerful those who know contentment are wealthy those who proceed vigorously have willpower those who do not lose their base endure those who die but do not perish have longevity chapter the great tao is like a flood it can flow to the left or to the right the myriad things depend on it for life but it never stops it achieves its work but does not take credit it clothes and feeds myriad things but does not rule over them ever desiring nothing it can be named insignificant myriad things return to it but it does not rule over them it can be named great even in the end it does not regard itself as great that is how it can achieve its greatness chapter hold the great image all under heaven will come they come without harm in harmonious peace music and food passing travelers stop the tao that is spoken out of the mouth is bland and without flavor look at it it can not be seen listen to it it can not be heard use it it can not be exhausted chapter if one wishes to shrink it one must first expand it if one wishes to weaken it one must first strengthen it if one wishes to discard it one must first promote it if one wishes to seize it one must first give it this is called subtle clarity the soft and weak overcomes the tough and strong fish can not leave the depths the sharp instruments of the state can not be shown to the people chapter the tao is constant in non action yet there is nothing it does not do if the sovereign can hold on to

therefore using cleverness to govern the state is being a thief of the state not using cleverness to govern the state is being a blessing of the state know that these two are both standards always knowing these standards is called mystic virtue mystic virtue profound far reaching it goes opposite to material things then it reaches great congruencechapter rivers and oceans can be the kings of a hundred valleys because of their goodness in staying low so they can be the kings of a hundred valleys thus if sages wish to be over people they must speak humbly to them if they wish to be in front of people they must place themselves behind them thus the sages are position above but the people do not feel burdened they are position in front but the people do not feel harmed thus the world is glad to push them forward without resentment because they do not contend so the world can not contend with themchapter everyone in the world calls my to great as if it is beyond compare it is only because of its greatness that it seems beyond compare if it can be compared it would already be insignificant long ago i have three treasures i hold on to them and protect them the first is called compassion the second is called conservation the third is called not daring to be ahead in the world compassionate thus able to have courage conserving thus able to reach widely not daring to be ahead in the world thus able to assume leadership now if one has courage but discards compassion reaches widely but discards conservation goes ahead but discards being behind then death if one fights with compassion then victory with defense then security heaven shall save them and with compassion guard themchapter the great generals are not warlike the great warriors do not get angry those who are good at defeating enemies do not engage them those who are good at managing people lower themselves it is called the virtue of non contention it is called the power of managing people it is called being harmonious with heaven the ultimate principle of the ancientschapter in using the military there is a saying i dare not be the host but prefer to be the guest i dare not advance an inch but prefer to withdraw a foot this is called marching in formation without formation raising arms without arms grappling enemies without enemies holding weapons without weapons there is no greater

understand me are few thus i am highly valued therefore the sage wears plain clothes but holds jadechapter to know that you do not know is highest to not know but think you know is flowed only when one recognizes the fault as a fault can one be without fault the sages are without fault because they recognize the fault as a fault that is why they are without faultchapter when people no longer fear force they bring about greater force do not limit their place do not reject their livelihood because the ruler does not reject them therefore they do not reject the ruler therefore the sages know themselves but do not glorify themselves respect themselves but do not praise themselves thus they discard that and take thischapter the bold in daring will be killed the bold in not daring will survive of these two one may benefit the other may harm the one hated by heaven who knows the reason even the sages still find this difficult the tao of heaven does not contend and yet excels in winning does not speak and yet excels in responding is not summoned and yet comes on its own is unhurried and yet excels in planning the heavenly net is vast loose and yet does not let anything slip throughchapter people do not fear death how can they be threatened with death if people are made to constantly fear death then those who act lawfully i can capture and kill them who would dare there exists a master executioner that kills if we substitute for the master executioner to kill it is like substituting for the great carpenter to cut those who substitute for the great carpenter to cut it is rare that they do not hurt their own handschapter the peoples hunger is due to the excess of their rulers taxation so they starve the peoples difficulty in being governed is due to the meddling of their ruler so they are difficult to govern the peoples disregard for death is due to the glut in their rulers pursuit of life so they disregard death therefore those who do not strive for living are better than those who value livingchapter while alive the body is soft and pliant when dead it is hard and rigid all living things grass and trees while alive are soft and supple when dead become dry and brittle thus that which is hard and stiff is the follower of death that which is soft and yielding is the follower of life therefore an inflexible army will not win a strong tree will be cut down

that which has excess add to that which is lacking the tao of heaven reduces the excessive and adds to the lacking the tao of people is not so it reduces the lacking in order to offer to the excessive who can offer their excess to the world only those who have the tao therefore sages act without conceit achieve without claiming credit they do not wish to display their virtue chapter nothing in the world is softer or weaker than water yet nothing is better at overcoming the hard and strong this is because nothing can replace it that the weak overcomes the strong and the soft overcomes the hard everybody in the world knows but can not put into practice therefore sages say the one who accepts the humiliation of the state is called its master the one who accepts the misfortune of the state becomes king of the world the truth seems like the oppositechapter after settling a great dispute there must be remaining resentments how can this be considered good therefore the sage holds the left part of the contract but does not demand payment from the other person those who have virtue hold the contract those without virtue hold the collections the heavenly tao has no favorites it constantly gives to the kind peoplechapter small country few people let them have many weapons but not use them let the people regard death seriously and not migrate far away although they have boats and chariots they have no need to take them although they have armors and weapons they have no need to display them let the people return to tying knots and using them savor their food admire their clothes content in their homes happy in their customs neighboring countries see one another hear the sounds of roosters and dogs from one another the people until they grow old and die do not go back and forth with one anotherchapter true words are not beautiful beautiful words are not true those who are good do not debate those who debate are not good those who know are not broad of knowledge those who are broad of knowledge do not know sages do not accumulate the more they assist others the more they possess the more they give to others the more they gain the tao of heaven benefits and

people are shrewd and craftymisfortune is what fortune depends uponfortune is where misfortune hides beneathwho knows their ultimate end they have no determined outcomerightness reverts to become strangegoodness reverts to become wickedthe confusion of peoplehas lasted many long daystherefore the sages are righteous without being scathingincorruptible without being piercingstraightforward without being ruthlessilluminated without being flashychapter in governing people and serving heaventhere is nothing like conservationonly with conservation is it called submitting earlysubmitting early is called emphasis on accumulating virtuesaccumulating virtues means there is nothing one can not overcomewhen there is nothing that one can not overcomeones limits are unknownthe limitations being unknown one can possess sovereigntywith this mother principle of power one can be everlastingthis is called deep roots and firm foundationthe tao of longevity and lasting visionchapter ruling a large country is like cooking a small fishusing the tao to manage the worldits demons have no powernot only do its demons have no powerits gods do not harm peoplenot only do its gods not harm peoplethe sages also do not harm peoplethey both do no harm to one anotherso virtue merges and returnschapter the large country is like the lowest riverthe converging point of the worldthe receptive female of the worldthe female always overcomes the male with serenityusing serenity as the lower positionthus if the large country is lower than the small countrythen it can take the small countryif the small country is lower than the large countrythen it can be taken by the large countrythus one uses the lower position to takethe other uses the lower position to be taketh large country only wishes to gather and protect peoplethe small country only wishes to join and serve peopleso that both obtain what they wishthe larger one should assume the lower positionchapter the tao is the wonder of all thingsthe treasure of the kind personthe protection of the unkind personadmirable words can win the publics respectadmirable actions can improve peoplethose who are unkindhow can they be abandoned therefore when crowning the emperorand installing the three ministersalthough there is the offering of jade before four horsesnone of it can compare to being seated in this taowhy did the ancients value this tao so much is it not said that those who seek will find and those with guilt will not be vaulted therefore it is the greatest value in the worldchapter act without actionmanage without meddlingtaste without tastinggreat small many fewrespond to hatred with virtueplan difficult tasks through the simplest tasksachieve large tasks through the smallest tasksthe difficult tasks of the worldmust be handled through the simple tasksthe large tasks of the worldmust be handled through the small taskstherefore sages never attempt great deeds all through lifethus they can achieve greatnessone who makes promises lightly must deserve little trustone who sees many easy tasks must encounter much difficultytherefore sages regard things as difficultso they never encounter difficulties all through lifechapter when it is peaceful it is easy to maintainwhen it shows no signs it is easy to plan when it is frail it is easy to breakwhen it is small it is easy to scatteract on it when it has not yet begun treat it when it is not yet chaotic tree thick enough to embracegrows from the tiny saplinga tower of nine levelsstarts from the dirt heapa journey of a thousand milesbegins beneath the seethe one who meddles will failthe one who grasps will losetherefore sages do not meddle and thus do not failthey do not grasp and thus do not losepeople in handling affairsoften come close to completion and failif they are as careful in the end as the beginningthen they would have no failuretherefore sages desire not to desirethey do not value goods that are hard to acquirethey learn to unlearnto redeem the fault of the peopleto assist the nature of all thingswithout daring to meddle . the tao that can be spoken is not the eternal taothis has to be the best opening line of any scripture straight to the point looking to the eternal its only possible to say what it is not never what it is although words cant capture it its great to have words in the form of scripture that point this out as seeing that words are inadequate at conveying the nature of being it can allow us to be less dependent on thoughts to define ourself and so remain true to ourself . chapter those who are on tiptoes can not stand those who straddle can not walk those who flaunt themselves are not clear those who presume themselves are not distinguished those who praise themselves have no merit those who boast about themselves do not last those with the tao call such things leftover food or tumors they despise them thus those who possesses the tao do not engage in them chapter there is something formless created born before heaven and earth so silent so ethereal independent and changeless circulating and ceaseless it can be regarded as the mother of the world i do not know its name identifying it i call it to forced to describe it i call it great great means passing passing means receding receding means returning therefore the tao is great heaven is great earth is great the sovereign is also great there are four greats in the universe and the sovereign occupies one of them humans follow the laws of earth earth follows the laws of heaven heaven follows the laws of tao tao follows the laws of nature chapter heaviness is the root of lightness quietness is the master of restlessness therefore the sages travel an entire day without leaving the heavy supplies even though there are luxurious sights they are composed and transcend beyond how can the lords of ten thousand chariots apply themselves lightly to the world to be light is to lose ones root to be restless is to lose ones mastery chapter good traveling does not leave tracks good speech does not seek faults good reckoning does not use counters good closure needs no bar and yet can not be opened good knot needs no rope and yet can not be untied therefore sages often save others and so do not abandon anyone they often save things and so do not abandon anything this is called following enlightenment therefore the good person is the teacher of the bad person the bad person is the resource of the good person those who do not value their teachers and do not love their resources although intelligent they are greatly confused this is called the essential wonder chapter know the masculine hold to the feminine be the watercourse of the world being the watercourse of the world the eternal virtue does not depart return to the state of the infant know the white hold to the black be the standard of the world being the standard of the world the eternal virtue does not deviate return to the state of the boundless know the honor hold to the humility be the valley of the world being the valley of the world the eternal virtue shall be sufficient return to the state of plain wood plain wood splits then becomes tools the sages utilize them and then become leaders thus the greater whole is undivided chapter those who wish to take the world and control it i see that they can not succeed the world is a sacred instrument one can not control it the one who controls it will fail the one who grasps it will lose because all things either lead or follow either blow hot or cold either have strength or weakness either have ownership or take by force therefore the sage eliminates extremes eliminates excess eliminates arrogance chapter the one who uses the tao to advise the ruler does not dominate the world with soldiers such methods tend to be returned the place where the troops camp thistles and thorns grow following the great army there must be an unsuspicious year a good commander achieves result then stops and does not dare to reach for domination achieves result but does not brag achieves result but does not flaunt achieves result but is not arrogant achieves result but only out of necessity achieves result but does not dominate things become strong and then get old this is called contrary to the tao that which is contrary to the tao soon ends chapter a strong military a tool of misfortune all things detest it therefore those who possess the tao avoid it honorable gentlemen while at home value the left when deploying the military value the right the military is a tool of misfortune not the tool of honorable gentlemen when using it out of necessity calm detachment should be above all victorious but without glory those who glorify are delighting in the killing those who delight in killing can not achieve their ambitions upon the world auspicious events favor the left unsuspicious events favor the right the lieutenant general is position to the left the major general is position to the right we say that they are treated as if in a funeral those who have been killed should be mourned with sadness victory in war should be treated as a funeral chapter the tao eternally nameless its simplicity although imperceptible can not be treated by the world as subservient if the sovereign can hold on to it all will follow by themselves heaven and earth together in harmony will rain sweet dew people will not need to force it it will adjust by itself in the beginning there were names names came to exist everywhere one should know when to stop knowing when to stop thus avoiding danger the existence of the tao in the world is like streams in the valley into rivers and the ocean chapter those who understand others are intelligent those who understand themselves are enlightened those who overcome others have strength those who overcome themselves are powerful those who know contentment are wealthy those who proceed vigorously have willpower those who do not lose their base endure those who die but do not perish have longevity chapter the great tao is like a flood it can flow to the left or to the right the myriad things depend on it for life but it never stops it achieves its work but does not take credit it clothes and feeds myriad things but does not rule over them ever desiring nothing it can be named insignificant myriad things return to it but it does not rule over them it can be named great even in the end it does not regard itself as great that is how it can achieve its greatness chapter hold the great image all under heaven will come they come without harm in harmonious peace music and food passing travelers stop the tao that is spoken out of the mouth is bland and without flavor look at it it can not be seen listen to it it can not be heard use it it can not be exhausted chapter if one wishes to shrink it one must first expand it if one wishes to weaken it one must first strengthen it if one wishes to discard it one must first promote it if one wishes to seize it one must first give it this is called subtle clarity the soft and weak overcomes the tough and strong fish can not leave the depths the sharp instruments of the state can not be shown to the people chapter the tao is constant in non action yet there is nothing it does not do if the sovereign can hold on to this all things shall transform themselves transformed yet wishing to achieve i shall restrain them with the simplicity of the nameless the simplicity of the nameless they shall be without desire without desire using stillness the world shall steady itself chingvirtue classic chapters to chapter high virtue is not virtuoustherefore it has virtuelow virtue never loses virtuetherefore it has no virtuehigh virtue

it not to make people brighter but to keep them simple the difficulty in governing people is due their excessive cleverness therefore using cleverness to govern the state is being a thief of the state not using cleverness to govern the state is being a blessing of the state know that these two are both standards always knowing these standards is called mystic virtue mystic virtue profound far reaching it goes opposite to material things then it reaches great congruencechapter rivers and oceans can be the kings of a hundred valleys because of their goodness in staying low so they can be the kings of a hundred valleys thus if sages wish to be over people they must speak humbly to them if they wish to be in front of people they must place themselves behind them thus the sages are position above but the people do not feel burdened they are position in front but the people do not feel harmed thus the world is glad to push them forward without resentment because they do not contend so the world can not contend with themchapter everyone in the world calls my to great as if it is beyond compare it is only because of its greatness that it seems beyond compare if it can be compared it would already be insignificant long ago i have three treasures i hold on to them and protect them the first is called compassion the second is called conservation the third is called not daring to be ahead in the world compassionate thus able to have courage conserving thus able to reach widely not daring to be ahead in the world thus able to assume leadership now if one has courage but discards compassion reaches widely but discards conservation goes ahead but discards being behind then death if one fights with compassion then victory with defense then security heaven shall save them and with compassion guard themchapter the great generals are not warlike the great warriors do not get angry those who are good at defeating enemies do not engage them those who are good at managing people lower themselves it is called the virtue of non contention it is called the power of managing people it is called being harmonious with heaven the ultimate principle of the ancientschapter in

raising arms without arms grappling enemies without enemies holding weapons without weapons there is no greater disaster than to underestimate the enemy underestimating the enemy almost made me lose my treasures so when evenly matched armies meet the side that is compassionate shall winchapter my words are easy to understand easy to practice the world can not understand can not practice my words have basis my actions have principle people do not understand this therefore they do not understand me those who understand me are few thus i am highly valued therefore the sage wears plain clothes but holds jadechapter to know that you do not know is highest to not know but think you know is flowed only when one recognizes the fault as a fault can one be without fault the sages are without fault because they recognize the fault as a fault that is why they are without faultchapter when people no longer fear force they bring about greater force do not limit their place do not reject their livelihood because the ruler does not reject them therefore they do not reject the ruler therefore the sages know themselves but do not glorify themselves respect themselves but do not praise themselves thus they discard that and take thischapter the bold in daring will be killed the bold in not daring will survive of these two one may benefit the other may harm the one hated by heaven who knows the reason even the sages still find this difficult the tao of heaven does not contend and yet excels in winning does not speak and yet excels in responding is not summoned and yet comes on its own is unhurried and yet excels in planning the heavenly net is vast loose and yet does not let anything slip throughchapter people do not fear death how can they be threatened with death if people are made to constantly fear death then those who act lawfully i can capture and kill them who would dare there exists a master executioner that kills if we substitute for the master executioner to kill it is like substituting for the great carpenter to cut those who substitute for the great carpenter to cut it is rare that they do not hurt their own handschapter the peoples hunger is due to the excess of their rulers taxation so they starve the peoples difficulty in being governed is due to the meddling of their ruler so they are difficult to govern the peoples disregard for death is due to the glut in their rulers pursuit of life so they disregard death therefore those who do not strive for living are better than those who value livingchapter while alive the body is soft and pliant when dead it is hard and rigid all living things grass and trees while alive are soft and supple when dead become dry and brittle thus that which is hard and stiff is the follower of death that which is soft and yielding is the follower of life therefore an inflexible army will not win a strong tree will be cut down the big and forgetful occupy a lowly position while the soft and pliant occupy a higher placechapter the tao of heaven is like drawing a bow lower that which is high raise that which is low reduce that which has excess add to that which is lacking the tao of heaven reduces the excessive and adds to the lacking the tao of people is not so it reduces the lacking in order to offer to the excessive who can offer their excess to the world only those who have the tao therefore sages act without conceit achieve without claiming credit they do not wish to display their virtue chapter nothing in the world is softer or weaker than water yet nothing is better at overcoming the hard and strong this is because nothing can replace it that the weak overcomes the strong and the soft overcomes the hard everybody in the world knows but can not put into practice therefore sages say the one who accepts the humiliation of the state is called its master the one who accepts the misfortune of the state becomes king of the world the truth seems like the oppositechapter after settling a great dispute there must be remaining resentments how can this be considered good therefore the sage holds the left part of the contract but does not demand payment from the other person those who have virtue hold the contract those without virtue hold the collections the heavenly tao has no favorites it constantly gives to the kind peoplechapter small country few people let them have many weapons but not use them let the people regard death seriously and not migrate far away although they have boats and chariots they have no need to take them although they have armors and weapons they have no need to display them let the people return to tying knots and using them savor their food admire their clothes content in their homes happy in their customs neighboring countries see one another hear the sounds of roosters and dogs from one another the people until they grow old and die do not go back and forth with one anotherchapter true words are not beautiful beautiful words are not true those who are good do not debate those who debate are not good those who know are not broad of knowledge those who are broad of knowledge do not know sages do not accumulate the more they assist others the more they possess the more they give to others the more they gain the tao of heaven benefits and does not harm the tao of sages assists and does not contend . since this seems heavily recommended i thought it would be a good idea to put up a post of tao te ching enjoy tao ching to classic chapters to chapter the tao that can be spoken is not the eternal tao the name that can be named is not the eternal name the nameless is the origin of heaven and earth the named is the mother of myriad things thus constantly without desire one observes its essence constantly with desire one observes its manifestations these two emerge together but differ in name the unity is said to be the mystery mystery of mysteries the door to all wonders chapter when the world knows beauty as beauty ugliness arises when it knows good as good evil arises thus being and non being produce each other difficult and easy bring about each other long and short reveal each other high and low support each other music and voice harmonize each other front and back follow each other therefore the sages manage the work of detached actions conduct the teaching of no words they work with myriad things but do not control they create but do not possess they act but do not presume they succeed but do not dwell on success it is because they do not dwell on success that it never goes away chapter do not glorify the achievers so the people will not squabble do not treasure goods that are hard to obtain so the people will not become thieves do not show the desired things so their hearts will not be confused thus the governance of the sage empties their hearts fills their bellies weakens their ambitions strengthens their bones let the people have no cunning and no greed so those who scheme will not dare to meddle act without contrivance and nothing will be beyond control chapter the tao is empty when utilized it is not filled up so deep it seems to be the source of all things it blunts the sharpness unravels the knots dims the glare mixes the dusts so indistinct it seems to exist i do not know whose offspring it is its image is the predecessor of the emperor chapter heaven and earth are impartial they regard myriad things as straw dogs the sages are impartial they regard people as straw dogs the space between heaven and earth is it not like a bellows empty and yet never exhausted it moves and produces more too many words hasten failure can not compare to keeping to the void chapter the valley spirit undying is called the mystic female the gate of the mystic female is called the root of heaven and earth it flows continuously barely perceptible utilize it it is never exhausted chapter heaven and earth are everlasting the reason heaven and earth can last forever is that they do not exist for themselves thus they can last forever therefore the sages place themselves last but end up in front are outside of themselves and yet survive is it not due to their selflessness that is how they can achieve their own goals chapter the highest goodness resembles water water greatly benefits myriad things without contention it stays in places that people dislike therefore it is similar to the tao dwelling with the right location feeling with great depth giving with great kindness speaking with great integrity governing with great administration handling with great capability moving with great timing because it does not contend it is therefore beyond reproach chapter holding a cup and overfilling it can not be as good as stopping short pounding a blade and sharpening it can not be kept for long gold and jade fill up the room no one is able to protect them wealth and position bring arrogance and leave disasters upon oneself when achievement is completed fame is attained withdraw oneself this is the tao of heaven chapter in holding the soul and embracing oneness can one be steadfast without straying in concentrating the energy and reaching relaxation can one be like an infant in cleaning away the worldly view can one be without imperfections in loving the people and ruling the nation can one be without manipulation in the heavenly gates opening and closing can one hold to the feminine principle in understanding clearly all directions can one be without intellectuality bearing it rearing it bearing without possession achieving without arrogance raising without domination this is called the mystic virtue chapter thirty spokes join in one hub in its emptiness there is the function of a vehicle mix clay to create a container in its emptiness there is the function of a container cut open doors and windows to create a room in its emptiness there is the function of a room therefore that which exists is used to create benefit that which is empty is used to create functionality chapter the five colors make one blind in the eyes the five sounds make one deaf in the ears the five flavors make one tasteless in the mouth racing and hunting make one wild in the heart goods that are difficult to acquire make one cause damage therefore the sages care for the stomach and not the eyes that is why they discard the other and take this chapter favor and disgrace make one fearful the greatest misfortune is the self what does favor and disgrace make one fearful mean favor is high disgrace is low having it makes one fearful losing it makes one fearful this is favor and disgrace make one fearful what does the greatest misfortune is the self mean the reason i have great misfortune is that i have the self if i have no self what misfortune do i have so one who values the self as the world can be given the world one who loves the self as the world can be entrusted with the world chapter look at it it can not be seen it is called colorless listen to it it can not be heard it is called noiseless reach for it it can not be held it is called formless these three can not be completely untravelled so they are combined into one above it not bright below it not dark continuing endlessly can not be named it returns back into nothingness thus it is called the form of the formless the image of the imageless this is called enigmatic confront it its front can not be seen follow it its back can not be seen wield the tao of the ancients to manage the existence of today one can know the ancient beginning it is called the tao axiom chapter the tao masters of antiquity subtle wonders through mystery depths that can not be discerned because one can not discern them therefore one is forced to describe the appearance hesitant like crossing a

praising themselves and so have merit without boasting about themselves and so are lasting because they do not contend the world can not contend with them what the ancients called the one who yields and remains whole were they speaking empty words sincerity becoming whole and returning to oneself chapter sparse speech is natural thus strong wind does not last all morning sudden rain does not last all day what makes this so heaven and earth even heaven and earth can not make it last how can humans thus those who follow the tao are with the tao those who follow virtue are with virtue those who follow loss are with loss those who are with the tao the tao is also pleased to have them those who are with virtue virtue is also pleased to have them those who are with loss loss is also please to have them those who do not trust sufficiently others have no trust in them . since this seems heavily recommended i thought it would be a good idea to put up a post of tao te ching enjoy tao ching to classic chapters to chapter the tao that can be spoken is not the eternal tao the name that can be named is not the eternal name the nameless is the origin of heaven and earth the named is the mother of myriad things thus constantly without desire one observes its essence constantly with desire one observes its manifestations these two emerge together but differ in name the unity is said to be the mystery mystery of mysteries the door to all wonders chapter when the world knows beauty as beauty ugliness arises when it knows good as good evil arises thus being and non being produce each other difficult and easy bring about each other long and short reveal each other high and low support each other music and voice harmonize each other front and back follow each other therefore the sages manage the work of detached actions conduct the teaching of no words they work with myriad things but do not control they create but do not possess they act but do not presume they succeed but do not dwell on success it is because they do not dwell on success that it never goes away chapter do not glorify the achievers so the people will not squabble do not treasure goods that are hard to obtain so the people will not become thieves do not show the desired things so their hearts will not be confused thus the governance of the sage empties their hearts fills their bellies weakens their ambitions strengthens their bones let the people have no cunning and no greed so those who scheme will not dare to meddle act without contrivance and nothing will be beyond control chapter the tao is empty when utilized it is not filled up so deep it seems to be the source of all things it blunts the sharpness unravels the knots dims the glare mixes the dusts so indistinct it seems to exist i do not know whose offspring it is its image is the predecessor of the emperor chapter heaven and earth are impartial they regard myriad things as straw dogs the sages are impartial they regard people as straw dogs the space between heaven and earth is it not like a bellows empty and yet never exhausted it moves and produces more too many words hasten failure can not compare to keeping to the void chapter the valley spirit undying is called the mystic female the gate of the mystic female is called the root of heaven and earth it flows continuously barely perceptible utilize it it is never exhausted chapter heaven and earth are everlasting the reason heaven and earth can last forever is that they do not exist for themselves thus they can last forever therefore the sages place themselves last but end up in front are outside of themselves and yet survive is it not due to their selflessness that is how they can achieve their own goals chapter the highest goodness resembles water water greatly benefits myriad things without contention it stays in places that people dislike therefore it is similar to the tao dwelling with the right location feeling with great depth giving with great kindness speaking with great integrity governing with great administration handling with great capability moving with great timing because it does not contend it is therefore beyond reproach chapter holding a cup and overfilling it can not be as good as stopping short pounding a blade and sharpening it can not be kept for long gold and jade fill up the room no one is able to protect them wealth and position bring arrogance and leave disasters upon oneself when achievement is completed fame is attained withdraw oneself this is the tao of heaven chapter in holding the soul and embracing oneness can one be steadfast without straying in concentrating the energy and reaching relaxation can one be like an infant in cleaning away the worldly view can one be without imperfections in loving the people and ruling the nation can one be without manipulation in the heavenly gates opening and closing can one hold to the feminine principle in understanding clearly all directions can one be without intellectuality bearing it rearing it bearing without possession achieving without arrogance raising without domination this is called the mystic virtue chapter thirty spokes join in one hub in its emptiness there is the function of a vehicle mix clay to create a container in its emptiness there is the function of a container cut open doors and windows to create a room in its emptiness there is the function of a room therefore that which exists is used to create benefit that which is empty is used to create functionality chapter the five colors make one blind in the eyes the five sounds make one deaf in the ears the five flavors make one tasteless in the mouth racing and hunting make one wild in the heart goods that are difficult to acquire make one cause damage therefore the sages care for the stomach and not the eyes that is why they discard the other and take this chapter favor and disgrace make one fearful the greatest misfortune is the self what does favor and disgrace make one fearful mean favor is high disgrace is low having it makes one fearful losing it makes one fearful this is favor and disgrace make one fearful what does the greatest misfortune is the self mean the reason i have great misfortune is that i have the self if i have no self what misfortune do i have so one who values the self as the world can be given the world one who loves the self as the world can be entrusted with the world chapter look at it it can not be seen it is called colorless listen to it it can not be heard it is called noiseless reach for it it can not be held it is called formless these three can not be completely untravelled so they are combined into one above it not bright below it not dark continuing endlessly can not be named it returns back into nothingness thus it is called the form of the formless the image of the imageless this is called enigmatic confront it its front can not be seen follow it its back can not be seen wield the tao of the ancients to manage the existence of today one can know the ancient beginning it is called the tao axiom chapter the tao masters of antiquity subtle wonders through mystery depths that can not be

harmony is said to be constancyknowing constancy is said to be clarityexcessive vitality is said to be inauspiciousmind overusing energy is said to be aggressivethings become strong and then grow

benefitedthey can not obtain this and be harmedthey can not obtain this and be valuedthey can not obtain this and be degradedtherefore they become honoured by the worldchapter govern a country with upright integritydeploy the military with surprise tacticstake the world with non interferencehow do i know this is so with the following when there are many restrictions in the worldthe people become more impoverishedwhen people have many sharp weaponsthe country becomes more chaoticwhen people have many clever tricksmore strange things occurthe more laws are postedthe more robbers and thieves there aretherefore the sage says i take attached action and the people transform themselves prefer quiet and the people right themselves do not interfere and the people enrich themselvesi have no desires and the people simplify themselveschapter when governing is lacklusterthe people are simple and honestwhen governing is scrutinizingthe people are shrewd and craftymisfortune is what fortune depends uponfortune is where misfortune hides beneathwho knows their ultimate end they have no determined outcomerightness reverts to become strangegoodness reverts to become wickedthe confusion of peoplehas lasted many long daystherefore the sages are righteous without being scathingincorruptible without being piercingstraightforward without being ruthlessilluminated without being flashychapter in governing people and serving heaventhere is nothing like conservationonly with conservation is it called submitting earlysubmitting early is called emphasis on accumulating virtuesaccumulating virtues means there is nothing one can not overcomewhen there is nothing that one can not overcomeone s limits are unknownthe limitations being unknown one can possess sovereigntywith this mother principle of power one can be everlastingthis is called deep roots and firm foundationthe tao of longevity and lasting visionchapter ruling a large country is like cooking a small fishusing the tao to manage the worldits demons have no powernot only do its demons have no powerits gods do not harm peoplenot only do its gods not harm peoplethe sages also do not harm peoplethey both do no harm to one anotherso virtue merges and returnschapter the large country is like the lowest riverthe converging point of the worldthe receptive female of the worldthe female always overcomes the male with serenityusing serenity as the lower positionthus if the large country is lower than the small countrythen it can take the small countryif the small country is lower than the large countrythen it can be taken by the large countrythus one uses the lower position to takethe other uses the lower position to be taketh large country only wishes to gather and protect peoplethe small country only wishes to join and serve peopleso that both obtain what they wishthe larger one should assume the lower positionchapter the tao is the wonder of all thingsthe treasure of the kind personthe protection of the unkind personadmirable words can win the public s respectadmirable actions can improve peoplethose who are unkindhow can they be abandoned therefore when crowning the emperorand installing the three ministersalthough there is the offering of jade before four horsesnone of it can compare to being seated in this taowhy did the ancients value this tao so much is it not said that those who seek will find and those with guilt will not be vaulted therefore it is the greatest value in the worldchapter act without actionmanage without meddlingtaste without tastinggreat small many fewrespond to hatred with virtueplan difficult tasks through the simplest tasksachieve large tasks through the smallest tasksthe difficult tasks of the worldmust be handled through the simple tasksthe large tasks of the worldmust be handled through the small taskstherefore sages never attempt great deeds all through lifethus they can achieve greatnessone who makes promises lightly must deserve little trustone who sees many easy tasks must encounter much difficultytherefore sages regard things as difficultso they never encounter difficulties all through lifechapter when it is peaceful it is easy to maintainwhen it shows no signs it is easy to plan when it is frail it is easy to breakwhen it is small it is easy to scatteract on it when it has not yet begun treat it when it is not yet chaotic tree thick enough to embracegrows from the tiny saplinga tower of nine levelsstarts from the dirt heapa journey of a thousand milesbegins beneath the seethe one who meddles will failthe one who grasps will losetherefore sages do not meddle and thus do not failthey do not grasp and thus do not losepeople in handling affairsoften come close to completion and failif they are as careful in the end as the beginningthen they would have no failuretherefore sages desire not to desirethey do not value goods that are hard to acquirethey learn to unlearnto redeem the fault of the peopleto assist the nature of all thingswithout daring to meddle . chapter those of ancient times who were adopt at the tao used it not to make people brighter but to keep them simple the difficulty in governing people is due their excessive cleverness therefore using cleverness to govern the state is being a thief of the state not using cleverness to govern the state is being a blessing of the state know that these two are both standards always knowing these standards is called mystic virtue mystic virtue profound far reaching it goes opposite to material things then it reaches great congruencechapter rivers and oceans can be the kings of a hundred valleys because of their goodness in staying low so they can be the kings of a hundred valleys thus if sages wish to be over people they must speak humbly to them if they wish to be in front of people they must place themselves behind them thus the sages are position above but the people do not feel burdened they are position in front but the people do not feel harmed thus the world is glad to push them forward without resentment because they do not contend so the world can not contend with themchapter everyone in the world calls my to great as if it is beyond compare it is only because of its greatness that it seems beyond compare if it can be compared it would already be insignificant long ago i have three treasures i hold on to them and protect them the first is called compassion the second is called conservation the third is called not daring to be ahead in the world compassionate thus able to have courage conserving thus able to reach widely not daring to be ahead in the world thus able to assume leadership now if one has courage but discards compassion reaches widely but discards conservation goes ahead but discards being behind then death if one fights with compassion then victory with defense then security heaven shall save them and with compassion guard themchapter the great generals are not warlike the great warriors do not get angry those who are good at defeating enemies do not engage them those who are good at managing people lower themselves it is called the virtue of non contention it is called the power of managing people it is called being harmonious with heaven the ultimate principle of the ancientschapter in using the military there is a saying i dare not be the host but prefer to be the guest i dare not advance an inch but prefer to withdraw a foot this is called marching in formation without formation raising arms without arms grappling enemies without enemies holding weapons without weapons there is no greater disaster than to underestimate the enemy underestimating the enemy almost made me lose my treasures so when evenly matched armies meet the side that is compassionate shall winchapter my words are easy to understand easy to practice the world can not understand can not practice my words have basis my actions have principle people do not understand this therefore they do not understand me those who understand me are few thus i am highly valued therefore the sage wears plain clothes but holds jadechapter to know that you do not know is highest to not know but think you know is flowed only when one recognizes the fault as a fault can one be without fault the sages are without fault because they recognize the fault as a fault that is why they are without faultchapter when people no longer fear force they bring about greater force do not limit their place do not reject their livelihood because the ruler does not reject them therefore they do not reject the ruler therefore the sages know themselves but do not glorify themselves respect themselves but do not praise themselves thus they discard that and take thischapter the bold in daring will be killed the bold in not daring will survive of these two one may benefit the other may harm the one hated by heaven who knows the reason even the sages still find this difficult the tao of heaven does not contend and yet excels in winning does not speak and yet excels in responding is not summoned and yet comes on its own is unhurried and yet excels in planning the heavenly net is vast loose and yet does not let anything slip throughchapter people do not fear death how can they be threatened with death if people are made to constantly fear death then those who act lawfully i can capture and kill them who would dare there exists a master executioner that kills if we substitute for the master executioner to kill it is like substituting for the great carpenter to cut those who substitute for the great carpenter to cut it is rare that they do not hurt their own handschapter the people s hunger is due to the excess of their ruler s taxation so they starve the people s difficulty in being governed is due to the meddling of their ruler so they are difficult to govern the people s disregard for death is due to the glut in their ruler s pursuit of life so they disregard death therefore those who do not strive for living are better than those who value livingchapter while alive the body is soft and pliant when dead it is hard and rigid all living things grass and trees while alive are soft and supple when dead become dry and brittle thus that which is hard and stiff is the follower of death that which is soft and yielding is the follower of life therefore an inflexible army will not win a strong tree will be cut down the big and forgetful occupy a lowly position while the soft and pliant occupy a higher placechapter the tao of heaven is like drawing a bow lower that which is high raise that which is low reduce that which has excess add to that which is lacking the tao of heaven reduces the excessive and adds to the lacking the tao of people is not so it reduces the lacking in order to offer to the excessive who can offer their excess to the world only those who have the tao therefore sages act without conceit achieve without claiming credit they do not wish to display their virtue chapter nothing in the world is softer or weaker than water yet nothing is better at overcoming the hard and strong this is because nothing can replace it that the weak overcomes the strong and the soft overcomes the hard everybody in the world knows but can not put into practice therefore sages say the one who accepts the humiliation of the state is called its master the one who accepts the misfortune of the state becomes king of the world the truth seems like the oppositechapter after settling a great dispute there must be remaining resentments how can this be considered good therefore the sage holds the left part of the contract but does not demand payment from the other person those who have virtue hold the contract those without virtue hold the collections the heavenly tao has no favorites it constantly gives to the kind peoplechapter small country few people let them have many weapons but not use them let the people regard death seriously and not migrate far away although they have boats and chariots they have no need to take them although they have armors and weapons they have no need to display them let the people return to tying knots and using them savor their food admire their clothes content in their homes happy in their customs neighboring countries see one another hear the sounds of roosters and dogs from one another the people until they grow old and die do not go back and forth with one anotherchapter true words are not beautiful beautiful words are not true those who are good do not debate those who debate are not good those who know are not broad of knowledge those who are broad of knowledge do not know sages do not accumulate the more they assist others the more they possess the more they give to others the more they gain the tao of heaven benefits and does not harm the tao of sages assists and does not contend . i feel like everyone on tmg is going to start quoting the tao te ching like how people quote the bible dewnry are there any
