i think crystal is more stable than liquid not a sure on that though co seems like a good idea i would not use water with the dry ice though perhaps find some other way to heat it to avoid water vapor although it should be cold enough anyways that that shouldnt happen . this seems a bit extreme to me if you want to keep in liquid form just vacuum jar seal it and keep it in a dark place . here is yet another storage question for lsd sorry hopefully someone with experience in this area can shed some light i have read the numerous posts about this topic however many do not hash out specifics how long would g stal last in a pure ever clear solution sealed within an ozone of co gas my plan is to do the following tell me what you think add mg to several separate amber glass serum vials add ever clear to each vial to create laying solution seal them with standard mm rubber stopper and flip to cap insert one g needle into the rubber top for venting insert another g needle and syringe without the plunger using a beaker filled with a little water and dry ice crumbles with a tube attached to the neck top leading directly into the open ended syringe pressure building inside the beaker will push co through the tube into the vial and expel all oxygen inside vial through the g needle remove venting needle remove co syringe rig this will hopefully allow co to remove the oxygen will this allow lifetime storage with animal unnoticeable degradation assuming its kept out of direct sunlight and intense fluctuating heat thanks everyone for your input any advice is greatly appreciated hambone w jurassic pharmaceuticals . i dunno if you have the means it may be worth the peace of mind . day perhaps this is extreme do you know if a everclear solution would contribute any to degradation . here is yet another storage question for lsd sorry hopefully someone with experience in this area can shed some light i have read the numerous posts about this topic however many do not

hambone w jurassic pharmaceuticals . quote from hambone on april am how long would g stal last in a pure ever clear solution sealed within an ozone of co gas using a beaker filled with a little water and dry ice crumbles with a tube attached to the neck top leading directly into the open ended syringe i would go with what ootp said on this using crystal should keep longer i would not use solution for the following reasons both these steps you propose introduce oxygen and chlorine in the gaseous form since they are voluble in water and alcohol oxygen may have more solubility in water but still has similar solubility in alcohol in the general order of magnitude chlorine i assume would be the same but have not seen data the problem with solution is any you add has oxygen and chlorine in them from the atmosphere once you add any solution exposed to atmospheric air you have just added both substances which degrade lsd you would have to expose the solution to some washes of a pure gas more inert to lsd probably carbon dioxide to draw out the oxygen and chlorine from solution the only data i could find about an established lsd decay rate when exposed to environment conditions was in brine samples after excretion hard to draw conclusions conditions in urine are very different than that of a pure liquid solution especially one not at body temperature it was noted that temperatures at degrees celsius or below would greatly reduce decay to almost nothing caused by ethereal energy sandoz may have established more formal rates on decay but have not seen anything think that information was kept internal if gathered if not would like to see it may have just been noted what causes damage but never quantified your set up looks like it could work besides that lot of this is going to depend on how experienced you are doing that type of work everything can de done perfectly on paper but actually doing it can be something else . quote from hambone on april amwill this allow lifetime storage with animal unnoticeable degradation assuming its kept out of direct sunlight and intense fluctuating heat thanks everyone for your input any advice is greatly appreciated sandoz glass ampules produced several decades ago are said to be good as new those were suspended in distilled water and sealed with co i cant see why the results would be different with a bit of ethanol in the mix give always wondered how exactly clandestine producers go about this process i e if they use dry ice or compressed co gas . quote from hambone on april amperhaps i could puncture a co cartridge used to power pellet rifles and attach the hose to the end i dunno but i will update in years passed if im still a member here haha thanks to all yeah in sure its not hard to fashion your own with things around the house trip to a hardware store also tattoo supply shops sell regulator valves that fit the pellet gun sized co cartridges for tattoo guns paintball shops will offer valves for larger paintball tanks . quote from hambone on april amperhaps i could puncture a co cartridge used to power pellet rifles and attach the hose to the end i dunno but i will update in years passed
