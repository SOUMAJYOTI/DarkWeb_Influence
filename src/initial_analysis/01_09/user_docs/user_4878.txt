through ignorance like a machine love and light acid ever sense i found out how to use the dnm i dont allow my friends to get something somewhere other than me unless its tested its sad but a very true statement i trust dnm vendors more than drug dealers in real life with reviews honest in most aspects i can see if a vendor is notable good before i buy from them instead of being forced into whatever is in town at the time and my knowledge on these substances has multiplied in the last years sense sr and dpr i dont believe stupid stereotypical happy mumbo jumbo either such as cant cut lsd with water from the store or brown folly is mad and white folly is mama with dim give skipped passed the typical salesman and have jumped right to other entrepeneurs that share in like interest and care to look into the science rather than what most people i know do follow the guy thats eaten acid the longest noon im too analogical to just go off of hear say i want to know from a person thats dealing with portions that if iiifff their stuff was bad they wouldnt move it because in order grams make a bad review greenbuddy might order grams and write a bad review than when someone else comes to maybe buy grams they see two bad reviews and a vendor trying to sell them shit again i trust dim vendors more than i do rl vendors . quote from goodfornothing on may pmseems like a pretty bad time

seemingly oh wait nevermind luck luck luck fuck at this point i think it would be ambitious to get too comfortable even if it goes consecutive days with time oh and i m not mocking the op i ve fallen into the semi comfort of a little bit of responsive uptime a bit too easily too rowdy gfn thank you for the response it s weird not being able to trust the dnm but it s a giving being blessed with dpr before was just soo easy to have lack of downtime quick deposits withdraws that when i go to make an order on any marketplace i just quickly jump the gun which is faulty sooo faulty on my end as i get left with in limbo however agra has fixed this and given me my btc i was still worried sick for multiply days like i can t lose that much money that s more than my car is worth i just need to be more understanding for the dnm but at the same time know that they could bail for numerous reasons at anytime . quote from greenbuddy on may pmquote from unit on may pmu i couldnt agree more give already swore to myself in sticking to micro transactions from now on id rather have etc on the line than what i had put myself into and exactly give never felt comfortable with sharing that i even use the market with anybody but close close close friends when they would like help with using it or want me to over see a transaction for them i let them know i risk my money when i use these marketplaces so when you want to use them youre risking your money too rascally saying ill do my best to make sure they get a clean transaction but if it goes to hell in a hand basket which ive seen happen very easily its not up to me to fix or compensate anything for them unit i also use markets for mostly etc deals its less of a worry and below a certain amount is io much less dangerous than a larger amount some may say that it requires more orders to get the same amount but id rather get caught with a of decriminalized amounts in some places of bud than a whole zip or qp not that it matters if the feds get you but if you get pulled over with it then unless you live in the deep south just a ticket the same is true for rl i used to have this strategy when buying weed id go to my dealer and if i was getting a half or a zip i would never tell them first id check it out and if the weed was sub par id just get a dub or a slice there are exceptions like if i wanted some primo bud from a vendor like cultmadeline who only sells ozs but their bud is fire and they are trusted even then id rather direct deal one thing about direct deals though i would place a very basin order one item and maybe a small cheap second but you dont need to make it confusing or overlay complicated final note there are some things that make sense to buy in bulk the one thing i dont is with mdma i dont have many friends who do it although getting rid of it is easy the reason i dont is that i know that for myself i will do higher doses and more often if i bought a whole g if i had friends who would buy it i could sell it very fast for a nice profit most of my friends done even know if the folly they got of some uri student was real mdma and are averse to pills never had good ones or think they are cut thanks to pop culture its crazy smart people too that is what is so vibrating about dnms you dont have to take what everyone else in your area or circle of friends does it cuts through ignorance like a machine love and light acid ever sense i found out how to use the dnm i dont allow my friends to get something somewhere other than me unless its tested its sad but a very true statement i trust dnm vendors more than drug dealers in real life with reviews honest in most aspects i can see if a vendor is notable good before i buy from them instead of being forced into whatever is in town at the time and my knowledge on these substances has multiplied in the last years sense sr and dpr i dont believe stupid stereotypical happy mumbo jumbo either such as cant cut lsd with water from the store or brown folly is mad and white folly is mama with dim give skipped passed the typical salesman and have jumped right to other entrepeneurs that share in like interest and care to look into the science rather than what most people i know do follow the guy thats eaten acid the longest noon im too analogical to just go off of hear say i want to know from a person thats dealing with portions that if iiifff their stuff was bad they wouldnt move it because in order grams make a bad review greenbuddy might order grams and write a bad review than when someone else comes to maybe buy grams they see two bad reviews and a vendor trying to sell them shit again i trust dim vendors more than i do rl vendors . quote from goodfornothing on may pmseems like a pretty bad time to be depositing
