greeted by a scam of the entire site the worst thing is that this has put me at a very tight spot but i m not so much afraid bec of me but rather because of the coming situation of distrust and high prices which will come since there will be a lot of vendors who got damaged for a much much higher amount than myself it is sad that people have to be so much greedy even when making more than decent profit with their regular business now i m out of weed and out of money i hope the rest of you find a way out of this the only thing that s bugging me is what is the guy thinking scamming m from top drug dealers in the world you are bound to get your head priced by at least one of them . im so sorry for anybody that lost out to these thieves karma will surely bring balance to this situation i would have never used that market had i known that it was owned by known credit card scammers . no prob i know alot of people are against doxxing but at the same time if you plan on stealing from customers vendors especially when its in the millions you damn well know the risks that come along with doing that . please be careful friends looks like theres the possiblility that evolution
