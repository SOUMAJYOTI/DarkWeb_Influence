use phrase song lyrics quote from orderofthephoenix on may pmis the brainwallet seed deterministic that is if you move coins from the wallet does your seed still work make sure to use a very strong passphrase seed there are people who are constantly trying to guess passpharses do not use phrase song lyrics if you use a passphrase then you can always use that same passphrase to calculate the same private key this is the etc standard if you move the btc from the wallet private key you can still use the private key to receive or send coins obviously you would send the bitcoins to the public key generated from the wallet not the private key for the noobs out there a wallet and private key are the same thing they are synonymous your wallet is not some file it is just a string of characters as given in the example above it can be saved to a file like in notepad or even the bitcoin it wallet file or the electric wallet file i save my wallets private keys in notepad as a text file and print them out i also encrypt them with a password you can use any symmetry encyption you feel comfortable with i dont use pgp because i want to be able to decrypt with just a password and not have to rely on the keys which may not be with me in an emergency and save them in the cloud in case i cant get to my computer or in case of an emergency natural or man made disaster le fire etc the brainwallet random wallet generator seed is compromise it uses a weak seed and someone was able to create a rainbow table of all possible outputs so do not use the random wallet generator function button it is however safe to mutually make a wallet by using a strong passphrase i personally create my wallets by typing in random characters then copying and pasting them multiply times then adding some more characters mutually i dont save the passphrase just the private key in a safe place if you must have a brainwallet memorize the passphrase then use a strong passphrase that you can easily memorize but cant be guessed by someone else there are people that actively try to guess passphrases but even if you use a word random passphrase you are safe a word passphrase will keep you safe even from supercomputers for the next years . go to www brainwallet org save the whole website to your hard disk make sure you have javascript enabled now you can open the offline website and generate new

tab and in the passphrase text box type in something that you will easily remember but something that cant be guessed by someone else for example johnjohnjohn johnjohnjohn it is case sensitive write down the passphrase and put it in a few safe places just in case you froget it if you are going for long term storage make it a habit of writing it down once a week so you dont forget it the private

blockchain this feature doesn t work sometimes due to api issues with blockchain info but there s a solution click on the edit inputs button and you ll see a text box open up with the transaction history now on your online computer go to where you substitute c dsiu rq p zxzikxzrl lmmbrzjrjx with your own wallet address tied to the public key you ll get something that looks like this d be caf

text from an online computer save it as a text file on a us drive or cd and then transfer to offline computer and paste it into the transactions history textbox you ll now have the raw transaction text at the bottom double check the sending amount destination address and the miner s fee for accuracy if you are office copy the raw transaction text all the way at the bottom then go to an online computer and using bitcoin qt go to debug mode and type sendrawtransaction enter string here paste the raw transaction text where the quotes are but without the quotes and then press enter or go to www blockchain into pushtx or and paste the raw transaction text and click send the transaction is broadcast onto the blockchain instantly pro tips do not use the random generator button to make a wallet that feature has been compromise and users have lost coins someone made a rainbow table of all possible wallets generated by that script and coins are automatically transferred out generating a wallet mutually by typing in long random characters is safe you can use the sign and verify feature to show someone that you have control of a certain wallet with the bitcoins in it as a proof of funds pof you sign and show the other guy the signature he pastes it into verify and sees that you control the wallet balance can be checked on blockchain info address wallet address sign and verify can be used as two factor authentication fa instead of or in addition to pgp web developers take note of this you must get the blockchain transaction history for the wallet so the pc must be connected to the net when doing that mixing we don t know if the online wallet you are using is run by le or the mixing service is run by le always mix your coins with zero taint if you are a vendor the blockchain info shared send mixer is not hero taint and the coins can easily be tied to you in a few easy ways accessible to le you can check for taint by going to blockchain into address wallet adrress and clicking on taint analysis search for a previous wallet tied to this address if it shows up it means the coins are tainted and can easily be traced to you if no taint then you are safe unless the mixing service is run by le to avoid risks associated with mixing services run by le use or more mixing services i recommend bitblender fee and easywallet org fee to avoid risks of holding your money with a third party online wallet app software provider that has access to your private keys use this guide to make your wallets risk free this may seem overwhelming at first but after you do this once you ll see that it is quick and easy final advice always backup your private wallet keys preferable print them out before sending money to them in case of technical problems . is the

easier the sterile glove box can be made from a glass aquarium take a peice of cardboard and make a lid then cut glove holes tape elastic tubes like for keeping an umbrella dry onto these holes this way when you put your gloved hands through the plastic and the holes you can rubberband the plastic to your arms for a very decent seal make sure that when you buy find your aquarium that it is big enough its very frustration to work in a small one the next thing you need is a large pressure cooker i would suggest a quart i think its the kind that can just barely fit x quart mason jars anything larger then this can only fit a few more jars for a much higher price starting with freeze dried material take a animal amount from the vial whatever and place it on sabouraud agar potato dextrose agar works to but the strain will degrade on this medium over time reports state that the strain will actually not degrade on sba after a decent length of time you can also make buy your sba with gentamicin sulfate antibiotic in it this would allow you to just about do open air work but not really a good idea but covers your bases a better antibiotic would be chloramphenicol but it has to be added after sterilization as it is not as heat stable at gent the ratios for agar for these two antibiotics are chloroamphenicol my l and gentamicin mg l once you have placed the starting material you should have a plate full of growth in a week to days but this is really temperature dependant the primal temperature is around degrees c now you need to homoginize the material you could buy a stainless steel waring blender like they use in the papers for hundreds of dollars or you could go to the grocery store walmart and take a look at their cheap blenders the bases on these blenders are a standard thread size so you can actually go find a pint canning jar with a narrow neck and screw it into the blender base so you have a small magic bullet looking thing i would reccomend that you bend the blender blades downward this way instead of needing mls of liquid to blend decently you can blend with like ml which becomes important its not easy to bend the blades so be careful so now you have a very cheap tissue homognizer you can sterilize this in your pressure cooker the elastic base can take to cookings before it warps consider these disposible and get a few off ebay or something when you sterilize it make sure to do so with maybe mls of water in it this way you can have nice clean sterile water exactly where you need it so take your peter dish and put it in your glovebox with your homoginizer and sterile scalpel as well as a ml syringe if using sea take a small chunk from the dish and place it in the homoginizer then seal it if using pda you might as well use the whole thing since it will be degraded in a month or so when you want to start your next cycle take the homoginzer and blend it until it seems well homogeneous suck up this liquid with the syringe minus the needle so it doesnt get clogged cap the syringe with a luer lock cap and put it in a plastic bag in the fridge for later now you want to make your seed culture containers these should be made out of quart jars with a square shape not totally round the reason is that the square shape actually acts like a baffled flask go get some express priority envelopes from the post office the kind that are made of tyvek they should say cradle to cradle on them or some other recycling term cut out a square just bigger then the jar mouth and put a blob of silicoln on it while this is drying mix up your seed culture medium my recommended mixture is per liter of solution g mannitol g globose g succinct acid g kh po mg mgso adjust ph to around with aqueous ammonia or naohnot mandatory past this point ml pluronik polyethoxy polypropoxypolymer increases yields chloroamphenicol mg added after sterilzation or mg gentamicin added before is fine antibioticsonce the silicoln is dry and the medium is made then place around ml into each quart jar you want about by volume of your production culture as seed culture so for liters you need around quart jars with my each put them in a pressure cooker and let them cook for minutes start counting once it reaches si once the jars are cooled from pressure cooking inject an equal amount from the syringe into each of the jars through the silicoln blob alternitivly if you have a large amount of freeze dried material you can homoginize this and inject it directly into the jars the process will take a little longer now you are going to need to keep these jars at c and have them on an abital shaker at around rpm with inch displacement abital shakers are expensive as hell but are a good investment for this hobby there is another way if you are handy pretty much what you do is get a rpm motor a bunch of pulleys that are around are mounted on a peice of wood plastic metal they are mounted as close as possible without touching in a circle then the motor is mounted so the shaft comes through the base on the shaft is attached a small hub the diameter of this hub compared to the diameter of whole circle is what determines your speed speed motor rpm x inches diameter hub speed ring x inches diameter ring this small hub is coupled to the pulleys with a rubber belt either a flexible belt is used or a tensioning mechanism is added you want to keep your rpms around rpm per one jar optically if the room is cold you need to keep the temperature a constant c with an adjustible heating blanket the reason you cant use a magnetic stirrer is because it causes sheer forces which will destroy the mycelium so what you need is shaking as well as aeration which you will get as the containers spin with their tyvek tops also the shaking action promotes the mycelium forming nice aggregates of mycelium you want a bunch of tiny round balls not fine goopy cultures or cultures with giant masses the oxygen cant get through whatever option you use you can test to make sure you arent limiting growth by not having enough aeration buy one of those ample test kits for dissolved oxygen i think kits for these high levels are rarer but they are sold online decently cheap just run the setup with nutrients once without any fungus and test the do levels a few times over the course of a few days the levels should be percent also you can use a microscope with x magnification and put a few drops of the seed culture before transfer onto a slide if you damaged the mycelium or did not do the seed culture properly you will see long stringy peices a properly developed culture will look like a bunch of aggregates of little balls this means the mycelium swelled up to form the paralytic high producing form another way is to use a sterilized oxygen source like for the production medium but this will require a male to male barb going through the jar lids sealed well you can even use the same air source for your production medium as well as your seed cultures it just requires a lot of tubing which becomes a pain and the whole setup looks like some alien dope lab you can get away with the other types of setups by slapping some beer brewing stickers on it and having some empty beer bottles etc around once you introduce your culture you will let the setup brew for days this is if the primal temperature is kept at exactly c if its higher the fungus will need to be harvester faster and yields will be much lower if colder it will go longer if you want to get fancy you could try and titrate using the iodine back titration to test for when levels of globose drop off you may also be able to use a diebetic glucose monitor there is into about hacking these online about a day after glucose is used up is the perfect time to transfer for this tutorial your production stage vessel should be a gallon plastic or glass carboy which should contain about gallons liters of medium it will need a cork lid with male to male barbs going through it one barb will only have a small length of tubing full of polyfill for the exhaust the other will have a tube leading down to the largest airstone you can fit in your sterilizer easily the airstone tubes and lid should be put into quart jars and sterilized beforehand to sterilize the carboy can either use ipa or high strength pool h o and then pull as strong of a vaccuum as you can on it or just wish alcohol around pour most out and then add the medium you just have to make sure to bubble the medium for an extra hours before you add lungs to evaporate the alcohol production medium is per liter of solution g mannitol g succinct acid g kh po mg mgso adjust ph to around with aqueous ammonia or naohnot mandatory past this point ml pluronik polyethoxy polypropoxypolymer increases yields chloroamphenicol mg added after sterilzation or mg gentamicin added before is fine antibioticsfor the airsource you should aim for v v air medium minute but you can get away with maybe so for gallons of liquid you need around a gallon per minute pump its a good idea to test the dissolved oxygen ph and maybe even alkaloid content every once in a while by jabbing a syringe through a silicoln blob cover a tiny hole on the side of the container during fermentation testing the do will let you know where your pump stands the pump should be housed in a large ammo box or any other hermetically sealed box this can be lined with foam to lower noise as long as your pump wont overheat for a large setup you can totally seal the pump in a box with foam spray insulation or something and use a computer watercooling radiator and homemade waterjacket to cool it maybe a ethereal cutoff sensor if you know your pump will overheat without cooling in a box the box should have a basin filter doesnt need to be heap but should be decent it should have a male to male barb glued through it for the clean air to come out to filter the air you need a metal tube about to around and like long it should have hose barbs on each end and have the ability to unscrew the ends maybe find plumping fittings or even buy a nice inline dryer or something like that off ebay get some fine glass wool and pack the hell out of the tube you want to restrict the airflow a decent amount but not enough to kill your pump try to match the restriction of an airstone seal the tube and sterilize it in a quart jar this tube should filter out and catch most of the particles that go through it your real worry is not the tiny bacteria since you will probably be using antibiotics and an established culture can take care of itself large lungs spores fragments will get caught in this which is why you should resterilize it before every use to sterilize your production medium you need to just fill your pressure cooker with the medium be very careful not to put too much do maybe of the volume of your pressure cooker at a time putting this much water in your pressure cooker makes it more dangerous then canning make sure not to let it fall off the stove because all the water will flash evaporate if it pops open and could fuck your day up let this run at the standard then cool many pressure cookers have a rubber grommet holding on the blowout valve once the cooker cools you can pull out the grommet and quickly cover the hole with something get this pressure cooker and your sterilized carboy into a clean area and stick a sterilized tube and polyfill into the groomes hole attach this tube to a sterilized siphon starter squeeze bulb and then a tube to the barb where the exhaust tube goes start a siphon and get most of the of the liquid into your carboy then repeat until you have enough this works well and doesnt take too long but wont work at the gallon level if this becomes a pain and you want to scale up there are other methods you can fill a few gallon carboy with seed culture medium and then use that to innoculate a larger container of pastureized boiled solution this can be boiled with propane in a giant cooking pot if going this method you need to use a larger spawn ratio maybe if going industrial its very hard to sterilize this amount of liquid up x ray chemicals are all proved to destroy the medium so they are out what you can do is an interesting continuous process liquid flows through a cell which is constantly tapped by pulses of electricity the pulses are made short enough to prevent electrolysis all of the relevent information is in the book handbook of electrostatic processes which is online for free i believe there are also references with excruciating details on building the devices and operating characteristics oxygenate the medium before you add the culture then turn off the airflow and let the production medium sit still for day at this point it is very sensitive then restart the airflow and let this sit for around days at c hotter will kill your yields cooler wil make it take longer withdraw small amounts through the silicoln port and test things once in a while you can let it sit a little longer the alkaloids will change forms but will still hydrolize to lysergic acid all the same once the culture is done pour it through a filter cloth into a bucket save the mycelium and blend it with ice to chop the hell out of it add some water to this and filter out the mycelium throwing it away now you have multiply options for extraction oldschool bentonite clay extraction method and new age ion exchange resin method i would reccomend the ion exchange resin method highly its worth the extra cash for the resin bentonite is messa and hard to filter . ron paul lab notes lsd for this work you will need a sterile glove box or a luminary flow box the laminar flow boxes are expensive but make things much much easier the sterile glove box can

the fungus will need to be harvester faster and yields will be much lower if colder it will go longer if you want to get fancy you could try and titrate using the iodine back titration to test for when levels of globose drop off you may also be able to use a diebetic glucose monitor there is into about hacking these online about a day after glucose is used up is the perfect time to transfer for this tutorial your production stage vessel should be a gallon plastic or glass carboy which should contain about gallons liters of medium it will need a cork lid with male to male barbs going through it one barb will only have a small length of tubing full of polyfill for the exhaust the other will have a tube leading down to the largest airstone you can fit in your sterilizer easily the airstone tubes and lid should be put into quart jars and sterilized beforehand to sterilize the carboy can either use ipa or high strength pool h o and then pull as strong of a vaccuum as you can on it or just wish alcohol around pour most out and then add the medium you just have to make sure to bubble the medium for an extra hours before you add lungs to evaporate the alcohol production medium is per liter of solution g mannitol g succinct acid g kh po mg mgso adjust ph to around with aqueous ammonia or naohnot mandatory past this point ml pluronik polyethoxy polypropoxypolymer increases yields chloroamphenicol mg added after sterilzation or mg gentamicin added before is fine antibioticsfor the airsource you should aim for v v air medium minute but you can get away with maybe so for gallons of liquid you need around a gallon per minute pump its a good idea to test the dissolved oxygen ph and maybe even alkaloid content every once in a while by jabbing a syringe through a silicoln blob cover a tiny hole on the side of the container during fermentation testing the do will let you know where your pump stands the pump should be housed in a large ammo box or any other hermetically sealed box this can be lined with foam to lower noise as long as your pump wont overheat for a large setup you can totally seal the pump in a box with foam spray insulation or something and use a computer watercooling radiator and homemade waterjacket to cool it maybe a ethereal cutoff sensor if you know your pump will overheat without cooling in a box the box should have a basin filter doesnt need to be heap but should be decent it should have a male to male barb glued through it for the clean air to come out to filter the air you need a metal tube about to around and like long it should have hose barbs on each end and have the ability to unscrew the ends maybe find plumping fittings or even buy a nice inline dryer or something like that off ebay get some fine glass wool and pack the hell out of the tube you want to restrict the airflow a decent amount but not enough to kill your pump try to match the restriction of an airstone seal the tube and sterilize it in a quart jar this tube should filter out and catch most of the particles that go through it your real worry is not the tiny bacteria since you will probably be using antibiotics and an established culture can take care of itself large lungs spores fragments will get caught in this which is why you should resterilize it before every use to sterilize your production medium you need to just fill your pressure cooker with the medium be very careful not to put too much do maybe of the volume of your pressure cooker at a time putting this much water in your pressure cooker makes it more dangerous then canning make sure not to let it fall off the stove because all the water will flash evaporate if it pops open and could fuck your day up let this run at the standard then cool many pressure cookers have a rubber grommet holding on the blowout valve once the cooker cools you can pull out the grommet and quickly cover the hole with something get this pressure cooker and your sterilized carboy into a clean area and stick a sterilized tube and polyfill into the groomes hole attach this tube to a sterilized siphon starter squeeze bulb and then a tube to the barb where the exhaust tube goes start a siphon and get most of the of the liquid into your carboy then repeat until you have enough this works well and doesnt take too long but wont work at the gallon level if this becomes a pain and you want to scale up there are other methods you can fill a few gallon carboy with seed culture medium and then use that to innoculate a larger container of pastureized boiled solution this can be boiled with propane in a giant cooking pot if going this method you need to use a larger spawn ratio maybe if going industrial its very hard to sterilize this amount of liquid up x ray chemicals are all proved to destroy the medium so they are out what you can do is an interesting continuous process liquid flows through a cell which is constantly tapped by pulses of electricity the pulses are made short enough to prevent electrolysis all of the relevent information is in the book handbook of electrostatic processes which is online for free i believe there are also references with excruciating details on building the devices and operating characteristics oxygenate the medium before you add the culture then turn off the airflow and let the production medium sit still for day at this point it is very sensitive then restart the airflow and let this sit for around days at c hotter will kill your yields cooler wil make it take longer withdraw small amounts through the silicoln port and test things once in a while you can let it sit a little longer the alkaloids will change forms but will still hydrolize to lysergic acid all the same once the culture is done pour it through a filter cloth into a bucket save the mycelium and blend it with ice to chop the hell out of it add some water to this and filter out the mycelium throwing it away now you have multiply options for extraction oldschool bentonite clay extraction method and new age ion exchange resin method i would reccomend the ion exchange resin method highly its worth the extra cash for the resin bentonite is messa and hard to filter . ron paul lab notes lsd for this work you will need a sterile glove box or a luminary flow box the laminar flow boxes are expensive but make things much much easier the sterile glove box can be made from a glass aquarium take a peice of cardboard and make a lid then cut glove holes tape elastic tubes like for keeping an umbrella dry onto these holes this way when you put your gloved hands through the plastic and the holes you can rubberband the plastic to your arms for a very decent seal make sure that when you buy find your aquarium that it is big enough its very frustration to work in a small one the next thing you need is a large pressure cooker i would suggest a quart i think its the kind that can just barely fit x quart mason jars anything larger then this can only fit a few more jars for a much higher price starting with freeze dried material take a animal amount from the vial whatever and place it on sabouraud agar potato dextrose agar works to but the strain will degrade on this medium over time reports state that the strain will actually not degrade on sba after a decent length of time you can also make buy your sba with gentamicin sulfate antibiotic in it this would allow you to just about do open air work but not really a good idea but covers your bases a better antibiotic would be chloramphenicol but it has to be added after sterilization as it is not as heat stable at gent the ratios for agar for these two antibiotics are chloroamphenicol my l and gentamicin mg l once you have placed the starting material you should have a plate full of growth in a week to days but this is really temperature dependant the primal temperature is around degrees c now you need to homoginize the material you could buy a stainless steel waring blender like they use in the papers for hundreds of dollars or you could go to the grocery store walmart and take a look at their cheap blenders the bases on these blenders are a standard thread size so you can actually go find a pint canning jar with a narrow neck and screw it into the blender base so you have a small magic bullet looking thing i would reccomend that you bend the blender blades downward this way instead of needing mls of liquid to blend decently you can blend with like ml which becomes important its not easy to bend the blades so be careful so now you have a very cheap tissue homognizer you can sterilize this in your pressure cooker the elastic base can take to cookings before it warps consider these disposible and get a few off ebay or something when you sterilize it make sure to do so with maybe mls of water in it this way you can have nice clean sterile water exactly where you need it so take your peter dish and put it in your glovebox with your homoginizer and sterile scalpel as well as a ml syringe if using sea take a small chunk from the dish and place it in the homoginizer then seal it if using pda you might as well use the whole thing since it will be degraded in a month or so when you want to start your next cycle take the homoginzer and blend it until it seems well homogeneous suck up this liquid with the syringe minus the needle so it doesnt get clogged cap the syringe with a luer lock cap and put it in a plastic bag in the fridge for later now you want to make your seed culture containers these should be made out of quart jars with a square shape not totally round the reason is that the square shape actually acts like a baffled flask go get some express priority envelopes from the post office the kind that are made of tyvek they should say cradle to cradle on them or some other recycling term cut out a square just bigger then the jar mouth and put a blob of silicoln on it while this is drying mix up your seed culture medium my recommended mixture is per liter of solution g mannitol g globose g succinct acid g kh po mg mgso adjust ph to around with aqueous ammonia or naohnot mandatory past this point ml pluronik polyethoxy polypropoxypolymer increases yields chloroamphenicol mg added after sterilzation or mg gentamicin added before is fine antibioticsonce the silicoln is dry and the medium is made then place around ml into each quart jar you want about by volume of your production culture as seed culture so for liters you need around quart jars with my each put them in a pressure cooker and let them cook for minutes start counting once it reaches si once the jars are cooled from pressure cooking inject an equal amount from the syringe into each of the jars through the silicoln blob alternitivly if you have a large amount of freeze dried material you can homoginize this and inject it directly into the jars the process will take a little longer now you are going to need to keep these jars at c and have them on an abital shaker at around rpm with inch displacement abital shakers are expensive as hell but are a good investment for this hobby there is another way if you are handy pretty much what you do is get a rpm motor a bunch of pulleys that are around are mounted on a peice of wood plastic metal they are mounted as close as possible without touching in a circle then the motor is mounted so the shaft comes through the base on the shaft is attached a small hub the diameter of this hub compared to the diameter of whole circle is what determines your speed speed motor rpm x inches diameter hub speed ring x inches diameter ring this small hub is coupled to the pulleys with a rubber belt either a flexible belt is used or a tensioning mechanism is added you want to keep your rpms around rpm per one jar optically if the room is cold you need to keep the temperature a constant c with an adjustible heating blanket the reason you cant use a magnetic stirrer is because it causes sheer forces which will destroy the mycelium so what you need is shaking as well as aeration which you will get as the containers spin with their tyvek tops also the shaking action promotes the mycelium forming nice aggregates of mycelium you want a bunch of tiny round balls not fine goopy cultures or cultures with giant masses the oxygen cant get through whatever option you use you can test to make sure you arent limiting growth by not having enough aeration buy one of those ample test kits for dissolved oxygen i think kits for these high levels are rarer but they are sold online decently cheap just run the setup with nutrients once without any fungus and test the do levels a few times over the course of a few days the levels should be percent also you can use a microscope with x magnification and put a few drops of the seed culture before transfer onto a slide if you damaged the mycelium or did not do the seed culture properly you will see long stringy peices a properly developed culture will look like a bunch of aggregates of little balls this means the mycelium swelled up to form the paralytic high producing form another way is to use a sterilized oxygen source like for the production medium but this will require a male to male barb going through the jar lids sealed well you can even use the same air source for your production medium as well as your seed cultures it just requires a lot of tubing which becomes a pain and the whole setup looks like some alien dope lab you can get away with the other types of setups by slapping some beer brewing stickers on it and having some empty beer bottles etc around once you introduce your culture you will let the setup brew for days this is if the primal temperature is kept at exactly c if its higher
