soon i posted this explanation on how the mixer works in another forum so i copy the same text here when you register an account you get your own deposit address deposit coins to your address and you should see them as incoming within one minute just refresh the deposit page now you will see a new button that was hidden before get new deposit address as soon as you have deposited coins to your current address you can get a new one after three network confirms the coins will be added to your balance and you can withdraw coins will be sent immediately there is no waiting time the mixer uses coin control to make sure to send you other coins than the coins you deposited it keeps track of all your old deposited coins and will not send it to you the test send button will go through and select coins just like when doing a normal withdraw but instead get back to you with an answer if there are enough coins in the mixer or not if you deposited a large amount of coins and you get a negative response on test send what you can do is leave the coins on the mixer to let it mix with other users and withdraw a small amount every day to different addresses each time if you still want to withdraw just do a normal send and it will do it the automatic withdraw feature is like coinkites auto forwarding it will automatically send coins to the address you set as your automatic withdraw address whenever coins are deposited to your account it will however not automatically send coins if there is not enough coins in the mixer but it will keep trying until there is to override this just log in and turn off the automatic withdraw and it will immediately send you the coins even if it means you will receive parts of your own old deposited coins . the fog is having delays and not showing
