sleep so off to bed i went pretty sure that my wallet would have the funds by the morning when i woke i logged onto blockchain and saw that there were confirmations on the blockchain but still nothing in my agra wallet a support request has gone unanswered but a banner on all agora pages now states we are aware of the payment issues working on the solution so almost two days after making the

admit im worried for my just please done make any deposits until this is sorted . agora deposits and withdrawal and forums been down for hours agra message not long ago reddit dear users we are sorry again for the lack of communication the current problems are a direct result of our security model even though at this time it was unfortunate that many of you had to wait for your money because of this as our availability faq has stated we always value security above availability and feel this is the only way to run an operation like ours we believe this is also on of the reasons we were one of the few to withstand the test of time and seizures the upstanding withdrawals should be complete during the day for future withdrawals expect some minor delays in the order of a couple of hours between the adding of payout and the transaction broadcasting until the problem is completely resolved in the middle of next week the forums might take a couple of days as well we are putting all our resources on solving the payment issues . right now agora is inaccessible in hoping and pretty confident that this is as a result of the efforts to fix the payments issue i hope i dont turn out be being hopelessly niaive here . yea for real there must be a shitload of coins in escrow also in concerned if evolution could handle the massive influx of new users . quote from jack harkness on
