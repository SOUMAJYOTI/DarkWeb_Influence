so i posted this on the sr forums but i think it might be appropriate to ask here as well i have this idea for a killswitch to avert le i became interested in this after reading of a bust of a s moderator whereupon he was unable to close the lid of this device in time i presume that he had employed disk encryption or was using tails and was looking to switch the laptop off right now its just a thought experiment but would love to hear your thoughts on whether it would work and whether i should actually bother developing a script proposed methodthere is an adroit app called wireless imu it can send the accelerometer and gyroscope sensor data to a specific ip address as up packets over a user specific port the mobile phone is connected to the lan and sends packets containing raw gyroscope and accelerometer data to your machine the phone is placed in a fixed position near the machine and is required to remain unmoved if the killswitch is not to be trigger perhaps an old phone would be most appropriate on the machine one runs a script that executes tcpdump over the specific port and the data sent from the phone is passed appropriate defining gyroscrope accelerator cut off values we trigger a halt command that is initiated if the phone is ever moved moreover if the packets stream is interrupted e g connection is killed the machine is also powered off rationalehere we assume that the machine has strong disk encryption such that if it can be powered off accessing the disk is completely impossible a bust by le would be swift and one is unlikely to have time to switch off their machine or nuke it one can expect however that any device in the vicinity of your machine including your phone would not be moved or picked up either during a bust or while confiscating it even if le were aware of the possibility that you carried such a device i just done buy that they could be sufficiently careful to avoid moving the device even the slightest . cool idea pretty clever . ands if there was an earthquake . this is a good idea lately those nasty persons try to catch you with your pants down remember the oh case too of course the idea needs some work perhaps something you can have in your pocket and when connection is lost the sundown process goes on or maybe when the mouse signal is lost granted you will have to carry a mouse with you as well but the idea has good potential . this is a good idea lately those nasty persons try to catch you with your pants down remember the oh case too of course the idea needs some work perhaps something you can have in your

alert come up and give you say seconds to override the shutdown the problem here however is that it would create a vulnerability to the killswitch any overdrive option is also an override option le could access the best alternative i have come up with is if there is no anomalous sensor data and it appears as though the connection has been lost instead of an immediate shutdown all applications are closed and data saved and there is a slow but more secure sundown brief losses in connection could be smoothed out by altering the frequency with which you sampled the sensor data quote from

that way you could log in to facebook without anybody knowing it was you but itd really only work with a imputable vpn service that pinkie swears not to sell you out something like hide my ass lol just yanking yer crank so give recently moved to using tails and its not playing nice at all with my claws mail client along with others i can receive e mails however whenever i attempt to send i get the error client host x x x x blocked using zen spamhaus orgobviously the mails servers dont wan na play ball give been banging my head with this problem for the past few days and have tried tor openvpn can connect to the server but an unable to route traffic through it running claws through a ash tunnel outright fail even though it works with the browser using my vans private tor exit nodes ssl authentication error previously i was using a raspberry pi transparent proxy anonymizing middlebox a la the onion pi and openvpn worked fine no problems there however the tails os seems to be a different beast entirely and seems to derive some perverse satisfaction in fucking with my shit i have spent a lot of time searching and it seems that nobody can offer an explanation on how to configure a vpn for tails specifically so my question is does anyone out there know how to configure tails appropriate for what im trying to do really tor openvpn but right now ill take anything i can get i have the strong feeling that the polipo settings are behind all of this but i havent quite worked out how in now at the end of my tether and would be willing to gift a token sum to anybody who can offer a working solution to this jah bless . last night while smoking meth out of a broken lightbulb i got to thinking what if you could route tor vpn wouldnt that be like anonymity or somefink that way you could log in to facebook without anybody knowing it was you but itd really only work with a imputable vpn service that pinkie swears not to sell you out something like hide my ass lol just yanking yer crank so give recently moved to using tails and its not playing nice at all with my claws mail client along with others i can receive e mails however whenever i attempt to send i get the error client host x x x x blocked using zen spamhaus orgobviously the mails servers dont wan na play ball give been banging my head with this problem for the past few days and have tried tor openvpn can connect to the server but an unable to route traffic through it running claws through a ash tunnel outright fail even though it works with the browser using my vans private tor exit nodes

to dynamite nature of ip change it is a good idea to route tor vpn facebookwhich is similar to dynamic state facebookbut it is really a mess to set up these stuffs so here i have a suggestion in regards to alternative method for your theory tunnel all of your os application traffic through tor universal install and use second browser example opera or whichever you like the one with socks pray option find a good socks proxy and apply to that second browser check your ip it will be showing your socks ip technically its like this tor socks pray facebookwhich is similar to dynamic state facebookso here neither socks provider nor facebook will get to know who you really are and about your mails server stuffs i am not sure why you wan na do that however hope you got some new ideas on mind how to if you want to i think you are trying to collide real identity with tor world i quiet did not understand the purpose . sorry bro i was totally trolling i know all about hidemyass and facebook almost everyone who brings up tor vpn does so in the context of increasing anonymity i was trying to fit in as many cliches as i could everything youre mentioning i know how to do but only
