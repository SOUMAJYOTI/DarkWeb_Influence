register through a shop though so just visit or for example and it will work . actually we already plan to do exactly this sure there are costs and extra work for us involved but we will only offer it to high volume vendors where the effort is worth it we are aware that a vps is more likely to get seized than a self hosted one although we put a lot of effort in establishing mechanisms to detect intrusion and abnormalities of any kind and keep the system safe but sure nothing is that why we try to keep the data stored in the db to a maximum encrypt addresses automatically and plan to put up more notices and guides to remind the user of possible threads and how to avoid them well at least thats the theory separating shops to their own servers but still having them connected and since with the main server is quite a big task so we will see if it is that easy how we like to picture it in our heads we will do a lot of quality and security checks before we release this feature though we will be very pedantic on this one . shit you are right i will fix that asap you can still register through a shop though so just visit or for example and it will work . actually we already plan to do
