opinions on this you are depending on the vps provider if you plan to use a vs pay with bitcoin connect only via tor red quote . no its not particularly safe but everybody does it anyway there are three huge problems with vps hosting for hidden services its impossible to completely isolate the server from the tor instance providing the hidden service this means that the best youre going to do is a did based iptables rule to keep non tor traffic from exiting the box quite a few people arent even bright enough to get this much right when someone gets root on the vps they can pull down the iptables rules and deanonymize the box in a second hell ifconfig a pretty much deanonymizes the box at that point the vps provider has a complete level of visibility into your box if they choose to theres really nothing they cant see or do to your environment they can strace processes view memory take snapshots while your vps is live etc their ability to directly read memory is the worst part they can scrape it for crypto keys capture passwords etc no method or amount of encryption on the vps can save you from this btw when someone exploits the vps provider console management interface they have root on your vps instance this one happens fairly often someone exploits a bug in solusvm or another vps provider management console and gets control over every vps box in their environment including yours a better solution is a rented dedicated server running xen or another hypervisor and using the hypervisor to isolate the server actually providing the http or other service from the tor instance that advertises the onion address servervm private virtual network form internet in that scenario when someone pwns the servervm they cant deanonymize it by sending arbitrary traffic out theyre stuck behind the torvm and can only send traffic via tor to deanonymize the servervm reflectively they need to exploit the hypervisor first in that architecture the torvm should only be allowed to send in out the tor traffic the hypervisor probably shouldnt even really be on a public network except to bridge traffic to the torvm and damned sure shouldnt accept arbitrary traffic from the internet itself the best solution is physical isolation the server would be on a separate physical box from the tor instance connected only by a crossover cable however that architecture is difficult to find in a rented anonymous environment if youre doing something that seriously annoys first world governments you probably have to worry about hardware deanonymization in that scenario too once someone has access they can pull aerial numbers mac addresses etc that may be able to identify the box via tracing the supply chain a few handy tips if you have to use a vps your http server should not answer requests on clearnet if its handling tor based requests from a hidden onion address nothing good is going to come from that and a million bad things will come from it guaranteed your http service on a vps should only be bound to localhost never to a real ip actually your vps shouldnt be accepting any clearnet traffic aside from the tor traffic it needs open to function and your

providing to the world youre just putting yourself and everyone that connects to your box at risk bandwidth consumption cpu memory and storage utilization are the three most visible pieces of information that a vs provider monitors if youre using enough cpu to affect other vps users the provider stuck on the overlooked and oversold vps hosting box someone will eventually come looking at whats going on remember the provider can see your individual process details so there going to see that us bin strange shit is consuming all the cpu and theyll wonder what is that doing . i assume you mean to contact the vps over clearnet for management purposes a hidden onion service for management ssh onioncat etc or alternate connectivity method is probably a better idea than clearnet for management i personally wouldn run a private exit node because its going to have to directly touch clearnet and tor and be identifiable to me on the learned side but you raise a good point that should be reiterated to anyone reading this thread and deciding to set up a hasted hidden service every interaction you have with the vps or hosting provider has the possibility of generating paths back to the real you payment is an obvious one but so is logging into the vs console from your real ip or a vpon managing your vps etc from a real ip etc if youre using ash public key auth for management make

at home the server was in france the hosting provider is believed to be oh none of the sr servers were hasted at home either but they were all discovered the problem with hosting at home is that its undeniable you are the owner whereas if you rent a server anonymously then even if your hidden service is found they wont necessarily be able to find you the point is it is stupid to host from home . gumby is right fh was at oh in france and based on opdarknet logs and their owners posts on clearnet forums im fairly confident they were using virtual isolation and however they got caught in fairly sure it wasnt because they correctly isolated their serve instances as with almost any security decision its balancing risks and rewards vps based hosting gives you the risk of being discovered by the vps provider assuming youre doing something the provider cares about and if the box gets hacked till get deanonymized you balance that with the awareness that a vs environment should be disposal with nothing to tie it to its owner of course you cant ensure the integrity of any of your data or onion key in that environment so plan accordingly hosting at home seems stupid once your deanonymized but if you can reflectively use physical isolation and do it right you are probably much more resistance to being deanonymized in the first place i dont think thats as crazy of an idea as people think but you better be damned sure youre doing it right if you go that route theres not a perfect solution anonymously renting a dedicated server and using a hypervisor to provide isolation is probably the best balance . what about in theory if you host it at your home but the machine which the hidden service resides on can only access the internet through an anonymous vpn service lets assume that this

be forced by court order to keep logs this happened to hide my ass and another vpn which escapes me right now just remember that nobody will go to jail for you check out my post about the pedophile ring was a good read thank you how about this solution tor over vpn like axa mentioned it here i dont want to be a pain in the ass just trying to find the best solution available to a person . quote

really do not have a definition answer for you because nobody agrees on this i am the kind of person who is a needle in a haystack type that likes to blend in with the crowd mirage likes his her obfuscated bridges axa likes his her vpn tor you will never get everyone to come together on this never ending debate find one that you feel best about sorry for the lack of an answer . quote from cicada on february pmplease elaborate on the hypervisor use case if possible references to detailed example documentation most appreciated is it safe to assume the torvm is comprised of a barebones installation with iptables dropping everything but tor traffic i dont know of an off the shelf play by play set of documentation for virtual isolation of hidden services the simplest method is probably using phoenix gateway and a servicevm either on phoenix workstation or a bare install of linux bsd behind it all running under virtualbox probably the best method would involve configuring xen using paravirtualization not hvm so theres less attack surface at the hypervisor to provide a bridge interface from the ethernet adapter to the outside virtual interface of thetorvm then using a separate virtual interface between the inside of the torvm and the service yes the middlebox torvm should pretty much just have a tor instance and properly configured iptables pf etc firewall ruleset the tor instance will host the onion service the overlay picture looks like this enduser x tor hops to hidden service tor instance on torvm servervmlogically the only traffic the servervm should be seeing from the torvm is inbound http requests assuming web server is what were talking about therefore the only legitimate traffic that the firewall rule on the inside interface of the torvm should have to allow in that interface are responses to http requests you could track state on traffic leaving the torvm for the servervm and only allow established connections to come back in if you lock it down this far literally nothing with a son bit should be allowed out from the servervm once you think its good you should at least use nmap or something similar to make sure you cant get traffic out past the torvm youll have to have a way to manage the servervm so you will need to allow appropriate management traffic to it if your management happens over tor in recommend at least considering the use of client authorization for hidden management services in that scenario your tor client needs a hidservauth entry to get to the management onion address and the torvm will need to host a separate management onion address service with access controlled via the hiddenserviceauthorizeclient directive if i was going to build one on xen id go dissemble qubes os and steal as much as possible they already solve most of these problems theyre just doing it from a client perspective instead of a server one . quote from cicada on february pmplease elaborate on the hypervisor use case if possible
