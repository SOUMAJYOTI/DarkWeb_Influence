these tabs but theres also something else the real magic started when i closed my eyes it was like watching a cartoon but not just random images i could feel the story behind it its hard to explain i wish you could see it for yourself sure i ordered a few berkeleys from mrpickles great acid very colorful and energetic but i prefer his gdf blotters i think that eventually its a matter of taste i

why have competition helps agora is that they can t handle the amount of people that are trying to use the site how much money have they made in the last hours pretty close to if their servers are being overlooked then they would want less customers so they could keep the servers up like you said le wants results and the thing is the general public doesn t know the difference between bb nucleus

they would want less customers so they could keep the servers up agree competition for the entire dnm community benefits everyone overlay agora is getting much less benefit than any new smaller dnm and in relation to them is actually at a loss based on competition benefits they are a victim of their own success right now if they changed to maintaining a smaller market share the could last longer but then they will cut into their profits and le risk remains constant quote from scidmt on may amlike you said le wants results and the thing is the general public doesnt know the difference between
