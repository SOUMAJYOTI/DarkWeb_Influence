so give finished going through the draft of oracles memoirs that got posted out of order to srfs newbie forum and it was interesting reading i think theres lots of truths in there and probably a few stretches here and there one specific thing id like to point out is that the post miscategorizes a truly hilarious impo posting of stexos i have the original thread in my archives so ill include some of the other posts for background i think oracle only had access to the original post not the entire thread so may have lost the context of it oracles leading commentary in bold quotestexo while maintaining his original handle first denounced his association with sr to distance himself from his real intention but then vouched for the new sr forums and publicly stated he had advised and helped rally the troops but said he declined and offer to join the team as seen by a post you all may remember discussion silk road discussion topic started by stexo on october pmtitle do not join silkroad and reasons hypos by stexo on october unfortunately some members of the forum who most of us have never heard of are now planning their own silkroad and i feel to prevent problems later down the line i will state exactly why it is a bad idea and how you are endangering yourself by joining there the users behind it are cluelesshaving watched the threads about it it is obvious to me and anyone who knows what they are talking about that these people are trying to throw buzz words out but dont actually understand anything that they plan to do they promise security they promise functionality yet they dont understand dpr had phenomena security on his part and silkroad was only found as he used a connection between his real identity and silkroad one at he very start but his going security was very good the concept of making it more secure is nonsense they couldnt even explain the former silkroad infrastructure if they tried or how to for example stop a ddos on hidden services this might not seem an issue to people but let us think about it freehom hosting if le get hold of a server they can put exploits in to attack and identify users the first assault they done on hidden services with the hit on freedom hosting was a test of our strengths and the next will be a test of our weaknesses and i do not want a bunch of fools running any server i visit because although i consider myself one of the most secure users around here with many layers of isolation making even a tailor attack difficult i know the nsa if they really wanted could still rip off my covers because they have an army of workers and billions in funding a bunch of nobodies making a marketplace almost overnight is not going to last if hackers get it everyone loses their coins and are completely exposed to whatever the hacker wants to do with their information and if anonymous manage to get it they will almost certainly make their findings public information so it wont just be le youd have to worry about but anyone else who seems you as fair game including every other government in the world they are taking the idea of another and attempting to ride its reputationdpr made silkroad it was a new era of selling drugs online taking the name of silkroad although it had its flaws and then trying to create something out of it is just disrespectful to the idea that silkroad has now brought to the masses of a free marketplace if you can truly create a much improved marketplace you do not need to take silkroads name to do it all you will be doing is attempting to hijack the attention of silkroad i will never trust a marketplace run by a methamphetamine drug addictthe instability of somebody who is absolutely dependent on something liketh instability of somebody who is absolutely dependent on something like methamphetamine should be enough to scare anyone off and yes give seen the messages youve sent to various staff and your little threats against dpr to expose him a while ago done think i am ignorant or that i am an isolated entity i talk to many other well known members and staff and your pathetic antics are well known so i feel this is good to publish here so others can be wary of just how pathetic it all really is i could go on further but if the above doesnt convince you why it is a bad idea i feel i would be wasting my time debating this with you that post wasnt referring to
