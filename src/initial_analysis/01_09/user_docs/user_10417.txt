status not be yellow the reason i suggest this is due to the forum still being down and under maintenance to me it is hard to trust a site that cant operate a forum but i understand this may be confusing for people so maybe it should be green because your focusing on the site itself part of me agrees with what youre saying however it may just be a simple case of a lack of man power and only being able to handle so much at once give used nucleus numerous times both recently and in the past without any issues at all so the current lack of a forum isnt going to prevent me from buying what i want from a particular vendor with places like the hub and reddit now visited by many dnm users perhaps the need to have a working market forum isnt what it used to be if you have the staff to handle the additional workload a forum would bring then by all means open up a forum but if you dont in rather the market admin s devote all their time and energy into the market itself rather than run a poorly moderated forum and a marketplace with a lot of downtime caused by ongoing issues very fair point mate i have used nucleus since it opened up and never had an issue but then again i said that about evolution we can all hope it is as you say and they are understaffed and focusing on the site itself rather than a forum time will always give an answerlets hope its a good one and not another dnm down the drain peacemj . cool thanks for the plate glad they are staying around . is there anyone who is surprised this is could be happening ab will be responsible for one of the biggest exit

etc price flux but this is just visual actual btc amount you have in escrow does not change it has been discussed in forum and you can check your orders in escrow to see the amount of btc you have in escrow with orders does not change when the price changes go and ad up all your escrow orders and check back next morning you see the amount is the same alphabaysupport points an hour ago this is bullshit the btc amount in escrow remains the same the in escrow us value will vary according to the price but this has no influence on how much is in escrow if you place an order today for btc you will see in escrow usd if tomorrow the price falls you will see in escrow usd for example but you still have etc in escrow and this will never change unless the buyer does a partial release when it gets finalized you get etc minus comission regardless of how much the etc price was at the start the in escrow us value is provided only for your convenience hope this is clear . quote from anything

nothing surprises me anymore in relation to dnms in sure well know more in due course thanks for the post . this is an announcement from the alphabay market quotealphabay can now be used as a coin tumbler alphabay can now safely be used as a coin tumbler this means that no level of blockchain analysis can prove that your coins come from alphabet since we use our own obfuscation technology making a deposit and withdrawing after is now a way to tumble your coins and break the link to the source of the funds since tumbling is not illegal and since we leave no paper trail you now have ironclad plausible deniabilty with your bitcoins alphabay s withdrawal fee is a fixed to btc contrary to most mixer who charge up to from the transaction amount and allows you to input up to different addresses for a single withdrawal each withdrawal will be random split across those addresses along with an rational random delay in sending of up to hours in relation to the above announcement i will say that the ab admin s are marketing geniuses and know how to promote certain aspects of their site in a way that will entice both new and existing customers into using it when conducting business on the market they will no doubt ensure its lawless functionality in the interim as they gain the confidence of their customers and word of mouth starts to spread amongst the dnm community it ticks all the right boxes and offers a service which beats the price of all other market competitors as well as centralizing the process to just the one website where you can now buy your drugs and tumble any spare coins when making a withdrawal at the one place im willing to bet some people will foolishly deposit coins into their ab accounts and then withdraw them soon after in an attempt to save some coin in commission fees its just another way of attracting more coin into the market in preparation for a planned exit scam at some point in the future its going to happen one day and with nucleus now seemingly gone forever and many former nuc customers migrating to other markets such as ab the stars are aligning for a huge pay day if the ab admins are ready it just depends on how much coin they

can see this for yourself if you are a vendor this is not suspicion this is fact and any vendor can see it for themselves im posting this on a throwaway account because i still have lots of money in escrow and i dont want alphabay to steal it after they see this post first i will tell you how their scam works this only happens to your money in escrow not your available balance if the price of bitcoin goes up alphabet automatically removes bitcoins from your escrow balance to match the dollar amount of your original escrow balance they do this once per day with an automatic script what happens when bitcoin goes back down well nothing youre just fucked they dont add bitcoin back into your account in sure ab will say they try to match the us price to make things easier on you but its a one way adjustment in their favor and none of the other markets do this i shouldnt have to point out the obvious fact that this is plain old theft they are literally removing bitcoin from our accounts if i lose money when bitcoin goes down i should be able to make it back when bitcoin goes up the more the price of bitcoin fluctuates the more money they steal here is how to see it for yourself if you are a vendor go to any sale details page and look at the total in escrow number this is the original amount you earned on a sale commission has already been subtract it is the fair amount you should earn on your sale now add up this total in escrow number for all pending sales sales that havent been finalized yet then compare that total number with the escrow holdings in the sidebar your escrow holdings in the side bar will be lower than the total in escrow from all your pending sales that means that alphabay has trimmed your account here is a screen shot in case you are still confused can also watch it happenning if you are patient all you have to do is disable all your listings and done make any withdrawals from your alphabet wallet for a few days add up the escrow holdings and current balance and you will see coins disappear each day as long as the price of btc goes up its happening to all vendors they are probably making thousands of dollars per week on with this scam its not right its not fair its theft im sure some of you will say what do you expect its a drug market not amazon well you know what i expect i expect honesty not latent and systematic theft from all sellers mods alphabet needs to be removed from the superlist or be given an active warning until they stop stealing this violates the th rule for a market to be on the superlist users must be able to withdraw their coins well im not able to withdraw all my coins because alphabet stole them please do your duty and hold them accountable any alphabet vendors here who can check this . quote

skimming bitcoin from all vendor escrow accounts i will explain how you can see this for yourself if you are a vendor this is not suspicion this is fact and any vendor can see it for themselves im posting this on a throwaway account because i still have lots of money in escrow and i dont want alphabay to steal it after they see this post first i will tell you how their scam works this only happens to your money in escrow not your available balance if the price of bitcoin goes up alphabet automatically removes bitcoins from your escrow balance to match the dollar amount of your original escrow balance they do this once per day with an automatic script what happens when bitcoin goes back down well nothing youre just fucked they dont add bitcoin back into your account in sure ab will say they try to match the us price to make things easier on you but its a one way adjustment in their favor and none of the other markets do this i shouldnt have to point out the obvious fact that this is plain old theft they are literally removing bitcoin from our accounts if i lose money when bitcoin goes down i should be able to make it back when bitcoin goes up the more the price of bitcoin fluctuates the more money they steal here is how to see it for yourself if you are a vendor go to any sale details page and look at the total in escrow number this is the original amount you earned on a sale commission has already been subtract it is the fair amount you should earn on your sale now add up this total in escrow number for all pending sales sales that havent been finalized yet then compare that total number with the escrow holdings in the sidebar your escrow holdings in the side bar will be lower than the total in escrow from all your pending sales that means that alphabay has trimmed your account here is a screen shot in case you are still confused can also watch it happenning if you are patient all you have to do is disable all your listings and done make any withdrawals from your alphabet wallet for a few days add up the escrow holdings and current balance and you will see coins disappear each day as long as the price of btc goes up its happening to all vendors they are probably making thousands of dollars per week on with this scam its not right its not fair its theft im sure some of you will say what do you expect its a drug market not amazon well you know what i expect i expect honesty not latent and systematic theft from all sellers mods alphabet needs to be removed from the superlist or be given an active warning until they stop stealing this violates the th rule for a market to be on the superlist users must be able to withdraw their coins well im not able to withdraw all my coins because alphabet stole them please do your duty and hold them accountable any alphabet vendors here who can check this . using ab as a tumbler is one of the dumbest ideas give heard in some time hoof is right they are fattening the sheep for a huge payday down

functionality in the interim as they gain the confidence of their customers and word of mouth starts to spread amongst the dnm community it ticks all the right boxes and offers a service which beats the price of all other market competitors as well as centralizing the process to just the one website where you can now buy your drugs and tumble any spare coins when making a withdrawal at the one place im willing to bet some people will foolishly deposit coins into their ab accounts and then withdraw them soon after in an attempt to save some coin in commission fees its just another way of attracting more coin into the market in preparation for a planned exit scam at some point in the future its going to happen one day and with nucleus now seemingly gone forever and many former nuc

from mj on november pmshould its status not be yellow the reason i suggest this is due to the forum still being down and under maintenance to me it is hard to trust a site that cant operate a forum but i understand this may be confusing for people so maybe it should be green because your focusing on the site itself part of me agrees with what youre saying however it may just be a simple case of a lack of man power and only being able to handle so much at once give used nucleus numerous times both recently and in the past without any issues at all so the current lack of a forum isnt going to prevent me from buying what i want from a particular vendor with places like the hub and reddit now visited by many dnm users perhaps the need to have a working market forum isnt what it used to be if you have the staff to handle the additional workload a forum would bring then by all means open up a forum but if you dont in rather the market admin s devote all their time and energy into the market itself rather than run a poorly moderated forum and a marketplace with a lot of downtime caused by ongoing issues . this is alarming and might be true to some extent wouldnt rule it out be safe brothers and sisters . quote from arcane on april amquote from hoof hearted on april amquote from agito on april amclearnet link from vendor bbmcthis is why give been saying that nucleus owner has

through it k lots of small payments in but the bulk of the money is from nucleus not bad for months the troubling part if we look at it in walletexplorer we can see that he cashed out btc to localbitcoins recently down to nd april he deposited and btc to localbitcoins without tumbling i think that one subpoena to lbc later nucleus went down and that guys usually busy wallet fell silent i didnt want to post this on the main sub it may be that the marketplace admins were arrested at the same time or that they havent confirmed the arrest in case it alerted the cops to the fact that they have the right man in custody and not a very big vendor they must surely know that they have arrested nucleus owner because the site is still down the cops may have access to the server but i think they would have put up a seized notice by now and started draining the bitcoins i really hope im wrong and this is a straight exit scam because at least were cant read all your messages between you and vendors lets all keep our fingers crossed for mr nucleus something bad has happened but he hasnt robbed us and it looks like he did manage to shut his atop down before the cops got it and hes telling them nadab youve probably seen enough of blockexplorer to make you think twice about taking your bitcoin out now even if you could the best scenario is that mr nucleus manages to sneak his user id and password out via his lawyer to one of the admins they bring the site back up for a day or two and you all withdraw your nitcoin and delete anything you can site owners can sneak their earnings out if they tumble them mr nucleus did a good job of hiding amongst the crowd but if you take bitcoin out when the site is down and normal users cant withdraw bitcoin cops will spot that you are the site owner like i did btc is quite a lot to sell in one day on localbitcoins even if you keep each transaction down to btc localbitcoins are based in finland not north korea if the cops ask for the username assotiated with a particular wallet address they have to cooperate and the cops have your name account number and sort code im going to get rolled by the usual guys telling you i done know anything about bitcoin but you can follow my working above for yourself remember that walletexplorer is good at looking at the whole wallet app eg electrum multibit mycelium which can all use several or thousands of bitcoin addresses blockchain info is better at looking at one address at a time it doesnt know if a wallet belongs to nucleus or localbitcoins or the same android phone never done before the time time timethis is a very plausible explanation for what may have occurred and it could well be an accurate assessment of what actually happened to nucleus i guess time will tell all i find it hard to believe that a dnm admin could make such a stupid mistake like sell dirty untumbled coins through localbitcoins without having tumbled them first however as troubling as that is nothing surprises me anymore in relation to dnms in sure well know more in due course thanks for the post is this some of bombs legendary meth fueled blockchain forensics whilst in take anything bomb

fucks about tumbling i love me a good rocket fueled rant of tinfoil helmet nature the person above me is a good and fun person . i agree this is very plausible as hoof and others have said nuke has

quite plausible . having read some of the comments poosass points hours ago you should have done your homework before crying here like a bitch ab system has a clitch where the escrow changes by the etc price flux but this is just visual actual btc amount you have in escrow does not change it has been discussed in forum and you can check your orders in escrow to see the amount of btc you have in escrow with orders does not change when the price changes go and ad up all your escrow orders and check back next morning you see the amount is the same alphabaysupport points an hour ago this is bullshit the btc amount in escrow remains the same the in escrow us value will vary according to the price but this has no influence on how much is in escrow if you place an order today for btc you will see in escrow usd if tomorrow the price falls you will see in escrow usd for example but you still have etc in escrow and this will never change unless the buyer does a partial release when it gets finalized you get etc minus comission regardless of how much the etc price was at the start the in escrow us value is provided only for your convenience hope this is clear . quote from jaxinshit
