tails is verified why and how am i still compromise what do you mean by verified there are still vulnerabilities out there whether theyre publicly known or not days it can still be compromise like any other operating system if you are using it as a live os then it will revert back to its initials state each time it is rooted however you mentioned persistent storage so i dont think this applies to you likelihood of hour surveillance for non vendor nothing to help you with here either in imagine that it depends on your weight and the workload of the police force my area would love to get ahold of anybody buying drugs off the dreaded darknet it would eat up local media feds pass off surveillance after nothing found to local pd likely does it have to be same agency i imagine they work together depending on how big of a fish you are to them i wouldn be surprised if they didnt just have local pd do it as to not waste their time where did all the real motherfuckers go i look around and i see many le shills and nooks many just because my join date is recent doesnt make me any more less real than pinocchio .
