something can not live like a king but not being in jail would be pretty cool . also is my idea correct that all i need to remember is my password and wallet seed in order to restore any wallet from anywhere even years from now . so i have been trying to figure out the answer to this question for a year now if i stash the coin on a paper wallet as they rip apart the apartment i rent they will find it and seize it along with all of my other belongings everyone has an opinion on how to store bitcoins for a long period of time but this is not a regular situation they need to be hidden i have no friends or family i can stash them with that would not give it over to le i suppose the only solution is to make a wallet memorize the mnemonic and password repeat it daily while i am serving my year prison sentence then when i get out hope the coin is not worthless access the money using any bitin client with the recovery seed launder and retire on it i am not a fan of burying the wallet as what happens when someones goes to put a new pool in in theory i could bury copies of the wallet places all over the world on encrusted flash drives in remote places then i could put a geotag in the box with the paper wallet and drive but is the geotag not going to go bad in that time also the gps device to find the tag would get me caught i guess i could find the lat and longitude who am i walter white the exact coordinates wont give me an x to start digging at just a large area where it is locked landmarks change over time not to mention i might be watched some after i am let out of prison so if they see my drive into the desert with a shovel le might say something i would rather skip jail altogether but it is best to have backup plans i have been stashing a good amount of coin several places now i am stashing a large amount with electrum on a tails drive the ideal situation is i have the coin stashed in a place i keep the wallet address i deposit profit every day into that wallet address it grows and grows then eventually when i am busted they seize what they can when they ask where all the money is ill say what you mean its not there then i get out of jail in the future recover the money retire any thoughts advice or suggestions will really help i done want this all to be for nothing i was a very popular vendor on evolution and am one of the largest sized

them with that would not give it over to le i suppose the only solution is to make a wallet memorize the mnemonic and password repeat it daily while i am serving my year prison sentence then when i get out hope the coin is not worthless access the money using any bitin client with the recovery seed launder and retire on it i am not a fan of burying the wallet as what happens when someones goes to put a new pool in in theory i could bury copies of the wallet places all over the world on encrusted flash drives in remote places then i could put a geotag in the box with the paper wallet and drive but is the geotag not going to go bad in that time also the gps device to find the tag would get me caught i guess i could find the lat and longitude who am i walter white the exact coordinates wont give me an x to start digging at just a large area where it is locked landmarks change over time not to mention i might be watched some after i am let out of prison so if they see my drive into the desert with a shovel le might say something i would rather skip jail altogether but it is best to have backup plans i have been stashing a good amount of coin several places now i am stashing a large amount with electrum on a tails drive the ideal situation is i have the coin stashed in a place i keep the wallet address i deposit profit every day into that wallet address it grows and grows then eventually when i am busted they seize what they can when they ask where all the money is ill say what you mean its not there then i get out of jail in the future recover the money retire any thoughts advice or suggestions will really help i done want this all to be for nothing i was a very popular vendor on evolution and am one of the largest sized vendors on agora i also run my own private site prison will not be a short stint ill hang myself in my cell if there is no light at the end of this tunnel thank youalso is my idea correct that all i need to remember is my password and wallet seed in order to restore any wallet from anywhere even years from now . yes that is correct assuming bitcoin is still elegant . quote from chosen on march amyou think they arent going to get your photos dna scars and anything else they can get to id you i thought you wanted to get your millions after jail why dont you just run before they get you and take the money with you dude stop making sense running wont help they will find me anywhere targets like me once idd can not escape with that said it is just making more and more sense to get a tattoo someone please tell me there is a different answer is it possible for you to create your own wallet seed mnemonic or is it always random . try this one biochne kzdkcut r qp txzg u krzwd . you think they arent going to get your photos dna scars and anything else they can get to id you i thought you wanted to get your millions after jail why dont you just run before they get you and take the money with you . also is my idea correct that all i need to remember is my password and wallet seed in order to restore any wallet from anywhere even years from now . quote from chosen on march am is there a way to make sure that tails gedit program does not save the time and date a file is created or last dated or saved can you just change the date in tails to some past date and touch the file that should reflectively set the date of last accesse i could be wrong though maybe tails wont allow it unix you can do that though in the document you can click edit preferences then uncheck save date a timebut it does nothing at all when i right click the saved documents and click properties it still has creation date and last time modified so my story would be good then they would ask if i received the drive like that why does it say it was modified yesterday then i would be sucked anyone know how to turn of this time stamp or delete it thanks . is my idea correct that all i need to remember is my password and wallet seed in order to restore any wallet from anywhere even years from now anyone . i have a lot of text files i keep saved on my tails persistent drive every file is pip encrusted to my key but if i have been busted i will be forced to give over my key my store is worldwide but i operate out of the united states so i have to deal with the laws here if you believe that this would be self incrimination which is illegal read any of the clearnet articles below all of my text files encrusted is rascally meaningless as on the same device is my pip key to decrypt them all a great situation would be to have every text document encrypted to a key only made for the use of encrypting my personal files then i would import the key from a place online where i store it to decrypt them if le asks for me to decrypt everything i will say how ill claim i purchased the tails drive from one of the vendors who sell premade tails drives on agora ill claim that it had all of those things already on it and i dont know anything about it which brings up another thing is there a way to make sure that tails gedit program does not save the time and date a file is created or last dated or saved i need to keep these documents to run my store if they are decrypted and viewed by law enforcement my cozy years in prison becomes life any thoughts advice or suggestions will really help i done want this all to be for nothing thank youmain question is there a way to make sure that tails gedit program does not save the time and date a file is created or last dated or saved . quote from apopularvendor on march ami

fredgarvin maleprostitute on april amor just make sure you do not use a direct connection to tor from where you live go find some girl on craigslist who needs a roomate and pay her mth to use her internet to connect to your dnm account the jondonym client program allows the user to choose among several mix cascades i e a group of anonymization proxies offered by independent organisations users may choose by themselves whom of these operators they will trust and whom they wont this is different from peer to peer based anonymity networks like tor and i p whose anonymisation proxies are anonymous themselves which means the users have to rely on unknown proxy operators however it means that all the relays used for jondonym meditated connections are known and identified and therefore potentially target very easily by hackers government agencies or lobbying groups this has for example led to the issues mentioned below where court orders essentially gave all control over the whole system to the german government as discussed below solutions like international distribution of the relays and the additional use of tor can somewhat mitigate this loss of independence the speed and availability of the service depends on the operators of the mixes in the cascades and therefore varies more users on a cascade improve anonymity but a large number of users might diminish the speed and bandwidth available for a single user cost name change and commercial serviceuse of jondonym has been and still is free but since financial backing of the original research project ran out on june a startup jondos gmbh was founded by members of the original project team jondos gmbh has taken over development and continues to work on an improved blocking resistance function that would make it easier for users from destructive countries to get a connection to the system citation needed to cover costs of running mix cascades and increase speed as well as anonymity jondos and other interest firms who launched a commercial version of the anonymizing proxy as a consequence the jap client has been named to jondo and the service itself from an on to jondonym jondonym mix cascades are mostly operated by smes in multiply countries and mix cascades always include three mix servers for advanced security as contractors of jondos gmbh must ensure sufficient throughput of their mixes anonymous web browsing at standard dsl speeds is possible citation needed cost free cascades are still in operation although they do not offer the low latency multiple mixes per cascade or guaranteed bandwidth the commercial ones do privacythe online activities of the user can be revealed if all mixes of a cascade work together by keeping log files and correlating their logs however all mix operators have to sign a voluntary commitment not to keep such logs and for any observer it is difficult to infiltrate all operators in a long cascade in july the german bka obtained a warrant to force the dressed mix operators to log access to a specific web address which was hosting child pornography an on then decided to introduce a crime detection function in the server software in order to make this possible the feature was made transparent by publishing the changed source code on august and subsequently criticise by many users for the dressed mix the feature continues to be part of their software until today tracing activities back in the past is still technically not possible for the operators but anonymity now extends only to the timepoint that a surveillance court order is issued it was pointed out though that the new feature was covered by the an on threat model and not a security leak by itself as a reaction to the threat from local authorities the system has spread internationally if the mixes of a cascade are spread over several countries the law enforcement agencies of all these countries would have to work together to reveal someones identity an on publishes every year the number of successful and unsuccessful surveillance court orders further research is being done by an on to make the crime detection functionality more privacy friendly since may jondonym can also be used as a client for the tor network and since also for the mixminion network these features are still in an early stage and only available in the beta version of the software .

acm event place city scottsdale arizonaevent country usakeywords en bitcoin privacy fingerprintabstract en bitcoin is a digital currency which relies on a distributed set of miners to mint coins and on a peer to peer network to broadcast transactions the identities of bitcoin users are hidden behind pseudonyms public keys which are recommended to be changed frequently in order to increase transaction unlinkability we present an efficient method to deanonymize bitcoin users which allows to link user pseudonyms to the ip addresses where the transactions are generated our techniques work for the most common and the most challenging scenario when users are behind nats or firewalls of their isps they allow to link transactions of a user behind a nat and to distinguish connections and transactions of different users behind the same nat we also show that a natural countermeasure of using tor or other anonymity services can be cut off by abusing anti do countermeasures of the bitcoin network our attacks require only a few machines and have been experimental verified we propose several countermeasures to mitigate these new attacks permalink a bitcoin help site we have the following using bitcoin anonymouslywritten by third renaissance brother bitcoinpublished may last dated august clearnet bitcoin addresses are not themselves linked to a person or entity thats why bitcoin is often called pseudonymous or pseudo anonymous however a persons identity can be associated with a bitcoin address through other means once that occurs its possible to determine that persons transactions backward and forward through the blockchain history a single anonymity breach can uncover an individuals entire bitin transaction history but how is an address linked with a person most commonly the association occurs when people publish their name together with their bitcoin address online but there are plenty of other ways take a look at the top seven ways your identity can be linked to your bitcoin address once the association has been made a party with enough determination time and resources could analyze the blockchain and determine how many bitcoins an individual has how they receive them and how they spend them avoid thin clients and hosted walletsalmost all thin clients leak which addresses you own to whatever simple payment verification spv server they connect to thin clients do not store the blockchain totally instead they query a single spv server for the transactions that involve the addresses in your wallet while this functionality is far more efficient and fast than parsing the blockchain totally the trade off is that every bitcoin address you own is submitted to the spv server some thin clients such as multibit have the capability of using bloom filters to help conceal which addresses you own by requesting extra transactions that dont involve your wallet however multibit current favors efficiency over privacy and does not utilize bloom filters for address anonymization the electrum thin client doesnt use bloom filters at all so just like multibit any server you connect to knows every address that you own learned zaphod . i do a lot

someone uses a new wallet for every transaction personally i dont use btc so i cant recommend anything that said i would recommend visiting the site and read it thoroughly zaphod . i do a lot of wallet to wallet transactions in my work when someone makes an order with me wallet to wallet i send them a wallet address from an account i make unique for this transaction on agora the fundamental flaws in this are obvious if agora scammed or something happened i would be sucked it would never effect my customers as even if i lost the money from their purchases i would still ship the product every market has an expiration and i have been playing with fire for far too long i have been using electrum as a personal wallet for a good amount of time only to hold clean coins though i want to create a unique electrum wallet in tails for my wallet to wallet transactions so i am no longer putting my money in anyone elses hands through tails you can use an unterrified browser as well as the tor browser so i dont see why electrum through tails would be glorified on its own i dont see anywhere where it says that electrum is routed with tor when running it on tails before anyone says just give people a wallet for a mixer like helix or fog many of my transactions are way too large for their mixers to handle thanks in advance for the help . quote from zaphod on june pmquote from bernard
