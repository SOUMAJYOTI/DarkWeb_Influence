why not use the sha hash from the sha family instead whether you think they are right or wrong dutchdrugz i just done see any point in taking the risk when you can avoid it altogether without it costing you anything other than a little bit of your spare time its a similar story to some people who have decided to upgrade their existing insecure rsa bit key by generating a new rsa bit key while a key size of bits is current still considered secure why on gods earth wouldnt you just increase the key size to bits and then generate a new key pair the only reason i can think of is that these people are all using gpa which has a max key size of only bits regardless its not hard to download a new pip client such as gpg usb and generate a new rsa bit key pair and be done with it rsa bit keys are next in line for the nsa i for one will never underestimate the resources the money and the power these le agencies have at theiir disposal using your theory dutchdrugz why wouldnt the nsa just state that all the sha hashes are now considered unsafe and vulnerable to attack including both the sha and the sha hashes instead of just stating the sha hash is now considered insecure the nsa is one hell of a powerful organization which should never be underestimated do so at your own peril . this guide was originally posted in the wrong thread by rasalghul this is where it should have been

or years many people receive mail at their work part how to choose a vendorconnect to the darknet find a dim onion address to a marketplace and paste it into the tor browser create an account find the

cost to tumble your bitcoins if you re planning to use a btc tumbler part how to make bitcoin walletsconnect to the clearnet find a website that offers bitin wallets or download a wallet to your computer some wallets will make you download the entire history of the blockchain before you can use them this can take several hours and it takes up about gb of your hard drive there are other

this will be wallet a write down the wallet a address connect to the darknet create a wallet on electrum this will be called electric wallet b electrum is a bitin wallet included with tails when you open electric choose to create a new wallet it will generate a seed of random words write this down and if you ever have computer or dvd us failure then you can just reinstall electrum on another device and re enter the seed to get your wallet and bitcoins back next electrum will ask you to create a password then it should create the wallet rational create one more wallet while on the darknet if you desire not electrum this is just extra rational opsec this will be called wallet c part how to buy btc use tumblers transfer to other walletsconnect to the clearnet for this next part please remember wallet a should never touch the tor network wallet b should never touch the clearnet any time bitcoins are transferred from one account to another it usually takes confirmations minutes for the bitcoins to be deposited and ready to use or transfer again do not use the same deposit receive address twice the address will likely change after every transaction there are many ways to buy bitcoins some online some in person some are anonymous some are not your overlay goal is to buy the bitcoins and send them to wallet a the value of bitcoins fluctuates so always buy a few more bitcoins than you need an extra should be enough buy bitcoins with your preferred method localbitcoins several methods some are anonymous lower fees to transfer pre paid debit cards buy with cash anonymous higher fees to transfer circle not anonymous lower fees to transfer you buy your bitcoins on a website you will likely be asked to create an account you can use your real name and email address here if you re going to tumble the bitcoins but some people choose to use fake information anyway when you buy the bitcoins they will either be transferred to a bitin wallet under the jebusite account you just created or it will ask you for a bitin wallet address to send the coins to send to wallet a if you buy the bitcoins in person you will most likely pay upfront and give them the bitcoin wallet address to transfer the bitcoins to wallet a address other methods involve sending the buyer your wallet a address and going somewhere like a bank or money transfer location and depositing or transferring the money to the account number they provide you with once the bitcoins are in wallet a you may continue to transfer bitcoins copy the receive address from the wallet you re sending to then go to the other wallet find the send tab and paste it in the address bar add btc amount send rational create an account with a tumbler website transfer your bitcoins from wallet a to the tumbler account and wait for confirmation next you will click a button to tumble your bitcoins which will charge you a small fee wait for the new bitcoins to return to your tumbler wallet i like helix and helix light helix light can send etc straight to electrum wallet b if you don t tumble please at least transfer bitcoins through a few wallets before dim wallet transfer your bitcoins from the current wallet a or the tumbler wallet to electrum wallet b transferring to wallet b is of that doesn t count as touching b with the darknet tails tor connect to the darknet rational once the

with your purchase order your bitcoins will be placed in the dnm s escrow if the vendor requires you to fe click fe congratulations you re almost done now you just calmly wait for the package to arrive part delivery stagedepending on where your package is coming from domestic vs international it could show up between a few days and a few weeks if it takes any longer contact your vendor to sort it out if the vendor is not responding or unwilling to sort out the problem contact the dnm you ordered from the end results depend on their return policy and whether you fe d or not once the package arrives bring it inside and don t open it for minutes this is a simple precaution in case it was a controlled delivery after a few minutes dig in and enjoy if you got what you ordered return to the dnm and release the bitcoins to the vendor after you try the goodies you can return and write a review if you have a problem with your order pgp message the vendor and try to solve the problem if you and the vendor can t solve the problem contact the dnm you ordered from and tell them what happened using multi sig they will ultimately decide what happens at this point optional you can choose to wait a day before opening the package you could also take the package to a different location that is more private to open it up part random tips and commentsin the rare chance you are ever confronted by le related to this situation say i m going to remain silent i want a lawyer then shut the hell up anything you say can and will be used against you in court if it makes you feel any better there are a lot of people who order from the dnms very few get caught but the ones who do are usually the ones with bad open don t tell people where you get your goodies from just say you have a good connection remember tails tor pgp bitcoins wallets and browsing the dark net markets is all legal the only part of this that is illegal in the us is if you actually buy something on the dnms i obviously recommend using tails for better opsec but many people simply use tor pgp and usually vpn with no tails that method is easier but it s more risk do not keep your bitcoins in a dnm wallet after your purchase move your left over bitcoins back to your previous darknet wallet wallet b or c consider buying a usb for tails etc that is disguised as some other item you can also store hide your usb at another location when you re not using it if you ever want to delete everything you have saved on tails you can delete the persistence volume do not do this until you are done with everything though you will lose all saved files keys passwords documents and your bitcoin wallet if you suspect something has gone wrong with the delivery and it s taking too long consider cleaning house if you get a love letter or controlled delivery consider your address burned part very helpful links dnm dictionary . quote from jaxinshit on may amvendors need to update asap i have three

different location that is more private to open it up part random tips and commentsin the rare chance you are ever confronted by le related to this situation say i m going to remain silent i want a lawyer then shut the hell up anything you say can and will be used against you in court if it makes you feel any better there are a lot of people who order from the dnms very few get caught but the ones who do are usually the ones with bad open don t tell people where you get your goodies from just say you have a good connection remember tails tor pgp bitcoins wallets and browsing the dark net markets is all legal the only part of this that is illegal in the us is if you actually buy something on the dnms i obviously recommend using tails for better opsec but many people simply use tor pgp and usually vpn with no tails that method is easier but it s more risk do not keep your bitcoins in a dnm wallet after your purchase move your left over bitcoins back to your previous darknet wallet wallet b or c consider buying a usb for tails etc that is disguised as some other item you can also store hide your usb at another location when you re not using it if you ever want to delete everything you have saved on tails you can delete the persistence volume do not do this until you are done with everything though you will lose all saved files keys passwords documents and your bitcoin wallet if you suspect something has gone wrong with the delivery and it s taking too long consider cleaning house if you get a love letter or controlled delivery consider your address burned
