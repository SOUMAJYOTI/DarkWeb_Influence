very oft time posting here sorry paracelsus very well put ive said the same when the op posted on evo a while ago there are mechanisms on pentesting distros such as kali where you can setup honeypot access points such as fakeap and evilap and besides if you can which you of course can backdoor the persons computer via man connection and so on so all in all yes you can be tracked ill cross post quotesince youre connecting from your location to another wifi which may or may not be a faked then yes not first and last name but they can trace where its coming from they have a device name they have matador etc you never heard of a honeypot faked have you its a virtual captured wifi spot which has a weak or has no password they collect data from there what defines high target is the more legitimately appropriate question they can also arp poison you through the lan causing you to visit a landing page via redirect with an exploit its been done before have you also never heard of lanspy you can distribute malware through a network heck you can shut down computers that are in the same workgroup imagine what they can do if youre hooked into their wifi doesnt matter whether you use stealth mode or not it still is possible try testing tools that do this in kali linux youll find a buttload its not retarded its common sense no offense what about intercepting messages and traffic via dsniff these are not new holes theyre beyond old are spoof was a vulnerability characterized in the s sniffing traffic through the same lan network is as old as dirt itself its not even complicated its not just possible its already built upon established evidence followed by tools that make it work everyday in the field youre wrong to think they cant trace you read up on pentesting tools youll find more than youdve thought theres more to it than lama rat and loic theres real life threats which can and are used to trace data streams to their source vs destination if anyone can download the kali pentesting distro with all of these tools built in for free imagine what le has its all too real please do research as for beaver youre wrong at least in how you explained your theory sdr handles software driven radio frequency rfid is hardware driven radio frequency tech it has nothing to do with the macaddr and responding to another person vpn isnt the best if its fed owned or run inside of a server service by an isp that keeps logs the real ip can also be tracked by mechanisms like cipav which would mean the next time you disconnect your vpn and think boot up shut down which makes it open even if for a short period of time to phone the ip address home to dc proxies only work if you disable javascript including tor if youre just connecting to an ap or wifi router you still show off that youre using tor and that creates a red flag it wont of course in normal circumstances lead to interception of traffic since even tor tunneled traffic bypasses arp spoon attacks and blocks any infiltration into the tunnel itself but if a fed owns the node you happened to be assigned by the client then they essentially own all your traffic while thats mostly rare its still possible and does happen you are however very correct with mite attacks anyone can intercept traffic by issuing a rogue ssl cert to the host being spied upon its even easy for anyone with a computer and interest access just use sslstrip its a tool that will intercept ssl traffic through said means feds in u s did it with google and bing and nahor france did with google turkey did it for gmail if you have the cert authorizing you to see all their ssl traffic not even secure connections such as forms with sensitive data is safe in theory funnytrips macaddr doesn give anyone a whos whom it identifies the manufacturers id of your nice card which yes can be an discriminating factor as the rest of a potential investigation pans out and narrows down but it wont tell whos whom at most itll probably tell you which computer in the neighborhood household assuming enough variety in models of nice cards and yes i know because i am a graham ideologist who studies computer forensics aware

and yes i know because i am a graham ideologist who studies computer forensics aware backdoors and methods used as well as pentesting etc i see enough of all of this stuff everyday out there i know what im talking about give even used these methods first hand for testing think random neighbor kids as test subjects i know how they work . first of all forgive the lurking give been a part of the darkweb since late however while give had an account on the hub since it was mentioned first in topic i never posted until now i will generally be busy so please done expect very oft time posting here sorry paracelsus very well put ive said the same when the op posted on evo a while ago there are mechanisms on pentesting distros such as kali where you can setup honeypot access points such as fakeap and evilap and besides if you can which you of course can backdoor the persons computer via man connection and so on so all in all yes you can be tracked ill cross post quotesince youre connecting from your location to another wifi which may or may not be a faked then yes not first and last name but they can trace where its coming from they have a device name they have matador etc you never heard of a honeypot faked have you its a virtual captured wifi spot which has a weak or has no password they collect data from there what defines high target is the more legitimately appropriate question they can also arp poison you through the lan causing you to visit a landing page via redirect with an exploit its been done before have you also never heard of lanspy you can distribute malware through a network heck you can shut down computers that are in the same workgroup imagine what they can do if youre hooked into their wifi doesnt matter whether you use stealth mode or not it still is possible try testing tools that do this in kali linux youll find a buttload its not retarded its common sense no offense what about intercepting messages and traffic via dsniff these are not new holes theyre beyond old are spoof was a vulnerability characterized in the s sniffing traffic through the same lan network is as old as dirt itself its not even complicated its not just possible its already built upon established evidence followed by tools that make it work everyday in the field youre wrong to think they cant trace you read up on pentesting tools youll find more than youdve thought theres more to it than lama rat and loic theres real life threats which can and are used to trace data streams to their source vs destination if anyone can download the kali pentesting distro with all of these tools built in for free imagine what le has its all too real please do research as for beaver youre wrong at least in how you explained your theory sdr handles software driven radio frequency rfid is hardware driven radio frequency tech it has nothing to do with the macaddr and responding to another person vpn isnt the best if its fed owned or run inside of a server service by an isp that keeps logs the real ip can also be tracked by mechanisms like cipav which would mean the next time you disconnect your vpn and think boot up shut down which makes it open even if for a short period of time to phone the ip address home to dc proxies only work if you disable javascript including tor if youre just connecting to an ap or wifi router you still show off that youre using tor and that creates a red flag it wont of course in normal circumstances lead to interception of traffic since even tor tunneled traffic bypasses arp spoon attacks and blocks any infiltration into the tunnel itself but if a fed owns the node you happened to be assigned by the client then they essentially own all your traffic while thats mostly rare its still possible and does happen you are however very correct with mite attacks anyone can intercept traffic by issuing a rogue ssl cert to the host being spied upon its even easy for anyone with a computer and interest access just use sslstrip its a tool that will intercept ssl traffic through said means feds in u s did it with google and bing and nahor france did with google turkey did it for gmail if you have the cert authorizing you to see all their ssl traffic not even secure connections such as forms with sensitive data is safe in theory funnytrips macaddr doesn give anyone a whos whom it identifies the manufacturers id of your nice card which yes can be an discriminating factor as the rest of a potential investigation pans out and narrows down but it wont tell whos whom at most itll probably tell you which computer in the neighborhood household assuming enough variety in models of nice cards and yes i know because i am a graham ideologist who studies computer forensics aware backdoors and methods used as well as
