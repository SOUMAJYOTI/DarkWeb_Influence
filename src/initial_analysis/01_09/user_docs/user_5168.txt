some security in dissapearing off of the darknet and wanting surity that upon return youll still have access to customers vendors and their great product well i think the time may be here imagine this a vendor only market based on trust no user registrations and the site is essentially hidden on tor pgp services by default and maximum security implements each and every source should in theory be a somewhat experienced darknet market buyer so essentially the concept is this vendors start the market i have in mind jor since he seems to be the most well trusted a vendor only community that when vendors like a customer they are able to provide a one time registration url that is then to be sent to the user they choose that user may then register on the site and take part in purchasing product next part im trying to plan is anonymous vendor buying but i dont quite know how this will work out essentially since the community is based on trust to begin with vendors will be responsible for knowing how much stock they put into the store no vendors name will be shared and categories and organization will be added for instance say you wand led well mrpickles and for both have it but instead of it saying both vendors theres only one listing with the combined features both mrpickles and for both put up there if theres the exact same posting on both accounts the system takes from whomver has the most stock in their inventory to help balance out and for fatness different categories of drugs if it gets to that point would have their own similar features marijuana would be difficult but i hopefully done imagine anyone serious about buying drugs buys and ships marijuana or perhaps im just native but in like to protect people against that since its the most widely busted drug and quite frankly is probably within kilometer of anywhere you are at any given point in time that you are on this earth how does this sound i would also provide the solution open source so that admins could inspect it vendors and be sure theres no exit scam awal code developed in there that i nor anyone else would be able to touch also the system would use bitchain infus public api to create

anonyminity is creating extra scripting to be hacked make sure you have it all locked down if not you will have to trust in people to refund its not just a payment code with a ledger created for an escrow account and then dropped in real addresses anonymous listings lead to a whole vacuum for scams are you logging the anonyminity to the vendor so when a scam occurs there is a way to locate the scammer yes their will be internal data logging disputes are still able to be made and messages sent to from vendors through the product page there will be a spot to ask questions no identiy from vendor will be shown unless question is answered this allows vendors the ability to conceal themselves should a user thats been suggested as le somehow gets in and hasnt yet been banned will still display vendor names the anonymity for the vendor buying would only be for the listings once a question is asked on the product the instant chat window if java enabled would still display the vendor youre communicating with if java isnt enabled youd have the same typical html html screen as mem did also one vendor voted by all of the rest with the best reviews undecided will ultimately be given king status on the site giving them the ability to override small features and veto console votes that have been performed by the community they will be able to prioritize endor inventory such as auto direct sales to xx vendors stash instead of xxx vendors stash if xx vendor has an item that xxx vendor has there will be a smart sense feature that dissalows similar items to be posted as a means to bypass this king admin will have ability to modify but this feature will be strictly difficult and will require much more approval from the vendor congress vendors on vacation mode will opt out and or auto vote not yet decided still working on the philsophy and bugs within the business logic aspect of the site but overlay thats the general solution im thinking of essentially a darknet congress i dont have the full plan played out yet which is why id like some feedback and i didnt mean to be nasty in my previous message dh im sorry if i came out that way at all i dont want to doxx but i do this type of work fairly often so in extremely confident that i can architect a flawless system or atleast should a flaw be noted a solution would be implements that would please everyone i have no interested in making anything off of the site either i just want lsd so no fees for transactions or tax withdrawal crap that give seen at other places but there might be a tax for funds that are transferred in and withdrawn without a purchase the system wont be intended to be a tumbler service so that type of activity will be looked down upon edit i have added donation abilities and details

all of the vendors being trusted and within their own circle it either all turns to shit or its all working correctly in theory or unless the majority of the vendors go on vacation and theres one little scrappy guy left in the corner snatching money from people but thats always a problem in any enviornment . you should look at a nodded version of also bitwasp it will save you a lot of time all you are doing by the vendor anonyminity is creating extra scripting to be hacked make sure you have it all locked down if not you will have to trust in people to refund its not just a payment code with a ledger created for an escrow account and then dropped in real addresses anonymous listings lead to a whole vacuum for scams are you logging the anonyminity to the vendor so when a scam occurs there is a way to locate the scammer . youre a little late to the party dhl is already trying to capitolize on that i think we can do it better with less infrastructure we have a multisig system

through the product page there will be a spot to ask questions no identiy from vendor will be shown unless question is answered this allows vendors the ability to conceal themselves should a user thats been suggested as le somehow gets in and hasnt yet been banned will still display vendor names the anonymity for the vendor buying would only be for the listings once a question is asked on the product the instant chat window if java enabled would still display the vendor youre communicating with if java isnt enabled youd have the same typical html html screen as mem did also one vendor voted by all of the rest with the best reviews undecided will ultimately be given king status on the site giving them the ability to override small features and veto console votes that have been

will be a smart sense feature that dissalows similar items to be posted as a means to bypass this king admin will have ability to modify but this feature will be strictly difficult and will require much more approval from the vendor congress vendors on vacation mode will opt out and or auto vote not yet decided still working on the philsophy and bugs within the business logic aspect of the site but overlay thats the general solution im thinking of essentially a darknet congress i dont have the full plan played out yet which is why id like some feedback and i didnt mean to be nasty in my previous message dh im sorry if i came out that way at all i dont want to doxx but i do this type of work fairly often so in extremely confident that i can architect a flawless system or atleast should a flaw be noted a solution would be implements that would please everyone i have no interested in making anything off of the site either i just want lsd so no fees for transactions or tax withdrawal crap that give seen at other places but there might be a tax for funds that are transferred in and withdrawn without a purchase the system wont be intended to be a tumbler service so that type of activity will be looked down upon edit i have added donation abilities and details onto the original post if anyone would like to assist . quote from doseheavy on november pmyoure a little

while but as with many of you i m sure you d like some security in dissapearing off of the darknet and wanting surity that upon return you ll still have access to customers vendors and their great product well i think the time may be here imagine this a vendor only market based on trust no user registrations and the site is essentially hidden on tor pgp services by default and maximum security implements each and every source should in theory be a somewhat experienced darknet market buyer so essentially the concept is this vendors start the market i have in mind jor since he seems to be the most well trusted a vendor only community that when vendors like a customer they are able to provide a one time registration url that is then to be sent to the user they choose that user may then register on the site and take part in purchasing product next part i m trying to plan is anonymous vendor buying but i don t quite know how this will work out essentially since the community is based on trust to begin with vendors will be responsible for knowing how much stock they put into the store no vendors name will be shared and categories and organization will be added for instance say you wand led well mrpickles and for both have it but instead of it saying both vendors there s only one listing with the combined features both mrpickles and for both put up there if there s the exact same posting on both accounts the system takes from whomver has the most stock in their inventory to help balance out and for fatness different categories of drugs if it gets to that point would have their own similar features marijuana would be difficult but i hopefully don t imagine anyone serious about buying drugs buys and ships marijuana or perhaps i m just native but i d like to protect people against that since it s the most widely busted drug and quite frankly is probably within kilometer of anywhere you are at any given point in time that you are on this earth how does this sound i would also provide the solution open source so that admins could inspect it vendors and be sure there s no exit scam awal code developed in there that i nor anyone else would be able to touch also the system would use bitchain into s public api to create destroy transfer money from wallets and would allow downloadable wallet backups directly from bitchain info if my site ever goes down your coin is always right where you left it so long as you can remember where you wrote down download your backup stuff too comments feedback plz i just want access to lsd for my whole life just incase i run through my entire stock pile and this whole thing dissapears lol i plan on going dark for a while but if this sounds good to the community perhaps it can be a christmas present to everyone that s been loyal also the vendors i imagine starting out with are jesusofrave mrpickles and liquidergot if you know of anyone else that should be on that list they would need the approval of i don t know some percentage of approval from all of the current active vendors if you see talk too any of these vendors please have them read this thread thanks love all of you edit if you would like to make anonymous donations for this service please donate to quote hmgdq lthvdqygnumu bycubpkn ennbthe amount of donations received will vastly improve the quality of service i can provide and shorten the amount of time taken if i start receiving a large amount of donations i will put up a site as a placeholder for the service with accurate information if you donate be sure to send me a private message with your used that you use across the darknet or send me a pgp key and a message personally you will be heavily rewarded for assisting in the development process of this but it has been undecided as of yet it s possible you could receive a vast amount of free lsd mdma if this takes off like i plan on it doing plate for teach speck quote from sterlingsword on november match specs updatewhile

on how long the vendor has been around rate of success vs rate of failure confidence factor overlay rating across the darkneti m still trying to decide all of the internal politics and due to the nature of this trusted environment i plan on developing said vendor will need to approve on this decision much love . looks like you been keeping yourself busy i applaud you on your efforts to make
