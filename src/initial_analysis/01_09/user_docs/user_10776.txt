yeah in some free wifi places you need to accept the terms before you can have access so as you said you need to accept the terms from a regular browser i believe it is called the unsafe browser in tails then once you have accepted the terms you can then access tor . hi folks a few weeks ago i went to a coffee shop and tried to connect to their public wifi while using tails although i could connect to the network tor wouldnt connect i tried to do the same at a public library the other day same result i wasnt able to find this topic covered on the hub but after searching around some other places found this a guy having the same problem in a starbucks you need your browser to connect to local network and accept before you that is tor is allowed to make any connection to internet proper sequence would be connect to cafes network from your os open non tor browser accept terms introduce login etc close non tor browser unless it specifically says not to close the connection window tab open tormy question is would having to connect to their network without tor running put me at more risk of losing the security tor provides i have mac spoofing enabled in tails so i thought in be of but wanted to double check in thinking if this isnt the solution or isnt a safe one then trying to connect through a vpn then in to tor or using bridges may help but im not sure if they would realistically be censoring tor or not i did take the logs from the tor startup wizard i can post if that would be a helpthanks very much in advance for any help or advice . great thanks im not familiar with the details of mac spoofing but i assume for you will have the same address for each boot session of tails so anyone monitoring the network could see my mac logan as normal then the same mac later running on tor i ask because if i was to do the process described in my first post in a library im a member of i believe the unsafe browser logon page would ask me to put in my library card number or something so obviously in not be going there thanks again big help . yup whats the difference between that library and your home if you have to use your credentials . great thanks im not

they know you in anyway or where you have to be a member of should be avoided as your number one rule so it sounds like youre particular library would be a no go . hi folks a few weeks ago i went to a
