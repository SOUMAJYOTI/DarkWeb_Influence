hey folks i am completely new to laying my own tabs but in looking to get started by laying my xtal on a page in this regard i have a couple of questions i cant seem to find everclear anywhere around can i use ml of absinthe or grey goose vodka these are some of the two spirits i can find nearly also i read somewhere that led doesnt dissolve in alcohol if this is the case how would it dissolve in vodka or everclear wouldnt it be better if i used some solvent in which lsd dissolves completely the xtal i have is bit rocky and in small chucks what is the size of the magnetic stirrer that i should be looking to get i am extremely new to magnetic stirrers i had no clue about them till i read a post here suggesting its use i saw a my stirrer at a local chemist supplies store i do not think that would be unusable for mixing my solutions there would be a greater risk of the solution evaporating at a fast pace are there smaller stirrers available and i should not be using the hot plate correct thanks . hey folks i am completely new to laying my own tabs but in looking to get started by laying my xtal on a page in this regard i have a couple of questions i cant seem to find everclear

fine i switch between that and a solution depending on the paper addition free vodka mixed with distilled water should not make your blotter bitter the should work fine but it wont want to move much on its own make sure youre tilting your sheets to work it down test run test run test run test run the only time i used anything lower than was on my first lay was some cheap flavored vodka i had sitting in my freezer for months turned out to be a huge mistake shit evaporated faster than ice on heat so half the lay came out super strong the other half not so good the tabs tasted fruity though a stirrer isnt needed but recommended sure you can use a stirring rod or some other cheap alternative but if your aiming for a thorough solution set it to stir on medium for an hr in a temp controlled environment ive done multiply tests to see if any solution was lost stirring under ml in a cool clean room with no loss at all and i lay using a pipette so i can see if up is missing or notus get one theyre cheap get a beaker and stir bar that fits according to the volume of solution used dilute the solution so you have more to work with if needed and do more than run plus multiply runs using a thoroughly stirred diluted solution ensures a more accurate lay theres never a need for it magnetic stirrerive been doin it all wrong for years thanks for the advice regards lucy . the alcohol you use
