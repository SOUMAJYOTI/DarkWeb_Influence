however in my country anyway unless you are a registered and licence account holder with the chemical supply company in question and complete an end user declaration eud before the goods are allowed

just the fact that you are coming in here and asking these types of questions is ample proof that you are in over your head accordingly my advice to you would be to forget whatever it is that you have been contemplating under many conspiracy statutes a necessary pre condition is that you commit an act in furtherance of the conspiracy for example consider a group of guys shooting the shit around the bbq knocking back drinks they discuss knocking over the local bank in and of itself this would not normally be considered criminal behavior however if the next day one of their number went out and purchased half a dozen masks that would be considered an act in furtherance of the conspiracy this means that even if those discussing the bank heist never actually attempted it they could still be charged convicted and imprisoned for conspiracy to commit bank robbery in a like manner purchase of fake id and or pre paid credit card s could serve essentially the same purpose you may have unwittingly already placed yourself in a vulnerable position where you could be charged and convicted for conspiracy even in the absence of any other evidence the wisest course of action you could

such plans zaphodevery vendor had to learn this shit at some point how else would i learn without asking questions over the almost years that ive been around these types of places the impression that give gotten is that people who vend online learned the ropes from dealing office most of them already have sources of supply and general street smarts what skills as they may be lacking are generally to do with online security and to a lesser extent shipping most people who deal online already have of the skills they need already thus the learning curve is relatively modest you on the other hand appear to be starting at ground zero if you dont know what youre doing the odds of your being apprehended are pretty high its not just the time in jail thats the problem its the asset stripping that theyll do to you virtual everything that you have will be forfeited as the proceeds of crime youll come out of jail essentially destitute with zero job prospects because no one wants to hire an ex con even if you had the worlds best idea and you wanted to start up a business good luck no bank will loan to an ex con not unless you have collateral but then remember the feds will have stripped you of anything you might have that could be used as collateral its your life youre free to fuck it up if you want but then dont blame us for helping you to do it zaphod .
