over all the other markets to answer that pleas see the answers to questions and lolalso as mentioned above this market treats quality vendors with care and is made to be a good home for them the focus is quality and security and the whole market is tailor to those two things so please come give tba a try we still need vendors so done be afraid to sign up and get some sales . theres so many popping up its crazy . bazaar alpha . bazaar alpha . there is already a thread for this please check it out . bazaar alpha . i signed up as a vendor for the lulz they seem to be offering a variety of flaws and bugs . they should be established before being added here . hello my name is evilgrin i have been hired by albert to help him with tba trying to think of what to say most everything has already been said the three main questions asked when a new market arises are how do i know my coins are safe yes the market has the same look as other not so legitimate and or flowed markets have had in the past this is because the frontend is bitwasp code open source however this does not hinder security all the background code is written by albert and as albert mentioned all processes involving the movement of coins are verified mutually and values are checked against the history of deposits withdraws and transactions so no one can create false values and withdraw the coins are stored offline with seemed watch only wallets so no one can steal coins also the market is hasted on alberts own servers i dont really know how better security could be set up how can we trust you to not run off with out coins well with any market or any person for that matter you can never be too sure i dont suggest putting blind faith in any marketplace but i can say this albert is not new to tor he has been hosting tor shops for a few years and has built a reputation he may not be the most well known guy on tor but at least he is known and known for being a nice guy why should i chose your market

bitcoin clients that current support a transaction in some form or another and give had folks pm me with their ideas asto why we should have such a system in place as well as why they believe not so in set it up for a debate amongst our users and having heard both sides of the argument the overwhelming choice was for in favor of a multi sig integration despite the niggles and constraints it presented to an end user with various bicoin clients out there i was wondering what the spread was like and hence the poll maybe if you could also drop in a line or two auto why you use prefer the said client over another thatd be totally gamesome though am pretty close to having had worked out a fine balance for how to go about it without it being too complicated as some users suggested it seemed in like to know what people out here use as their favorite bitcoin client . security of bitcoin depends on the blockchain being held in full by many people bitcoin it and armoury do exactly that however given enough copies of the blockchain one can assume the system is secure from the data being lost and rely on other nodes to provide the information we require when we need it many users like having the whole blockchain available to them but if that is a problem for you use a lightweight wallet like electrum of all the wallets available only armory and electrum only need to be backed up once ever be careful with web wallets they have been hacked before keeping your bitcoin totally using a client on your own computer is always more secure . bitcoin qt also messed up my computer and i dont like the idea of the client having to store the entire blockchain on my computer i use blockchain info because it is pretty damn simple and has never given me problems however i know i will have to sacrafice conveinience for security and i am happy to do so unfortunately not all people will feel that way quite possibly the majority im ready to try a wallet that supports mst and will have to do so soon so i can explain how it works to all the n bs . quote from axa on february pmsecurity of bitcoin depends on the blockchain being held in full by many people bitcoin it and armoury do

mufti sig compliant the server can then link your addresses and potentially deanonoymise you on bitcoind you have the whole blockchain so no one can link nothing to you albert one thing i would say though is to allow people to be able to verify the multi sig address is let by giving them the public keys needed to recreate it i e markets and vendors buyer will already have his own key pointless to have mufti sig if the user cant generate the address themselves and verify it is let some pretty gamesome and important points well yes the clients would be generating their own key pairs pub and priv keys for precisely that such to verify transactions then broadcast them as well as for vendors to later redeem them the idea is to have this done in pretty simple steps . most people use bitin qt

javascript is not malicious unless you verify it everytime i prefer bitcoind over electrum for reasons electrum is crap for signing multisigs give it a go and you will see what i mean other than transfering coins to a multi sig address it isnt mufti sig compliant bitcoind has the whole blockchain electrum requests the data for addresses it sends to a server the server can then link your addresses and potentially deanonoymise you on bitcoind you have the whole blockchain so no one can link nothing to you having said that electrum is obviously more convenient and space saving i have been working on a plugin for trying to fix mufti sig signing on electrum but havent had as much time to devote to this as i would have liked recently but will continue on it and hopefully have it out before electric fix it albert one thing i would say though is to allow people to be able to verify the multi sig address is let by giving them the public keys needed to recreate it i e markets and

worried about being able to use sets of repeated data for a user to be able to crack your private key . the current bazaar scenario is as follows when a buyer builds up on an order and hits proceed with order post which theyre taken to a page where they see the breakdown of the fees shipping total order price and then they enter their address which gets encrusted for the vendor so right here is where the proposed changes would be implements the buyer will then need to enter a public key to their portion of the multi sir transaction the vendor would have a choice to enter multiply public keys in advance otherwise they be asked to enter one after receiving the order when they choose to finalize early or escrow during the process of a sale once the vendor has provided a public key the bazaars public key will be automatically generated and the final multisig address and the trasaction details will be sent to everyone the address the amount that needs to be sent the redeemscript so they can verify it encodes all the correct details to double check regardless of whether the payment is finale early or escrow the bazaar will then poll blockchain info for payments to that address once the full amount is paid then the order is marked as paid all users are message a link to a page that shows the generated transaction paying the vendor the full amount minus the bazaar fees a raw transaction spending all the transactions sent to the multisg address and sent to the vendor in one output everyone will be shown the transaction paying the vendor if the buyer for some reason choses to raise a dispute then all involved users will start multi party discussion on the order and the bazaar admin will then generate a new transaction based on the outcome of the the dispute will pay both either parties the appropriate amount for the order but if all is successful with the order which should be most of the time then one of the buyer will sign the transaction and paste the partially signed transaction after which the user party will then sign the transaction and broadcast it where it will be identified by bazaar when it makes it into the blockchain network via the blockchain ai so to break it down the vendor and buyer both have to supply their public keys for that transaction either in advance or when their action is needed during an order this would involve entering an address or selecting crow fe they need to add the multisig address to their client if using bitcoinqt using one command and then sign using another they can also verify the redeemscript or transaction hex so that the details are correct using their client or else online using www coinb inso buyers vendors will need to enter their public keys mutually or in advance they can generate them in their browsers using www coinb in multisig though we will be suggesting people to download an office copy of this site codes because it means once funds are sent to the multisig address the two users can add the signature to transactions in the browser without having to use any other desktop client its really that simple or folks could use www brainwallet organyway having users supplying them in the browser is probably the best thing until bip is supported in most clients which current is not bitin qt and electrum are definitely going to use bip in the foreseeable future so that for then but thats another milestone long after multisig goes in soon and will worked on as a separate plate how does this sound does the process sound like something you folks can easily adapt to i think it becomes pretty straightforward as there are only actions the buyers vendors need to do it would be one less step when we automate key generation during registration guess a small inconvinience but thats a small price to pay for absolute security for all bazaar coins no more worryings about markets heists as all transactions occur in the blockchain and are only considered valid when broadcast into blockchain which means even if the site is run down by an attacker they simply cant run off with any coins also if there is unexpected downtime or the admin me goes awol the buyer and vendor have

works out for them this action should help us in a number of ways such that any potential phishing links can be avoided as well as for users to be up to date with the latest balaam news and

vendor promotions and offers constantly dated here current a less then of the bazaars users visit the forums and wed definitely like to improve on that stat and be a more inclusive community with a larger audience participating in on the forum discussions just a quick word on how to now access the bazaar if an user were to try and access the bazzar directly via the market url they would be

bitin link on the navigation panel instead of topping up to a wallet address to pay for funds which leaves the scope for hacks and theft by hackers and maket operator multisignature transactions are now standard for up front payment or escrow vendors can chose enter a list of public keys in advance for accepting orders or will be prompted to enter keys if they have none available when accepting an order buyers must enter public keys on a per order basis in the new system once funds leave a multisig address they pay directly to the users key that was used to create the address users will then need to sign multisignature transactions as explain in detail below we recommend electric as a bitcoin client as its the only deterministic key derivation algorithm that sees mainstream use forcing users to enter a list of keys or individually or solely from an mpk sucks however this is an acceptable solution until clients adopt bip library which will be the case for the next version of electrum and eventually all the others as well so its a start since vendors buyers admins can go missing during an order of multisignature addresses are used for escrow and up front payments so funds are recoverable so whats multisig multisignature addresses are bitin addresses controlled by more than one person they are created with a set of requirements that dictate how the funds in the address can be moved between parties of signature addresses are joint controlled by people the market the buyer and the seller but funds can only be moved if two people authorize and sign a transaction users will be expected to sign transactions for themselves while current clients leave much to be desired regarding support for multisignature transactions we believe the best way is by increasing the adoption in it into day to day life and watch the situation improve from there current the only modified client which supports signing multisignature transactions is bitin core otherwise users can use an office copy of to sign in their browser it kinda sucks that bitcoin core is the only client that lets us do this as of now but were very much looking forward to a lighter client that supports it out of the box in the days to come training users to use multisigmultisig can seem complicated but weve tried to make the process as smooth as practicality can be done and with the necessary security measures in place and can only improve from here completing an order doesnt require many complicated steps at once but rather it is a gradual process where users are guided doing the transaction if users have any experience with an electrum offline wallet the process is very similar take signed transaction sign broadcast heres a more detailed explanation order process step buyer choses their items as normal when theyre ready they enter a public key and their address and confirm their order step vendor receives the new order then must decide to proceed either vis escrow or up front payment fe based on ratings etc if the vendor has pre entered public keys in advance with their listings they can skip to step below but if not they will be prompted to do so here step awaiting payment once the order is accepted by the vendor and the terms are selected up front or escrow the multisig address will be created and available to all users a redeemscript is then given allowing users to verify that the address is one they have control over which contains their public key the buyer then needs to pay to the address to continue once the market has seen enough incoming transactions to this address to cover for the order it will progress the order to the next step which is of signing it first both users need to import the address to their wallet a copy paste command will be shown to help them with that step up front orders only await buyer signature if the order is up front then the buyer signs the signed transaction they paste the partially signed transaction onto the order page and submit where it will be verified and the order progressed to step if the order is crow then the process skips this step and the vendor signs dispatches first step waiting for vendor to deliver goods the vendor signs to indicate they have dispatched if the order is up front then the vendor will now sign and broadcast the transaction once the market sees this transaction in blockchain then the order is moved to step if the order is escrow the vendor will add the first signature to the transaction and paste the partially signed transaction onto the order page step order has been dispatched await buyer to sign broadcast escrow or click received up front if its up front the buyer simply clicks the received button and the order is completed step otherwise the buyer can raise a dispute if its escrow when the goods arrive the buyer signs broadcasts the transaction paying the vendor the order is marked as completed step otherwise the buyer or the vendor can raise a dispute step disputed orderif a dispute is raised and the order was escrow the market administrator will be able to craft a new raw transaction which pays the buyer vendor an appropriate amount at their discretion really both users should be satisfied with the outcome but the admin can sign and wait for the second signature and the transaction to be broadcast before the dispute is automatically closed and the order marked complete step completed orderat this point the buyer and seller will be asked to leave feedback for the other a buyer will leave feedback for the vendor and then the items a vendor will leave feedback for the buyer if the order was disputed this will mark each review on the page as disputed allowing users to read what happened leaving feedback vendors can rate buyers on qualities like cooperation and communication from buyers can rate vendors on qualities like shipping and communication from they also rate the items on an order on item quality and if it matches description as on the listing when buyers leave feedback for an order with more than one item they can choose to rate all the items with the same score and comments or else fill in ratings comments individually all

payment or escrow vendors can chose enter a list of public keys in advance for accepting orders or will be prompted to enter keys if they have none available when accepting an order buyers must enter public keys on a per order basis in the new system once funds leave a multisig address they pay directly to the users key that was used to create the address users will then need to sign multisignature transactions as explain in detail below we recommend electric as a bitcoin client as its the only deterministic key derivation algorithm that sees mainstream use forcing users to enter a list of keys or individually or solely from an mpk sucks however this is an acceptable solution until clients adopt bip library which will be the case for the next version of electrum and eventually all the others as well so its a start since vendors buyers admins can go missing during an order of multisignature addresses are used for escrow and up front payments so funds are recoverable so whats multisig multisignature addresses are bitin addresses controlled by more than one person they are created with a set of requirements that dictate how the funds in the address can be moved between parties of signature addresses are joint controlled by people the market the buyer and the seller but funds can only be moved if two people authorize and sign a transaction users will be expected to sign transactions for themselves while current clients leave much to be desired regarding support for multisignature transactions we believe the best way is by increasing the adoption in it into day to day life and watch the situation improve from there current the only modified client which supports signing multisignature transactions is bitin core otherwise users can use an office copy of to sign in their browser it kinda sucks that bitcoin core is the only client that lets us do this as of now but were very much looking forward to a lighter client that supports it out of the box in the days to come training users to use multisigmultisig can seem complicated but weve tried to make the process as smooth as practicality can be done and with the necessary security measures in place and can only improve from here completing an order doesnt require many complicated steps at once but rather it is a gradual process where users are guided doing the transaction if users have any experience with an electrum offline wallet the process is very similar take signed transaction sign broadcast heres a more detailed explanation order process step buyer choses their items as normal when theyre ready they enter a public key and their address and confirm their order step vendor receives the new order then must decide to proceed either vis escrow or up front payment fe based on ratings etc if the vendor has pre entered public keys in advance with their listings they can skip to step below but if not they will be prompted to do so here step awaiting payment once the order is accepted by the vendor and the terms are selected up front or escrow the multisig address will be created and available to all users a redeemscript is then given allowing users to verify that the address is one they have control over which contains their public key the buyer then needs to pay to the address to continue once the market has seen enough incoming transactions to this address to cover for the order it will progress the order to the next step which is of signing it first both users need to import the address to their wallet a copy paste command will be shown to help them with that step up front orders only await buyer signature if the order is up front then the buyer signs the signed transaction they paste the partially signed transaction onto the order page and submit where it will be verified and the order progressed to step if the order is crow then the process skips this step and the vendor signs dispatches first step waiting for vendor to deliver goods the vendor signs to indicate they have dispatched if the order is up front then the vendor will now sign and broadcast the transaction once the market sees this transaction in blockchain then the order is

orderif a dispute is raised and the order was escrow the market administrator will be able to craft a new raw transaction which pays the buyer vendor an appropriate amount at their discretion really

armoury do exactly that however given enough copies of the blockchain one can assume the system is secure from the data being lost and rely on other nodes to provide the information we require when we need it many users like having the whole blockchain available to them but if that is a problem for you use a lightweight wallet like electrum of all the wallets available only armory and electrum only need to be backed up once ever be careful with web wallets they have been hacked before keeping your bitcoin totally using a client on your own computer is always more secure i can see no reason to use a web wallet unless you have a small amount on there it has to be armoury as the most secure at moment . most people use bitin qt or a web based wallet personally i think bitin it rots your hard drive as its a huge ass nigga file and amused on itself then fucked my mac i dont like spending on a computer to only have it sucked albert i dont . believe it or not the nsa is definitely data mining the blockchain and using it to connect your so called anonymity to you perhaps it could be that they are worried about being able to use sets of repeated data for a user to be able to crack your private key . web wallets can be secure if they are fully client side but you take the risk that the javascript is not malicious unless you verify it everytime i prefer bitcoind over electrum for reasons electrum is crap for signing multisigs give it a go and you will see what i mean other than transfering coins to a multi sig address it isnt mufti sig compliant bitcoind has the whole blockchain electrum requests the data for addresses it sends to a server the server can then link your addresses and potentially deanonoymise you on bitcoind you have the whole blockchain so no one can link nothing to you having said that electrum is obviously more convenient and space saving i have been working on a plugin for trying to fix mufti sig signing on electrum but havent had as much time to devote to this as i would have liked recently but will continue on it and hopefully have it out before electric fix it albert one thing i would say though is to allow people to be able to verify the multi sig address is let by giving them the public keys needed to recreate it i e markets and vendors buyer will already have his own key pointless to have mufti sig if the user cant generate the address themselves and verify it is let . security of bitcoin depends on the blockchain being held in full by many people bitcoin it and armoury do exactly that however given enough

the most secure at moment agree the most secure web wallets atm are blockchain into and coinbase coinbase keeps over of bitcoin in cold storage and moves to users hot wallet as needed . bitcoin qt also messed up my computer and i dont like the idea of the client having to store the entire blockchain on my computer i use blockchain info because it is pretty damn simple and has never given me problems however i know i will have to sacrafice conveinience for security and i am happy to do so unfortunately not all people will feel that way quite possibly the majority im ready to try a wallet that supports mst and will have to do so soon so i can explain how it works to all the n bs . well give been playing around with the idea of having a secure multi sins implementation at tba for a while now and been toying around with a number of different bitcoin clients that current support a transaction in some form or another and give had folks pm me with their ideas asto why we should have such a system in place as well as why they believe not so in set it up for a debate amongst our users and having heard both sides of the argument the overwhelming choice was for in favor of a multi sig integration despite the niggles and constraints it presented to an end user with various bicoin clients out there i was wondering what the spread was like and hence the poll maybe if you could also drop in a line or two auto why you use prefer the said client over another thatd be totally gamesome though am pretty close to having had worked out a fine balance for how to go about it without it being too complicated as some users suggested it seemed in like to know what people out here use as their favorite bitcoin client . quote from cooked on february amas its a huge ass nigga file and

the client having to store the entire blockchain on my computer i use blockchain info because it is pretty damn simple and has never given me problems great feedbacks people just what i was looking for i got very little hands on experience with bitcoinqt but i gather its just python based gui for the bash based bitcoind program but with limited features but interesting to know that its missed up your computers sure want something else and yes youre right it requires bitcoind dated to the lastest blockchain and synced n all to function which is about gigs as of now quote from axa on february pmbitcoin qt and armory do exactly that many users like having the whole blockchain available to them but if that is a problem for you use a lightweight wallet like electrum be careful with web wallets they have been hacked before keeping your bitcoin totally using a client on your own computer is always more secure unfortunately armoury doesn support multi sigs just yet but id definitely agree its the most secure office wallet program out there and therefore we use it for the markets cold storage comes in two flavors online and offline and unlike the online version which requires a good gb ram the office version can be run on mb and most folks use it on a old rusty which doesnt require no internet ideal for office storage quote from missjones on february pmagree the most secure web wallets atm are blockchain into and coinbase coinbase keeps over of bitcoin in cold storage and moves to users hot wallet as needed correct me if am wrong i looked into trying out the coinbase api for multisigs and they only support transactions upto a couple of hundred dollars a day without dox anything above and for larger transactions requires a verified account should i forward them my son

is let some pretty gamesome and important points well yes the clients would be generating their own key pairs pub and priv keys for precisely that such to verify transactions then broadcast them as well as for vendors to later redeem them the idea is to have this done in pretty simple steps . quote from albert on february amalso drop in a line or two auto why you use prefer the said client over another thatd be totally awesomei use few other things too but for this conversation my preference seems to be around these kryptokit com brainwallet org blockchain into electrum org .
