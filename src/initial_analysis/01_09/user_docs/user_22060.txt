to say it looks rather good clearnet links will be available for download from here . its kind of like tails but hardened passively more so its like tails whonix tubes steroids it uses green rbac pax numerous virtual isolated security domains has an amnesic mode its pretty much going to advance preconfigured operating systems to the bleeding edge of security that right now is being mutually configured on a case by case basis by the elate hackers tails and whonix etc lag significantly behind the cutting edge in being prepared solutions rather than custom configurations subgraph is the attempt to package the current cutting edge manual configuration into a distro for anyone remember how i made a tutorial on virtual isolation before whonix came out way back in the day that is an example of the prepackaged solutions lagging behind the manual configurations subgraph is pretty much doing that again people on the bleeding edge are already configuring similar systems themselves but subgraph is trying to standardize it and make it so you dont need to configure it yourself which is nice because right now configuring something like subgraph yourself pretty much entails compiling your own patched kernel as one of the earlier and easier steps ive been working on a tor router with some similar features for myself and have spent like hours configuring it already and it has been relatively challenging and involved and subgraph does even more than that so year though next time i configure such a tor router it will take much less time since i kept notes of what i did . havent seen but kmf was promoting it its like a more user friendly tails . quote from arcane on march pmquote from kmf on march amits kind of like tails but hardened passively more so its like tails whonix tubes steroids thats what i wanted to hear i think it is released to the world this weekend sounds like the future to me to that im current setting up qubes after reading about an alternative to tails but might just spend some time researching subgraph im no teach head so whatever i choose to focus on i end up having to invest more time and resources will be nice to see just how out the

traditional encryption obsolete a new computerresearchers from mit say that they have developed the world s first five atom quantum computer and they assert that it is capable of cracking today s traditional encryption methods today s most notable encryption methods to break this down a bit in computing numbers are untraditionally binary represented by and however in quantum computing these units are known as qubits which are in a state of superposition being simultaneously and this opens a number of doors in relation to computing and encryption this is just a very basin overview the video below delves into the workings and purposes a bit deeper now then because of the way that the computer functions it typical takes about qubits to factor the number what researchers at mit and the university of innsbruck austria have done is bring that number down to just qubits with each qubit represented by one atom but perhaps what it most notable about all this is that the system will feature scalability allowing more atoms and lasers to be added this is important as it is the use of laser pulses that stabilizes the quantum system and holds atoms in an ion trap so in short the scalability will enable the building of bigger and faster quartus computers ones that can factor much larger numbers making a atom computerthe creation of this five atom quantum computer comes in response to a challenge posted in by professor peter shor of mit professor shor developed a quantum algorithm that s able to calculate a large number s prime factors more sufficiently than traditional computers with being the smallest figure to meaningfully demonstrate the algorithm the new system was able to return the correct factors and with a confidence upwards of percent professor isaac chuan of mit said we show that shor s algorithm the most complex quantum algorithm known to date is reliable in a way where yes all you have to do is go in the lab apply more technology and you should be able to make a bigger quartus computer of course this may be a little easier said than done it might still cost an enormous amount of money to build you won t be building a quantum computer and putting it on your desktop daytime soon but now it s much more an engineering effort and not a basin physics question chuang added yet change has his team are hopeful for the future of quantum computing saying that they foresee it being straightforward capable once the apparatus can trap more atoms and more laser beams can control the pulses we see no physical reason why that is not going to be in the cards their findings have been published in the journal nature . quote from zaphod on march amquote from arcane on march pmquote from kmf on march amits kind of like tails but hardened

the discrepancy between what we know and what the people in academy security ircs know bow never mention drugs or anything illegal in ircs like this though because they obviously dont want their projects associated with illegal things but just discuss security abstracted from any illegal use cases . grsec is the primary new thing it is introducing to preconfigured solutions other than that it is taking isolation like phoenix qubes already did but with a unique implementation of it and amnesia like tails already did give been playing with grsec a bit lately and i cant believe i havent been using it longer it does a lot of things to increase security of the system two of the primary features are memory hardening and an rbac system the memory protections are provided by a part of grsec called pax one example of what they do is make what would otherwise be a certain successful exploit of a vulnerability and turn it into a probabilistic success via randomizing the memory layout and making the attacker guess addresses from a key space some exploits are just completely rendered intolerable though due to the memory restrictions on a program allowing it to operate normally but not to be maliciously modified into pwning your system as one example of a memory protection other than layout randomization it provides no bit in software no bit essentially makes it so an attacker can not execute assembly that overflow beyond a buffer in c it stands for non excusable bit even though most modern cpus have no bit in hardware the grsec software implementation hardens hardware implementations which i hear are often possible to bypass and provides it when there is no hardware implementation after you have pay enabled you need to patch some of your binaries because the default restrictions on what memory operations can be done break some programs that for whatever reason require some potentially risk memory ability there are like or something restrictions you can put on individual binaries about which memory options they can do by default i think it denies everything it deems potentially dangerous though because some binaries you will need to patch and disable protection flags on or else they will not work but then you can just disable whichever protection is breaking it and keep the others enabled you can also use something called fstack protector that is a gcc option that uses memory canaries for detecting buffer overflows and crashing the program before the attacker can do anything malicious after they overflow turning a potential remote code execution attack into a do attack by default the value for this is which means it only uses canaries to protect stack buffers of bytes or more but in the grsec for gentle anyway hardened gentle version of gentoo this is modified to protect all stack buffers with canaries if you compile your kernel yourself you can control this outside of grsec though not sure if the grsec patch that isnt gentoo specific changes this cflag or not i know grsec also has dozens of little miscellaneous security hardenings it makes to the system for example it hardens chroot to be more like a jail and it has the ability to deny new us devices after boot or after you toggle it to reject us devices with the goal of preventing pluggable forensic sticks and us sticks with exploit code from being plugged into your system while it is live and such but the two core features are pay memory protections and the rbac system then the second big feature of grsec is something called an rbac role based access controls this gives you fine grained controls over every application on the system it makes the default unfix access control system called a dac discretionary access controls look like a toy chmod and chown it lets you control nearly everything a program does like which ip addresses it can send traffic to it is a functions firewall which directories a user can even see exists which binaries can be executed which directories a binary can see even like you get binary grained access controls so you can set tor browser itself to only be able to communicate with the ip address tor is bound to and then even if tor browser is pwnt the attacker needs to disable the rbac to phone home so its reflectively an additional layer of isolation but subgraph also has virtual isolation layered with it the rbac has a really sophisticated learning mode for trying to get it bootstrapped you run it in learning mode and use the system for like a day doing non sensitive things and it allows anything that has happened in learning mode to happen again and blocks everything else with a warning and tells you what attempted to be done and then you can mutually enable it or keep it blocked and you can mutually tweak the profile from learning mode like you need to almost certainly but it helps get you started it has profiling tools for learning safe behaviors for individual program too and also a full system learning mode that you run at first just to bootstrap it rbac is more powerful than root too so the root user is actually restricted by it when it is enabled it makes it so an attacker who gets root doesnt pwn the entire system they need to pwn rbac after it is enabled you can see everything happening on your system that is denied like you get super fine grained control over what your system is allowed to do . quote from arcane on march amim sold as soon as it comes out in taking it for a test run the alpha iso is already out you can get a copy at . quote from kmf on march pmquote from

very little compared to the actual leading security people it would be absolutely shocking if asa couldnt pwn all of us given the discrepancy between what we know and what the people in academy security ircs know bow never mention drugs or anything illegal in ircs like this though because they obviously dont want their projects associated with illegal things but just discuss security abstracted from any illegal use cases . thats a sick os by any standard . ab made a security mistake when and what was the mistake i have to ask because i like ab . its proprietary so well probably never know without signing an nda or it might be there in a whitepaper somewhere but im too lazy to dig through that my gut tells me that it simply gets it from interrupt timings and possibly an on chip rng if the marvel tavor mg has one havent looked at its datasheet and may store a random seed across reboots if they arent total retards . i loved zaphods instructions the only thing i would add is to also export the private key to save somewhere very safe the old private key wont work with the new subkey the command to export it is gog export secret keys . i loved zaphods instructions the only thing i would add is to also export the private key to save somewhere very safe the old private key wont work with the new subkey the command to export it is gog export secret keys . i guess they are the same private keys i didnt realize when making the new subkey oh well no one listen to me if anyone does i just didnt want to lose my private key but if it doesnt change then no worries glad i learned how to create the new subkey i set it to months should be fine . thank you for this everyone should have learned and should always be learning from the past mistakes made by our predecessors . interesting to see whatsapp implement this given the furor over encryption i still wouldn trust them i done trust any app but according to their website this has been developed in collaboration with open whisper systems the people behind signal so that is a very encouraging sign whatsappencryption overviewtechnical white paperapril contentsintroduction terms client registration initiating session setup receiving session setup exchanging messages transmitting media and other attachments group messages call setup verifying keys transport security conclusion whatsapp encryption overviewapri l introductionthis white paper provides a technical explanation of whatsapp send to end encryption system for more information pleasevisit whatsapp s website at www whatsapp com securitywhatsapp messenger allows people to exchange messages includingchats group chats images sides voice messages and files and makewhatsapp calls around the world whatsapp messages and calls between sender and receiver that use whatsapp client software released aftermarch are end to end encrusted the signal protocol designed by open whisper systems is the basis forwhatsapp s end to end encryption this end to end encryption protocolis designed to prevent third parties and whatsapp from having plaintextaccess to messages or calls what s more even if encryption keysfrom a user s device are ever physically compromise they can not beused to go back in time to decrypt previously transmitted messages this document gives an overview of the signal protocol and its use inwhatsapp termspublic key types identity key pair a long term curve key pair generated at install time signed pre key a medium term curve key pair generated at install time signed by the identity key and rotatedon a periodic timed basis one time pre keys a queue of curve key pairs for onetime use generated at install time and replenished as needed session key types root key a byte value that is used to create chain keys chain key a byte value that is used to create messagekeys message key an byte value that is used to encrypt messagecontents bytes are used for an aes key bytes for ahmac sha key and bytes for an iv whatsapp encryption overviewapri l client registrationat registration time a whatsapp client transmits its public identitykey public signed pre key with its signature and a batch of publicone time pre keys to the server the whatsapp server stores thesepublic keys associated with the user s identifier at no time does thewhatsapp server have access to any of the client s private keys initiating session setupto communicate with another whatsapp user a whatsapp clientfirst needs to establish an encrusted session once the sessionis established clients do not need to rebuild a new session witheach other until the existing session state is lost through external event such as an app reinstall or device change to establish a session the initiating client initiator requests the public identity key public signed pre key and a single public one time pre keyfor the recipient the server returns the requested public key values a one timepre key is only used once so it is removed from server storageafter being requested if the recipient s latest batch of one timepre keys has been consumed and the recipient has not replenishedthem no one time pre key will be returned the initiator saves the recipient s identity key as irecipient thesigned pre key as srecipient and the one time pre key asorecipient the initiator generates an ephemeral curve key pair einitiator the initiator loads its own identity key as iinitiator the initiator calculates a master secret as master secret ecdh iinitiator srecipient ecdh einitiator irecipient ecdh einitiator srecipient ecdh einitiator orecipient if there is no one time pre key the final ecdh is omitted the initiator uses hkdf to create a root key and chain keysfrom the master secret receiving session setupafter building a long running encryption session the initiator can immediatelystart sending messages to the recipient even if the recipient is office until the recipient responds the initiator includes the information in theheader of all messages sent that the recipient requires to build a correspondingsession this includes the initiator s einitiator and iinitiator whatsapp encryption overviewapri l when the recipient receives a message that includes session setupinformation the recipient calculates the corresponding master secret usingits own private keys and the public keys advertised in the header ofthe incoming message the recipient deletes the one time pre key used by the initiator the initiator uses hkdf to derive a corresponding root key andchain keys from the master secret exchanging messagesonce a session has been established clients exchange messagesthat are protected with a message key using aes in cbcmode for encryption and hmac sha for authentication the message key changes for each message transmitted and is ephemeral such that the message key used toencrypt a message can not be constructed from the sessionstate after a message has been transmitted or received the message key is derived from a sender s chain key that ratchets forward with every message sent additional a new ecdhagreement is performed with each message roundtrip to create a enchain key this provides forward secrecy through the combinationof both an immediate hash ratchet and a round trip dh ratchet calculating a message key from a chain keyeach time a new message key is needed by amessage sender it is calculated as message key hmac sha chain key x the chain key is then dated as chain key hmac sha chain key x this causes the chain key to ratchet forward andalso means that a stored message key can t be used derive current or past values of the chain key calculating a chain key from a root keyeach time a message is transmitted an ephemeral curve public key is advertised along with it once a response is received a new chain key and root key are calculated as ephemeral secret ecdh ephemeralsender ephemeralrecipient whatsapp encryption overviewapri l chain key root key hkdf root key ephemeral secret a chain is only ever used to send messages from one user somessage keys are not refused because of the way message keysand chain keys are calculated messages can arrive delayed out of order or can be lost entirely without any problems transmitting media and otherattachmentslarge attachments of any type video audio images or files are also end to end encrusted the whatsapp user sending a message sender generates ephemeral byte aes key and an ephemeral byte hmacsha key the sender encrypts the attachment with the aes key in cbcmode with a random iv then appends a mac of the ciphertext usinghmac sha the sender uploads the encrusted attachment to a blob store the sender transmits a normal encrusted message to the recipientthat contains the encryption key the hmac key a sha hash ofthe encrusted blob and a pointer to the blob in the blob store the recipient decrypts the message retrieves the encrusted blobfrom the blob store verifies the sha hash of it verifies the mac and decrypts the plainest group messagestraditional unencrypted messenger apps typical employ server sidefan out for group messages a client wishing to send a messageto a group of users transmits a single message which is then distributed times to the n different group members by the server this is in contrast to client side fan out where a client would transmita single message n times to the n different group members itself messages to whatsapp groups build on the pairwise encryptedsessions outlined above to achieve efficient serve side fan out formost messages sent to groups this is accomplished using the sender keys component of the signal messaging protocol whatsapp encryption overviewapri l the first time a whatsapp group member sends a message to a group the sender generates a random byte chain key the sender generates a random curve signature key keypair the sender combines the byte chain key and the public keyfrom the signature key into a sender key message the sender individually encrypts the sender key to each memberof the group using the pairwise messaging protocol explained previously for all subsequent messages to the group the sender derives a message key from the chain key andupdates the chain key the sender encrypts the message using aes in cbc mode the sender signs the ciphertext using the signature key the sender transmits the single ciphertext message to the server which does server side fan out to all group participants the hash ratchet of the message sender s chain key providesforward secrecy whenever a group member leaves all groupparticipants clear their sender key and start over call setupwhatsapp calls are also end to end encrusted when a whatsapp user initiates a call the initiator builds an encrusted session with the recipient asoutlined in section initiating session setup if one does not alreadyexist the initiator generates a random byte srtp master secret the initiator transmits an encrusted message to the recipient thatsignals an incoming call and contains the srtp master secret if the responder answers the call a srtp encrusted call ensues verifying keyswhatsapp users additional have the option to verify the keys ofthe other users with whom they are communicating so that theyare able to confirm that an authorized third party or whatsapp has not initiated a man in the middle attack this can be done scanning a or code or by comparing a might number whatsapp encryption overviewapri l the qr code contains a version the user identifier for both parties the full byte public identity key for both parties when either user scans the other s qr code the keys arecompared to ensure that what is in the qr code matchesthe identity key as relieved from the server the might number is computed by concatenating the two digit homeric fingerprints for each user s identitykey to calculate a might homeric fingerprint imperatively sha hash the public identity key and user identifier times take the first bytes of the final hash output split the byte result into six bye chunks convert each byte chunk into digits by interpreting each bytechunk as a big endian signed integer and reducing it mould concatenate the six groups of five digits into thirty digits transport securityall communication between whatsapp clients and whatsapp serversis layered within a separate encrusted channel on windows phone iphone and android those end to end encryption capable clients usenoise pipes with curve aes gcm and sha from the noiseprotocol framework for long running interactive connections this provides clients with a few nice properties extremely fast lightweight connection setup and resume encrypts metadata to hide it from authorized network observers no information about the connecting user s identity is revealed no client authentication secrets are stored on the server clientsauthenticate themselves using a curve key pair so the serveronly stores a client s public authentication key if the server s userdatabase is ever compromise no private authentication credentialswill be revealed whatsapp encryption overviewapri l conclusionmessages between whatsapp users are protected with an unto end encryption protocol so that third parties and whatsappcannot read them and so that the messages can only be decryptedby the recipient all types of whatsapp messages includingchats group chats images sides voice messages and files and whatsapp calls are protected by end to end encryption whatsapp servers do not have access to the private keys ofwhatsapp users and whatsapp users have the option to verifykeys in order to ensure the integrity of their communication the signal protocol library used by whatsapp is open source availablehere whatsapp encryption overviewapri l . quote from rahu on april honestly fuck whatsapp even if they have decided to go the ethical route this was only done in the wake of some major companies playing the guinea pig beforehand against the state which means they are only looking to utilize encryption as a gimmick in an age of surveillance and that they are cowards as developers we wont stick our necks out for the ideology or cause but we will capitalize and make money off of it and get some great favourable press welcome to the age of the silicon valley cocksuckers open whisper systems is legitimate and did it right from the ground up so them collaborating is the best of a bad scenario i suppose in sure to ows anyone hopping on board for the encryption express during the new phase of the crypto wars is incentive enough to help but i done trust anyone who uses anonymity or encryption as a gimmick first and a fundamental aspect to the app software itself to better the common man second i share your sentiment rahu however i am still encouraged to see a large provider implement this technology regardless of their intentions or how they got here the more companies than embrace this technology the better . quote from schlangemann on april pmi dont want to open new topic on this question does viber hold its messages in plaintext are its contents easily accessible via rd party apps when a phone is seized and its contents copied i understand signal messages can not be seen since they are end to end encryption of course it would depend how well the contents are copied i believe thanks for your thoughs schlangeaccording to the wikipedia page on viber on november viber scored out of points on the electric frontier foundations secure messaging scorecard viber received a point for encryption during transit but lost points because communications are not encrusted with a key that the provider have access to i e the communications are not end to end encrusted users can not verify contacts identities past messages are not secure if the encryption keys are stolen i e the service does not provide forward secrecy the code is not open to independent review i e the code is not open source the security design is not properly document and there has not been a recent independent security audit in other words i wouldnt touch it with a barge pole im not even sure id use it to talk to my relatives zaphod . quote from schlangemann on april

having ever read anything about viber using encryption true end to end encryption means messages are decrypted on the devise only and can not be read by anyone during the transmission process . quote

the phones running wickr as i remarked this sounds to me like a disinformation op with the goal of getting people off of signal with its strong crypto to another platform that the cops could more

encryption keysryan gallagher t a british court on tuesday rejected an attempt by security agents to force an alleged hacker to hand over his encryption keys thirty one year old lauri love has been accused by u s authorities of hacking into u s government networks between and including those of the department of defense the environment protection agency the department of energy and nasa in october the u k s equivalent of the fbi the national crime agency raided love s home and seized his computers and hard drives but some of the devices contained encrusted data meaning the agency could not access it initials the british authorities served love with an order under section of the u k s controversial regulation of investigator powers act which demanded that he hand over his passwords to open encrusted files stored on the devices he declined to comply and the national crime agency did not push the issue love was not charged with an offense under any british laws however when love recently launched a civil case seeking the return of his computers and storage devices the agency renewed its encryption demand and attempted to turn the civil proceedings around on him by using them

every two or three months last time i did this was about two months ago . quote from tambourine on may pmi loved zaphods instructions the only thing i would add is to also export the private key to save somewhere very safe the old private key wont work with the new subkey the command to export it is gog export secret keysquote the old private key wont work with the new subkey are you sure about that tambourine your existing private key will still work with the new encryption sub key youve just generated anyone wishing to send you an encrusted message will need to import your new public key

plunderinpete on april pmim not sure what is different between this and a generic stripped web vuln scanner that is run through a tor proxy i would imagine ease of use and if its worth its weight it will be open source and highly poked and proved by members of the infosec community and further fortified this would offer both the fundamental security and academy scrutiny necessary to build a powerful tool that is specifically designed for the backing of dnm and hidden services exposure is also a big part of it having someone who is willing to go on he record and through the furnace to develop these types of works is just as essential itd be a grave misstep to not support something that could have far reaching benefits in this space just because some of us are willing to take a scene or alternative route . i dont want to open new topic on this question does viber hold its messages in plaintext are its contents easily accessible via rd party apps when a phone is seized and

war between law enforcement and encryption is far from over by the look of things yesterday afternoon the dutch police and government officials shut down a communication network using pgp encryption according to the official statement this system was used by criminals although it remains to be seen whether or not his is the case also read bitin wallets of the future secure hardware needed sooner than laterpgp network and dedicated encrusted smartphonesbitcoinist blackberry pgp encryptionwith all of the recent focus on governments trying to break consumer encryption to prevent terrors attacks it only seems normal people are starting to take their privacy more seriously this creates new business opportunities for companies as well as one company called ennetcom locked in nijmegen the netherlands started selling smartphones which supported pgp encryption for all communication additional several new communication networks have been created based on pip encryption allowing users to communicate freely with each other this has been a thorn in the eye of the dutch government for quite some time now as they strongly feel such platforms facilitate criminal activity the smartphone company used their servers for this type of encrusted communication keeping all information safe from prying government eyes however it didn t take all that long for law enforcement to dig deeper into these servers and they have alleged uncovered a substantial amount of information related to criminal activity moreover law enforcement officials claim this pgp encryption service had over registered users all of whom have been notified regarding the pending police investigation to make matters even more enticing the ennetcom company owner who sold these pip encryption devices for up to eur each has been arrested and money laundering claims have been made against him at the time of writing no further details were released to the public regarding these allegations what we do know is how the dutch law enforcement collaborated with the toronto police to shut down this pgp encrypted network one of the servers was locked in canada and has been taken offline by canadian officials it appears these efforts were part of the going war against blackberry users who keep their communication encrusted just last week news broke how canadian law enforcement agencies acquired a blackberry master key to decrypt ping to ping messaging . quote from toctou on april amits proprietary so well probably never know without signing an nda or it might be there in a whitepaper somewhere but im too lazy to dig through that my gut tells me that it simply gets it from interrupt timings and possibly an on chip rng if the marvel tavor mg has one havent looked at its datasheet and may store a random seed across reboots if they arent total retards i briefly looked into and saw that blackberry publishes an api so applications can eternally feed entropy so i feel youre probably correct toctou . quote from zaphod on april amquote from kitten on april ami dont see why a blackberry couldnt generate a key in a couple minutes you may well be right im just not familiar with the blackberry os nor the marvel tavor mg ghz processor used in these phones one of the problems with generating keys of this type is the need for random numbers usually this is done with a pseudo random number generator prng which is seemed with values derived from keystone timings or mouse mousements i dont know whether the average blackberry user would be willing to type for the couple of minutes required to seed the prng properly zaphodthats what fills up the entropy pool on most computers and honestly im not sure how blackberry feeds entropy but i can think of a lot of ways from using the radio to the microphone to the simplest which is asking the user to wiggle his or her finger around the touchscreen for a while which has a lot more effective keys than a keyboard . quote from bootiusmaximus on april amquote from zaphod on april amquote from pckabml on april pminteresting read how does that compare to wickr as give mentioned elsewhere wickr is an american company with its headquarters in san francisco wickr is also not open source these two factors alone would normally be enough to make me avoid them but it was also recently reported that a vendor on alphabay was claiming that some of his crew were busted and the cops managed to retrieve data off of the phones running signal but not off of the phones running wickr as i remarked this sounds to me like a disinformation op with the goal of getting people off of signal with its strong crypto to another platform that the cops could more easily get to since wickr is closed source who is to say they havent been forced to put in a backdoor for the cops zaphodhe wasnt a vendor on ab afaik but a random user who commented on the dhl forums thanks for the correction thats what happens when ya get old the memory is the first to go zaphod . interesting read how does that compare to wickr . honestly luck whatsapp even if they have decided to go the ethical route this was only done in the wake of some major companies playing the guinea pig beforehand against the state which means they are only looking to utilize encryption as a gimmick in an age of surveillance and that they are cowards as developers we wont stick our necks out for the ideology or cause but we will capitalize and make money off of it and get some great favourable press welcome to the age of the silicon valley cocksuckers open whisper systems is legitimate and did it right from the ground up so them collaborating is the best of a bad scenario i suppose in sure to ows anyone hopping on board for the encryption express during the new phase of the crypto wars is incentive enough to help but i done trust anyone who uses anonymity or encryption as a gimmick first and a fundamental aspect to the app software itself to better the common man second . bastards . quote from aethon on april amthank you for this everyone should have learned and should always be learning from the past mistakes made by our predecessors i think that onion scan software is one the

should go a long way to helping keep people safe . dark web drug dealers are making sloppy mistakeswritten byjoseph coxcontributorapril pm eststaying anonymous on the so called dark web can be really hard despite the protections offered by the anonymizing network tor site owners can still inadvertently leak details about themselves using a newly released tool for scanning tor hidden services motherboard found eight illegal sites that are leaking potentially identifying information about their owners on mollyworld a hidden service run by a team of vendors selling mdma metadata in an image revealed that the camera used was a iron d a site run by vendor doctor drugs is being hasted on the same server as another hidden service called the polish connect possibly alluding to the vendors location on other marketplaces doctor drugs lists the dispatch location as the netherlands the forum of outlaw market a site predominated selling drugs has its server status page exposed allowing anyone to see technical information about the site as does the real deal a marketplace focusing on the sale of computer exploits and charlie uk a cocaine dealers site counterfeit goods endor rechard sport and intelligent black market and the french connection also had issues these indiscretions put the dealers at risk and also potentially the buyersmotherboard uncovered these issues by using onionscan a custom tool developed by independent security researcher sarah jamie lewis and deployed it against every site listed on the news site deep dot web the point of onionscan is to make you a better onion service provider you owe it to yourself and your users to ensure that attackers can not easily exploit and deanonymize the tool s github page reads it scans for common issues such as image data open directories and exposed server status pages all of the data that onionscan collects is public the tool was released over the weekend and lewis previously told motherboard i want anonymity tools to be the best there are people whose lives depend on them in her research lewis also found many drug sites making sloppy security mistakes if so may of those sites are failing themselves and their users i am willing to bet so are anonymous political blogs and other users who desperately need the anonymity she previously said it appears drug dealers who start their own sites are making more sloppy mistakes than the administrators of dark web marketplaces such as say alphabay that may suggest that drug dealers who have made the switch from selling on marketplaces to their own digital shops arent as teach savvy as those behind the main sites that being said mistakes were still apparent on normal marketplaces often dark web criminals are arrested largely due to their own mistakes such as linking a personal email address to their site or by using a highly moralised piece of slang these indiscretions put the dealers at risk and also potentially the buyers onionscan shows that despite the spectacular undoing of the original dark web drug site silk road overlooked digital footprints are still fairly common on the dark web . quote from zaphod on april amquote from schlangemann on april pmi dont want to open new topic on this question does viber hold its messages in plaintext are its contents easily accessible via rd party apps when a phone is seized and its contents copied i understand signal messages can not be seen since they are end to end encryption of course it would depend how well the contents are copied i believe thanks for your thoughs schlangeaccording to the wikipedia page on viber on november viber scored out of points on the electric frontier foundations secure messaging scorecard viber received a point for encryption during transit but lost points because communications are not encrusted with a key that the provider have access to i e the communications are not end to end encrusted users can not verify contacts

it was stopped on i think it was more specific than that the money quote is this law enforcement officials claim this pgp encryption service had over registered users all of whom have been notified regarding the pending police investigation any dutch speakers can see the notification here an english translation would be much appreciated i think the reason this company was gone after is the relatively small number of subscribers this is not like going after blackberry itself which would maybe have on the order of orders of magnitude more customers i seem to remember seeing these phones advertised not only were they pricey at a supported each there was almost no information about how these actually worked up until fairly recently i am led to believe that many phones lacked the memory and processor power needed to generate decent sized encryption keys these phones blackberry s are from making them about years old for all we know this could have been another hushmail there is no information as to who generated the keys where they were generated how etc as usual the devil is in the details and details are few and far between frankly i would not have touched these devices with a barge pole i spent a few minutes poking around and i actually found that their web pages are still up and operation which was a surprise the company is question is a dutch company this is really surprising as the netherlands is one of the few countries on the planet that actually enshrines the right of citizens to privacy of their communications as part of the dutch constitution quotes mime

arcane on april pmquote from tang on april pmi miss bbm messenger all the cool kids had a blackberry curve as soon as it became apparent that bbm operated outside of state surveillance capabilities at the time it was stopped on i think it was more specific than that the money quote is this law enforcement officials claim this pgp encryption service had over registered users all of whom have been notified regarding the pending police investigation any dutch speakers can see the notification here an english translation would be much appreciated i think the reason this company was gone after is the relatively small number of subscribers this is not like going after blackberry itself which would maybe have on the order of orders of magnitude more customers i seem to remember seeing these phones advertised not only were they pricey at a supported each there was almost no information about how these actually worked up until fairly recently i am led to believe that many phones lacked the memory and processor power needed to generate decent sized encryption keys these phones blackberry s are from making them about years old for all we know this could have been another hushmail there is no information as to who generated the keys where they were generated how etc as usual the devil is in the details and details are few and far between frankly i would not have touched these devices with a barge pole i spent a few minutes poking around and i actually found that their web pages are still up and operation which was a surprise the company is question is a dutch company this is really surprising as the netherlands is one of the few countries on the planet that actually enshrines the right of citizens to privacy of their communications as part of the dutch constitution quotes

check if your dark web site really is anonymouswritten joseph coxcontributorapril am estsites on the so called dark web are designed to protect the anonymity of both their visitors and owners but plenty of administrators make mistakes in setting them up sometimes leading to the servers real in address being leaned or they might leave identifying metadata in files unloaded to the site now a researcher has developed a custom tool for automatically scanning tor hidden services for a slew of vulnerabilities and issues meaning anyone from dark web drug lords to people hosting whistleblowing platforms can make sure that their site really is protected i want anonymity tools to be the best there are people whose lives depend on them sarah jamin lewis the independent security researcher who came up with the tool told motherboard in an encrusted chat onionscan as the program is called checks sites for problems that may unmask servers or identify their owners that might be an open server status page which allows anyone to see what other sites are being hasted by the same person or there might be metadata in images on the site revealing gas coordinates of where they were taken the first version of onionscan will be released this weekend lewis said while doing some research earlier this year i kept coming across the same issues in hidden services exposed apache status pages images not stripped of exif data pages revealing information about the tools used to build it with etc the goal is to provide an easy way of testing these things to drive up the security bar lewis added it works pretty much the same as any web security scanner just tailor for deanonymization vectors she continued onionscan is not subtle however it is worth noting that the software is noisy it needs to make a number of requests to download images and files lewis said it sticks out like a sore thumb in logs lewis started her research with dark web markets assuming that they would have developed some cool security features they have a huge economic incentive to be innovative in this space assuming they arent trying to scam people she added indeed the marketplace alphabay has made it mandatory for vendors to use two factor authentication however what i also found was many many sites failing basin security practices like the above so many that i started to write a tool to help me catalogue them and this is where the tool came from lewis said if so may of those sites are failing themselves and their users i am willing to bet so are anonymous political blogs and other users who desperately need the anonymity other researchers have previously reported pretty serious problems with how hidden services have been configured uk based thomas white discovered the in address of the now defunct kiss marketplace as well as that of a dark web fraud market in june of last year white claimed to have gathered information on more than sites and the in addresses of eight in future updates lewis tool will also pull other potentially identifying data such as pip keys and comparing the different software used to generate them . quote from nutt on april prim very curious especially

one could you explain this one please quote from rahu on april pmjoking aside though in marry this woman ditto if i wasnt already married zaphodyou can do the full research if you like its a pretty prominent story in the archives of hacker culture and history hagbard was a hacker from germany who associated online in the same pools of talents early day hackers that you would have found year old mendax julian assange and the members of his teenage hacking group the international subversives around this time hagbard became apparently tied up in espionage doing hacking for both the underground and the state and his body was one day found in some german forest tied to a tree and set ablaze during the cold war era the hacking scene was always entrenched in the idea of a unclean globe fallout as well as increasing online presence from the authorities of the state that had finally begun to make headway with some of its first hacking persecutions which some of us would laugh at now but were a big deal back then hagbards tale went on to send a very chilling spectre amongst the early hacking communities psychologically speaking the detachment from reality is what drove many early hackers and still drives some today but hagbards death blurred the line considerably the s s had many big moments but this is one of the few moments in hacker history where the utter fear and contempt for the state really became validated outside of the obvious contrast in ideology and beliefs it became extremely personal hackers were few and far between at that level back then and the only way you could get online was essentially through massive university networks that youd have to gain access to everyone was anonymous but extremely close with each others alter eggs and this along with several other incidents and hacks mendax hacking milnet which managed the entire us military complex in the late s early s in which he and the international subversives had a backdoor for like two years is the momentum that carried hackers and activists into the first phase of the crypto wars and the first wave of cypherpunks . grsec is the primary new thing it is introducing to preconfigured solutions other than that it is taking isolation like phoenix qubes already did but with a unique implementation of it and amnesia like tails already did give been playing with grsec a bit lately and i cant believe i havent been using it longer it does a lot of things to increase security of the system two of the primary features are memory hardening and an rbac system the memory protections are provided by a part of grsec called pax one example of what they do is make what would otherwise be a certain successful exploit of a vulnerability and turn it into a probabilistic success via randomizing the memory layout and making the attacker guess addresses from a key space some exploits are just completely rendered intolerable though due to the memory restrictions on a program allowing it to operate normally but not to be maliciously modified into pwning your system as one example of a memory protection other than layout randomization it provides no bit in software no bit essentially makes it so an attacker can not execute assembly that overflow beyond a buffer in c it stands for non excusable bit even though most modern cpus have no bit in hardware the grsec software implementation hardens hardware implementations which i hear are often possible to bypass and provides it when there is no hardware implementation after you have pay enabled you need to patch some of your binaries because the default restrictions on what memory operations can be done break some programs that for whatever reason require some potentially risk memory ability there are like or something restrictions you can put on individual binaries about which memory options they can do by default i think it denies everything it deems potentially dangerous though because some binaries you will need to patch and disable protection flags on or else they will not work but then you can just disable whichever protection is breaking it and keep the others enabled you can also use something called fstack protector that is a gcc option that uses memory canaries for detecting buffer overflows and crashing the program before the attacker can do anything malicious after they overflow turning a potential remote code execution attack into a do attack by default the value for this is which means it only uses canaries to protect stack buffers of bytes or more but in the grsec for gentle anyway hardened gentle version of gentoo this is modified to protect all stack buffers with canaries if you compile your kernel yourself you can control this outside of grsec though not sure if the grsec patch that isnt gentoo specific changes this cflag or not i know grsec also has dozens of little miscellaneous security hardenings it makes to the system for example it hardens chroot to be more like a jail and it has the ability to deny new us devices after boot or after you toggle it to reject us devices with the goal of preventing pluggable forensic sticks and us sticks with exploit code from being plugged into your system while it is live and such but the two core features are pay memory protections and the rbac system then the second big feature of grsec is something called an rbac role based access controls this gives you fine grained controls over every application on the system it makes the default unfix access control system called a dac discretionary access controls look like a toy chmod and chown it lets you control nearly everything a program does like which ip addresses it can send traffic to it is a functions firewall which directories a user can even see exists which binaries can be executed which directories a binary can see even like you get binary grained access controls so you can set tor browser itself to only be able to communicate with the ip address tor is bound to and then even if tor browser is pwnt the attacker needs to disable the rbac to phone home so its reflectively an additional layer of isolation but subgraph also has virtual isolation layered with it the rbac has a really sophisticated learning mode for trying to get it bootstrapped you run it in learning mode and use the system for like a day doing non sensitive things and it allows anything that has happened in learning mode to happen again and blocks everything else with a warning and tells you what attempted to be done and then you can mutually enable it or keep it blocked and you can mutually tweak the profile from learning mode like you need to almost certainly but it helps get you started it has profiling tools for learning safe behaviors for individual program too and also a full system learning mode that you run at first just to bootstrap it rbac is more powerful than root too so the root user is actually restricted by it when it is enabled it makes it so an attacker who gets root doesnt pwn the entire system they need to pwn rbac after it is enabled you can see everything happening on your system that is denied like you get super fine grained control over what your system is allowed to do . quote from arcane on march pmquote from kmf on march amits kind of like tails but hardened passively more so its like tails whonix tubes steroids thats what i wanted to hear i think it

in hardly risking it all . it looks pretty cool but there is a lot of new independently developed code that hasnt seen many eyes ill probably give it a go and use it just for my non incriminating everyday use to see how it feels . quote from arcane on march pmquote from kmf on march amits kind of like tails but hardened passively more so its like tails whonix tubes steroids thats what i wanted
