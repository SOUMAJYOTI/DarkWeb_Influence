so give been using coinbase since getting on the dn a couple months ago and then a few different tumblers before depositing in the markets its linked to my checking account but it doesnt concern me because i buy some ecstasy and marijuana edibles for personal use and thats it i like the convenience of coinbase but now they keep fucking with my daily purchase limits which causes me to lose out on good deals on the markets and now in order to raise those limits theyre requiring additional pieces of verification like scanning my dl i guess it doesn matter because they already have my personal info but in looking for an alternative they can suck a bag of dicks before i scan an id i wont buy bitin local or in person im a pettie blonde raver chick and dont want that risk id like to buy online but am not sure where ive researched this topic briefly on deepdotweb but theres quite a few smart boys on here and i want expert advice thank you . depending on the country your in it can vary in ireland and uk you can buy btc with no id and pay with cash or bank deposit on a site called it can also be used worldwide but as i said i dont know about not using id in other countries but there is always someone who might charge you maybe quid extra for say our worth and meet you in person with a laptop for it thats where most people use and as for mixing i done mix my coins when sending them in i only do it when taking them out the markets serve would have to seized and law enforcement would have to go through every account like and then go and match up the accounts btc right back to were it came from and if you used id then you get caught but if no id then your safe and not to mention the amount of resources that would have to be used to just trace a btc address would be too much so in my opinion i dont see the need for a mixer when sending it in if your only a buyer cashing out is another ball game altogether . so give been using coinbase since getting on the dn a couple months
