last february he wrote that law enforcement and security agencies could use technologies to access the data they need in cleartext before it gets encrusted by the device and sent to the network and after it is received from the network and decrypted by the device itself actually this is precisely what we do the buyersthe push into the local district attorney market for which the company considered san bernardino a pilot appears to have been facilitate by ss a massive california based security company that markets to law enforcement agencies in the united states and abroad rabe denied that ss is working with hacking team despite emails between the companies the local market could be lucrative a budget for the district attorney in new york that hacking team proposed in april totaled in front license fees and another in services and maintenance as with so many other surveillance technologies that were originally created for the military and intelligence community they eventually trickle down to local law enforcement who start using them without seeking the approval of legislators and in many cases keeping the courts in the dark too said christopher soghoian principal technologist of the american civil liberties union the dea fbi and army bought hacking team s software through a company called cicom which for several years served as a middleman for hacking team s u s business the dea and army contracts to buy remote control system through cicom were first revealed by the advocacy group privacy international this spring reporters noted that cicom shared the same incorporate address in the united states as hacking team but when asked about the connection by ars technica hacking team s u s spokesperson erie rabe said i can not confirm any relationship between the company cicom and hacking team alex velasco cicom s general manager has in fact been a consultant under contract to represent hacking team to clients in north america since company emails show the relationship ended in march after hacking team accused velasco of scheming to market competing products according to an internal investigation commissioned by hacking team velasco declined to comment to the intercept on the allegations because he is in legal proceedings with hacking team hacking team was also in talks in with the fbi s national domestic communications assistance center a secrecie unit formed in and focused on interception technologies velasco claims in an email that the group came to them after citizen lab a research group at the university of toronto accused on internet technology and human rights published a highly critical report on hacking team s globe sales if anything good came out of the citizen lab articles is that it brought them to contact us to see if it was true he wrote thank you citizen lab it s not clear from hacking team emails what army component bought an rcs system in but it was based at fort meade and apparently sat unused for years according to a email from velasco they purchased a system right before they got their budget cut they were never given permission to pull an internet line to their office to install the system ridiculous but true hacking team was in the midst of negotiations for a new fbi contract from cicom after velasco s firing but the agency decided to go with another vendor due to budget timing issues according to an email from philip vinci hacking team s vice president for business development besides the product was seen as a nice to have by fbi but they confessed they were using it for low level types of investigations for critical operations they were using another platform wrote vinci he said the fbi wanted more ability to go after users of tor the anonymizing web browser those users accounted for percent of its targets but hacking team appeared determined to continue its conquest of the u s market there will be a process to have he us inc accredited wrote operations manager daniele milan he pledged to stay in touch with the fbi marketing new features and identifying problems to resolve for them in exchange for while hacking team s emails reveal the company to be strongest about selling only to governments the company officials appear to worry less about how its technology is used once it gets to those customers responding to concerns raised by the district attorney of new york in hacking team s chief operating officer giancarlo russo wrote that all the consideration regarding the legal framework can not be addressed by us instead he was more concerned about local customers ability to use the product reflectively if you buy a ferrari they can teach you how to drive they can not grant you will be the winner of the race he wrote to his colleagues in english if bertha sell you a gun the most peculiar and sophisticated one they can teach how to use it they can not grant you are going to shoot your target properly on the field . since there isnt a monero thread i have

surveillance faltered through specification of some individual and social dimensions of information control the two can be related in a variety of empirick and ethical configurations in both academy and popular discussion privacy is too often justified as a value because of what it is presumed to do for individuals but as this volume shows it can also be a positive social value because of what it does for the group an additional point neglected by some of privacy s more trident supporters is that it can also be an anti social value tied to private property and modernization in contrast surveillance is too often criticise for what it is presumed to do for more powerful groups whether government or corporations relative to the individual but it can also be a pro social value just as privacy can support the dignity and freedom to act of the person surveillance can protect the integrity and independence of groups vital to a pluralistic democratic society and it can offer protection to individuals whether for the dependent such as children and the sick or to those who like clean water and industrial safety and do not want their precious liberties destroyed by enemies surveillance like privacy can be good for the individual and for the society but like privacy it can also have negative consequences for both as with most interesting questions it all depends but what does it depend on to begin with we must come to terms with the meaning of some basin terms for information control a map and a common language are required to explain and evaluate fundamental properties contexts and behaviors involving personal information the empirick richness of information protection and revelation needs to be disentangled and passed into basin categories and dimensions some of the confusion and debate about privacy and surveillance is caused by the failure to consider different types of these and the dimensions which may cross cut and divide them varying time periods the particular groups and individuals in question and the variety of positive and negative consequences and ways of measuring and weighing these must be noted little can or better should be universally said about the topic apart from such specification terms must be defined and connections noted what we see and conclude depends on how we turn the conceptual kaleidoscope in broadening and turning the kaleidoscope this article considers some connections between surveillance privacy and publicity elaborates on some meanings of surveillance and privacy and then considers contexts and goals and conflicts between goals that inform the formative questions and make them so challenging related but distinct surveillance and privacy privacy and publicity how do surveillance and privacy relate before considering their logical empirick and ethical connections they need to be seen as elements within a broader sociology of information control framework they both are about the control of information in one case as discovery in the other as protection at the most basin level surveillance is a way of accessing data surveillance implies an agent who accesses whether through discovery tools rules or physical logistical settings personal data privacy in contrast involves a subject who restricts access to personal data through the same means in popular and academy dialogue surveillance is often wrongly seen to be the opposite of privacy and in simplistic dramaturgy the former is seen as bad and the latter good for example social psychologist kelvin kelvin emphasized privacy as a nullification mechanism for surveillance but kelvin s assertion needs to be seen as only one of four basin empirick connections between privacy and surveillance surveillance is not necessarily the dark side of the social dimension of privacy yes privacy or better actions taken to restrict access to all or only to insiders may serve to nullify surveillance familiar examples are encryption whispering and disguises but surveillance may serve to protect privacy examples include biometric identification and audit trails privacy may serve to protect surveillance consider undercover police who use various fronts and false identification to protect their real identity and activities surveillance may serve to nullify privacy as kelvin claims big data night vision video cameras drugs tests break through protection borders privacy may be easier to think about than surveillance because it has opposites consider privacy publicity nouns privatization publicization action nouns privatize publicize verbs the noun surveillance and the verb to surveil are the same figures of speech as privacy and privatization the latter however have their opposites in publicity and publicization but where are the equivalent opposites for surveillance as a noun and a verb if privacy and publicity are opposites can we say that privacy and surveillance are also opposites they can certainly be in opposition but it does not then follow that to surveil and to publicize are automatically joined although as the next paragraph suggests they can be linked in english there is no easy term for the action which is the opposite of surveillance the verb form to surveil suggests actively surveying by an agent just as the verb form to privatize suggests actively protecting although the more common usage involves property rights as with privatization while publicize is the opposite of privatize the best worst term we have for a potential surveillance agent who doesn t act is that he or she demonstrates anti or non surveillance the agent chooses not to act he or she doesn t want to know as with the proverbial three monkeys who were capable of surveilling but did not one form here is minimization in which a surveillance agent engages in self restraint given laws or policies e g wiretap restrictions in a search warrant in contrast with privatization the subject who has the data chooses to act to protect restrict its being known by unspecified others but the subject could also take actions of publicization in efforts to broadcast it the distinct activities covered by the umbrella term surveillance do not have equivalent implications for privacy the most common meaning refers to an act of data discovery collection but these occur within a broader system of connected activities seven kinds of activity conceived as surveillance strips can be noted tool selection subject selection collection processing analysis interpretation uses action and data fate considered together these strips constitute the surveillance occasion and offer a way to bind a given application privacy is most likely to be at issue with respect to data collection and uses that involve the communication of results the discovery of information and its communication are sequential linked surveillance involves the ferretting out or at least reception of data it thus has an element of publicization at least to the surveillant who finds it in this sense to make public is to make available to at least some persons beyond those whose initials have the data the public or better audience for results may be animal as with surveillance data classified as top secret proprietary or confidential here the results of surveillance are private even in the act of their becoming public to some although the agent may not share it yet this involves an act of restricting information rather than an offering or broadcasting to the public as the term is usually understood e g in the form of a newspaper story a posting on a webpage or foil results privacy and publicityprivacy like surveillance is a mufti dimensions concept whose contours are often ill defined contested negotiated and fluid dependent on the context and culture consideration needs to be given to how the different forms of privacy and surveillance relate beyond considering these as generic forms among some major forms are information westin aesthetic rule et al decision decew and proprietary allen privacy information privacy is the most significant and contested contemporary form and involves the rules and conditions around personal information violations of aesthetic privacy while usually carrying animal implications for life chances are often the most shocking as with a hidden video camera in a girl s locker room breaches of decision or proprietary privacy involve application or use of private information rather than information discovery which is the core of surveillance however if individuals can nullify surveillance e g hiding their use of contraceptives when that was illegal blocking paparazzi from taking pictures encryption then they need not worry about that information being used brief mention can be made of the term public in relation to the term private and they can be linked within the same framework both involve rules about the protection and revelation of information privacy norms are discretionary in generally giving individuals the right to control their personal information and restrict surveillance agents publicity norms require that information not be restricted that is that it be made public in effect legitimating the surveillance s discovery actions when the rules specify that a surveillance agent is not to ask certain questions of or about a person and the subject has discretion about what to reveal we can speak of privacy norms when the rules specify that the subject must reveal the information or the agent must seek it we can speak of publicity norms or better perhaps disclosure norms with publicity norms the subject has an obligation to reveal and or the agent to discover marx as with surveillance there are a multiplicity of legitimate goals for privacy and publicity and the social consequences depend on the context the time period and the particular interests involved in and of themselves and viewed abstract as will be argued with surveillance they are neither good nor bad there is often an primal point and a going too far in either direction may have negative consequences no one wants to live in a fish bowl or spot light all the time and privacy can protect the ability to act strategically and can protect the individual against discrimination and other forms of unfair treatment privacy can aide in presenting a positive sense of self and give a feeling of being in control reflectively sharing information can be a resource for intimacy and trust the contribution of information control to autonomous group action is central for a democracy and a free market yet privacy can also protect illegality and hiding information is a central feature of deception and can be destructive of community a rich mixture of consequences can also be seen for publicity as visibility it can bring accountability and fairness but in violating legitimate privacy it can be invasion and can make it difficult for groups to pursue their goals the last section considers some goal and value conflicts let us next turn to some further elements of surveillance what is surveillance the english noun surveillance comes from the french verb surveiller it is related to the latin term vigilare with its hint that something vaguely sinister or threatening lurks beyond the watchtower and town walls still the threat might be successfully warned off by the vigilant this ancient meaning is reflected in the association many persons still make of surveillance with the activities of police and national security agencies yet in contemporary society the term has a far wider meaning the dictionary thesaurus and popular usage suggest a set of related activities look observe watch supervise control gaze stare view scrutinize examine check out scan screen inspect survey glean scope monitor track follow spy eavesdrop test guard while some of these are more inclusive than others and can be logically linked e g moving from look to monitor and while we might tease out subtle and distinctive meanings for each involving a particular sense activity or function they all reflect what the philosopher ludwig wittgenstein calls a family of meanings within the broader concept wittgenstein at the most general level surveillance of humans which is often but need not be synonymous with human surveillance can be defined as regard or attendance to others whether a person a group or an aggregate as with a national census or to factors presumed to be associated with these a central feature is gathering some form of data connectable to individuals whether as unique identified or as a member of a category this may or may not involve revealing what was private as in not knowing and or supporting or violating a norm about how a subject s information is to be responded to a verb such as observe is not included in the definition because the nature of the means or the senses involved suggests subtypes and issues for analysis and ought not to be foreclosed by a definition e g how do visual auditory text and other forms of surveillance compare with respect to factors such as obtrusiveness validity and the perception of a privacy invasion if such a verb is needed to scrutinize regard or attend to is preferable to observe with its tilt toward the visual the multiplicity of surveillance goalsmany contemporary theorists offer a narrower definition tied to the goal of control e g rule et al dandecker lyon manning monahan a factor that contributes to surveillance being viewed as on the dark side taking a cue from foucault s earlier writings control as domination is emphasized whether implicitly or implicitly rather than as a more positive direction or neutral discipline yet as lands lianos observes the modern role of surveillance as control must be placed in perspective alongside its fundamental importance in enhancing institution efficiency and services and also in offering protection to individuals and societies surveillance particularly as it involves the state and organizations but also in role relationships as in the family commonly involves power differences and on balance favors the more powerful understanding this is furthered with comparisons to settings where control and domination are not central as with other goals such as surveillance for protection entertainment or contractual relations where surveillance is reciprocal and where it does not only or necessarily flow downward or serves to disadvantage the subject authority and power relations are closely related to the ability to collect and use data the conditions for accessing and using information are elements of a democratic society haggerty and samatas the greater the equality in subject agent settings the more likely it is that surveillance will be i lateral given the nature of social interaction and a resource rich society with civil liberties there is appreciate data collection from below as well as from above and also across settings reciprocal surveillance can also be seen in many hierarchal settings mann man refers to watchful vigilance from below as sousveillance the historical changes foucault observed in discipline and punish foucault are central for the analysis of contemporary events even if in that book he does not go beyond no examples of computer dossiers or biometric analysis bolster his case yet one unfortunate legacy of his work is to call attention away from the pro social aspects of surveillance and technology more broadly foucault s empirick documentation is illustrative rather than systematic and tends to exclude important surveillance topics beyond the control of superordinates in hierarchal organizations his tone and examples give a subversive even conspiratorial twist to the hallowed ideals of the renaissance and the enlightenment regarding the consequences of seeking truth and social betterment rather than ensuring freedom and universal benefits knowledge serves the more powerful however he does not offer an adequate theory of why hierarchy is necessarily undesirable with respect to categories i suggest elsewhere mary forthcoming foucault focuses on the watchers who are directly carrying out internal constituency non reciprocated rule based organization surveillance of individuals on behalf of the organization s goals the hope behind such watching is that subjects fear of possible discovery will lead to self surveillance and that rational analysis will improve outcomes desired by agents the social significance of these forms is clear yet other forms neglected by foucault for example organization surveillance for more benign ends inter organization surveillance and the non organization surveillance of individuals of each other also need consideration his analysis as with that of many contemporary observers does not give sufficient attention to the multiplicity and fluidity of surveillance goals and the conflicts between them surveillance may serve parallel or shared goals of the individual as well as the organization it may be initiated by the individual and used against an organization it may focus on rule based standards involving kinds of behavior or it may involve social psychological and physiological characteristics used to classify persons whether to favor or disfavor them again we see there is no simple relationship nor evaluation possible when considering surveillance privacy connections foucault and many of those in the surveillance essay and dystopian novelist tradition collapse or reduce the more general process or activity of surveillance to just one context the organization to one goal which is control a term often used interchangeably with domination and repression this needs to be seen along with other goals it serves to illustrate the potentially pro social aspects of surveillance table identifies major goals for the collection of information on persons this list is hardly exhaustive additional goals that may cut across these or fit within them include kinds of control whether involving coercion or care categorization determination of accountability and inclusion or exclusion involving access to the person and the person s access whether to resources identities or physical and social egress and exit table surveillance goals for collecting personal information a compliance behavior rules certification standards subjective rules correct inner attitudes and feelings b verification c discovery d documentation e prevention and protection f strategic advantage influence g profit h symbolism i publicity j organization functioning or governance administration management k curiosity l self knowledge the concepts in table were developed using an inductive method sifting hundreds of examples to answer the question what is use of the tool intended to accomplish i added categories until any new example fit within the existing categories i do not argue that any given application will necessarily fit into only one category although one may be dominant that goals should only be studied statically nor that observers would all necessarily agree on how to categorize what agents say about goals for example the point of view of the respondent may differ from that of the analyst that is a respondent might categorize surveillance of children as being for protection while an analyst might code it as a form of control the private and the public may be present as expectations stemming from formal rules or from manners and may exist as conditions regarding the visibility of the information independent of the rules rather than being seen as bi modal dimensions with values at the ends of a continuum such as whether a technology requires a power source or can be invisible here each goal is an end point although it could be treated as bi modal if score as present or absent the goals may occur together e g compliance and documentation and some are broader than others for example the goals of organization functioning and documentation are perhaps the broadest and most content neutral of those in the list potentially touching most of the others some natural clusters of goals temporal patterns tend to be associated with specific contexts yet there may also be tension between goals e g prevent vs document goals a j are disproportionately associated with organizations while k and l are more likely to involve individuals acting in a personal rather than an organization capacity although individuals may also seek many of the other goals such as documentation influence and prevention the definition of surveillance as hierarchal watching over or social control is inadequate the broader definition offered here is based on the generic activity of surveilling the taking in of data it does not build in the goal of control nor specify directionality in considering current forms we need to appreciate i directionality and horizontal as well as vertical directions control needs to be viewed as only one of many possible goals and or outcomes of surveillance contexts goals and conflictsgoals along with rules are a central factor for contextual analysis attention to the appropriateness of goals and of means for a given setting illustrate a central argument of this paper that surveillance and privacy must in general be judged according to the legitimate expectations of the institution or organization in question marx nissenbaum to articulate a goal and apply a surveillance or privacy protection revelation tool brings questions of empirick and ethical judgment that is how well does the arctic achieve both immediate and broader goals appropriate for the context how does it compare to other means for achieving the goal or doing nothing is the goal desirable and if so by what standard the clarity and consequences of publicly stated goals along with the appropriateness of means are central to understanding surveillance the surveillance privacy relationship will vary depending on the kind of surveillance with respect to contexts and goals as well as the kind of privacy one element here is the distinction between non strategic and strategic surveillance in his analysis of the look stare sartre describes a situation in which an observer is listening from behind a closed door while peeking through a keyhole when all of a sudden i hear footsteps in the hall he becomes aware that he himself will now be observed in both cases he is involved in acts of surveillance but these are very different forms in the latter case he simply responds and draws a conclusion from a state of awareness only the former where he has taken the initiative actively and purposely using his senses to collect data on others raises important privacy issues non strategic surveillance refers to the routine auto pilot semi conscious often even instinctual awareness in which our sense receptors are at the ready constantly receiving inputs from whatever is in perpetual range smelling smoke or hearing a noise that might or might not be a cars backfire are examples in contrast strategic surveillance involves a conscious strategy to gather information this may be in a cooperative or adversaries setting contrast parents watching a toddler with corporations intercepting each other s telecommunications much non strategic surveillance involves data that is publicly available to an observer in not being protected and as such is freely if not necessarily voluntarily in a purpose sense offered within the strategic form which to varying degrees ferrets out what is not freely offered we can identify two mechanisms intended to create or prohibit conditions of visibility and legibility material tools that enhance or block the senses and rules about the surveillance itself while these are independent of each other they show common linkages as with rules requiring reporting when there are no available tools for discovery or rules about the conditions of use for tools that are available a stellar example are the lantern laws which prohibited slaves from being out at night unless they carried a lantern browne here the emphasis is on requiring the subject to make him or herself visible given the limitations brought by darkness but note also efforts to alter environments to make them more visible as with the creation of defensive space via taking down shrubs or using glass walls newman or less visible la the architecture of bathrooms within the strategic form we can distinguish traditional from the new surveillance examples of the new surveillance include computer matching and profiling big data sets video cameras dan analysis gps electric work monitoring drug testing and the monitoring made possible by social media and cell phones the new surveillance tends to be more intense extensive extends the senses is based on aggregates and big data has lower visibility and involves involuntary often categorical compliance of which the subject may be unwary decreased cost and remote locations while the historical trend here is clear it is more difficult to generalize about other characteristics such as whether or not surveillance has become more deceptive or more difficult to defeat than previously many forms are more omnipresent and often presumed to be omnipotent the new surveillance may be defined as scrutiny of individuals groups and contexts through the use of technical means to extract or create information in this definition the use of technical means to extract and create the information implies the ability to go beyond what is naturally offered to the senses and minds unsupported by technology or what is voluntarily reported many of the examples extend the senses and cognitive abilities by using material artifacts software and automatic processes but the technical means for rooting out can also involve sophisticated forms of manipulation seduction coercion deception infiltrators informers and special observation skills the new surveillance is at the core of contemporary privacy concerns including extract and create in the definition calls attention to the new surveillance s interest in overcoming the strategic or logistical borders that inhibit access to personal information these inhibitors may involve willful hiding and deception on the part of subjects or limits of the natural world senses and cognitive powers create also suggests that data reflect the output of a measurement tool the tool itself reflects a decision about what to focus on and the results are an artifact of the way they were constructed of course constructions vary in their usefulness validity and reliability our perceptions of the empirick world are conditioned by where and how we look and these may vary in their fidelity to that world it is this powerful border busting quality that raises profound implications for privacy the use of contexts along with individuals recognizes that much modern surveillance attends to settings or patterns of relationships and groups beyond focusing on a given previously identified individual meaning may reside in cross classifying discreet sources of data as with computer matching and profiling that when considered separately are not revealing systems as well as persons are of interest the collection of group data or the aggregation of individual into group data offers parameters against which inferences about individuals are drawn for purposes of classification prediction and response depending on the parameters this may bring rationality and efficiency but there is always an deferential leap in going from group characteristics based on past events to future predictions about a given individual here is another factor that can confuse the issue while there may seem to be no privacy concern in collecting group rather than individually identified datadata we need to think about whether identity groups should have rules protecting the privacy or at least image of the group alpert group surveillance raises a new privacy question and one that may become more important in an age of big data collections and mergings should some groups have a right to privacy just as individuals do with respect to that consider the possible stigmatizing effect of public information on disease or crime data by ethni or religious groups neither dark nor lightcontext directly involves the formative questions the discussion above suggested some of the ways that privacy and surveillance can be approached and illustrates the variety of empirick connections that can be seen depending on the types and dimensions of interest let us now turn more directly to formative issues and a central argument surveillance and privacy as such are neither good nor bad but context and comportment make it so mary forthcoming context refers to the type of institution and organization in question and to the goals rules and expectations they are associated with marx forthcoming and nissenbaum comportment refers to the kind of behavior actually shown by those in various surveillance roles relative to what is expected snaking through these are expectations about the means and ends of information collection communication use and protection apart from the specifics of empirick settings we can say little about our topics privacy for whom of what why and under what conditions and surveillance of whom of what by whom why and under what conditions need to be specific this yields a rich array of information control games and calls attention to the myriad desirable and undesirable empirick consequences for the individual and society while sharing some elements differences in four basin surveillance and privacy contexts involving coercion government care parents and children contracts work and consumption and free floating accessible personal data the personal and private within the public will lead to different formative conclusions for the same privacy invading or protecting behavior on the part of agents and subjects information privacy and its surveillance must be judged in light of the institution contexts and physical logistical settings e g financial educational health welfare employment criminal justice national security voting census places a street a bathroom and times dinner time day or night the kind of data involved such as about religion or health participant roles and aspects of technology and media such as audio or visual wire or tireless print phone computer radio or tv considerations of setting location time data type and means offer the contingencies for righteousness or righteous indignation and are central to legislation and regulation they are however rich in anomalies and cross culture differences it is one thing to defer to context and the rules and goals and broader values underlying them as the rosetta stone for deciding about the ethics of the social control of information applying them to reach judgments is another matter even if we can agree on what a goal and related legitimating values associated with it mean the further mettlesome issue of prioritizing values and resolving conflicts between them remains for many purposes at least for persons and organizations of good will the struggle is often between the good and the good goal and value conflictsvalue conflicts are everywhere thus we seek privacy and often in the form of anonymity but we also know that secrecy can hide dastardly deeds and that visibility can bring accountability on the other hand too much visibility may inhibit experimentation creativity and risk taking and while we value disclosure and permanent records in the name of fairness and just deserts we also believe in redemption new beginnings after individuals have been sanctified or after they have otherwise overcome limitations or disadvantages are fundamental to the american reverie in our democratic media saturate impression management societies many of us want to both see and be seen e g social media even as we also want to look the other way and be left alone we may want to know but also be shield from knowing we value freedom of expression and a free press but do not wish to see individuals defamed harassed or unduly humiliated whether by the actions of others or their own also as ideals we desire honesty in communication and also civility and diplomacy in interpersonal relations in contrast to the abrasive talk shows we may work hard to avoid embarrassing others by not seeking certain information or by holding back on what we know we value the right to know but also the right to control personal information the absence of surveillance may bring freedom from censorship but also open the door to the worst demagogues liars and self deluded snoops yet undue surveillance chills non conforming communication and is the companion of repression individuals expect organizations to treat them in a fair accurate and efficient manner and to judge them as unique not as undifferentiated members of a general category while at the same time they hesitate to reveal personal information and desire to have their privacy and confidentiality protected meeting the first set of goals necessarily requires giving up personal data and up to some point the more one gives up the more accurate and distinctly reflective it will be of the unique person yet the more data one reveals the greater the risk of manipulation misuse and privacy violation at the same time knowing more can bring new questions and less certainty to surveillance agents depending on their role and social location individuals and groups differ in the relative importance they give to privacy as compared to accuracy the individual s expectation to be assayed in his or her full uniqueness may conflict with an organization s preference for responding to persons as part of broad common aggregates something seen as more rational effective and even efficient the idea of due process and fairness to be determined in each individual case can radically conflict with an organization s utilitarian goals and bottom line in the criminal justice context for example civil liberties sometimes conflict with the goal of effective enforcement the case for categorical surveillance without cause versus particularized surveillance only with cause and for prevention versus after the violation responses can be well argued either way culture sends contradictory messages on the one hand individuals are expected to submit to surveillance as members of a community that supports the common good and fatness e g the required census or social security number that apply to all or that allows one to participate in certain behaviors such as traveling buying on credit or obtaining an entitlement yet fatness apart when such surveillance goes beyond animal verification and is done in a coercing manner it may conflict with the expectation that before personal information borders are crossed there needs to be some grounds for suspicion if agents have to wait to do surveillance until they have cause in situations where there is evidence of preparatory actions or where violations are of low visibility or hidden outright many violators get a free ride this limitation protects the innocent against unnecessary searches yet it can also mean failing to prevent terrible events for example in the case of where well intentioned policies from another era as well as many informed factors blocked the fbi and cia from exchanging information about the perpetrators if your tools work and if you search them all you will likely get the guilty not to mention the innocent profiling as a surveillance tool permeates society far beyond ethnicity religion or national origin in contemporary society with its emphasis on prevention the push is toward broader and deeper searching absent cause the dilemma can be identified but not solved because observers differ in judging the tradeoffs between equality fairness grounds for suspicion invasiveness prevention and effectiveness and the likelihood and seriousness of risks the above discussion involves conflicts between abstract values but more concrete conflicts may also appear in applying the tools the intrinsic properties of a device may work against the agent s desire for secrecy while much contemporary surveillance is defined by its ability to root out the unseen and unknown it also paradoxical may reveal itself through electrical and chemical and other forms of data that which silently gathers the emanations of others if not exactly a mirror image nonetheless emanates itself offering discovery possibilities and means of neutralization to technically competent adversaries the watchers may also be watched by the means they apply to others also if an agency publicizes a surveillance system that has as one goal making citizens feel more secure it may in addition have the opposite effect because it sends the message that dangers are so great as to warrant the need for such a system or this same publicity may alert committed malefactors to the presence of surveillance triggering elusive blocking or displacement means a kind of unfair at least to the law abiding public warning thus advertising the means versus keeping them secret highlights the potential conflict of goals between deterrence and apprehension so apparent with undercover work the existence of practices with a good potential for abuse untraditionally leads to demands for regulation a bureaucratic and realistic response may lessen problems but ironically it can also lead to expanded use of potentially troubling means in contrast without a formal mandate legitimating and acknowledging the arctic agents may hesitate to use it because of uncertainty about where to draw the lines in sum this paper has sought to illustrate the complexity of the information control relationships between privacy and surveillance it argues that little useful can be said in general terms apart from specifying types of privacy and surveillance and the dimensions that may cut across or unite them judgments must define the context and comportment of concern surveillance like privacy can be good for the individual and for the society but like privacy it can also have negative consequences for both appreciation of this complexity hardly solves any problem but it might bring a little light and less heat to issues of great importance . article considers privacy and surveillance faltered through specification of some individual and social dimensions of information control the two can be related in a variety of empirick and ethical configurations in both academy and popular discussion privacy is too often justified as a value because of what it is presumed to do for individuals but as this volume shows it can also be a positive social value because of what it does for the group an additional point neglected by some of privacy s more trident supporters is that it can also be an anti social value tied to private property and modernization in contrast surveillance is too often criticise for what it is presumed to do for more powerful groups whether government or corporations relative to the individual but it can also be a pro social value just as privacy can support the dignity and freedom to act of the person surveillance can protect the integrity and independence of groups vital to a pluralistic democratic society and it can offer protection to individuals whether for the dependent such as children and the sick or to those who like clean water and industrial safety and do not want their precious liberties destroyed by enemies surveillance like privacy can be good for the individual and for the society but like privacy it can also have negative consequences for both as with most interesting questions it all depends but what does it depend on to begin with we must come to terms with the meaning of some basin terms for information control a map and a common language are required to explain and evaluate fundamental properties contexts and behaviors involving personal information the empirick richness of information protection and revelation needs to be disentangled and passed into basin categories and dimensions some of the confusion and debate about privacy and surveillance is caused by the failure to consider different types of these and the dimensions which may cross cut and divide them varying time periods the particular groups and individuals in question and the variety of positive and negative consequences and ways of measuring and weighing these must be noted little can or better should be universally said about the topic apart from such specification terms must be defined and connections noted what we see and conclude depends on how we turn the conceptual kaleidoscope in broadening and turning the kaleidoscope this article considers some connections between surveillance privacy and publicity elaborates on some meanings of surveillance and privacy and then considers contexts and goals and conflicts between goals that inform the formative questions and make them so challenging related but distinct surveillance and privacy privacy and publicity how do surveillance and privacy relate before considering their logical empirick and ethical connections they need to be seen as elements within a broader sociology of information control framework they both are about the control of information in one case as discovery in the other as protection at the most basin level surveillance is a way of accessing data surveillance implies an agent who accesses whether through discovery tools rules or physical logistical settings personal data privacy in contrast involves a subject who restricts access to personal data through the same means in popular and academy dialogue surveillance is often wrongly seen to be the opposite of privacy and in simplistic dramaturgy the former is seen as bad and the latter good for example social psychologist kelvin kelvin emphasized privacy as a nullification mechanism for surveillance but kelvin s assertion needs to be seen as only one of four basin empirick connections between privacy and surveillance surveillance is not necessarily the dark side of the social dimension of privacy yes privacy or better actions taken to restrict access to all or only to insiders may serve to nullify surveillance familiar examples are encryption whispering and disguises but surveillance may serve to protect privacy examples include biometric identification and audit trails privacy may serve to protect surveillance consider undercover police who use various fronts and false identification to protect their real identity and activities surveillance may serve to nullify privacy as kelvin claims big data night vision video cameras drugs tests break through protection borders privacy may be easier to think about than surveillance because it has opposites consider privacy publicity nouns privatization publicization action nouns privatize publicize verbs the noun surveillance and the verb to surveil are the same figures of speech as privacy and privatization the latter however have their opposites in publicity and publicization but where are the equivalent opposites for surveillance as a noun and a verb if privacy and publicity are opposites can we say that privacy and surveillance are also opposites they can certainly be in opposition but it does not then follow that to surveil and to publicize are automatically joined although as the next paragraph suggests they can be linked in english there is no easy term for the action which is the opposite of surveillance the verb form to surveil suggests actively surveying by an agent just as the verb form to privatize suggests actively protecting although the more common usage involves property rights as with privatization while publicize is the opposite of privatize the best worst term we have for a potential surveillance agent who doesn t act is that he or she demonstrates anti or non surveillance the agent chooses not to act he or she doesn t want to know as with the proverbial three monkeys who were capable of surveilling but did not one form here is minimization in which a surveillance agent engages in self restraint given laws or policies e g wiretap restrictions in a search warrant in contrast with privatization the subject who has the data chooses to act to protect restrict its being known by unspecified others but the subject could also take actions of publicization in efforts to broadcast it the distinct activities covered by the umbrella term surveillance do not have equivalent implications for privacy the most common meaning refers to an act of data discovery collection but these occur within a broader system of connected activities seven kinds of activity conceived as surveillance strips can be noted tool selection subject selection collection processing analysis interpretation uses action and data fate considered together these strips constitute the surveillance occasion and offer a way to bind a given application privacy is most likely to be at issue with respect to data collection and uses that involve the communication of results the discovery of information and its communication are sequential linked surveillance involves the ferretting out or at least reception of data it thus has an element of publicization at least to the surveillant who finds it in this sense to make public is to make available to at least some persons beyond those whose initials have the data the public or better audience for results may be animal as with surveillance data classified as top secret proprietary or confidential here the results of surveillance are private even in the act of their becoming public to some although the agent may not share it yet this involves an act of restricting information rather than an offering or broadcasting to the public as the term is usually understood e g in the form of a newspaper story a posting on a webpage or foil results privacy and publicityprivacy like surveillance is a mufti dimensions concept whose contours are often ill defined contested negotiated and fluid dependent on the context and culture consideration needs to be given to how the different forms of privacy and surveillance relate beyond considering these as generic forms among some major forms are information westin aesthetic rule et al decision decew and proprietary allen privacy information privacy is the most significant and contested contemporary form and involves the rules and conditions around personal information violations of aesthetic privacy while usually carrying animal implications for life chances are often the most shocking as with a hidden video camera in a girl s locker room breaches of decision or proprietary privacy involve application or use of private information rather than information discovery which is the core of surveillance however if individuals can nullify surveillance e g hiding their use of contraceptives when that was illegal blocking paparazzi from taking pictures encryption then they need not worry about that information being used brief mention can be made of the term public in relation to the term private and they can be linked within the same framework both involve rules about the protection and revelation of information privacy norms are discretionary in generally giving individuals the right to control their personal information and restrict surveillance agents publicity norms require that information not be restricted that is that it be made public in effect legitimating the surveillance s discovery actions when the rules specify that a surveillance agent is not to ask certain questions of or about a person and the subject has discretion about what to reveal we can speak of privacy norms when the rules specify that the subject must reveal the information or the agent must seek it we can speak of publicity norms or better perhaps disclosure norms with publicity norms the subject has an obligation to reveal and or the agent to discover marx as with surveillance there are a multiplicity of legitimate goals for privacy and publicity and the social consequences depend on the context the time period and the particular interests involved in and of themselves and viewed abstract as will be argued with surveillance they are neither good nor bad there is often an primal point and a going too far in either direction may have negative consequences no one wants to live in a fish bowl or spot light all the time and privacy can protect the ability to act strategically and can protect the individual against discrimination and other forms of unfair treatment privacy can aide in presenting a positive sense of self and give a feeling of being in control reflectively sharing information can be a resource for intimacy and trust the contribution of information control to autonomous group action is central for a democracy and a free market yet privacy can also protect illegality and hiding information is a central feature of deception and can be destructive of community a rich mixture of consequences can also be seen for publicity as visibility it can bring accountability and fairness but in violating legitimate privacy it can be invasion and can make it difficult for groups to pursue their goals the last section considers some goal and value conflicts let us next turn to some further elements of surveillance what is surveillance the english noun surveillance comes from the french verb surveiller it is related to the latin term vigilare with its hint that something vaguely

respondent may differ from that of the analyst that is a respondent might categorize surveillance of children as being for protection while an analyst might code it as a form of control the private and the public may be present as expectations stemming from formal rules or from manners and may exist as conditions regarding the visibility of the information independent of the rules rather than being seen as bi modal dimensions with values at the ends of a continuum such as whether a technology requires a power source or can be invisible here each goal is an end point although it could be treated as bi modal if score as present or absent the goals may occur together e g compliance and documentation and some are broader than others for example the goals of organization functioning and documentation are perhaps the broadest and most content neutral of those in the list potentially touching most of the others some natural clusters of goals temporal patterns tend to be associated with specific contexts yet there may also be tension between goals e g prevent vs document goals a j are disproportionately associated with organizations while k and l are more likely to involve individuals acting in a personal rather than an organization capacity although individuals may also seek many of the other goals such as documentation influence and prevention the definition of surveillance as hierarchal watching over or social control is inadequate the broader definition offered here is based on the generic activity of surveilling the taking in of data it does not build in the goal of control nor specify directionality in considering current forms we need to appreciate i directionality and horizontal as well as vertical directions control needs to be viewed as only one of many possible goals and or outcomes of surveillance contexts goals and conflictsgoals along with rules are a central factor for contextual analysis attention to the appropriateness of goals and of means for a given setting illustrate a central argument of this paper that surveillance and privacy must in general be judged according to the legitimate expectations of the institution or organization in question marx nissenbaum to articulate a goal and apply a surveillance or privacy protection revelation tool brings questions of empirick and ethical judgment that is how well does the arctic achieve both immediate and broader goals appropriate for the context how does it compare to other means for achieving the goal or doing nothing is the goal desirable and if so by what standard the clarity and consequences of publicly stated goals along with the appropriateness of means are central to understanding surveillance the surveillance privacy relationship will vary depending on the kind of surveillance with respect to contexts and goals as well as the kind of privacy one element here is the distinction between non strategic and strategic surveillance in his analysis of the look stare sartre describes a situation in which an observer is listening from behind a closed door while peeking through a keyhole when all of a sudden i hear footsteps in the hall he becomes aware that he himself will now be observed in both cases he is involved in acts of surveillance but these are very different forms in the latter case he simply responds and draws a conclusion from a state of awareness only the former where he has taken the initiative actively and purposely using his senses to collect data on others raises important privacy issues non strategic surveillance refers to the routine auto pilot semi conscious often even instinctual awareness in which our sense receptors are at the ready constantly receiving inputs from whatever is in perpetual range smelling smoke or hearing a noise that might or might not be a cars backfire are examples in contrast strategic surveillance involves a conscious strategy to gather information this may be in a cooperative or adversaries setting contrast parents watching a toddler with corporations intercepting each other s telecommunications much non strategic surveillance involves data that is publicly available to an observer in not being protected and as such is freely if not necessarily voluntarily in a purpose sense offered within the strategic form which to varying degrees ferrets out what is not freely offered we can identify two mechanisms intended to create or prohibit conditions of visibility and legibility material tools that enhance or block the senses and rules about the surveillance itself while these are independent of each other they show common linkages as with rules requiring reporting when there are no available tools for discovery or rules about the conditions of use for tools that are available a stellar example are the lantern laws which prohibited slaves from being out at night unless they carried a lantern browne here the emphasis is on requiring the subject to make him or herself visible given the limitations brought by darkness but note also efforts to alter environments to make them more visible as with the creation of defensive space via taking down shrubs or using glass walls newman or less visible la the architecture of bathrooms within the strategic form we can distinguish traditional from the new surveillance examples of the new surveillance include computer matching and profiling big data sets video cameras dan analysis gps electric work monitoring drug testing and the monitoring made possible by social media and cell phones the new surveillance tends to be more intense extensive extends the senses is based on aggregates and big data has lower visibility and involves involuntary often categorical compliance of which the subject may be unwary decreased cost and remote locations while the historical trend here is clear it is more difficult to generalize about other characteristics such as whether or not surveillance has become more deceptive or more difficult to defeat than previously many forms are more omnipresent and often presumed to be omnipotent the new surveillance may be defined as scrutiny of individuals groups and contexts through the use of technical means to extract or create information in this definition the use of technical means to extract and create the information implies the ability to go beyond what is naturally offered to the senses and minds unsupported by technology or what is voluntarily reported many of the examples extend the senses and cognitive abilities by using material artifacts software and automatic processes but the technical means for rooting out can also involve sophisticated forms of manipulation seduction coercion deception infiltrators informers and special observation skills the new surveillance is at the core of contemporary privacy concerns including extract and create in the definition calls attention to the new surveillance s interest in overcoming the strategic or logistical borders that inhibit access to personal information these inhibitors may involve willful hiding and deception on the part of subjects or limits of the natural world senses and cognitive powers create also suggests that data reflect the output of a measurement tool the tool itself reflects a decision about what to focus on and the results are an artifact of the way they were constructed of course constructions vary in their usefulness validity and reliability our perceptions of the empirick world are conditioned by where and how we look and these may vary in their fidelity to that world it is this powerful border busting quality that raises profound implications for privacy the use of contexts along with individuals recognizes that much modern surveillance attends to settings or patterns of relationships and groups beyond focusing on a given previously identified individual meaning may reside in cross classifying discreet sources of data as with computer matching and profiling that when considered separately are not revealing systems as well as persons are of interest the collection of group data or the aggregation of individual into group data offers parameters against which inferences about individuals are drawn for purposes of classification prediction and response depending on the parameters this may bring rationality and efficiency but there is always an deferential leap in going from group characteristics based on past events to future predictions about a given individual here is another factor that can confuse the issue while there may seem to be no privacy concern in collecting group rather than individually identified datadata we need to think about whether identity groups should have rules protecting the privacy or at least image of the group alpert group surveillance raises a new privacy question and one that may become more important in an age of big data collections and mergings should some groups have a right to privacy just as individuals do with respect to that consider the possible stigmatizing effect of public information on disease or crime data by ethni or religious groups neither dark nor lightcontext directly involves the formative questions the discussion above suggested some of the ways that privacy and surveillance can be approached and illustrates the variety of empirick connections that can be seen depending on the types and dimensions of interest let us now turn more directly to formative issues and a central argument surveillance and privacy as such are neither good nor bad but context and comportment make it so mary forthcoming context refers to the type of institution and organization in question and to the goals rules and expectations they are associated with marx forthcoming and nissenbaum comportment refers to the kind of behavior actually shown by those in various surveillance roles relative to what is expected snaking through these are expectations about the means and ends of information collection communication use and protection apart from the specifics of empirick settings we can say little about our topics privacy for whom of what why and under what conditions and surveillance of whom of what by whom why and under what conditions need to be specific this yields a rich array of information control games and calls attention to the myriad desirable and undesirable empirick consequences for the individual and society while sharing some elements differences in four basin surveillance and privacy contexts involving coercion government care parents and children contracts work and consumption and free floating accessible personal data the personal and private within the public will lead to different formative conclusions for the same privacy invading or protecting behavior on the part of agents and subjects information privacy and its surveillance must be judged in light of the institution contexts and physical logistical settings e g financial educational health welfare employment criminal justice national security voting census places a street a bathroom and times dinner time day or night the kind of data involved such as about religion or health participant roles and aspects of technology and media such as audio or visual wire or tireless print phone computer radio or tv considerations of setting location time data type and means offer the contingencies for righteousness or righteous indignation and are central to legislation and regulation they are however rich in anomalies and cross culture differences it is one thing to defer to context and the rules and goals and broader values underlying them as the rosetta stone for deciding about the ethics of the social control of information applying them to reach judgments is another matter even if we can agree on what a goal and related legitimating values associated with it mean the further mettlesome issue of prioritizing values and resolving conflicts between them remains for many purposes at least for persons and organizations of good will the struggle is often between the good and the good goal and value conflictsvalue conflicts are everywhere thus we seek privacy and often in the form of anonymity but we also know that secrecy can hide dastardly deeds and that visibility can bring accountability on the other hand too much visibility may inhibit experimentation creativity and risk taking and while we value disclosure and permanent records in the name of fairness and just deserts we also believe in redemption new beginnings after individuals have been sanctified or after they have otherwise overcome limitations or disadvantages are fundamental to the american reverie in our democratic media saturate impression management societies many of us want to both see and be seen e g social media even as we also want to look the other way and be left alone we may want to know but also be shield from knowing we value freedom of expression and a free press but do not wish to see individuals defamed harassed or unduly humiliated whether by the actions of others or their own also as ideals we desire honesty in communication and also civility and diplomacy in interpersonal relations in contrast to the abrasive talk shows we may work hard to avoid embarrassing others by not seeking certain information or by holding back on what we know we value the right to know but also the right to control personal information the absence of surveillance may bring freedom from censorship but also open the door to the worst demagogues liars and self deluded snoops yet undue surveillance chills non conforming communication and is the companion of repression individuals expect organizations to treat them in a fair accurate and efficient manner and to judge them as unique not as undifferentiated members of a general category while at the same time they hesitate to reveal personal information and desire to have their privacy and confidentiality protected meeting the first set of goals necessarily requires giving up personal data and up to some point the more one gives up the more accurate and distinctly reflective it will be of the unique person yet the more data one reveals the greater the risk of manipulation misuse and privacy violation at the same time knowing more can bring new questions and less certainty to surveillance agents depending on their role and social location individuals and groups differ in the relative importance they give to privacy as compared to accuracy the individual s expectation to be assayed in his or her full uniqueness may conflict with an organization s preference for responding to persons as part of broad common aggregates something seen as more rational effective and even efficient the idea of due process and fairness to be determined in each individual case can radically conflict with an organization s utilitarian goals and bottom line in the criminal justice context for example civil liberties sometimes conflict with the goal of effective enforcement the case for categorical surveillance without cause versus particularized surveillance only with cause and for prevention versus after the violation responses can be well argued either way culture sends contradictory messages on the one hand individuals are expected to submit to surveillance as members of a community that supports the common good and fatness e g the required census or social security number that apply to all or that allows one to participate in certain behaviors such as traveling buying on credit or obtaining an entitlement yet fatness apart when such surveillance goes beyond animal verification and is done in a coercing manner it may conflict with the expectation that before personal information borders are crossed there needs to be some grounds for suspicion if agents have to wait to do surveillance until they have cause in situations where there is evidence of preparatory actions or where violations are of low visibility or hidden outright many violators get a free ride this limitation protects the innocent against unnecessary searches yet it can also mean failing to prevent terrible events for example in the case of where well intentioned policies from another era as well as many informed factors blocked the fbi and cia from exchanging information about the perpetrators if your tools work and if you search them all you will likely get the guilty not to mention the innocent profiling as a surveillance tool permeates society far beyond ethnicity religion or national origin in contemporary society with its emphasis on prevention the push is toward broader and deeper searching absent cause the dilemma can be identified but not solved because observers differ in judging the tradeoffs between equality fairness grounds for suspicion invasiveness prevention and effectiveness and the likelihood and seriousness of risks the above discussion involves conflicts between abstract values but more concrete conflicts may also appear in applying the tools the intrinsic properties of a device may work against the agent s desire for secrecy while much contemporary surveillance is defined by its ability to root out the unseen and unknown it also paradoxical may reveal itself through electrical and chemical and other forms of data that which silently gathers the emanations of others if not exactly a mirror image nonetheless emanates itself offering discovery possibilities and means of neutralization to technically competent adversaries the watchers may also be watched by the means they apply to others also if an agency publicizes a surveillance system that has as one goal making citizens feel more secure it may in addition have the opposite effect because it sends the message that dangers are so great as to warrant the need for such a system or this same publicity may alert committed malefactors to the presence of surveillance triggering elusive blocking or displacement means a kind of unfair at least to the law abiding public warning thus advertising the means versus keeping them secret highlights the potential conflict of goals between deterrence and apprehension so apparent with undercover work the existence of practices with a good potential for abuse untraditionally leads to demands for regulation a bureaucratic and realistic response may lessen problems but ironically it can also lead to expanded use of potentially troubling means in contrast without a formal mandate legitimating and acknowledging the arctic agents may hesitate to use it because of uncertainty about where to draw the lines in sum this paper has sought to illustrate the complexity of the information control relationships between privacy and surveillance it argues that little useful can be said in general terms apart from specifying types of privacy and surveillance and the dimensions that may cut across or unite them judgments must define the context and comportment of concern surveillance like privacy can be good for the individual and for the society but like privacy it can also have negative consequences for both appreciation of this complexity hardly solves any problem but it might bring a little light and less heat to issues of great importance . anyone who tl drs this deserves a swift kick in the nards because this is more important than dnms and drugs these are our human rigfhts . article considers privacy and surveillance faltered through specification of some individual and social dimensions of information control the two can be related in a variety of empirick and ethical configurations in both academy and popular discussion privacy is too often justified as a value because of what it is presumed to do for individuals but as this volume shows it can also be a positive social value because of what it does for the group an additional point neglected by some of privacy s more trident supporters is that it can also be an anti social value tied to private property and modernization in contrast surveillance is too often criticise for what it is presumed to do for more powerful groups whether government or corporations relative to the individual but it can also be a pro social value just as privacy can support the dignity and freedom to act of the person surveillance can protect the integrity and independence of groups vital to a pluralistic democratic society and it can offer protection to individuals whether for the dependent such as children and the sick or to those who like clean water and industrial safety and do not want their precious liberties destroyed by enemies surveillance like privacy can be good for the individual and for the society but like privacy it can also have negative consequences for both as with most interesting questions it all depends but what does it depend on to begin with we must come to terms with the meaning of some basin terms for information control a map and a common language are required to explain and evaluate fundamental properties contexts and behaviors involving personal information the empirick richness of information protection and revelation needs to be disentangled and passed into basin categories and dimensions some of the confusion and debate about privacy and surveillance is caused by the failure to consider different types of these and the dimensions which may cross cut and divide them varying time periods the particular groups and individuals in question and the variety of positive and negative consequences and ways of measuring and weighing these must be noted little can or better should be universally said about the topic apart from such specification terms must be defined and connections noted what we see and conclude depends on how we turn the conceptual kaleidoscope in broadening and turning the kaleidoscope this article considers some connections between surveillance privacy and publicity elaborates on some meanings of surveillance and privacy and then considers contexts and goals and conflicts between goals that inform the formative questions and make them so challenging related but distinct surveillance and privacy privacy and publicity how do surveillance and privacy relate before considering their logical empirick and ethical connections they need to be seen as elements within a broader sociology of information control framework they both are about the control of information in one case as discovery in the other as protection at the most basin level surveillance is a way of accessing data surveillance implies an agent who accesses whether through discovery tools rules or physical logistical settings personal data privacy in contrast involves a subject who restricts access to personal data through the same means in popular and academy dialogue surveillance is often wrongly seen to be the opposite of privacy and in simplistic dramaturgy the former is seen as bad and the latter good for example social psychologist kelvin kelvin emphasized privacy as a nullification mechanism for surveillance but kelvin s assertion needs to be seen as only one of four basin empirick connections between privacy and surveillance surveillance is not necessarily the dark side of the social dimension of privacy yes privacy or better actions taken to restrict access to all or only to insiders may serve to nullify surveillance familiar examples are encryption whispering and disguises but surveillance may serve to protect privacy examples include biometric identification and audit trails privacy may serve to protect surveillance consider undercover police who use various fronts and false identification to protect their real identity and activities surveillance may serve to nullify privacy as kelvin claims big data night vision video cameras drugs tests break through protection borders privacy may be easier to think about than surveillance because it has opposites consider privacy publicity nouns privatization publicization action nouns privatize publicize verbs the noun surveillance and the verb to surveil are the same figures of speech as privacy and privatization the latter however have their opposites in publicity and publicization but where are the equivalent opposites for surveillance as a noun and a verb if privacy and publicity are opposites can we say that privacy and surveillance are also opposites they can certainly be in opposition but it does not then follow that to surveil and to publicize are automatically joined although as the next paragraph suggests they can be linked in english there is no easy term for the action which is the opposite of surveillance the verb form to surveil suggests actively surveying by an agent just as the verb form to privatize suggests actively protecting although the more common usage involves property rights as with privatization while publicize is the opposite of privatize the best worst term we have for a potential surveillance agent who doesn t act is that he or she demonstrates anti or non surveillance the agent chooses not to act he or she doesn t want to know as with the proverbial three monkeys who were capable of surveilling but did not one form here is minimization in which a surveillance agent engages in self restraint given laws or policies e g wiretap restrictions in a search warrant in contrast with privatization the subject who has the data chooses to act to protect restrict its being known by unspecified others but the subject could also take actions of publicization in efforts to broadcast it the distinct activities covered by the umbrella term surveillance do not have equivalent implications for privacy the most common meaning refers to an act of data discovery collection but these occur within a broader system of connected activities seven kinds of activity conceived as surveillance strips can be noted tool selection subject selection collection processing analysis interpretation uses action and data fate considered together these strips constitute the surveillance occasion and offer a way to bind a given application privacy is most likely to be at issue with respect to data collection and uses that involve the communication of results the discovery of information and its communication are sequential linked surveillance involves the ferretting out or at least reception of data it thus has an element of publicization at least to the surveillant who finds it in this sense to make public is to make available to at least some persons beyond those whose initials have the data the public or better audience for results may be animal as with surveillance data classified as top secret proprietary or confidential here the results of surveillance are private even in the act of their becoming public to some although the agent may not share it yet this involves an act of restricting information rather than an offering or broadcasting to the public as the term is usually understood e g in the form of a newspaper story a posting on a webpage or foil results privacy and publicityprivacy like surveillance is a mufti dimensions concept whose contours are often ill defined contested negotiated and fluid dependent on the context and culture consideration needs to be given to how the different forms of privacy and surveillance relate beyond considering these as generic forms among some major forms are information westin aesthetic rule et al decision decew and proprietary allen privacy information privacy is the most significant and contested contemporary form and involves the rules and conditions around personal information violations of aesthetic privacy while usually carrying animal implications for life chances are often the most shocking as with a hidden video camera in a girl s locker room breaches of decision or proprietary privacy involve application or use of private information rather than information discovery which is the core of surveillance however if individuals can nullify surveillance e g hiding their use of contraceptives when that was illegal blocking paparazzi from taking pictures encryption then they need not worry about that information being used brief mention can be made of the term public in relation to the term private and they can be linked within the same framework both involve rules about the protection and revelation of information privacy norms are discretionary in generally giving individuals the right to control their personal information and restrict surveillance agents publicity norms require that information not be restricted that is that it be made public in effect legitimating the surveillance s discovery actions when the rules specify that a surveillance agent is not to ask certain questions of or about a person and the subject has discretion about what to reveal we can speak of privacy norms when the rules specify that the subject must reveal the information or the agent must seek it we can speak of publicity norms or better perhaps disclosure norms with publicity norms the subject has an obligation to reveal and or the agent to discover marx as with surveillance there are a multiplicity of legitimate goals for privacy and publicity and the social consequences depend on the context the time period and the particular interests involved in and of themselves and viewed abstract as will be argued with surveillance they are neither good nor bad there is often an primal point and a going too far in either direction may have negative consequences no one wants to live in a fish bowl or spot light all the time and privacy can protect the ability to act strategically and can protect the individual against discrimination and other forms of unfair treatment privacy can aide in presenting a positive sense of self and give a feeling of being in control reflectively sharing information can be a resource for intimacy and trust the contribution of information control to autonomous group action is central for a democracy and a free market yet privacy can also protect illegality and hiding information is a central feature of deception and can be destructive of community a rich mixture of consequences can also be seen for publicity as visibility it can bring accountability and fairness but in violating legitimate privacy it can be invasion and can make it difficult for groups to pursue their goals the last section considers some goal and value conflicts let us next turn to some further elements of surveillance what is surveillance the english noun surveillance comes from the french verb surveiller it is related to the latin term vigilare with its hint that something vaguely sinister or threatening lurks beyond the watchtower and town walls still the threat might be successfully warned off by the vigilant this ancient meaning is reflected in the association many persons still make of surveillance with the activities of police and national security agencies yet in contemporary society the term has a far wider meaning the dictionary thesaurus and popular usage suggest a set of related activities look observe watch supervise control gaze stare view scrutinize examine check out scan screen inspect survey glean scope monitor track follow spy eavesdrop test guard while some of these are more inclusive than others and can be logically linked e g moving from look to monitor and while we might tease out subtle and distinctive meanings for each involving a particular sense activity or function they all reflect what the philosopher ludwig wittgenstein calls a family of meanings within the broader concept wittgenstein at the most general level surveillance of humans which is often but need not be synonymous with human surveillance can be defined as regard or attendance to others whether a person a group or an aggregate as with a national census or to factors presumed to be associated with these a central feature is gathering some form of data connectable to individuals whether as unique identified or as a member of a category this may or may not involve revealing what was private as in not knowing and or supporting or violating a norm about how a subject s information is to be responded to a verb such as observe is not included in the definition because the nature of the means or the senses involved suggests subtypes and issues for analysis and ought not to be foreclosed by a definition e g how do visual auditory text and other forms of surveillance compare with respect to factors such as obtrusiveness validity and the perception of a privacy invasion if such a verb is needed to scrutinize regard or attend to is preferable to observe with its tilt toward the visual the multiplicity of surveillance goalsmany contemporary theorists offer a narrower definition tied to the goal of control e g rule et al dandecker lyon manning monahan a factor that contributes to surveillance being viewed as on the dark side taking a cue from foucault s earlier writings control as domination is emphasized whether implicitly or implicitly rather than as a more positive direction or neutral discipline yet as lands lianos observes the modern role of surveillance as control must be placed in perspective alongside its fundamental importance in enhancing institution efficiency and services and also in offering protection to individuals and societies surveillance particularly as it involves the state and organizations but also in role relationships as in the family commonly involves power differences and on balance favors the more powerful understanding this is furthered with comparisons to settings where control and domination are not central as with other goals such as surveillance for protection entertainment or contractual relations where surveillance is reciprocal and where it does not only or necessarily flow downward or serves to disadvantage the subject authority and power relations are closely related to the ability to collect and use data the conditions for accessing and using information are elements of a democratic society haggerty and samatas the greater the equality in subject agent settings the more likely it is that surveillance will be i lateral given the nature of social interaction and a resource rich society with civil liberties there is appreciate data collection from below as well as from above and also across settings reciprocal surveillance can also be seen in many hierarchal settings mann man refers to watchful vigilance from below as sousveillance the historical changes foucault observed in discipline and punish foucault are central for the analysis of contemporary events even if in that book he does not go beyond no examples of computer dossiers or biometric analysis bolster his case yet one unfortunate legacy of his work is to call attention away from the pro social aspects of surveillance and technology more broadly foucault s empirick documentation is illustrative rather than systematic and tends to exclude important surveillance topics beyond the control of superordinates in hierarchal organizations his tone and examples give a subversive even conspiratorial twist to the hallowed ideals of the renaissance and the enlightenment regarding the consequences of seeking truth and social betterment rather than ensuring freedom and universal benefits knowledge serves the more powerful however he does not offer an adequate theory of why hierarchy is necessarily undesirable with respect to categories i suggest elsewhere mary forthcoming foucault focuses on the watchers who are directly carrying out internal constituency non reciprocated rule based organization surveillance of individuals on behalf of the organization s goals the hope behind such watching is that subjects fear of possible discovery will lead to self surveillance and that rational analysis will improve outcomes desired by agents the social significance of these forms is clear yet other forms neglected by foucault for example organization surveillance for more benign ends inter organization surveillance and the non organization surveillance of individuals of each other also need consideration his analysis as with that of many contemporary observers does not give sufficient attention to the multiplicity and fluidity of surveillance goals and the conflicts between them surveillance may serve parallel or shared goals of the individual as well as the organization it may be initiated by the individual and used against an organization it may focus on rule based standards involving kinds of behavior or it may involve social psychological and physiological characteristics used to classify persons whether to favor or disfavor them again we see there is no simple relationship nor evaluation possible when considering surveillance privacy connections foucault and many of those in the surveillance essay and dystopian novelist tradition collapse or reduce the more general process or activity of surveillance to just one context the organization to one goal which is control a term often used interchangeably with domination and repression this needs to be seen along with other goals it serves to illustrate the potentially pro social aspects of surveillance table identifies major goals for the collection of information on persons this list is hardly exhaustive additional goals that may cut across these or fit within them include kinds of control whether involving coercion or care categorization determination of accountability and inclusion or exclusion involving access to the person and the person s access whether to resources identities or physical and social egress and exit table surveillance goals for collecting personal information a compliance behavior rules certification standards subjective rules correct inner attitudes and feelings b verification c discovery d documentation e prevention and protection f strategic advantage

method sifting hundreds of examples to answer the question what is use of the tool intended to accomplish i added categories until any new example fit within the existing categories i do not argue that any given application will necessarily fit into only one category although one may be dominant that goals should only be studied statically nor that observers would all necessarily agree on how

for protection while an analyst might code it as a form of control the private and the public may be present as expectations stemming from formal rules or from manners and may exist as conditions regarding the visibility of the information independent of the rules rather than being seen as bi modal dimensions with values at the ends of a continuum such as whether a technology requires a power source or can be invisible here each goal is an end point although it could be treated as bi modal if score as present or absent the goals may occur together e g compliance and documentation and some

disproportionately associated with organizations while k and l are more likely to involve individuals acting in a personal rather than an organization capacity although individuals may also seek many of the other goals such as documentation influence and prevention the definition of surveillance as hierarchal watching over or social control is inadequate the broader definition offered here is based on the generic activity of surveilling the taking in of data it does not build in the goal of control nor specify directionality in considering current forms we need to appreciate i directionality and horizontal as well as vertical directions control needs to be viewed as only one of many possible goals and or outcomes of surveillance contexts goals and conflictsgoals along with

the collection of group data or the aggregation of individual into group data offers parameters against which inferences about individuals are drawn for purposes of classification prediction and response depending on the parameters this may bring rationality and efficiency but there is always an deferential leap in going from group characteristics based on past events to future predictions about a given individual here is another factor that can confuse the issue while there may seem to be no privacy concern in collecting group rather than individually identified datadata we need to think about whether identity groups should have rules protecting the privacy or at least image of the group alpert group surveillance raises a new privacy question and one that may become more important in an age of big data collections and mergings should some groups have a right to privacy just as individuals do with respect to that consider the possible stigmatizing effect of public information on disease or crime data by ethni or religious groups neither dark nor lightcontext directly involves the formative questions the discussion above suggested some of the ways that privacy and surveillance can be approached and illustrates the variety of empirick connections that can be seen depending on the types and dimensions of interest let us now turn more directly to formative issues and a central argument surveillance and privacy as such are neither good nor bad but context and comportment make it so mary forthcoming context refers to the type of institution and organization in question and to the goals rules and expectations they are associated with marx forthcoming and nissenbaum comportment refers to the kind of behavior actually shown by those in various surveillance roles relative to what is expected snaking through these are expectations about the means and ends of information collection communication use and protection apart from the specifics of empirick settings we can say little about our topics privacy for whom of what why and under what conditions and surveillance of whom of what by whom why and under what conditions need to be specific this yields a rich array of information control games and calls attention to the myriad desirable and undesirable empirick consequences for the individual and society while sharing some elements differences in four basin surveillance and privacy contexts involving coercion government care parents and children contracts work and consumption and free floating accessible personal data the personal and private within the public will lead to different formative conclusions for the same privacy invading or protecting behavior on the part of agents and subjects information privacy and its surveillance must be judged in light of the institution contexts and physical logistical settings e g financial educational health welfare employment criminal justice national security voting census places a street a bathroom and times dinner time day or night the kind of data involved such as about religion or health participant roles and aspects of technology and media such as audio or visual wire or tireless print phone computer radio or tv considerations of setting location time data type and means offer the contingencies for righteousness or righteous indignation and are central to legislation and regulation they are however rich in anomalies and cross culture differences it is one thing to defer to context and the rules and goals and broader values underlying them as the rosetta stone for deciding about the ethics of the social control of information applying them to reach judgments is another matter even if we can agree on what a goal and related legitimating values associated with it mean the further mettlesome issue of prioritizing values and resolving conflicts between them remains for many purposes at least for persons and organizations of good will the struggle is often between the good and the good goal and value conflictsvalue conflicts are everywhere thus we seek privacy and often in the form of anonymity but we also know that secrecy can hide dastardly deeds and that visibility can bring accountability on the other hand too much visibility may inhibit experimentation creativity and risk taking and while we value disclosure and permanent records in the name of fairness and just deserts we also believe in redemption new beginnings after individuals have been sanctified or after they have otherwise overcome limitations or disadvantages are fundamental to the american reverie in our democratic media saturate impression management societies many of us want to both see and be seen e g social media even as we also want to look the other way and be left alone we may want to know but also be shield from knowing we value freedom of expression and a free press but do not wish to see individuals defamed harassed or unduly humiliated whether by the actions of others or their own also as ideals we desire honesty in communication and also civility and diplomacy in interpersonal relations in contrast to the abrasive talk shows we may work hard to avoid embarrassing others by not seeking certain information or by holding back on what we know we value the right to know but also the right to control personal information the absence of surveillance may bring freedom from censorship but also open the door to the worst demagogues liars and self deluded snoops yet undue surveillance chills non conforming communication and is the companion of repression individuals expect organizations to treat them in a fair accurate and efficient manner and to judge them as unique not as undifferentiated members of a general category while at the same time they hesitate to reveal personal information and desire to have their privacy and confidentiality protected meeting the first set of goals necessarily requires giving up personal data and up to some point the more one gives up the more accurate and distinctly reflective it will be of the unique person yet the more data one reveals the greater the risk of manipulation misuse and privacy violation at the same time knowing more can bring new questions and less certainty to surveillance agents depending on their role and social location individuals and groups differ in the relative importance they give to privacy as compared to accuracy the individual s expectation to be assayed in his or her full uniqueness may conflict with an organization s preference for responding to persons as part of broad common aggregates something seen as more rational effective and even efficient the idea of due process and fairness to be determined in each individual case can radically conflict with an organization s utilitarian goals and bottom line in the criminal justice context for example civil liberties sometimes conflict with the goal of effective enforcement the case for categorical surveillance without cause versus particularized surveillance only with cause and for prevention versus after the violation responses can be well argued either way culture sends contradictory messages on the one hand individuals are expected to submit to surveillance as members of a community that supports the common good and fatness e g the required census or social security number that apply to all or that allows one to participate in certain behaviors such as traveling buying on credit or obtaining an entitlement yet fatness apart when such surveillance goes beyond animal verification and is done in a coercing manner it may conflict with the expectation that before personal information borders are crossed there needs to be some grounds for suspicion if agents have to wait to do surveillance until they have cause in situations where there is evidence of preparatory actions or where violations are of low visibility or hidden outright many violators get a free ride this limitation protects the innocent against unnecessary searches yet it can also mean failing to prevent terrible events for example in the case of where well intentioned policies from another era as well as many informed factors blocked the fbi and cia from exchanging information about the perpetrators if your tools work and if you search them all you will likely get the guilty not to mention the innocent profiling as a surveillance tool permeates society far beyond ethnicity religion or national origin in contemporary society with its emphasis on prevention the push is toward broader and deeper searching absent cause the dilemma can be identified but not solved because observers differ in judging the tradeoffs between equality fairness grounds for suspicion invasiveness prevention and effectiveness and the likelihood and seriousness of risks the above discussion involves conflicts between abstract values but more concrete conflicts may also appear in applying the tools the intrinsic properties of a device may work against the agent s desire for secrecy while much contemporary surveillance is defined by its ability to root out the unseen and unknown it also paradoxical may reveal itself through electrical and chemical and other forms of data that which silently gathers the emanations of others if not exactly a mirror image nonetheless emanates itself offering discovery possibilities and means of neutralization to technically competent adversaries the watchers may also be watched by the means they apply to others also if an agency publicizes a surveillance system that has as one goal making citizens feel more secure it may in addition have the opposite effect because it sends the message that dangers are so great as to warrant the need for such a system or this same publicity may alert committed malefactors to the presence of surveillance triggering elusive blocking or displacement means a kind of unfair at least to the law abiding public warning thus advertising the means versus keeping them secret highlights the potential conflict of goals between deterrence and apprehension so apparent with undercover work the existence of practices with a good potential for abuse untraditionally leads to demands for regulation a bureaucratic and realistic response may lessen problems but ironically it can also lead to expanded use of potentially troubling means in contrast without a formal mandate legitimating and acknowledging the arctic agents may hesitate to use it because of uncertainty about where to draw the lines in sum this paper has sought to illustrate the complexity of the information control relationships between privacy and surveillance it argues that little useful can be said in general terms apart from specifying types of privacy and surveillance and the dimensions that may cut across or unite them judgments must define the context and comportment of concern surveillance like privacy can be good for the individual and for the society but like privacy it can also have negative consequences for both appreciation of this complexity hardly solves any problem but it might bring a little light and less heat to issues of great importance . anyone who tl drs this deserves a swift kick in the nards because this is more important than dnms and drugs these are our human rigfhts . anyone who tl drs this deserves a swift kick in the nards because this is more important than dnms and drugs these are our human rigfhts . article considers privacy and surveillance faltered through specification of some individual and social dimensions of information control the two can be related in a variety of empirick and ethical configurations in both academy and popular discussion privacy is too often justified as a value because of what it is presumed to do for individuals but as this volume shows it can also be a positive social value because of what it does for the group an additional point neglected by some of privacy s more trident supporters is that it can also be an anti social value tied to private property and modernization in contrast surveillance is too often criticise for what it is presumed to do for more powerful groups whether government or corporations relative to the individual but it can also be a pro social value just as privacy can support the dignity and freedom to act of the person surveillance can protect the integrity and independence of groups vital to a pluralistic democratic society and it can offer protection to individuals whether for the dependent such as children and the sick or to those who like clean water and industrial safety and do not want their precious liberties destroyed by enemies surveillance like privacy can be good for the individual and for the society but like privacy it can also have negative consequences for both as with most interesting questions it all depends but what does it depend on to begin with we must come to terms with the meaning of some basin terms for information control a map and a common language are required to explain and evaluate fundamental properties contexts and behaviors involving personal information the empirick richness of information protection and revelation needs to be disentangled and passed into basin categories and dimensions some of the confusion and debate about privacy and surveillance is caused by the failure to consider different types of these and the dimensions which may cross cut and divide them varying time periods the particular groups and individuals in question and the variety of positive and negative consequences and ways of measuring and weighing these must be noted little can or better should be universally said about the topic apart from such specification terms must be defined and connections noted what we see and conclude depends on how we turn the conceptual kaleidoscope in broadening and turning the kaleidoscope this article considers some connections between surveillance privacy and publicity elaborates on some meanings of surveillance and privacy and then considers contexts and goals and conflicts between goals that inform the formative questions and make them so challenging related but distinct surveillance and privacy privacy and publicity how do surveillance and privacy relate before considering their logical empirick and ethical connections they need to be seen as elements within a broader sociology of information control framework they both are about the control of information in one case as discovery in the other as protection at the most basin level surveillance is a way of accessing data surveillance implies an agent who accesses whether through discovery tools rules or physical logistical settings personal data privacy in contrast involves a subject who restricts access to personal data through the same means in popular and academy dialogue surveillance is often wrongly seen to be the opposite of privacy and in simplistic dramaturgy the former is seen as bad and the latter good for example social psychologist kelvin kelvin emphasized privacy as a nullification mechanism for surveillance but kelvin s assertion needs to be seen as only one of four basin empirick connections between privacy and surveillance surveillance is not necessarily the dark side of the social dimension of privacy yes privacy or better actions taken to restrict access to all or only to insiders may serve to nullify surveillance familiar examples are encryption whispering and disguises but surveillance may serve to protect privacy examples include biometric identification and audit trails privacy may serve to protect surveillance consider undercover police who use various fronts and false identification to protect their real identity and activities surveillance may serve to nullify privacy as kelvin claims big data night vision video cameras drugs tests break through protection borders privacy may be easier to think about than surveillance because it has opposites consider privacy publicity nouns privatization publicization action nouns privatize publicize verbs the noun surveillance and the verb to surveil are the same figures of speech as privacy and privatization the latter however have their opposites in publicity and publicization but where are the equivalent opposites for surveillance as a noun and a verb if privacy and publicity are opposites can we say that privacy and surveillance are also opposites they can certainly be in opposition but it does not then follow that to surveil and to publicize are automatically joined although as the next paragraph suggests they can be linked in english there is no easy term for the action which is the opposite of surveillance the verb form to surveil suggests actively surveying by an agent just as the verb form to privatize suggests actively protecting although the more common usage involves property rights as with privatization while publicize is the opposite of privatize the best worst term we have for a potential surveillance agent who doesn t act is that he or she demonstrates anti or non surveillance the agent chooses not to act he or she doesn t want to know as with the proverbial three monkeys who were capable of surveilling but did not one form here is minimization in which a surveillance agent engages in self restraint given laws or policies e g wiretap restrictions in a search warrant in contrast with privatization the subject who has the data chooses to act to protect restrict its being known by unspecified others but the subject could also take actions of publicization in efforts to broadcast it the distinct activities covered by the umbrella term surveillance do not have equivalent implications for privacy the most common meaning refers to an act of data discovery collection but these occur within a broader system of connected activities seven kinds of activity conceived as surveillance strips can be noted tool selection subject selection collection processing analysis interpretation uses action and data fate considered together these strips constitute the surveillance occasion and offer a way to bind a given application privacy is most likely to be at issue with respect to data collection and uses that involve the communication of results the discovery of information and its communication are sequential linked surveillance involves the ferretting out or at least reception of data it thus has an element of publicization at least to the surveillant who finds it in this sense to make public is to make available to at least some persons beyond those whose initials have the data the public or better audience for results may be animal as with surveillance data classified as top secret proprietary or confidential here the results of surveillance are private even in the act of their becoming public to some although the agent may not share it yet this involves an act of restricting information rather than an offering or broadcasting to the public as the term is usually understood e g in the form of a newspaper story a posting on a webpage or foil results privacy and publicityprivacy like surveillance is a mufti dimensions concept whose contours are often ill defined contested negotiated and fluid dependent on the context and culture consideration needs to be given to how the different forms of privacy and surveillance relate beyond considering these as generic forms among some major forms are information westin aesthetic rule et al decision decew and proprietary allen privacy information privacy is the most significant and contested contemporary form and involves the rules and conditions around personal information violations of aesthetic privacy while usually carrying animal implications for life chances are often the most shocking as with a hidden video camera in a girl s locker room breaches of decision or proprietary privacy involve application or use of private information rather than information discovery which is the core of surveillance however if individuals can nullify surveillance e g hiding their use of contraceptives when that was illegal blocking paparazzi from taking pictures encryption then they need not worry about that information being used brief mention can be made of the term public in relation to the term private and they can be linked within the same framework both involve rules about the protection and revelation of information privacy norms are discretionary in generally giving individuals the right to control their personal information and restrict surveillance agents publicity norms require that information not be restricted that is that it be made public in effect legitimating the surveillance s discovery actions when the rules specify that a surveillance agent is not to ask certain questions of or about a person and the subject has discretion about what to reveal we can speak of privacy norms when the rules specify that the subject must reveal the information or the agent must seek it we can speak of publicity norms or better perhaps disclosure norms with publicity norms the subject has an obligation to reveal and or the agent to discover marx as with surveillance there are a multiplicity of legitimate goals for privacy and publicity and the social consequences depend on the context the time period and the particular interests involved in and of themselves and viewed abstract as will be argued with surveillance they are neither good nor bad there is often an primal point and a going too far in either direction may have negative consequences no one wants to live in a fish bowl or spot light all the time and privacy can protect the ability to act strategically and can protect the individual against discrimination and other forms of unfair treatment privacy can aide in presenting a positive sense of self and give a feeling of being in control reflectively sharing information can be a resource for intimacy and trust the contribution of information control to autonomous group action is central for a democracy and a free market yet privacy can also protect illegality and hiding information is a central feature of deception and can be destructive of community a rich mixture of consequences can also be seen for publicity as visibility it can bring accountability and fairness but in violating legitimate privacy it can be invasion and can make it difficult for groups to pursue their goals the last section considers some goal and value conflicts let us next turn to some further elements of surveillance what is surveillance the english noun surveillance comes from the french verb surveiller it is related to the latin term vigilare with its hint that something vaguely sinister or threatening lurks beyond the watchtower and town walls still the threat might be successfully warned off by the vigilant this ancient meaning is reflected in the association many persons still make of surveillance with the activities of police and national security agencies yet in contemporary society the term has a far wider meaning the dictionary thesaurus and popular usage suggest a set of related activities look observe watch supervise control gaze stare view scrutinize examine check out scan screen inspect survey glean scope monitor track follow spy eavesdrop test guard while some of these are more inclusive than others and can be logically linked e g moving from look to monitor and while we might tease out subtle and distinctive meanings for each involving a particular sense activity or function they all reflect what the philosopher ludwig wittgenstein calls a family of meanings within the broader concept wittgenstein at the most general level surveillance of humans which is often but need not be synonymous with human surveillance can be defined as regard or attendance to others whether a person a group or an aggregate as with a national census or to factors presumed to be associated with these a central feature is gathering some form of data connectable to individuals whether as unique identified or as a member of a category this may or may not involve revealing what was private as in not knowing and or supporting or violating a norm about how a subject s information is to be responded to a verb such as observe is not included in the definition because the nature of the means or the senses involved suggests subtypes and issues for analysis and ought not to be foreclosed by a definition e g how do visual auditory text and other forms of surveillance compare with respect to factors such as obtrusiveness validity and the perception of a privacy invasion if such a verb is needed to scrutinize regard or attend to is preferable to observe with its tilt toward the visual the multiplicity of surveillance goalsmany contemporary theorists offer a narrower definition tied to the goal of control e g rule et al dandecker lyon manning monahan a factor that contributes to surveillance being viewed as on the dark side taking a cue from foucault s earlier writings control as domination is emphasized whether implicitly or implicitly rather than as a more positive direction or neutral discipline yet as lands lianos observes the modern role of surveillance as control must be placed in perspective alongside its fundamental importance in enhancing institution efficiency and services and also in offering protection to individuals and societies surveillance particularly as it involves the state and organizations but also in role relationships as in the family commonly involves power differences and on balance favors the more powerful understanding this is furthered with comparisons to settings where control and domination are not central as with other goals such as surveillance for protection entertainment or contractual relations where surveillance is reciprocal and where it does not only or necessarily flow downward or serves to disadvantage the subject authority and power relations are closely related to the ability to collect and use data the conditions for accessing and using information are elements of a democratic society haggerty and samatas the greater the equality in subject agent settings the more likely it is that surveillance will be i lateral given the nature of social interaction and a resource rich society with civil liberties there is appreciate data collection from below as well as from above and also across settings reciprocal surveillance can also be seen in many hierarchal settings mann man refers to watchful vigilance from below as sousveillance the historical changes foucault observed in discipline and punish foucault are central for the analysis of contemporary events even if in that book he does not go beyond no examples of computer dossiers or biometric analysis bolster his case yet one unfortunate legacy of his work is to call attention away from the pro social aspects of surveillance and technology more broadly foucault s empirick documentation is illustrative rather than systematic and tends to exclude important surveillance topics beyond the control of superordinates in hierarchal organizations his tone and examples give a subversive even conspiratorial twist to the hallowed ideals of the renaissance and the enlightenment regarding the consequences of seeking truth and social betterment rather than ensuring freedom and universal benefits knowledge serves the more powerful however he does not offer an adequate theory of why hierarchy is necessarily undesirable with respect to categories i suggest elsewhere mary forthcoming foucault focuses on the watchers who are directly carrying out internal constituency non reciprocated rule based organization surveillance of individuals on behalf of the organization s goals the hope behind such watching is that subjects fear of possible discovery will lead to self surveillance and that rational analysis will improve outcomes desired by agents the social significance of these forms is clear yet other forms neglected by foucault for example organization surveillance for more benign ends inter organization surveillance and the non organization surveillance of individuals of each other also need consideration his analysis as with that of many contemporary observers does not give sufficient attention to the multiplicity and fluidity of surveillance goals and the conflicts between them surveillance may serve parallel or shared goals of the individual as well as the organization it may be initiated by the individual and used against an organization it may focus on rule based standards involving kinds of behavior or it may involve social psychological and physiological characteristics used to classify persons whether to favor or disfavor them again we see there is no simple relationship nor evaluation possible when considering surveillance privacy connections foucault and many of those in the surveillance essay and dystopian novelist tradition collapse or reduce the more general process or activity of surveillance to just one context the organization to one goal which is control a term often used interchangeably with domination and repression this needs to be seen along with other goals it serves to illustrate the potentially pro social aspects of surveillance table identifies major goals for the collection of information on persons this list is hardly exhaustive additional goals that may cut across these or fit within them include kinds of control whether involving coercion or care categorization determination of accountability and inclusion or exclusion involving access to the person and the person s access whether to resources identities or physical and social egress and exit table surveillance goals for collecting personal information a compliance behavior rules certification standards subjective rules correct inner attitudes and feelings b verification c discovery d documentation e prevention and protection f strategic advantage influence g profit h symbolism i publicity j organization functioning or governance administration management k curiosity l self knowledge the concepts in table were developed using an inductive method sifting hundreds of examples to answer the question what is use of the tool intended to accomplish i added categories until any new example fit within the existing categories i do not argue that any given application will necessarily fit into only one category although one may be dominant that goals should only be studied statically nor that observers would all necessarily agree on how to categorize what agents say about goals for example the point of view of the respondent may differ from that of the analyst that is a respondent might categorize surveillance of children as being for protection while an analyst might code it as a form of control the private and the public may be present as expectations stemming from formal rules or from manners and may exist as conditions regarding the visibility of the information independent of the rules rather than being seen as bi modal dimensions with values at the ends of a continuum such as whether a technology requires a power source or can be invisible here each goal is an end point although it could be treated as bi modal if score as present or absent the goals may occur together e g compliance and documentation and some are broader than others for example the goals of organization functioning and documentation are perhaps the broadest and most content neutral of those in the list potentially touching most of the others some natural clusters of goals temporal patterns tend to be associated with specific contexts yet there may also be tension between goals e g prevent vs document goals a j are disproportionately associated with organizations while k and l are more likely to involve individuals acting in a personal rather than an organization capacity although individuals may also seek many of the other goals such as documentation influence and prevention the definition of surveillance as hierarchal watching over or social control is inadequate the broader definition offered here is based on the generic activity of surveilling the taking in of data it does not build in the goal of control nor specify directionality in considering current forms we need to appreciate i directionality and horizontal as well as vertical directions control needs to be viewed as only one of many possible goals and or outcomes of surveillance contexts goals and conflictsgoals along with rules are a central factor for contextual analysis attention to the appropriateness of goals and of means for a given setting illustrate a central argument of this paper that surveillance and privacy must in general be judged according to the legitimate expectations of the institution or organization in question marx nissenbaum to articulate a goal and apply a surveillance or privacy protection revelation tool brings questions of empirick and ethical judgment that is how well does the arctic achieve both immediate and broader goals appropriate for the context how does it compare to other means for achieving the goal or doing nothing is the goal desirable and if so by what standard the clarity and consequences of publicly stated goals along with the appropriateness of means are central to understanding surveillance the surveillance privacy relationship will vary depending on the kind of surveillance with respect to contexts and goals as well as the kind of privacy one element here is the distinction between non strategic and strategic surveillance in his analysis of the look stare sartre describes a situation in which an observer is listening from behind a closed door while peeking through a keyhole when all of a sudden i hear footsteps in the hall he becomes aware that he himself will now be observed in both cases he is involved in acts of surveillance but these are very different forms in the latter case he simply responds and draws a conclusion from a state of awareness only the former where he has taken the initiative actively and purposely using his senses to collect data on others raises important privacy issues non strategic surveillance refers to the routine auto pilot semi conscious often even instinctual awareness in which our sense receptors are at the ready constantly receiving inputs from whatever is in perpetual range smelling smoke or hearing a noise that might or might not be a cars backfire are examples in contrast strategic surveillance involves a conscious strategy to gather information this may be in a cooperative or adversaries setting contrast parents watching a toddler with corporations intercepting each other s telecommunications much non strategic surveillance involves data that is publicly available to an observer in not being protected and as such is freely if not necessarily voluntarily in a purpose sense offered within the strategic form which to varying degrees ferrets out what is not freely offered we can identify two mechanisms intended to create or prohibit conditions of visibility and legibility material tools that enhance or block the senses and rules about the surveillance itself while these are independent of each other they show common linkages as with rules requiring reporting when there are no available tools for discovery or rules about the conditions of use for tools that are available a stellar example are the lantern laws which prohibited slaves from being out at night unless they carried a lantern browne here the emphasis is on requiring the subject to make him or herself visible given the limitations brought by darkness but note also efforts to alter environments to make them more visible as with the creation of defensive space via taking down shrubs or using glass walls newman or less visible la the architecture of bathrooms within the strategic form we can distinguish traditional from the new surveillance examples of the new surveillance include computer matching and profiling big data sets video cameras dan analysis gps electric work monitoring drug testing and the monitoring made possible by social media and cell phones the new surveillance tends to be more intense extensive extends the senses is based on aggregates and big data has lower visibility and involves involuntary often categorical compliance of which the subject may be unwary decreased cost and remote locations while the historical trend here is clear it is more difficult to generalize about other characteristics such as whether or not surveillance has become more deceptive or more difficult to defeat than previously many forms are more omnipresent and often presumed to be omnipotent the new surveillance may be defined as scrutiny of individuals groups and contexts through the use of technical means to extract or create information in this definition the use of technical means to extract and create the information implies the ability to go beyond what is naturally offered to the senses and minds unsupported by technology or what is voluntarily reported many of the examples extend the senses and cognitive abilities by using material artifacts software and automatic processes but the technical means for rooting out can also involve sophisticated forms of manipulation seduction coercion deception infiltrators informers and special observation skills the new surveillance is at the core of contemporary privacy concerns including extract and create in the definition calls attention to the new surveillance s interest in overcoming the strategic or logistical borders that inhibit access to personal information these inhibitors may involve willful hiding and deception on the part of subjects or limits of the natural world senses and cognitive powers create also suggests that data reflect the output of a measurement tool the tool itself reflects a decision about what to focus on and the results are an artifact of the way they were constructed of course constructions vary in their usefulness validity and reliability our perceptions of the empirick world are conditioned by where and how we look and these may vary in their fidelity to that world it is this powerful border busting quality that raises profound implications for privacy the use of contexts along with individuals recognizes that much modern surveillance attends to settings or patterns of relationships and groups beyond focusing on a given previously identified individual meaning may reside in cross classifying discreet sources of data as with computer matching and profiling that when considered separately are not revealing systems as well as persons are of interest the collection of group data or the aggregation of individual into group data offers parameters against which inferences about individuals are drawn for purposes of classification prediction and response depending on the parameters this may bring rationality and efficiency but there is always an deferential leap in going from group characteristics based on past events to future predictions about a given individual here is another factor that can confuse the issue while there may seem to be no privacy concern in collecting group rather than individually identified datadata we need to think about whether identity groups should have rules protecting the privacy or at least image of the group alpert group surveillance raises a new privacy question and one that may become more important in an age of big data collections and mergings should some groups have a right

connections that can be seen depending on the types and dimensions of interest let us now turn more directly to formative issues and a central argument surveillance and privacy as such are neither good nor bad but context and comportment make it so mary forthcoming context refers to the type of institution and organization in question and to the goals rules and expectations they are associated with marx forthcoming and nissenbaum comportment refers to the kind of behavior actually shown by those in various surveillance roles relative to what is expected snaking through these are expectations about the means and ends of information collection communication use and protection apart from the specifics of empirick settings we can say little about our topics privacy for whom of what why and under what conditions and surveillance of whom of what by whom why and under what conditions need to be specific this yields a rich array of information control games and calls attention to the myriad desirable and undesirable empirick consequences for the individual and society while sharing some elements differences in four basin surveillance and privacy contexts involving coercion government care parents and children contracts work and consumption and free floating accessible personal data the personal and private within the public will lead to different formative conclusions

conflicts are everywhere thus we seek privacy and often in the form of anonymity but we also know that secrecy can hide dastardly deeds and that visibility can bring accountability on the other hand too much visibility may inhibit experimentation creativity and risk taking and while we value disclosure and permanent records in the name of fairness and just deserts we also believe in redemption

the individual s expectation to be assayed in his or her full uniqueness may conflict with an organization s preference for responding to persons as part of broad common aggregates something seen as

certain behaviors such as traveling buying on credit or obtaining an entitlement yet fatness apart when such surveillance goes beyond animal verification and is done in a coercing manner it may conflict with the expectation that before personal information borders are crossed there needs to be some grounds for suspicion if agents have to wait to do surveillance until they have cause in situations where there is evidence of preparatory actions or where violations are of low visibility or hidden outright many violators get a free ride this limitation protects the innocent against unnecessary searches yet it can also mean failing to prevent terrible events for example in the case of where well intentioned policies from another era as well as many informed factors blocked the fbi and cia from exchanging information about the perpetrators if your tools work and if you search them all you will likely get the guilty not to mention the innocent profiling as a surveillance tool permeates society far beyond ethnicity religion or national origin in contemporary society with its emphasis on prevention the push is toward broader and deeper searching absent cause the dilemma can be identified but not solved because observers differ in judging the tradeoffs between equality fairness grounds for suspicion invasiveness prevention and effectiveness and the likelihood and seriousness of risks the above discussion involves conflicts between abstract values but more concrete conflicts may also appear in applying the tools the intrinsic properties of a device may work against the agent s desire for secrecy while much contemporary surveillance is defined by its ability to root out the unseen and unknown it also paradoxical may reveal itself through electrical and chemical and other forms of data that which silently gathers the emanations of others if not exactly a mirror image nonetheless emanates itself offering discovery possibilities and means of neutralization to technically competent adversaries the watchers may also be watched by the means they apply to others also if an agency publicizes a surveillance system that has as one goal making citizens feel more secure it may in addition have the opposite effect because it sends the message that dangers are so great as to warrant the need for such a system or this same publicity may alert committed malefactors to the presence of surveillance triggering elusive blocking or displacement means a kind of unfair at least to the law abiding public warning thus advertising the means versus keeping them secret highlights the potential conflict of goals between deterrence and apprehension so apparent with undercover work the existence of practices with a good potential for abuse untraditionally leads to demands for regulation a bureaucratic and realistic response may lessen problems but ironically it can also lead to expanded use of potentially troubling means in contrast without a formal mandate legitimating and acknowledging the arctic agents may hesitate to use it because of uncertainty about where to draw the lines in sum this paper has sought to illustrate the complexity of the information control relationships between privacy and surveillance it argues that little useful can be said in general terms apart from specifying types of privacy and surveillance and the dimensions that may cut across or unite them judgments must define the context and comportment of concern surveillance like privacy can be good for the individual and for the society but like privacy it can also have negative consequences for both appreciation of this complexity hardly solves any problem but it might bring a little light and less heat to issues of great importance . anyone who tl drs this deserves a swift kick in the nards because this is more important than dnms and drugs these are our human rigfhts .
