with that account fuck you dr clu . of course it was a swam get real people and wake up after reading through all forum posts news comments of the mods and admins of sr there are too many fishy things and contradictions blaming transaction malleability and the admin clearly quote saying that it is a recently discovered bug is laughable it wasnt published last week as he stated in his latest forum post it was published looooong ago just before this heist a thread named reality check was posted stating that users should be thankful for all the positive security measures that had been made and for all the effort the admit s put in the development of the website also another thread was being publicized promoting that nobody should finalize early any transaction which then resulted in more btc in escrow also nothing was done regarding the required ban of certain well known scammers and certain users reported negative btc balance on their account after depositing a substantial amount of btc to their s wallet the admin defcon claims hes been off internet for like a whole week so he didnt know about the mtgox announcement and the ddos attacks lets be clear here he runs a black market the last thing he would do is not be informed for a whole damn week he had to live under a rock to not hear about the recent mtgox scandal and if he really didnt then hes not to be trusted with running any site let alone sr long minutes hours after the admin stated in the sr forum that the site has been hacked and all coins were stolen several transactions were still happening which deducted funds from known vendor accounts i repeat after the post has been made this is just written scam all over it the admin claims he took all funds from the wallets to a single hot storage wallet to re enable the auto finalize option on the site and he left it there for days straight i refuse to believe this level of stupidity from an admin who runs a site like sr then he tried to explain it by typing that he was dressed out sure the posts of certain mods have too many contradictions one minute they say im only a moderator here we are only paid to run the forums i have nothing to do with sr itself the usual blablabla and the next minute the same person on a different thread writes sentences like we will open the market when this and this will be finished oh so suddenly its a we also they claim they accidentally delete threads i e the most important one recently regarding the admins statement on the situation sounds believable right the admit defcon who failed his community by being hacked as he claims has the audacity to warn people of security issues of other sites suggesting people not to use other marketplaces he doesnt even know because he fears for the safety of the customers funds oh the irony i suspect that the forums mods also have other forum accounts so they can publicly write positive opinions about themselves s and anybody who still believes in them otherwise i can not explain mods and other users alleged female in the black market giving each other hugs and kisses and things of that nature while some people lost thousands of dollars in a few days also the admin has a bunch of dedicated groupies co signing whatever he says exchanging female like emotional comments like i am deeply thankful for the hundreds of supporting messages ive received this is a business not a f cking female high school simply put i cant believe this unprofessional manner to conduct business run a website and the obvious scam that this is these people should not be trusted with anything related to any black market in the future unfortunately the fact is that they can pop up anywhere daytime under a different name and identity and we probably wouldnt know a thing about it . quote from doctorclu on february amwe know what happened we are not careless it was a hack stop spewing nonsense and misinformation if by hack you mean stolen then use correct terminology if you honestly believe it was a hack then you are truly cullest yes that was a play on your name duh clueless for sure the mods have been a no show for months well they have been busy deleting forum accounts and censoring both facts and opinions not helping or advising properly in fact misleading not protecting us at all letting the sr kitty build up the lies excuse dr puppet accounts errrr defcon gave us did not make any sense more holes than swiss cheese in that story prehaps if you didnt understand how etc works or a jebusite you may easily buy into the web of lies but the ones who do understand know for a fact that defcon lied plain and simple fact defcons hack story which is what is in all our account wallets i do not expect any coin i do not expect an honest apology i do not expect to hear the truth from defcon or any s mod ie the truth i stole from the community just stop speading lies about a wink wink hack or some btc problem that has been known about for years nothing like this happened on sr there were other scams then if it were possible to steal btc as described in conjobs errr defcons explanation someone would have done it on sr but noone did because it is not possible im sorry for all those who lost coin never use sr again that site has been burned and so have we lets dox defcon and all the other thieves . of course it was a swam get real

the mods and admins of sr there are too many fishy things and contradictions blaming transaction malleability and the admin clearly quote saying that it is a recently discovered bug is laughable it wasnt published last week as he stated in his latest forum post it was published looooong ago just before this heist a thread named reality check was posted stating that users should be thankful for all the positive security measures that had been made and for all the effort the admit s put in the development of the website also another thread was being publicized promoting that nobody should finalize early any transaction which then resulted in more btc in escrow also nothing was done regarding the required ban of certain well known scammers and certain users reported negative btc balance on their account after depositing a substantial amount of btc to their s wallet the admin defcon claims hes been off internet for like a whole week so he didnt know about the mtgox announcement and the ddos attacks lets be clear here he runs a black market the last thing he would do is not be informed for a whole damn week he had to live under a rock to not hear about the recent mtgox scandal and if he really didnt then hes not to be trusted with running any site let alone sr long minutes hours after the admin stated in the sr forum that the site has been hacked and all coins were stolen several transactions were still happening which deducted funds from known vendor accounts i repeat after the post has been made this is just written scam all over it the admin claims he took all funds from the wallets to a single hot storage wallet to re enable the auto finalize option on the site and he left it there for days straight i refuse to believe this level of stupidity from an admin who runs a site like sr then he tried to explain it by typing that he was dressed out sure the posts of certain mods have too many contradictions one minute they say im only a moderator here we are only paid to run the forums i have nothing to do with sr itself the usual blablabla and the next minute the same person on a different thread writes sentences like we will open the market when this and this will be finished oh so suddenly its a we also they claim they accidentally delete threads i e the most important one recently regarding the admins statement on the situation sounds believable right the admit defcon who failed his community by being hacked as he claims has the audacity to warn people of security issues of other sites suggesting people not to use other marketplaces he doesnt even know because he fears for the safety of the customers funds oh the irony i suspect that the forums mods also have other forum accounts so they can publicly write positive opinions about themselves s and anybody who still believes in them otherwise i can not explain mods and other users alleged female in the black market giving each other hugs and kisses and things of that nature while some people lost thousands of dollars in a few days also the admin has a bunch of dedicated groupies co signing whatever he says exchanging female like emotional comments like i am deeply thankful for the hundreds of supporting messages ive received this is a business not a f cking female high school simply put i cant believe this unprofessional manner to conduct business run a website and the obvious scam that this is these people should not be trusted with anything related to any black market in the future unfortunately the fact is that they can pop up anywhere daytime under a different name and identity and we probably wouldnt know a thing about it . quote from highspeedflying on february pmyoure a fucking piece of ship doctorclu this the neck of dr clu if it was a hack

some time that sr didnt have all the bitcoins that were supposed in peoples wallets and were using these bugs to borrow money from vendors when deposits were not enough to fund the withdrawls now that people are losing faith and leaving the site deposits are much less than withdrawls and vendors are requiring customers to finalize early so they cant borrow the money anymore just an idea . quote from doctorclu on february amwe know what happened we are not careless it was a hack stop spewing nonsense and misinformation if by hack you mean stolen then use correct terminology if you honestly believe it was a hack then you are truly cullest yes that was a play on your name duh clueless for sure the mods have been a no show for months well they have been busy deleting forum accounts and censoring both facts and opinions not helping or advising properly in fact misleading not protecting us at all letting the sr kitty build up the lies excuse dr puppet accounts errrr defcon gave us did not make any sense more holes than swiss cheese in that story prehaps if you didnt understand how etc works or a jebusite you may easily buy into the web of lies but the ones who do understand know for a fact that defcon lied plain and simple fact defcons hack story which is what is in all our account wallets i do not expect any coin i do not expect an honest apology i do not expect to hear the truth from defcon or any s mod ie the truth i stole from the community just stop speading lies about a wink wink hack or some btc problem that has been known about for years nothing like this happened on sr there were other scams then if it were possible to steal btc as described in conjobs errr defcons explanation someone would have done it on sr but noone did because it is not possible im sorry

by agoras pgp signed message code select begin pgp signed message hash sha agora announcement earlier this week the details of a serious bug in the opens library were made public this bug which affected a large number of web servers and devices was popularly referred to as heartbleed the bug allows anybody connecting to a vulnerable service to reveal the contents of memory on the server and thus reveal secret keys user information passwords etc there is more information about the bug and the versions of openssl that are affected at the jebusite setup for the bug is a hidden service served on the tor network and while agora itself does not use the vulnerable library the tor software that makes up the network was affected by this bug in some instances since it integrates the opens library the tor project wrote a blog post about how this bug affects various aspects of the tor service users of the tor browser bundle you should upgrade to the latest release version immediately as the bundled version of tor is vulnerable to the attack get the latest tor browser bundle version from agora as a hidden service we have investigated the possibilities of exploitation and to our current best knowledge the most an attacker could hope to gain in a hypothetically situation of successful exploitation is the ability to impersonate the hidden service the tor blog post on this subject states like the last big openssl bug this shouldnt allow an attacker to identify the location of the hidden service but an attacker who knows the hidden service identity key can impersonate the hidden service at this time even an attack like that is looking unlikely and we havent seen any signs of it being successfully executed however since the underlying bug is very serious and has been in the wild for an unclean amount of time we will be taking the necessary precautions and shall hereby recycle all our previously used hidden service keys reflectively this means that we need to change the address of the market additional we have decided to take the market down for some time so we can fully investigate the effects and change all servers used by it in order to fully protect

service served on the tor network and while agora itself does not use the vulnerable library the tor software that makes up the network was affected by this bug in some instances since it integrates the opens library the tor project wrote a blog post about how this bug affects various aspects of the tor service users of the tor browser bundle you should upgrade to the latest release version immediately as the bundled version of tor is vulnerable to the attack get the latest tor browser bundle version from agora as a hidden service we have investigated the possibilities of exploitation and to our current best knowledge the most an attacker could hope to gain in a hypothetically situation of successful exploitation is the ability to impersonate the hidden service the tor blog post on this subject states like the last big openssl bug this shouldnt allow an attacker to identify the location of the hidden service but an attacker who knows the hidden service identity key can impersonate the hidden service at this time even an attack like that is looking unlikely and we havent seen any signs of it being successfully executed however since the underlying bug is very serious and has been in the wild for an unclean amount of time we will be taking the necessary precautions and shall hereby recycle all our previously used hidden service keys reflectively this means that we need to change the address of the market additional we have decided to take the market down for some time so we can fully investigate the effects and change all servers used by it in order to fully
