many fri not est we are sorry safe mail is not ready yet safe mail net is down for critical maintainance during the many and long days since the crash we have been experiencing the wider version of murphys law anything that can go wrong will at the worst possible moment we know that apologies will not change anything so in addition to our sincere apologies we are taking actions to make the system better we are now in the final stages of putting everything together and hope safe mail net will be available again not later then tuesday the th of november this will be a completely new system new equipment new operating system and recompiled software with small modifications to match the new environment we hope the renewed configuration will be more stable than the previous one there will be other changes mainly no self registration and a separate system for premium users during the coming weeks we will continue to work intensely on different aspect of the system after that period we intend to dedicate one hour of every week to maintenance during that hour user sign in will be disabled although during most of maintenance period the system will be up and running details will be announced soon we expect several issues because of the long down time we expect a high rate of password lost normally we cant help in such situations but at this time we will do whatever is possible to help mainly premium users details will be published soon as a result of the extensive cleanup in the list of users we expect that some innocent users were removed inadvertently we kept all data and will publish a procedure for recovering missing accounts sat not est we are very sorry the current safe mail service downtime is a major event we should learn from it and come out with a much better service for our loyal users about month ago we have twitched our hosting company as we felt that our previous hosting service was not as good as we would like it to be during the last year we have suffered from an increasing level of abuse and attacks of many types eventually we had to stop automatic self registration and require a mail request to open a free account for several months we are in the process of transferring users data to new and better equipment as a result about of our users will not lose any data the rest may suffer a animal loss of messages sent or received just before the crash hours up to a few days during this downtime we have already replaced most of our hardware and installed a new version of the operating system the current downtime forced us to execute the system overhaul earlier than planned we think that this is not good enough as soon as the system is functioning we intend to start building a separate system dedicated to our premium users this
