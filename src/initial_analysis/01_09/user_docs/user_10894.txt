send service over fog easy on the fees and takes way less time the only caveat is that since the service needs to match your deposited amount with someone elses on the network only nice round figures work well for quick transactions as then these coins can be snapped multiply times breaking the chain and leaving no trail fogs maximum his turnaround is not a luxury some people have all the more considering how volatile the btc prices are there like a casino where the house always wins no matter what so any fluctuations between market value from time sent to time received is theirs for the taking besides their prices are outrages if dealt in larger values yes if you are tumbling bitcoin and the fog takes bitcoins that is a large amount to take the upside of course being that you can deposit and take it out in different amounts into different wallets with shared send you can not do it like this to the best of my knowledge the downside though is once you take it out from bitcoin fog it is obvious that it came from bitcoin fog so it seems like the most primal yet expensive way would be to first send from yourself to the fog using shared send then after withdrawing from the fog forward to another address es using shared send again to break the link between the final wallet and shared send which also helps you break up the bitcoin into smaller amounts this can get expensive though . personally i prefer bcis shared send service over fog easy on the fees and takes way less time the only caveat is that since the service needs to match your deposited amount with someone

you completely erase any fingerprint from one blockchain to the next and if you use a more privacy friendly exchange like btc e with a fresh deposit address its simply not possible to even know that the address belongs to an exchange and youve now completely ended the trail because no further analysis is even possible since youve moved entirely off that blockchain so tumbling fog coinjoin shared send but also move into other coins and then tumbling fog coinjoin shared send on those other coins and then move back into bitcoin if when something like zerocoin comes out for real usage and has a
