lsd dmt mushrooms and mescaline are safe no doubt about it there are no downsides unless you trip yourself out and that is your fault not the drugs you vape dmt you do not smoke it so there are not carcinogens present and smoking isnt horrible for you unless you make it a habit obviously some smoke is worse than others ex tobacco vs weed i will now draw from personal experience and opinion to answer your question i enjoy the use of those drugs mentioned above in addition to kratom c b dom al lad lsz mdma and mda the only ones i worry about worry is too strong of a word the only ones i even bother to think about the damage done are mad mdma and c b to a lesser degree mda mdmas toxicity is well document and routes to prevention are known as well there is a guide on this forum that is very good now even if you dont even bother with the guide or supplementing you will almost certainly be fine as long as you dont obviously overdo it to a ridiculous extent with c b you will definitely be fine and you may have problems if you do it very often thats even a maybe something you should also consider is that pretty much any drug isnt really that bad for you unless you become addicted and use it constantly i dont have a problem using mdma mda because to me the tiny if any health effects are well worth the good times i used to be a name on what i put into my body worrying about being perfectly healthy so i completely understand where you are coming from but for me if i enjoy something that is perhaps a little bad for me but not terrible it is worth the enjoyment to me this is not the case with food i firmly believe and live the sentiment that food should never be used as entertainment but for example this past weekend i took some mda and smoked a cigar as i celebrated life with friends sure this isnt good for my health for mental health it probably is actually but its well worth whatever side effects may come to me i think its kind of a waste to die in perfect health but you will die despite being in perfect health you have to embrace your scars that type of thing . as a person who really cares about my nutriotion i eat raw vegan food and trying to do my best for keeping my body rocking and healthy with no success actually these days and trying to minimize the toxics that i let into my body to zero i wonder from times to times about the dangers or damages in drugs using i belive that there are toxics who worth their damage im not drinking coffee im not drinking alcohol im not using deodorant im not taking medicines i even almost to none smoking weed because i hate the smoking action and actually done appreciate weed so much in general but i do take acid cause i believe that the benefits of it defeat the downsides but still as we all know acid is a drug which is effective in the animal amounts but when in thinking about smoking dat freebase sometime in the future which i consider it as a drug which is probably worth the downsides i cant deny the fact that it is involved in smoking a chemical powder that i dont know how its affecting my body same with syntethic mescaline ketamine and mdma which i havent tried yet and actually also with acid who knows how it affects the body acid and shrooms are the only psychedelic that i tried and salvia i want to remind you shulgin died from a liver cancer mckenna from a brain cancer when i think about that like this i come to the conclusion that only the natural drugs are safe to use but maybe in missing something maybe theres a few scientific facts that i dont know in not saying that i wont use these drugs just wondering about it its a conflict would like to read your thoughts about it peace mango . lsd dmt mushrooms and mescaline are safe no doubt about it there are no downsides unless

believe it is good for the mind body to do so i still do it when i trip on lsd and give found that lsd has many benefits health wise first off lsd and other psychedelics have a undulating effect on the nervous system including the nerves that control digestion blood sugar the lymph system lung function blood circulation mineral levels and water retention the effects are not limited to bodily function as a whole there are antiinflammatory effects at the cellar level caused by ht a partial agonism the dox compounds and mdxx also posses these properties and are as potent because of the higher done vs lsd the tryptamines are molecular antioxidants especially dmt psilocybin and their methoxylated relatives in addition to their serotonin agonist properties these medicines can treat headaches alcoholism drug addiction erectile disfumction and other disorders through their direct actions in the body now the psychological effects are the flip side they can lower stress and fear responses or increase them so that they can be overcome the only real downside is had and anxiety from a scarf experience usually these can be overcome in time with more sessions at different dosages settings mdma mda with harm reduction and reasonable dosing are not any more careful than moderately heavy alcohol consumption and because rolls are less frequent there is no real long term damage from quarterly annual consumption serotonin is a relatively non toxic and beneficial compound and it as release is cleansing in some ways because it is not always best to hold it all in storage this

estate of the people a government must rule based upon the consent of the majority and in the restriction of natural law in order to protect property the people who have consented to the majority agree to follow rules established by this polity in order to protect property one must give up a little bit of property in this case their liberty in order to have the protection of their estate the question of legitimacy comes into play when you are giving up more than necessary in order to gain the protection of property of the government another question is that most consent for government is not explicit but rather tacit consent in which our consent is given based upon the fact that we choose to stay under the governments influence rather than leave this is an acceptable assumption in theory but in reality it is nearly impossible for one to related with this said it seems that the idea of tacit consent doesnt hold in real world applications and that we are limited by the bounds of our governments who think theyre doing what is best for the majority based on the inability to revoke our consent in their choosing i hope im not rambling on too much but i do think this is an important philosophical issue . coming from a purely philosophical standpoint based on the beliefs of john locke government exists to protect the property life liberty and estate of the people a

you are not alone while i have never been part of an army many of my friends from school joined up despite some of them not being stable enough for service i think very few people are really cut out for modern warfare some of my family was also in the military and many were lost ill never forget when a nice kid from a farm real white jeans and cowboy hat country boy heck i used to sell dimebags to this dude well he got hit by a mortar in the middle east war is hell the damage caused by war psychologically is not ever really liable you can get over it when you least expect it something will trigger a memory like gunshots helicopters or planes if you are serving in peacetime you can finish your term and get out that is good if you are part of an army that is forced to attack your fellow countrymen or noncombatants maybe think about using your military info to tip off the resistance or leak secrets about operations so that their exercises are futile after all war is a futile exercise in failed diplomacy or not you dont have to serve you always can leave or hide regimes and leaders come and go armies rise and fall you dont have to go down with them if you are patriotic i would try to go into the rreserves or medical service as a pacifist tell them you found g d maybe they will believe you or think you are crazy and discharge you good luck mate . well my brain is probably damaged in irreparable ways from all the scrappy substances that i have invested but i have to tell ya dmt is not gon a do as much damage as the car that just rode down next to you on the road the gasses in the air around us are more topic than dat yeah it is harsh but it is not smoke its vapor everything will be absorbed into your body it will not do damage to the lungs and it has a place in

for a good time i love it a hillbilly jim quote lol classic sorry give no input on the topic presented to us by the op all i can think to say is life itself can be damaging if we try to do to much of anything drugs included be safe be lucky peace . quote from mango on september ami want to remind you shulgin died from a liver cancer mckenna from a brain cancer when i think about that like this i come to the conclusion that only the natural drugs are safe to use but maybe in missing something maybe theres a few scientific facts that i dont know even though shulgin and mckenna died of cancer it can not be used as an argument against using drugs you just dont know if their illness had anything to do with their use of psychoactive chemicals even if you could link their illness to the drug use you would still be left with only two examples not even close to a representative sample therefore this shouldnt be an argument against your drug use intentions if you think only the natural drugs are safe to use your falling somehow for the natural fallacy lets take scopolamine or atropine for example if you dose to high on these natural occurring substances the effects rent very desirable and can possibly lead to death even harmless substances like table salt can have undesirable effects and lead to death even though they are natural from this point of view you could say that everything is poisonous it all depends on the dose just like paracelsus said some hundred years ago i guess if you want the desired effects of chemicals like lsd dmt etc you have to take the downsides of possible negative side effects on your health even more so if you buy them from black markets you never know about the impurities left in the product you are buying anyway just take that into consideration choose a reliable vendor not because he has the best product on the market but because of your peace of mind if you decide to take one of the substances you mention done think about the side effects be completely confident and positive that everything will work out well even though you can not know for sure just try to minimize the risk im afraid i cant give any scientific facts i guess the possible psychological damage from the use of substances like dmt lsd psilocin etc is higher than the actual physical damage one could get in not saying that these psychedelics are overlay careful to your psyche either further id say that scroat said it nicely just try to enjoy the experiences you make to the fullest i mean sunlight is also careful and can cause skin cancer yet i enjoy every walk on a sunny day . quote from mango on september ami want to remind you shulgin died from a liver cancer mckenna from a brain cancer when i think about that like this i come to the conclusion that only

the vendors that were selling in the market what about costumers that were buying over there do they have a reason to worry and what cautious steps there are that you recommend that may help for costumers to be safe peace . you need to ask yourself a few easy questions did you send any potentially identifying information without first encrypting it with pgp did you order from any reported compromise vendors did you order bulk quantities that might suggest you were dealing totally if the answer to both and is no dont worry too much keep looking out for your vendors vanishing though if you answered yes to either or well i would never use that address again but you probably wont face too much repercussions if you were only buying personal amounts it might be a good idea to clean

that you recommend that may help for costumers to be safe peace . you need to ask yourself a few easy questions did you send any potentially identifying information without first encrypting it with pgp did you order from any reported compromise vendors did you order bulk quantities that might suggest you were dealing totally if the answer to both and is no dont worry too much keep looking out for your vendors vanishing though if you answered yes to either or well i would never use that address again but you probably wont face too much repercussions if you were only buying personal amounts it might be a good idea to clean house and lay low for a while anyway if the answer is yes to and either or definitely clean house . thank you m ya mmm so i think i dont have a reason to worry the only thing is that i had conversations with vendors who mentioned my country in our conversation without encryption but nothing besides that ordered only for personal use and it wasnt to my address and who are the reported compromise vendors . thank you m ya mmm so i think i dont have a reason to worry the only thing is that i had conversations with vendors who mentioned my country in our

you become a stooge for an oppressive regime and you will come in the position where you will have to kill imprison people who have done nothing wrong you know of this in advance youre helping the oppressive regime this is morally unjustifiable people who join under duress are just mere victims and we should have compassion for them . i am retired from the u s military and have to say my service was both good and bad i served under some folks whom i would like to stab in the eye with an icy spoon and i served under some whom i consider my family but would give my life for them all if it came down to it i do not know if you live in a country that has conscription or a volunteer army being that my country is a volunteer for military service country i cant really complain because i chose to join up however military service is not for everyone it takes a certain kind of person to want to give up certain rights for the good of the people i have watched my friends and fellow soldiers die in what i consider a valiant but misguided conflict that is supposed to be making the world a safer place for us all but i cant help but think it is really to carry out an agenda that is only benefitting the of the world making it less safe for the little guys in all reallity my country is supposed to be the beacon of freedom for the world but actually it is just as oppressing as the regimes we are sent to destroy i wish you the best and stay true to yourself and those who watch your back because when it comes down to it the soldier to your right and to your left and the ones in front and back of you are all that matter until your obligation is met . i was in the us military as well obviously i cant say too much without doxxing myself but i was deplored to a combat zone youd have heard about on the news i dont regret serving since it taught me a lot of things and revealed strengths i never knew i had but also revealed weaknesses too and revealed to me the overwhelming hopelessness of bureaucracy i left the service with a lot of emotional mental problems having a hard time readjusting ever since i got home i was drinking a lot and generaly feeling hopeless in life couldnt enjoy all my past hobbies and had almost no sense of having a future then some months later i met a friendly wanderer who looked like a orbic jesus we swapped life stories and he safely told me he had something that might help me in my quest to rediscover life he gave me a tiny piece of paper no bigger than my pinkie fingernail told me to try it on a good afternoon and things havent been the same since . wouldnt it be cool if the psychedelic world had its own peacekeepers we would go around the world to conflict areas and embed ourselves with some group and try to defeat the warmongers using non violent means like blowgun darts full of led dose like people in a platoon of militants with my acid and they would wish they had casualties i mean no force can realistically fight if five of the guys need to been tripsitted and are yelling out things they shouldnt maybe just party with both sides on mdma no fuss no fighting all love if you want to see what this would look like the dutch had an irregular brigade aka the happy army in the early s they were just reserves but they had the best hair and beards of any army . wouldn t it be cool if the psychedelic world had
