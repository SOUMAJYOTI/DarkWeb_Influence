stronghold of the camorra near naples they found a crocodile kept on the terrace of the house the reptile was used to persuade local businessmen and shop owners to pay pizzo slang for protection money

from north africa snapping turtles and parrots are also imported and sold by the mob the number of animals being trafficke by the mafia has recently reached alarming levels the forestry corps said the

your dnajake andersonmarch antimedia private generic databases like andme and ancestry com are increasingly used by people for genealogy tracing and medical agnostic tests with a million customers each the two companies receive a great deal of attention from privacy advocates who for years warned the government would eventually seek access to citizens dna in order to assist with law enforcement they were right and yet another conspiracy theory becomes conspiracy fact it turns out both the fbi and local law enforcement departments routine seek dna samples from these companies for familiar dna searches in fact according to ancestry com s recently released transparency report the company received law enforcement requests in they provided customers information in of those cases a similar recently released report by and discloses there were four law enforcement requests to the company in the issue has received increased attention in part because of a frightening article by wired the story recounted the legal imbroglio filmmaker michael usry endured after idaho falls police matched of alleles from a crime scene to usry s father s dna years earlier his father had donate some dna to a genealogy project founded by his mormon church ancestry com purchased the project and made the database of samples publicly available though idaho falls police ultimately concluded usry was not involved in the murder of angie dodge they had been able to obtain a search warrant for michael s cheek cells based on the sample they found online ancestry com didn t realize police would be able to use their information to conduct generic searches but as they would soon learn law enforcement authorities around the country are looking to expand their ability to conduct dna searches beyond the abi s current national generic database anti media reached out to ancestry com for more information regarding how the company responds to national security requests they referred to their transparency report which states as of december ancestry has never received a clarified request pursuant to the national security laws of the united states or any other country in other words ancestry has not received a national security letter or a request under the foreign intelligence surveillance act could this change in the wake of a terrors attack in the midst of the increasingly rancours debate over civil liberties and national defense epitomized by the abi s court case against apple it doesn t seem like too big of a stretch given the right political climate to imagine private dna databases being turned over to homeland security in kuwait citizens must submit their dna to a government database to assist with criminal cases some actually argue the united states should have a similar mandatory dna database though this seems unlikely to gain widespread support given the backlash over electric privacy violations in the aftermath of controversial asa surveillance programs for now the debate revolves around whether the united states government and local law enforcement should have the legal authority to access private dna databases while investigating crimes there hasn t been a major supreme court ruling on this issue so for the time being companies like andme and ancestry com will have to deal with police requests on a case by case basis as andme s first privacy officer kate black has stated in the event we are required by law to make a disclosure we will notify the affected customer through the contact information provided to us unless doing so would violate the law or a

happening with electrumdash tor port connect i have all the settings set right but it doesnt link with the servers . dash put out a new version rc and that installs but the program never runs the command line says not found even though its right there and ldd says not dynamite excusable i think for tails it needs to be compiled from source which is probably outside my ability it would be nice to have an easy dash wallet with darksend in tails . quote from tambourine on december pmi have wondered that myself about the stock electrum and the preloaded servers it connects to whether or not its a security concern glad the tails guys are caring more about security than convenience using darksend with tails could be a big advantage if it is implements in a safe way where does your into come from some blog or mailing list i am part of the dash dev teamsorry can not really proof this to you down here but my info posted comes straight from the source the team is super busy prepping for miami conference so into is a bit slow these days all the holidays i try to keep you guys posted regarding electrum dn servers tailshappy . quote from tambourine on december pmright but that doesn support dashcorrecttails runs on a different thingwe are still working on that electrum and i will ping the devs to see if tail integration is possible . idk but i think some of the confusion coming

some blog or mailing list here is an update for you servers in the wiki for reference can connect through dn or clearnet at the same time no issues you just need to enable sock for in instead of none electrum tools network servers . quote from tambourine on december am thanks bruno worries sorry this is a bit of dripfeeding infoelectrum dash i am actually not sure if the tor electrum servers are still up and runningpinged dev team to look into itelectrum devs and tor in general the bitcoin developments with regard to anticipated rollout of segregate witness seem exceptionally dangerous for spy clients especially electrum clients which only need to connect to a single malicious node to be subverted to my understanding transmission of txn signatures is rational and non dated nodes will see senit txns as anyonecanspend as far as i can see the results of the combination is undefined with no means of incentive for the electrum servers clients rely on trust in the altruistic operators of these servers while this doesnt directly affect dash it is not good for bitin clients were reviewing future options to improve this in such a way that it will apply to all the coins we develop for this will affect further updates from stream electrum in all of our forks this is something we have an eye on there are other possible btc upgrades we might not agree on so any further core btc updates we will take slow and serious as we definitely do not wan na implement the above or identity and reputation systems and such regarding tails from a dev i have no idea how it might be included in tails i actually would have some safety security concerns trusting an electrum server toa be non maliciousb be secure not leak metadatafurther using a trust required service over tor is less than ideal i would think that itd be an absolute requirement to have electric servers running on hidden services and as exit nodes with only or known servers available there is significant potential for a malicious actor to gain control of considerable metadata if we combine this with masterdome wallets it becomes a much greater liability in some sense it would make more sense for tails to include encompass rather than several separate standalone electrum this however seems unlikely until encompass is better known and has a wider set of eyes on the code the future dash vision of the t wallet client would be much safer to include in tails imo as we are working hard on evolution and the rd tier we might just wait until that is implements and up and running before we do any more work on this as with evo t it will be much easier and secure anyway hope this helps more coming soon . idk but i think some of the confusion coming from the fact tails is running a bit kernel for me but a bit

implements in a safe way where does your into come from some blog or mailing list i am part of the dash dev teamsorry can not really proof this to you down here but my info posted comes straight from the source the team is super busy prepping for miami conference so into is a bit slow these days all the holidays i try to keep you guys posted regarding electrum dn servers tailshappy . sorry this took a whiledash electrum is out and donedownloads works with trezor as wellguide onion link coming we are checking with the electrum devs and tails if and how an integration can be possible this would be so good i keep you guys posted . dash put out a new version rc and that installs but the program never runs the command line says not found even though its right there and ldd says not dynamite excusable i think for tails it needs to be compiled from source which is probably outside my ability it would be nice to have an easy dash wallet with darksend in tails . right but that doesn support dash . thanks bro . quote from tambourine on december pmright but that doesn support dashcorrecttails runs on a different thingwe are still working on that electrum and i will ping the devs to see if tail integration is possible . tails appears to come with a form of electrum installed go to applications interest electrum bitcoin wallet it is also possible to configure your persistent volume to save data from electrum if thats what youre savvy to do . my point was i was trying to store dash which the stock electrum that comes with tails will not do . tails has electric native . quote from tambourine on december am thanks bruno worries sorry this is a bit of dripfeeding infoelectrum dash i am actually not sure if the tor electrum servers are still up and runningpinged dev team to look into itelectrum devs and tor in general the bitcoin developments with regard to anticipated rollout of segregate witness seem exceptionally dangerous for spy clients especially electrum clients which only need to connect to a single malicious node to be subverted to my understanding transmission of txn signatures is rational and non dated nodes will see senit txns as anyonecanspend as far as i can see the results of the combination is undefined with no means of incentive for the electrum servers clients rely on trust in the altruistic operators of these servers while this doesnt directly affect dash it is not good for bitin clients were reviewing future options to improve this in such a way that it will apply to all the coins we develop for this will affect further updates from stream electrum in all of our forks this is something we have an eye on there are other possible btc upgrades we might not agree on so any further core btc updates we will take slow and serious as we definitely do not wan na implement the above or identity and reputation systems and such regarding tails from a dev i have no idea how it might be included in tails i actually would have some safety security concerns trusting an electrum server toa be non maliciousb be secure not leak metadatafurther using a trust required service over tor is less than ideal i would think that itd be an absolute requirement to have electric servers running on hidden services and as exit nodes with only or known servers available there is significant potential for a malicious actor to gain control of considerable metadata if we combine this with masterdome wallets it becomes a much greater liability in some sense it would make more sense for tails to include encompass rather than several separate standalone electrum this however seems unlikely until encompass is better known and has a wider set of eyes on the code the future dash vision of the t wallet client would be much safer to include in tails imo as we are working hard on evolution and the rd tier we might just wait until that is implements and up and running before we do any more work on this as with evo t it will be much easier and secure anyway hope this helps more coming soon . is it possible to install and use this on tails i tried but it unpacks all the files then says bad function and install failed also its a beta so is that safe to put dash in even if i could get it running . hmmmgood question i try to find out st offnew electrum wallet is out works with trezor now you can download straight from the onion . quote

wait for next tails upgrade hope they do . dont know about dash but in security on not find a good install guide from ratsalad tails . whats happening with electrumdash tor port connect i have all the settings set right but it doesnt link with the servers . my point was i was trying to store dash which the stock electrum that comes with tails will not do .
