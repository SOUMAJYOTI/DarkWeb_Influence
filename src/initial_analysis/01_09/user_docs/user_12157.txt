links in the chain same with dogecoin btc is there really much difference between that and a single encrusted electrum seed one not tied to identity with the only link being the coins you sent it from coinbase i mean if they can accurately annalyze and trace the tumbled coin wouldnt that be just as easy as analizing the multiply wallet hops and crypts exchange an encrusted cold wallet that cant be linked to you should just break the chain right you could have multiple encrusted wallets and hop between them too besides if youre already under investigation its usually not the blockchain that fucks you the reason you go from a service like coinbase cold mix dnm is to surrogate the initials withdrawl avoiding some red flags while covering your tracks a bit then further cutting ties by mixing getting investigated means you most likely screwed up somewhere else that isnt to say you shouldn use cold storage mix hop etc when using a etc service tied to your real identity again i dont use services like coinbase so i may be speaking nonsense here enlighten me a little if you can regards lucythis my thinking as well i dont see the point in multiply wallet hops before mixing because anybody who understands the blockchain can easily trace those hops to a mixer also i have seen people claiming their coinbase account got closed after going from coinbase multiply wallet hops dnm skipping mixing entirely so that tells me multiply hops is futile now cold storage might be a better idea but i dont know regardless i will be using an electric wallet before helix from now on . thanks for your reply why a local wallet as opposed to an online wallet isnt it easy to see just one hop from my coinbase account to a wallet then to a mixer anyways if not coinbase then what else i never liked the idea of lbc . give been seeing quite a few people saying coinbase has closed their accounts for sending bitcoins directly to a dnm ive also heard people claim that they close accounts for directly sending to a tumbler for over a year ive been buying coins from coinbase with my bank account then sending directly to helix specifically then to a dnm afterwards i only buy personal use amounts btw is there a better way to be doing it i mean helix isnt a traditional mixer because they supposed replace your coins with new ones as opposed to mixing transactions in worried the extra work coinbase is putting into cracking down on illegal activity could cause me to lose my account because damn its convenient as fucking hell this way . coinbase has been diming people out for years but if thats your only option go coinbase local wallet mixer market but seriously done use coinbase or circle . correct me if in wrong here which is quite possible since i do not use services like coinbase gaining the wallet information is done via blockchain analysis if investigated an analysis of the blockchain can link your coinbase wallet and any receiving wallets including your dnm and mixed wallets simply put its linking your btc purchases to dnm activity and may be used against you during investigation having an office cold storage wallet like electrum that only you have access to adds an extra link in the chain gaining access to this wallet is completely remnant on how you choose to store it like a flash drive that you can hide and dispose of if needed if youre running tails and use electrum the wallets seed can be written down then stashed away you could even pgp encrypt the seed with a heavily password key and then store the encrusted message on paper or a separate encrusted drive from your cold wallet youd move the coin to a mixing service like helix which provides a variety options to choose from like random delayed withrawl each link you add to the chain the harder its going to be to analyze however if a serious blockchain analysis does in fact occur they can only get as far as the cold wallet which at this point if you left no ties between you and said cold wallet by properly hiding encrypting destroying it they be left with little to no evidence linking it back to you not sure how out dated this method is an interesting read regardless you havent tried it already lbc is the best way to obtain coin for coinbase coinbase cold wallet mixer dnm mixer rational cold wallet dirty wallet regards lucy . thanks for your reply why a local wallet as

so much less that it is worth it well i simply done want to involve anybody else in my transactions because the less people the better the idea of meeting with people all the time to buy coin stresses me out plus its also the more expensive more complicated aspect of it i regularly do research on a weekly basis to better my opsec but at the same time im trying to strike a balance between open and convenience if i were vending i wouldnt give a fuck about convenience though . you get the best prices on the exchanges i done trust someone online to hold my wallet markets included keep all cash in local wallet then send to mixer market when you need to buy . quote from memento vivere on september ami can not as i do not use coinbase to get bitcoins i was merely repeating what i was told i
