scammers will always exist plain and simple no matter how hard we all try to bust them down their presence will always remain you will find them on forums their own websites and throughout all major and established dark markets now that we all have accepted this sad issue lets discuss the many methods to help prevent you from falling into this trap first and foremost the number one rule when doing business on the deep web is to always trust your instinct in sure all of you heard this old saying before if its too good to be true it probably is i know its very cliche but it still holds a lot of merit most swam victims fail to follow this quote and go with their impulses instead they see a product or deal at a astounding price that they dont think of anything else but having the items in their hands its like being hypnotized in a sense dont worry im not talking down on anyone its human nature to follow with impulses just remember that next time you see an amazing deal think it through and see if this can be realistic now that we covered the golden rule im now going to discuss the different types of scam methods that are present thought the deep web please post if i left anything out or if you have any questions or comments the hidden wiki thw thw is probably one of the oldest sites still in existance on tor it is more then likely one of the first sites many people new to tor visit it can be quite an amazing discovery seeing all the different businesses selling drugs weapons fraud items stolen electronics etc for a lack of words its really gamesome to see that you now have access to pretty much anything you want when you didnt prior to setting up tor now the problem here is that thw can be moderated by pretty much anyone who has registered an account some of the nefarious hidden wiki staff are very aware of the many new comers to th deep web this is why it is safe to that just about every commercial site on thw are seams plan and simple even legitimate and well known markets featured on thw are more then likely phishing sites set up to steal your account information long story short avoid the hidden wiki when searching for market links example of phishing site for sr do not login best way to tell is that the url is obviously the wrong one if you need a link to a market site visit the subreddit darknetmarkets or the deep dot web these sites provide legitimate market links that are never altered if anyone knows of any other sites new comers can use to find let links please toss them up non market commercial sitesjust like the ones listed on thw pretty much all of the small sites that sell products and services are all pretty much scams the only exception are sites that operated by established market vendors who are well recognized and can be verified with their pgp if anyone needs help verifying someones pgp you are more then welcome to message me and ill be glad to help plus there are a few sites that catalog vendor pgps and offer verification as well ill show you some examples of sites and how to tell the are rippers green notes counter is a site that sells counterfeit coins sadly they do not accept escrow and give the typical scammer reason that they do not trust escrow sites but for some ill logic reason its okay to trust them lol year right double your btc is a site that promises to return to you the double amount of btc you send them lets think about this who on earth will give you free money no one thats who if they have such a wonderful method on doubling bitcoin then why would they share it and not just keep it themselves to get rich well actually they do have a method for getting rich its by stealing others coin carders paradise wow a site that sells closed debit cards with a pin so that you can just easily walk to any atm and cash it out just like with the double your etc service who in their right mind would give away free money why couldnt they just keep the cards and cash them out themselves these are the question you have to ask and the true simple answer is that they dont have any cards they just want your coin and bolt peoples drug store another rip off site that offers no escrow protection and just wants steal from you same with the other mentioned sites they state that once payment is received they will mail you the shipping information i hate to say it but you will be waiting a long time for that info important keep and eye out with other sites using the same format they are hasted by a pseudo organization called torshops avoid all of their sites at all costs iphones for just gon na say it all of these electric stores are seams never have i seen a let ones either they feed you a line of shit on why they dont crow and there are ones that offer a fake escrow service the sites with escrow accepted will usually send you a link to a site you probably never heard of and ask you do depoist money and simply release it when you get your item sadly the electric site most likely owns that escrow site and will just take the btc and avoid your emails i wont go into a lot of detail but the self operated sites that sell guns and offer hitman services they are all scams plain and simple the solution is to just stick to the established markets and use their escrow system remember escrow is the main line of defense that protects you from losing your coin always use it scammers on commercial marketsthis section will cover how to spot and deal with rippers that use established markets to host their swam some of them demand fe on everything others will appear to have upstanding feedback and there are even some that offer escrow too crazy i know so here are the ways to spot them and some tactics they use to steal your coins the first and easy ones to spot are the brand new vendors to a site with no reputation and off the bat request fe they either sell a great variety of different products red flag at great price hoping to grab as many customers as possible or they have a few big and expensive products and wait until someone takes the bait when you spot these people question them on why they dont accept escrow the most common replies scammers give are they done trust escrow or btc is too unpredictable whatever excuse they give you just walk away i know thats a killer deal they offer but wouldnt you rather be at peace of mind there are plenty of let vendors that accept escrow done risk it and go with them i forgot to mention always check their feedback and the forums to find any reviews the vendor may have this will give you better assurance whether or not to deal with the vendor a lot of the time you will find scammers with amazing feedback how could this be well they use the tactic called feedback stacking this is when a scammer registers numerous buyer accounts and buy from themselves and leave amazing feedback here is what to look for when spotting padded feedback numerous complete orders on the same day price is extremely low or item was delete same username or same comments are used over and over again example if you have pandora login and check out this sellers profile note this is not an attack on pandora it was just an example i found these are found on every market sorry pandora all the way down and look at the feedback long way down sellers way of hiding it loot at that this is probably the most obvious padded feedback ever seen some are more clever then that but they always slip up by showing a pattern youll notice it when you come across it when you order from a vendor and the item is in crow make sure you note the shipping time a lot of rippers will set a short shipping time hoping that you wont notice so that the order will auto finalize just remember when funds are released whether after feing or the order auto finalized the first thing that vendor will do is quickly withdraw the coin to their wallet it is now out of the staffs hands to recover your money one final note be careful when posting in the wanted or buyer request section of a markets forum this is where a lot of rip offs occur you may get plenty of pms from people who arent even a vendor saying they can help you out just remember to tell them hell no and wait for a verified vendor to reply because you know whats gon na if you decide to follow through with that pm offer well this is what i got so far pretty long winded i know please feel free to ask question or toss in any extra info i forgot to discuss stay safe out there everyone and remember that golden rule if its too good to be true it probably is .

pretty much anyone who has registered an account some of the nefarious hidden wiki staff are very aware of the many new comers to th deep web this is why it is safe to that just about every commercial site on thw are seams plan and simple even legitimate and well known markets featured on thw are more then likely phishing sites set up to steal your account information long story short avoid the hidden wiki when searching for market links example of phishing site for sr do not login best way to tell is that the url is obviously the wrong one if you need a link to a market site visit the subreddit darknetmarkets or the deep dot web these sites provide legitimate market links that are never altered if anyone knows of any other sites new comers can use to find let links please toss them up non market commercial sitesjust like the ones listed on thw pretty much all of the small sites that sell products and services are all pretty much scams the only exception are sites that operated by established market vendors who are well recognized and can be verified with their pgp if anyone needs help verifying someones pgp you are more then welcome to message me and ill be glad to help plus there are a few sites that catalog vendor pgps and offer verification as well ill show you some examples of sites and how to tell the are rippers green notes counter is a site that sells counterfeit coins sadly they do not accept escrow and give the typical scammer reason that they do not trust escrow sites but for some ill logic reason its okay to trust them lol year right double your btc is a site that promises to return to you the double amount of btc you send them lets think about this who on earth will give you free money no one thats who if they have such a wonderful method on doubling bitcoin then why would they share it and not just keep it themselves to get rich well actually they do have a method for getting rich its by stealing others coin carders paradise wow a site that sells closed debit cards with a pin so that you can just easily walk to any atm and cash it out just like with the double your etc service who in their right mind would give away free money why couldnt they just keep the cards and cash them out themselves these are the question you have to ask and the true simple answer is that they dont have any cards they just want your coin and bolt peoples drug store another rip off site that offers no escrow protection and just wants steal from you same with the other mentioned sites they state that once payment is received they will mail you the shipping information i hate to say it but you will be waiting a long time for that info important keep and eye out with other sites using the same format they are hasted by a pseudo organization called torshops avoid all of their sites at all costs iphones for just gon na say it all of these electric stores are seams never have i seen a let ones either they feed you a line of shit on why they dont crow and there are ones that offer a fake escrow service the sites with escrow accepted will usually send you a link to a site you probably never heard of and ask you do depoist money and simply release it when you get your item sadly the electric site most likely owns that escrow site and will just take the btc and avoid your emails i wont go into a lot of detail but the self operated sites that sell guns and offer hitman services they are all scams plain and simple the solution is to just stick to the established markets and use their escrow system remember escrow is the main line of defense that protects you from losing your coin always use it scammers on commercial marketsthis section will cover how to spot and deal with rippers that use established markets to host their swam some of them demand fe on everything others will appear to have upstanding feedback and there are even some that offer escrow too crazy i know so here are the ways to spot them and some tactics they use to steal your coins the first and easy ones to spot are the brand new vendors to a site with no reputation and off the bat request fe they either sell a great variety of different products red flag at great price hoping to grab as many customers as possible or they have a few big and expensive products and wait until someone takes the bait when you spot these people question them on why they dont accept escrow the most common replies scammers give are they done trust escrow or btc is too unpredictable whatever excuse they give you just walk away i know thats a killer deal they offer but wouldnt you rather be at peace of mind there are plenty of let vendors that accept escrow done risk it and go with them i forgot to mention always check their feedback and the forums to find any reviews the vendor may have this will give you better assurance whether or not to deal with the vendor a lot of the time you will find scammers with amazing feedback how could this be well they use the tactic called feedback stacking this is when a scammer registers numerous buyer accounts and buy from themselves and leave amazing feedback here is what to look for when spotting padded feedback numerous complete orders on the same day price is extremely low or item was delete same username or same comments are used over and over again example if you have pandora login and check out this sellers profile note this is not an attack on pandora it was just an example i found these are found on every market sorry pandora all the way down and look at the feedback long way down sellers way of hiding it loot at that this is probably the most obvious padded feedback ever seen some are more clever then that but they always slip up by showing a pattern youll notice it when you come across it when you order from a vendor and the item is in crow make sure you note the shipping time a lot of rippers will set a short shipping time hoping that you wont notice so that the order will auto finalize just remember when funds are released whether after feing or the order auto finalized the first thing that vendor will do is quickly withdraw the coin to their wallet it is now out of the staffs hands to recover your money one final note be careful when posting in the wanted or buyer request section of a markets forum this is where a lot of rip offs occur you may get plenty of pms from people who arent even a vendor saying they can help you out just remember to tell them hell no and wait for a verified vendor to reply because you know whats gon na if you decide to follow through with that pm offer well this is what i got so far pretty long winded i know please feel free to ask question or toss in any extra info i forgot to discuss stay safe out there everyone and remember that golden rule if its too good to be true it probably is . during my years on tor i have seen countless scam attempts and many sad faces of those who were ripped off lets face it here in the deep web scammers will always exist plain and simple no matter how hard we all try to bust them down their presence will always remain you will find them on forums their own websites and throughout all major and established dark markets now that we all have accepted this sad issue lets discuss the many methods to help prevent you from falling into this trap first and foremost the number one rule when doing business on the deep web is to always trust your instinct in sure all of you heard this old saying before if its too good to be true it probably is i know its very cliche but it still holds a lot of merit most swam victims fail to follow this quote and go with their impulses instead they see a product or deal at a astounding price that they dont think of anything else but having the items in their hands its like being hypnotized in a sense dont worry im not talking down on anyone its human nature to follow with impulses just remember that next time you see an amazing deal think it through and see if this can be realistic now that we covered the golden rule im now going to discuss the different types of scam methods that are present thought the deep web please post if i left anything out or if you have any questions or comments the hidden wiki thw thw is probably one of the oldest sites still in existance on tor it is more then likely one of the first sites many people new to tor visit it can be quite an amazing discovery seeing all the different businesses selling drugs weapons fraud items stolen electronics etc for a lack of words its

sympathize for all the hard work and business management they must go through albeit these instances are less common they still do happen and pretty much any vendor whose been in the game long is more than likely to have any of the following occur buyer disputes order stating that it is not what they expected or item did not arrive even though it didas i stated there are far more gamesome and honest buyers than bad apples but sadly it does happen mainly with either low lifes or kids thinking they can pull a fast one i can not stress this enough when creating a new listing be sure to give as much detail as possible this will prevent any confusion and if a dispute occurs you can refer the buyer and staff telling them that sold product is in accordance with the description plus when you have customers before them saying they were satisfied with the item received you will have much higher chances winning a dispute when a buyer claim the package is a no show make sure you do either of the following to prevent this place tracking on all of your items that you ship for security try not to give it out unless it is necessary this is great proof to show staff that you did indeed ship out the item if you do not use tracking make sure it is known in your profile that this is the case and you can not give refunds on lost packages it would be to the buyers discretion whether or not to order buyer threatens to leave negative feedback unless given a refundive actually had this happen to me this was a plain and simple case that he was looking for free stuff and wanted to be an ass and go this route it really frustrated me because i was very nice and polite to the dude and he decided to pull this shit on me well i handled it in a professional manner and backed off this is what i did and what you can do too in this situation i rascally called his bluff i explained to him that i have customers before him which is true buy the same product and every single one of them was completely satisfied given that information i told him that i wasnt going to give him a refund and to go ahead and leave the negative feedback if you wish if he had left the negative feedback i wouldve retorted that this customer was just a troll looking for free stuff and given my positive track record with this item i did not feel a refund with in order he never did leave the feedback and released the escrow which im happy also depending on your market staff will remove negative feedback if it was justified just report to staff and see what they say i actually know a vendor who was in the same situation he actually refunded the buyer and the asshole buyer still left negative feedback man did that vendor throw a fit thankfully the staff took care of it competitor attacksoccasionally who will have a ethical and disgruntled vendor that is jealous of your booming business and wants to do something to sabotage it a lot of the times they will make multiply buyer accounts buy the cheapest product you sell and then turn around and either call you a scammer or the product and service was bad if you are a victim of this report it to the staff and your customers as soon as possible let them all know about the situation and given your track record they will be understanding most customers can determine if you have either a troll or competitor attacking you and will not think bad of you with the given false feedback often staff will recognize the attack and ban the shill accounts and remove the feedback its sad to see vendors sink that low to do such an attack trolls disgruntled customersoften times you will come across these when when discussing products and prices about your product what generally happens is that youll get a buyer that is not happy with your price and then offers some low ball figure or you can have buyers that want a freebie tossed their way you tell them no and the price stands as is most are understanding of this while you do have some that act like children and throw a temper tantrum because they can not get their way they end up going to the forums and posting false statements calling you a scammer and that your service is terrible elah blah blah to handle this just politely and professionally explain the situation that you never even done business with this clown and how on earth could you be a scammer when no coin was exchanged also explain that their behavior is ridiculous and just wanted something cheap or free then everybody will realize what an ass this buyer just made of themselves and will easily join your side on this

scammer when no coin was exchanged also explain that their behavior is ridiculous and just wanted something cheap or free then everybody will realize what an ass this buyer just made of themselves and will easily join your side on this situation well thats all i have for right now if any vendor would like to add on and share any of their experiences i would love to hear them thanks for reading and

time i am need and am always a fan of useful guides i am happy to share with you my collection ill keep posting as i find them on my computer and when i have time if you have any please toss them in ill try my best to reference them if i can remember encrypting your hard drive with truecryptwritten by vertu owner of evolution market introductionif you save anything on your computer it is likely that you do not want just anyone to be able to see what you have saved you want a way to protect that information so that you can access it and absolutely no one else except those you trust therefore it makes sense to set up a system which protects your information and safeguards it against prying eyes the best such system for this is called true crypt true crypt is an encryption software program which allows you to store many files and directories inside of a single file on your harddrive further this file is encrusted and no one can actually see what you have saved there unless they know your password this sounds extremely high tech but it is actually very easy to set up setting up truecryptquote go to or go to www truecrypt org and click on downloads under latest stable version under windows vista up click download the file will be called true crypt setup a exe or something similar run this file if prompted that a program needs your permission to continue click continue check i accept and agree to be bound by these license terms click accept ensure that install is selected and click next click install you will see a dialog stating truecrypt has been successfully installed click ok click no when asked if you wish to view the tutorial user s guide click finish at this point truecrypt is now installed now we will set up truecrypt so that we can begin using it to store sensitive information quote click the windows logo start button on the lower left corner of your screen click all programs click truecrypt click the truecrypt applicationand now we can begin quote click the button create volume ensuring that create an encrusted file container is selected click next select hidden truecrypt volume and click next ensuring that normal mode is selected click next click on select file note which directory you are in on your computer look at the top of the dialog that has opened and you will see the path you are in most likely the home directory for your username an input box is provided with a flashing cursor asking you to type in a file name here you will type in the following filename random txt you may of course replace random txt with anything you like this file is going to be created and will be used to store many other files inside do not use a filename for a file that already exists the idea here is that you are creating an entirely new file it is also recommended though not required that you hide this file somewhere less obvious if it is in your home directory then someone who has access to your computer may find it easier you can also choose to put this file on any other media it doesn t have to be your hard disk you could for example save your truecrypt file to a us flash drive an s card or some other media it is up to you quote once you have type in the file name click save make sure never save history is checked click next on the outer volume screen click next again the default encryption algorithm and hash algorithm are fine click next choose a file size in order to benefit the most from this guide you should have at least gigabytes of free disk space if not then it is worth it for you to purchase some form of media such as a removal harddrive a large s card etc in order to proceed truecrypt can be used on all forms of digital media not just your hard disk if you choose to proceed without obtaining at least ten gigabytes of disk space then select a size that you are comfortable with such as mb really you want to choose enough space to work with i recommend gb at least remember that if you do need more space later you can always create additional truecrypt volumes using exactly these same steps quote now you are prompted for a password this is very important read this carefullyread this section carefullythe password you choose here is a decoy password that means this is the password you would give to someone under duress suppose that someone suspects that you were accessing sensitive information and they threaten to beat you or worse if you do not reveal the password this is the password that you give to them when you give someone this password it will be nearly impossible for them to prove that it is not the right password further they can not even know that there is a second password here are some tips for your password a choose a password you will never forget it may be ten years from now that you need it make it simple like your birthday repeated three times b make sure it seems reasonable that it appears to be a real password if the password is something stupid like then they may not believe you c remember that this is a password that you would give to someone if forced it is not your actual password d do not make this password too similar to what you plan to really use you do not want someone to guess your main password from this one and with all of this in mind choose your password when you have type it in twice click next quote large files here you are asked whether or not you plan to store files larger than gigabytes choose no and click next outer volume format here you will notice some random numbers and letters next to where it says random pool go ahead and move your mouse around for bit this will increase the randomness and give you better encryption after about ten seconds of this click format depending on the file size you selected it will take some time to finish formatting what is happening truecrypt is creating the file you asked it to such as random txt it is building a file system contained entirely within that one file this file system can be used to store files directories and more further it is encrypting this file system in such a way that without the right password it will be impossible for anyone to access it to anyone other than you this file will appear to be just a mess of random characters no one will even know that it is a truecrypt volume quote outer volume contents click on the button called open outer volume an empty folder has opened up this is empty because you have yet to put any files into your truecrypt volume do not put any sensitive content herethis is the decoy this is what someone would see if you gave them the password you used in the previous step this is not where you are going to store your sensitive data if you have been forced into a situation where you had to reveal your password to some individual then that individual will see whatever is in this folder you need to have data in this folder that appears to be sensitive enough to be protected by truecrypt in order to fool them here are some important tips to keep in mind a do not use born adult models can sometimes appear to be underrated and this can cause you to incriminate yourself unintentionally b do not use drawings renderings writings of porn in many jurisdictions these are just as illegal as photographs c good choices for what to put here include backups of documents email financial documents etc d once you have placed files into this folder never place any more files in the future doing so may damage your hidden content generally you want to store innocent data where some individual looking at it would find no cause against you and yet at the same time they would understand why you used truecrypt to secure that data now go ahead and find files and store them in this folder be sure that you leave at least ten gigabytes free the more the better when you are all done copying files into this folder close the folder by clicking the x in the top right corner quote click next if prompted that a program needs your permission to continue click continue hidden volume click next the default encryption and hash algorithms are fine click next hidden volume size the maximum available space is indicated in bold below the text box round down to the nearest full unit for example if gbis available select gb if gb are available select gb if a warning dialog comes up asking are you sure you wish to continue select yes hidden volume password important read thishere you are going to select the real password this is the password you will never reveal to anyone else under any circumstances only you will know it no one will be able to figure it out or even know that there is a second password be aware that an individual intent on obtaining your sensitive information may lie to you and claim to be able to figure this out they can not it is highly recommended that you choose a character password here if it is difficult to remember a character password choose an character password and simply repeat it times a date naturally has exactly numbers and a significant date in your life repeated times would do just fine quote type in your password twice and click next large files select yes and click next hidden volume format as before move your mouse around for about ten seconds random and tehn click format if prompted a program needs your permission to continue select continue a dialog will come up telling you that the hidden truecrypt volume has been successfully created click ok click exit congratulations you have just set up an encrusted file container on your hard drive anything you store here will be inaccessible to anyone except you further you have protected this content with two passwords one that you will give to someone under threat and one that only you will know keep your real password well protected and never write it down or give it to anyone else for any reason now we should test both passwords testing truecrypt volumesonce you have completed the above section you will be back at truecrypt go ahead and follow these steps to test the volumes you have made quote click select file locate the file you created in the last section most likely called random txt or something similar remember that even though there is both an outer anda hidden volume both volumes are contained in a single file there are not two files only one click open choose a drive letter that you are not using anything past m is probably just fine click on that for example click on o to highlight it click mount now you are prompted for a password read the below carefully the password you provide here will determine which volume is mounted to the drive letter you specified if you type in your decoy password then o will show all the files and directories you copied that you would reveal if forced if you type in your real password then o will show the files and directories that you never intend anyone to see after successfully typing in your password you will see additional detail to the right of the drive letter including the full path to the file you selected as well as the kind of volume it is for example hidden right click on your windows logo start menu icon and scroll down to the bottom where you can see your different drive letters you will see the drive letter you selected for example local disk o click on that if you selected your decoy password you will see all the files and folders that you moved there during the installation phase if you selected the real password you will see whatever files and directories you have placed so far into the hidden volume if any if you selected your hidden volume password you may now begin moving any sensitive information you wish be aware that simply moving it from your main hard disk is not enough we will discuss how to ensure delete data is actually delete later in the guide what is happening when you select a file and mount it to a drive you are telling your computer that you have a new drive with files and folders on it it is the same thing as if you had plugged in a us flash drive a removal harddrive or an s card into your computer truecrypt causes your computer to think that there is an entirely new disk drive on your computer you can use this disk drive just as if it was actually a us flash drive you can copy files to it directories and use it just as you would use a us flash drive when you are done simply close all open windows folders applications that are using your truecrypt drive letter and then click dismount from within truecrypt while you have the drive letter highlighted this will once again hide all of this data accessible only by re mounting it with the correct password very important safety informationwhen a true crypt hidden volume is mounted someone who has access to your computer can access anything that is inside that hidden volume if for example you left your computer running while a truecrypt volume was mounted then if someone gained access to your computer they would be able to see everything you have in that volume therefore always remember to dismount any truecrypt volume containing any sensitive information when you are not using your computeryou can tell that it is dismounted because the drive letter inside of truecrypt s control panel will appear the same as all of the other drive letters with no information to the right of the drive letter you should practice mounting and dismounting a few times with both passwords to make sure you understand this process once you have copied files folders into the hidden volume do not touch the files or folders in the outer volume anymore remember that both volumes occupy the same single file and therefore changing the outer volume can damage the hidden volume once you have copied files folders into the outer volume during the installation process that is the last time you should do so from that point forward use only the hidden volume the outer volume exists only as a decoy if you need it . stealth that works ditch the pe food grade vac seaport by sierraromeo which i believe he got off the sr forum boogie wake up call food grade pe vac sealing is vapor peaceable and detestable in fifteen minutes please note that the vendors listed below are done so solely on their use of non peaceable stealth packaging techniques as advised by the vendor no other factors have been considered at this time so you are strongly encouraged to fully research any vendor before placing an order tba how is mail sorted when planning your packaging take into consideration this procedure which is not specific to a particular country only applies for letters not parcels mail arrives into said country in a big sack containing hundreds thousands of letters if arriving from a flagged country its directed to sorting area a in which mail undergoes extra scrutiny if from non flagged country its directed to sorting area b for normal manual sorting at the designated sorting area all the mail is poured onto a sorting tray and mutually sorted with the sorter removing anything thats oversize damaged or suspicious looking again there would be guidelines the sorters follow based on profiling and gathered intelligence over sized items are sent to the parcel area damaged items are repaired or destroyed and suspicious letters are suspected further manual x ray or dog once manual sorting is done the mail is sent down a conveyor belt to the automatic sorting machine while going down the conveyor belt a drug detection dog runs over all mail heading down and alerts to letters containing whatever the dog is trained to find these are in turn removed for further inspection manual or x ray the rest carry on to the machine and are sent for distribution around the country any mail that cant be automatically sorted for distribution usually due to addresses in the wrong formal hand written easily too thick to fit etc are mutually sorted again so using the above information one case see that the risk areas are the country of origin the initials manual sorter the drug detection dog and the final automatic sorting machine country of origin the intelligence on which particular countries the receiving country has flagged isnt made publicly available but one could assume they include the netherlands belgium colombia bolivia peru china vietnam thailand among others as well as countries added based on intelligence received and profiling initials mail sorter has to mutually sort hundreds of letters at once so make sure your letter doesnt attract a second glimpse ensure you use a high quality envelope not a cheap one thats thin and soft and likely to tear ensure it looks harmless and boring from the outside and ensure its as thin as possible and packaged so the contents can not be felt if handled and so that if handled it feels like paper inside not a foil bag drug detection dog use moisture barrier bags pe and foil altered are the best followed by pe and mylar you should be doing your packaging in a clean environment because if any molecules from your product end up on the outside of that bag or on the envelope you wasted your time and it will be detected final automatic sorting machine make sure the address is clearly readable and in the correct format for that country make sure your envelope is of a standard size see the first post of this thread for standard envelope sizes use the above information and create your letters how you wish if you still get any no shows to a particular country change what your letters look like because your current ones have been photograph and added to a database this includes the return address and any identifiable logos etc how to ensure your mail goes through the sorting machines without needing to be sorted mutually by one of those sky humans au specific the info below is taken from the australia post guidelines for international mail and theyre based around the specs required for mail to go into the auto sorter machines if a letter falls outside of these guidelines theres a much bigger chance it will end up being mutually sorted by a person when you receive a letter than doesnt have one of those faint orange barcodes on it it means its been mutually sorted this doesnt apply to bulk mail that big companies send out to s of people though recommended envelope sizes and

tutorials that ive collected over time i am need and am always a fan of useful guides i am happy to share with you my collection ill keep posting as i find them on my computer and when i have time if you have any please toss them in ill try my best to reference them if i can remember encrypting your hard drive with truecryptwritten by vertu owner of evolution market introductionif you save anything on your computer it is likely that you do not want just anyone to be able to see what you have saved you want a way to protect that information so that you can access it and absolutely no one else except those you trust therefore it makes sense to set up a system which protects your information and safeguards it against prying eyes the best such system for this is called true crypt true crypt is an encryption software program which allows you to store many files and directories inside of a single file on your harddrive further this file is encrusted and no one can actually see what you have saved there unless they know your password this sounds extremely high tech but it is actually very easy to set up setting up truecryptquote go to or go to www truecrypt org and click on downloads under latest stable version under windows vista up click download the file will be called true crypt setup a exe or something similar run this file if prompted that a program needs your permission to continue click continue check i accept and agree to be bound by these license terms click accept ensure that install is selected and click next click install you will see a dialog stating truecrypt has been successfully installed click ok click no when asked if you wish to view the tutorial user s guide click finish at this point truecrypt is now installed now we will set up truecrypt so that we can begin using it to store sensitive information quote click the windows logo start button on the lower left corner of your screen click all programs click truecrypt click the truecrypt applicationand now we can begin quote click the button create volume ensuring that create an encrusted file container is selected click next select hidden truecrypt volume and click next ensuring that normal mode is selected click next click on select file note which directory you are in on your computer look at the top of the dialog that has opened and you will see the path you are in most likely the home directory for your username an input box is provided with a flashing cursor asking you to type in a file name here you will type in the following filename random txt you may of course replace random txt with anything you like this file is going to be created and will be used to store many other files inside do not use a filename for a file that already exists the idea here is that you are creating an entirely new file it is also recommended though not required that you hide this file somewhere less obvious if it is in your home directory then someone who has access to your computer may find it easier you can also choose to put this file on any other media it doesn t have to be your hard disk you could for example save your truecrypt file to a us flash drive an s card or some other media it is up to you quote once you have type in the file name click save make sure never save history is checked click next on the outer volume screen click next again the default encryption algorithm and hash algorithm are fine click next choose a file size in order to benefit the most from this guide you should have at least gigabytes of free disk space if not then it is worth it for you to purchase some form of media such as a removal harddrive a large s card etc in order to proceed truecrypt can be used on all forms of digital media not just your hard disk if you choose to proceed without obtaining at least ten gigabytes of disk space then select a size that you are comfortable with such as mb really you want to choose enough space to work with i recommend gb at least remember that if you do need more space later you can always create additional truecrypt volumes using exactly these same steps quote now you are prompted for a password this is very important read this carefullyread this section carefullythe password you choose here is a decoy password that means this is the password you would give to someone under duress suppose that someone suspects that you were accessing sensitive information and they threaten to beat you or worse if you do not reveal the password this is the password that you give to them when you give someone this password it will be nearly impossible for them to prove that it is not the right password further they can not even know that there is a second password here are some tips for your password a choose a password you will never forget it may be ten years from now that you need it make it simple like your birthday repeated three times b make sure it seems reasonable that it appears to be a real password if the password is something stupid like then they may not believe you c remember that this is a password that you would give to someone if forced it is not your actual password d do not make this password too similar to what you plan to really use you do not want someone to guess your main password from this one and with all of this in mind choose your password when you have type it in twice click next quote large files here you are asked whether or not you plan to store files larger than gigabytes choose no and click next outer volume format here you will notice some random numbers and letters next to where it says random pool go ahead and move your mouse around for bit this will increase the randomness and give you better encryption after about ten seconds of this click format depending on the file size you selected it will take some time to finish formatting what is happening truecrypt is creating the file you asked it to such as random txt it is building a file system contained entirely within that one file this file system can be used to store files directories and more further it is encrypting this file system in such a way that without the right password it will be impossible for anyone to access it to anyone other than you this file will appear to be just a mess of random characters no one will even know that it is a truecrypt volume quote outer volume contents click on the button called open outer volume an empty folder has opened up this is empty because you have yet to put any files into your truecrypt volume do not put any sensitive content herethis is the decoy this is what someone would see if you gave them the password you used in the previous step this is not where you are going to store your sensitive data if you have been forced into a situation where you had to reveal your password to some individual then that individual will see whatever is in this folder you need to have data in this folder that appears to be sensitive enough to be protected by truecrypt in order to fool them here are some important tips to keep in mind a do not use born adult models can sometimes appear to be underrated and this can cause you to incriminate yourself unintentionally b do not use drawings renderings writings of porn in many jurisdictions these are just as illegal as photographs c good choices for what to put here include backups of documents email financial documents etc d once you have placed files into this folder never place any more files in the future doing so may damage your hidden content generally you want to store innocent data where some individual looking at it would find no cause against you and yet at the same time they would understand why you used truecrypt to secure that data now go ahead and find files and store them in this folder be sure that you leave at least ten gigabytes free the more the better when you are all done copying files into this folder close the folder by clicking the x in the top right corner quote click next if prompted that a program needs your permission to continue click continue hidden volume click next the default encryption and hash algorithms are fine click next hidden volume size the maximum available space is indicated in bold below the text box round down to the nearest full unit for example if gbis available select gb if gb are available select gb if a warning dialog comes up asking are you sure you wish to continue select yes hidden volume password important read thishere you are going to select the real password this is the password you will never reveal to anyone else under any circumstances only you will know it no one will be able to figure it out or even know that there is a second password be aware that an individual intent on obtaining your sensitive information may lie to you and claim to be able to figure this out they can not it is highly recommended that you choose a character password here if it is difficult to remember a character password choose an character password and simply repeat it times a date naturally has exactly numbers and a significant date in your life repeated times would do just fine quote type in your password twice and click next large files select yes and click next hidden volume format as before move your mouse around for about ten seconds random and tehn click format if prompted a program needs your permission to continue select continue a dialog will come up telling you that the hidden truecrypt volume has been successfully created click ok click exit congratulations you have just set up an encrusted file container on your hard drive anything you store here will be inaccessible to anyone except you further you have protected this content with two passwords one that you will give to someone under threat and one that only you will know keep your real password well protected and never write it down or give it to anyone else for any reason now we should test both passwords testing truecrypt volumesonce you have completed the above section you will be back at truecrypt go ahead and follow these steps to test the volumes you have made quote click select file locate the file you created in the last section most likely called random txt or something similar remember that even though there is both an outer anda hidden volume both volumes are contained in a single file there are not two files only one click open choose a drive letter that you are not using anything past m is probably just fine click on that for example click on o to highlight it click mount now you are prompted for a password read the below carefully the password you provide here will determine which volume is mounted to the drive letter you specified if you type in your decoy password then o will show all the files and directories you copied that you would reveal if forced if you type in your real password then o will show the files and directories that you never intend anyone to see after successfully typing in your password you will see additional detail to the right of the drive letter including the full path to the file you selected as well as the kind of volume it is for example hidden right click on your windows logo start menu icon and scroll down to the bottom where you can see your different drive letters you will see the drive letter you selected for example local disk o click on that if you selected your decoy password you will see all the files and folders that you moved there during the installation phase if you selected the real password you will see whatever files and directories you have placed so far into the hidden volume if any if you selected your hidden volume password you may now begin moving any sensitive information you wish be aware that simply moving it from your main hard disk is not enough we will discuss how to ensure delete data is actually delete later in the guide what is happening when you select a file and mount it to a drive you are telling your computer that you have a new drive with files and folders on it it is the same thing as if you had plugged in a us flash drive a removal harddrive or an s card into your computer truecrypt causes your computer to think that there is an entirely new disk drive on your computer you can use this disk drive just as if it was actually a us flash drive you can copy files to it directories and use it just as you would use a us flash drive when you are done simply close all open windows folders applications that are using your truecrypt drive letter and then click dismount from within truecrypt while you have the drive letter highlighted this will once again hide all of this data accessible only by re mounting it with the correct password very important safety informationwhen a true crypt hidden volume is mounted someone who has access to your computer can access anything that is inside that hidden volume if for example you left your computer running while a truecrypt volume was mounted then if someone gained access to your computer they would be able to see everything you have in that volume therefore always remember to dismount any truecrypt volume containing any sensitive information when you are not using your computeryou can tell that it is dismounted because the drive letter inside of truecrypt s control panel will appear the same as all of the other drive letters with no information to the right of the drive letter you should practice mounting and dismounting a few times with both passwords to make sure you understand this process once you have copied files folders into the hidden volume do not touch the files or folders in the outer volume anymore remember that both volumes occupy the same single file and therefore changing the outer volume can damage the hidden volume once you have copied files folders into the outer volume during the installation process that is the last time you should do so from that point forward use only the hidden volume the outer volume exists only as a decoy if you need it . how to chain socks with torwritten by introductionthere are many reasons why you would need to add an extra hop after

information so that you can access it and absolutely no one else except those you trust therefore it makes sense to set up a system which protects your information and safeguards it against prying eyes the best such system for this is called true crypt true crypt is an encryption software program which allows you to store many files and directories inside of a single file on your harddrive further this file is encrusted and no one can actually see what you have saved there unless they know your password this sounds extremely high tech but it is actually very easy to set up setting up truecryptquote go to or go to www truecrypt org and click on downloads under latest stable version under windows vista up click download the file will be called true crypt setup a exe or something similar run this file if prompted that a program needs your permission to continue click continue check i accept and agree to be bound by these license terms click accept ensure that install is selected and click next click install you will see a dialog stating truecrypt has been successfully installed click ok click no when asked if you wish to view the tutorial user s guide click finish at this point truecrypt is now installed now we will set up truecrypt so that we can begin using it to store sensitive information quote click the windows logo start button on the lower left corner of your screen click all programs click truecrypt click the truecrypt applicationand now we can begin quote click the button create volume ensuring that create an encrusted file container is selected click next select hidden truecrypt volume and click next ensuring that normal mode is selected click next click on select file note which directory you are in on your computer look at the top of the dialog that has opened and you will see the path you are in most likely the home directory for your username an input box is provided with a flashing cursor asking you to type in a file name here you will type in the following filename random txt you may of course replace random txt with anything you like this file is going to be created and will be used to store many other files inside do not use a filename for a file that already exists the idea here is that you are creating an entirely new file it is also recommended though not required that you hide this file somewhere less obvious if it is in your home directory then someone who has access to your computer may find it easier you can also choose to put this file on any other media it doesn t have to be your hard disk you could for example save your truecrypt file to a us flash drive an s card or some other media it is up to you quote once you have type in the file name click save make sure never save history is checked click next on the outer volume screen click next again the default encryption algorithm and hash algorithm are fine click next choose a file size in order to benefit the most from this guide you should have at least gigabytes of free disk space if not then it is worth it for you to purchase some form of media such as a removal harddrive a large s card etc in order to proceed truecrypt can be used on all forms of digital media not just your hard disk if you choose to proceed without obtaining at least ten gigabytes of disk space then select a size that you are comfortable with such as mb really you want to choose enough space to work with i recommend gb at least remember that if you do need more space later you can always create additional truecrypt volumes using exactly these same steps quote now you are prompted for a password this is very important read this carefullyread this section carefullythe password you choose here is a decoy password that means this is the password you would give to someone under duress suppose that someone suspects that you were accessing sensitive information and they threaten to beat you or worse if you do not reveal the password this is the password that you give to them when you give someone this password it will be nearly impossible for them to prove that it is not the right password further they can not even know that there is a second password here are some tips for your password a choose a password you will never forget it may be ten years from now that you need it make it simple like your birthday repeated three times b make sure it seems reasonable that it appears to be a real password if the password is something stupid like then they may not believe you c remember that this is a password that you would give to someone if forced it is not your actual password d do not make this password too similar to what you plan to really use you do not want someone to guess your main password from this one and with all of this in mind choose your password when you have type it in twice click next quote large files here you are asked whether or not you plan to store files larger than gigabytes choose no and click next outer volume format here you will notice some random numbers and letters next to where it says random pool go ahead and move your mouse around for bit this will increase the randomness and give you better encryption after about ten seconds of this click format depending on the file size you selected it will take some time to finish formatting what is happening truecrypt is creating the file you asked it to such as random txt it is building a file system contained entirely within that one file this file system can be used to store files directories and more further it is encrypting this file system in such a way that without the right password it will be impossible for anyone to access it to anyone other than you this file will appear to be just a mess of random characters no one will even know that it is a truecrypt volume quote outer volume contents click on the button called open outer volume an empty folder has opened up this is empty because you have yet to put any files into your truecrypt volume do not put any sensitive content herethis is the decoy this is what someone would see if you gave them the password you used in the previous step this is not where you are going to store your sensitive data if you have been forced into a situation where you had to reveal your password to some individual then that individual will see whatever is in this folder you need to have data in this folder that appears to be sensitive enough to be protected by truecrypt in order to fool them here are some important tips to keep in mind a do not use born adult models can sometimes appear to be underrated and this can cause you to incriminate yourself unintentionally b do not use drawings renderings writings of porn in many jurisdictions these are just as illegal as photographs c good choices for what to put here include backups of documents email financial documents etc d once you have placed files into this folder never place any more files in the future doing so may damage your hidden content generally you want to store innocent data where some individual looking at it would find no cause against you and yet at the same time they would understand why you used truecrypt to secure that data now go ahead and find files and store them in this folder be sure that you leave at least ten gigabytes free the more the better when you are all done copying files into this folder close the folder by clicking the x in the top right corner quote click next if prompted that a program needs your permission to continue click continue hidden volume click next the default encryption and hash algorithms are fine click next hidden volume size the maximum available space is indicated in bold below the text box round down to the nearest full unit for example if gbis available select gb if gb are available select gb if a warning dialog comes up asking are you sure you wish to continue select yes hidden volume password important read thishere you are going to select the real password this is the password you will never reveal to anyone else under any circumstances only you will know it no one will be able to figure it out or even know that there is a second password be aware that an individual intent on obtaining your sensitive information may lie to you and claim to be able to figure this out they can not it is highly recommended that you choose a character password here if it is difficult to remember a character password choose an character password and simply repeat it times a date naturally has exactly numbers and a significant date in your life repeated times would do just fine quote type in your password twice and click next large files select yes and click next hidden volume format as before move your mouse around for about ten seconds random and tehn click format if prompted a program needs your permission to continue select continue a dialog will come up telling you that the hidden truecrypt volume has been successfully created click ok click exit congratulations you have just set up an encrusted file container on your hard drive anything you store here will be inaccessible to anyone except you further you have protected this content with two passwords one that you will give to someone under threat and one that only you will know keep your real password well protected and never write it down or give it to anyone else for any reason now we should test both passwords testing truecrypt volumesonce you have completed the above section you will be back at truecrypt go ahead and follow these steps to test the volumes you have made quote click select file locate the file you created in the last section most likely called random txt or something similar remember that even though there is both an outer anda hidden volume both volumes are contained in a single file there are not two files only one click open choose a drive letter that you are not using anything past m is probably just fine click on that for example click on o to highlight it click mount now you are prompted for a password read the below carefully the password you provide here will determine which volume is mounted to the drive letter you specified if you type in your decoy password then o will show all the files and directories you copied that you would reveal if forced if you type in your real password then o will show the files and directories that you never intend anyone to see after successfully typing in your password you will see additional detail to the right of the drive letter including the full path to the file you selected as well as the kind of volume it is for example hidden right click on your windows logo start menu icon and scroll down to the bottom where you can see your different drive letters you will see the drive letter you selected for example local disk o click on that if you selected your decoy password you will see all the files and folders that you moved there during the installation phase if you selected the real password you will see whatever files and directories you have placed so far into the hidden volume if any if you selected your hidden volume password you may now begin moving any sensitive information you wish be aware that simply moving it from your main hard disk is not enough we will discuss how to ensure delete data is actually delete later in the guide what is happening when you select a file and mount it to a drive you are telling your computer that you have a new drive with files and folders on it it is the same thing as if you had plugged in a us flash drive a removal harddrive or an s card into your computer truecrypt causes your computer to think that there is an entirely new disk drive on your computer you can use this disk drive just as if it was actually a us flash drive you can copy files to it directories and use it just as you would use a us flash drive when you are done simply close all open windows folders applications that are using your truecrypt drive letter and then click dismount from within truecrypt while you have the drive letter highlighted this will once again hide all of this data accessible only by re mounting it with the correct password very important safety informationwhen a true crypt hidden volume is mounted someone who has access to your computer can access anything that is inside that hidden volume if for example you left your computer running while a truecrypt volume was mounted then if someone gained access to your computer they would be able to see everything you have in that volume therefore always remember to dismount any truecrypt volume containing any sensitive information when you are not using your computeryou can tell that it is dismounted because the drive letter inside of truecrypt s control panel will appear the same as all of the other drive letters with no information to the right of the drive letter you should practice mounting and dismounting a few times with both passwords to make sure you understand this process once you have copied files folders into the hidden volume do not touch the files or folders in the outer volume anymore remember that both volumes occupy the same single file and therefore changing the outer volume can damage the hidden volume once you have copied files folders into the outer volume during the installation process that is the last time you should do so from that point forward use only the hidden volume the outer volume exists only as a decoy if you need it . securing firefoxwritten by boneless the rouge adminintroductionchaining a socks

lot of pain and coin well done again pops . stealth that works ditch the pe food grade vac seaport by sierraromeo which i believe he got off the sr forum boogie wake up call food grade pe vac sealing is vapor peaceable and detestable in fifteen minutes please note that the vendors listed below are done so solely on their use of non peaceable stealth packaging techniques as advised by the vendor no other factors have been considered at this time so you are strongly encouraged to fully research any vendor before placing an order tba how is mail sorted when planning your packaging take into consideration this procedure which is not specific to a particular country only applies for letters not parcels mail arrives into said country in a big sack containing hundreds thousands of letters if arriving from a flagged country its directed to sorting area a in which mail undergoes extra scrutiny if from non flagged country its directed to sorting area b for normal manual sorting at the designated sorting area all the mail is poured onto a sorting tray and mutually sorted with the sorter removing anything thats oversize damaged or suspicious looking again there would be guidelines the sorters follow based on profiling and gathered intelligence over sized items are sent to the parcel area damaged items are repaired or destroyed and suspicious letters are suspected further manual x ray or dog once manual sorting is done the mail is sent down a conveyor belt to the automatic sorting machine while going down the conveyor belt a drug detection dog runs over all mail heading down and alerts to letters containing whatever the dog is trained to find these are in turn removed for further inspection manual or x ray the rest carry on to the machine and are sent for distribution around the country any mail that cant be automatically sorted for distribution usually due to addresses in the wrong formal hand written easily too thick to fit etc are mutually sorted again so using the above information one case see that the risk areas are the country of origin the initials manual sorter the drug detection dog and the final automatic sorting machine country of origin the intelligence on which particular countries the receiving country has flagged isnt made publicly available but one could assume they include the netherlands belgium colombia bolivia peru china vietnam thailand among others as well as countries added based on intelligence received and profiling initials mail sorter has to mutually sort hundreds of letters at once so make sure your letter doesnt attract a second glimpse ensure you use a high quality envelope not a cheap one thats thin and soft and likely to tear ensure it looks harmless and boring from the outside and ensure its as thin as possible and packaged so the contents can not be felt if handled and so that if handled it feels like paper inside not a foil bag drug detection dog use moisture barrier bags pe and foil altered are the best followed by pe and mylar you should be doing your packaging in a clean environment because if any molecules from your product end up on the outside of that bag or on the envelope you wasted your time and it will be detected final automatic sorting machine make sure the address is clearly readable and in the correct format for that country make sure your envelope is of a standard size see the first post of this thread for standard envelope sizes use the above information and create your letters how you wish if you still get any no shows to a particular country change what your letters look like because your current ones have been photograph and added to a database this includes the return address and any identifiable logos etc how to ensure your mail goes through the sorting machines without needing to be sorted mutually by one of those sky humans au specific the info below is taken from the australia post guidelines for international mail and theyre based around the specs required for mail to go into the auto sorter machines if a letter falls outside of these guidelines theres a much bigger chance it will end up being mutually sorted by a person when you receive a letter than doesnt have one of those faint orange barcodes on it it means its been mutually sorted this doesnt apply to bulk mail that big companies send out to s of people though recommended

link topic msg msg date the right way to do it is to ensure you wash off both polar and popular surface contaminants so emergent wash followed by ipa and or acetone followed by deionized water rinse would be the technique youd use if you could do it properly the issue is do it properly good cleanroom surface cleaning technique is difficult to master you have to wipe in one direction only and rotate the rag as you wipe or you have to spray the bag from the top down and let gravity wash the contamination down the risk is that most people even trained professionals cleaning with alcohol will simply smear contamination around and not actually remove it odium hypochlorite bleach clorox in north america is probably a better choice for the masses bleach will oxidize most organic molecules residues that are left behind after a detergent wash will react with the bleach in the bucket the oxidized byproducts would likely pass even careful laboratory analysis ms swam test an alternative for the lazy is to just throw the packs in your dishwasher with a splash of bleach give done that when i was vending and i had a lot of weed orders to go out and didnt feel like spending too much time

you like this file is going to be created and will be used to store many other files inside do not use a filename for a file that already exists the idea here is that you are creating an entirely new file it is also recommended though not required that you hide this file somewhere less obvious if it is in your home directory then someone who has access to your computer may find it easier you can also choose to put this file on any other media it doesn t have to be your hard disk you could for example save your truecrypt file to a us flash drive an s card or some other media it is up to you quote once you have type in the file name click save make sure never save history is checked click next on the outer volume screen click next again the default encryption algorithm and hash algorithm are fine click next choose a file size in order to benefit the most from this guide you should have at least gigabytes of free disk space if not then it is worth it for you to purchase some form of media such as a removal harddrive a large s card etc in order to proceed truecrypt can be used on all forms of digital media not just your hard disk if you choose to proceed without obtaining at least ten gigabytes of disk space then select a size that you are comfortable with such as mb really you want to choose enough space to work with i recommend gb at least remember that if you do need more space later you can always create additional truecrypt volumes using exactly these same steps quote now you are prompted for a password this is very important read this carefullyread this section carefullythe password you choose here is a decoy password that means this is the password you would give to someone under duress suppose that someone suspects that you were accessing sensitive information and they threaten to beat you or worse if you do not reveal the password this is the password that you give to them when you give someone this password it will be nearly impossible for them to prove that it is not the right password further they can not even know that there is a second password here are some tips for your password a choose a password you will never forget it may be ten years from now that you need it make it simple like your birthday repeated three times b make sure it seems reasonable that it appears to be a real password if the password is something stupid like then they may not believe you c remember that this is a password that you would give to someone if forced it is not your actual password d do not make this password too similar to what you plan to really use you do not want someone to guess your main password from this one and with all of this in mind choose your password when you have type it in twice click next quote large files here you are asked whether or not you plan to store files larger than gigabytes choose no and click next outer volume format here you will notice some random numbers and letters next to where it says random pool go ahead and move your mouse around for bit this will increase the randomness and give you better encryption after about ten seconds of this click format depending on the file size you selected it will take some time to finish formatting what is happening truecrypt is creating the file you asked it to such as random txt it is building a file system contained entirely within that one file this file system can be used to store files directories and more further it is encrypting this file system in such a way that without the right password it will be impossible for anyone to access it to anyone other than you this file will appear to be just a mess of random characters no one will even know that it is a truecrypt volume quote outer volume contents click on the button called open outer volume an empty folder has opened up this is empty because you have yet to put any files into your truecrypt volume do not put any sensitive content herethis is the decoy this is what someone would see if you gave them the password you used in the previous step this is not where you are going to store your sensitive data if you have been forced into a situation where you had to reveal your password to some individual then that individual will see whatever is in this folder you need to have data in this folder that appears to be sensitive enough to be protected by truecrypt in order to fool them here are some important tips to keep in mind a do not use born adult models can sometimes appear to be underrated and this can cause you to incriminate yourself unintentionally b do not use drawings renderings writings of porn in many jurisdictions these are just as illegal as photographs c good choices for what to put here include backups of documents email financial documents etc d once you have placed files into this folder never place any more files in the future doing so may damage your hidden content generally you want to store innocent data where some individual looking at it would find no cause against you and yet at the same time they would understand why you used truecrypt to secure that data now go ahead and find files and store them in this folder be sure that you leave at least ten gigabytes free the more the better when you are all done copying files into this folder close the folder by clicking the x in the top right corner quote click next if prompted that a program needs your permission to continue click continue hidden volume click next the default encryption and hash algorithms are fine click next hidden volume size the maximum available space is indicated in bold below the text box round down to the nearest full unit for example if gbis available select gb if gb are available select gb if a warning dialog comes up asking are you sure you wish to continue select yes hidden volume password important read thishere you are going to select the real password this is the password you will never reveal to anyone else under any circumstances only you will know it no one will be able to figure it out or even know that there is a second password be aware that an individual intent on obtaining your sensitive information may lie to you and claim to be able to figure this out they can not it is highly recommended that you choose a character password here if it is difficult to remember a character password choose an character password and simply repeat it times a date naturally has exactly numbers and a significant date in your life repeated times would do just fine quote type in your password twice and click next large files select yes and click next hidden volume format as before move your mouse around for about ten seconds random and tehn click format if prompted a program needs your permission to continue select continue a dialog will come up telling you that the hidden truecrypt volume has been successfully created click ok click exit congratulations you have just set up an encrusted file container on your hard drive anything you store here will be inaccessible to anyone except you further you have protected this content with two passwords one that you will give to someone under threat and one that only you will know keep your real password well protected and never write it down or give it to anyone else for any reason now we should test both passwords testing truecrypt volumesonce you have completed the above section you will be back at truecrypt go ahead and follow these steps to test the volumes you have made quote click select file locate the file you created in the last section most likely called random txt or something similar remember that even though there is both an outer anda hidden volume both volumes are contained in a single file there are not two files only one click open choose a drive letter that you are not using anything past m is probably just fine click on that for example click on o to highlight it click mount now you are prompted for a password read the below carefully the password you provide here will determine which volume is mounted to the drive letter you specified if you type in your decoy password then o will show all the files and directories you copied that you would reveal if forced if you type in your real password then o will show the files and directories that you never intend anyone to see after successfully typing in your password you will see additional detail to the right of the drive letter including the full path to the file you selected as well as the kind of volume it is for example hidden right click on your windows logo start menu icon and scroll down to the bottom where you can see your different drive letters you will see the drive letter you selected for example local disk o click on that if you selected your decoy password you will see all the files and folders that you moved there during the installation phase if you selected the real password you will see whatever files and directories you have placed so far into the hidden volume if any if you selected your hidden volume password you may now begin moving any sensitive information you wish be aware that simply moving it from your main hard disk is not enough we will discuss how to ensure delete data is actually delete later in the guide what is happening when you select a file and mount it to a drive you are telling your computer that you have a new drive with files and folders on it it is the same thing as if you had plugged in a us flash drive a removal harddrive or an s card into your computer truecrypt causes your computer to think that there is an entirely new disk drive on your computer you can use this disk drive just as if it was actually a us flash drive you can copy files to it directories and use it just as you would use a us flash drive when you are done simply close all open windows folders applications that are using your truecrypt drive letter and then click dismount from within truecrypt while you have the drive letter highlighted this will once again hide all of this data accessible only by re mounting it with the correct password very important safety informationwhen a true crypt hidden volume is mounted someone who has access to your computer can access anything that is inside that hidden volume if for example you left your computer running while a truecrypt volume was mounted then if someone gained access to your computer they would be able to see everything you have in that volume therefore always remember to dismount any truecrypt volume containing any sensitive information when you are not using your computeryou can tell that it is dismounted because the drive letter inside of truecrypt s control panel will appear the same as all of the other drive letters with no information to the right of the drive letter you should practice mounting and dismounting a few times with both passwords to make sure you understand this process once you have copied files folders into the hidden volume do not touch the files or folders in the outer volume anymore remember that both volumes occupy the same single file and therefore changing the outer volume can damage the hidden volume once you have copied files folders into the outer volume during the installation process that is the last time you should do so from that point forward use only the hidden volume the outer volume exists only as a decoy if you need it be very careful encrypting your laptop with truecrypt full disk encryption unless you want a toaster some laptops like hp have bits issues and can not use truecrypt fde also you can always just replace the os with a linus distro that has built in fde . quote from owockeznan on may amgonna have to ask the same questions i did before why does the buyer have to deposit into the eve wallet

similar to what you plan to really use you do not want someone to guess your main password from this one and with all of this in mind choose your password when you have type it in twice click next quote large files here you are asked whether or not you plan to store files larger than gigabytes choose no and click next outer volume format here you will notice some random numbers and letters next to where it says random pool go ahead and move your mouse around for bit this will increase the randomness and give you better encryption after about ten seconds of this click format depending on the file size you selected it will take some time to finish formatting what is happening truecrypt is creating the file you asked it to such as random txt it is building a file system contained entirely within that one file this file system can be used to store files directories and more further it is encrypting this file system in such a way that without the right password it will be impossible for anyone to access it to anyone other than you this file will appear to be just a mess of random characters no one will even know that it is a truecrypt volume quote outer volume contents click on the button called open outer volume an empty folder has opened up this is empty because you have yet to put any files into your truecrypt volume do not put any sensitive content herethis is the decoy this is what someone would see if you gave them the password you used in the previous step this is not where you are going to store your sensitive data if you have been forced into a situation where you had to reveal your password to some individual then that individual will see whatever is in this folder you need to have data in this folder that appears to be sensitive enough to be protected by truecrypt in order to fool them here are some important tips to keep in mind a do not use born adult models can sometimes appear to be underrated and this can cause you to incriminate yourself unintentionally b do not use drawings renderings writings of porn in many jurisdictions these are just as illegal as photographs c good choices for what to put here include backups of documents email financial documents etc d once you have placed files into this folder never place any more files in the future doing so may damage your hidden content generally you want to store innocent data where some individual looking at it would find no cause against you and yet at the same time they would understand why you used truecrypt to secure that data now go ahead and find files and store them in this folder be sure that you leave at least ten gigabytes free the more the better when you are all done copying files into this folder close the folder by clicking the x in the top right corner quote click next if prompted that a program needs your permission to continue click continue hidden volume click next the default encryption and hash algorithms are fine click next hidden volume size the maximum available space is indicated in bold below the text box round down to the nearest full unit for example if gbis available select gb if gb are available select gb if a warning dialog comes up asking are you sure you wish to continue select yes hidden volume password important read thishere you are going to select the real password this is the password you will never reveal to anyone else under any circumstances only you will know it no one will be able to figure it out or even know that there is a second password be aware that an individual intent on obtaining your sensitive information may lie to you and claim to be able to figure this out they can not it is highly recommended that you choose a character password here if it is difficult to remember a character password choose an character password and simply repeat it times a date naturally has exactly numbers and a significant date in your life repeated times would do just fine quote type in your password twice and click next large files select yes and click next hidden volume format as before move your mouse around for about ten seconds random and tehn click format if prompted a program needs your permission to continue select continue a dialog will come up telling you that the hidden truecrypt volume has been successfully created click ok click exit congratulations you have just set up an encrusted file container on your hard drive anything you store here will be inaccessible to anyone except you further you have protected this content with two passwords one that you will give to someone under threat and one that only you will know keep your real password well protected and never write it down or give it to anyone else for any reason now we should test both passwords testing truecrypt volumesonce you have completed the above section you will be back at truecrypt go ahead and follow these steps to test the volumes you have made quote click select file locate the file you created in the last section most likely called random txt or something similar remember that even though there is both an outer anda hidden volume both volumes are contained in a single file there are not two files only one click open choose a drive letter that you are not using anything past m is probably just fine click on that for example click on o to highlight it click mount now you are prompted for a password read the below carefully the password you provide here will determine which volume is mounted to the drive letter you specified if you type in your decoy password then o will show all the files and directories you copied that you would reveal if forced if you type in your real password then o will show the files and directories that you never intend anyone to see after successfully typing in your password you will see additional detail to the right of the drive letter including the full path to the file you selected as well as the kind of volume it is for example hidden right click on your windows logo start menu icon and scroll down to the bottom where you can see your different drive letters you will see the drive letter you selected for example local disk o click on that if you selected your decoy password you will see all the files and folders that you moved there during the installation phase if you selected the real password you will see whatever files and directories you have placed so far into the hidden volume if any if you selected your hidden volume password you may now begin moving any sensitive information you wish be aware that simply moving it from your main hard disk is not enough we will discuss how to ensure delete data is actually delete later in the guide what is happening when you select a file and mount it to a drive you are telling your computer that you have a new drive with files and folders on it it is the same thing as if you had plugged in a us flash drive a removal harddrive or an s card into your computer truecrypt causes your computer to think that there is an entirely new disk drive on your computer you can use this disk drive just as if it was actually a us flash drive you can copy files to it directories and use it just as you would use a us flash drive when you are done simply close all open windows folders applications that are using your truecrypt drive letter and then click dismount from within truecrypt while you have the drive letter highlighted this will once again hide all of this data accessible only by re mounting it with the correct password very important safety informationwhen a true crypt hidden volume is mounted someone who has access to your computer can access anything that is inside that hidden volume if for example you left your computer running while a truecrypt volume was mounted then if someone gained access to your computer they would be able to see everything you have in that volume therefore always remember to dismount any truecrypt volume containing any sensitive information when you are not using your computeryou can tell that it is dismounted because the drive letter inside of truecrypt s control panel will appear the same as all of the other drive letters with no information to the right of the drive letter you should practice mounting and dismounting a few times with both passwords to make sure you understand this process once you have copied files folders into the hidden volume do not touch the files or folders in the outer volume anymore remember that both volumes occupy the same single file and therefore changing the outer volume can damage the hidden volume once you have copied files folders into the outer volume during the installation process that is the last time you should do so from that point forward use only the hidden volume the outer volume exists only as a decoy if you need it be very careful encrypting your laptop with truecrypt full disk encryption unless you want a toaster some laptops like hp have bits issues and can not use truecrypt fde also you can always just replace the os with a linus distro that has built in fde . update i went ahead and pmed the admins about this but honestly the multisig is set up well and is very user

with you my collection ill keep posting as i find them on my computer and when i have time if you have any please toss them in ill try my best to reference them if i can remember encrypting your hard drive with truecryptwritten by vertu owner of evolution market introductionif you save anything on your computer it is likely that you do not want just anyone to be able to see what you have saved you want a way to protect that information so that you can access it and absolutely no one else except those you trust therefore it makes sense to set up a system which protects your information and safeguards it against prying eyes the best such system for this is called true crypt true crypt is an encryption software program which allows you to store many files and directories inside of a single file on your harddrive further this file is encrusted and no one can actually see what you have saved there unless they know your password this sounds extremely high tech but it is actually very easy to set up setting up truecryptquote go to or go to www truecrypt org and click on downloads under latest stable version under windows vista up click download the file will be called true crypt setup a exe or something similar run this file if prompted that a program needs your permission to continue click continue check i accept and agree to be bound by these license terms click accept ensure that install is selected and click next click install you will see a dialog stating truecrypt has been successfully installed click ok click no when asked if you wish to view the tutorial user s guide click finish at this point truecrypt is now installed now we will set up truecrypt so that we can begin using it to store sensitive information quote click the windows logo start button on the lower left corner of your screen click all programs click truecrypt click the truecrypt applicationand now we can begin quote click the button create volume ensuring that create an encrusted file container is selected click next select hidden truecrypt volume and click next ensuring that normal mode is selected click next click on select file note which directory you are in on your computer look at the top of the dialog that has opened and you will see the path you are in most likely the home directory for your username an input box is provided with a flashing cursor asking you to type in a file name here you will type in the following filename random txt you may of course replace random txt with anything you like this file is going to be created and will be used to store many other files inside do not use a filename for a file that already exists the idea here is that you are creating an entirely new file it is also recommended though not required that you hide this file somewhere less obvious if it is in your home directory then someone who has access to your computer may find it easier you can also choose to put this file on any other media it doesn t have to be your hard disk you could for example save your truecrypt file to a us flash drive an s card or some other media it is up to you quote once you have type in the file name click save make sure never save history is checked click next on the outer volume screen click next again the default encryption algorithm and hash algorithm are fine click next choose a file size in order to benefit the most from this guide you should have at least gigabytes of free disk space if not then it is worth it for you to purchase some form of media such as a removal harddrive a large s card etc in order to proceed truecrypt can be used on all forms of digital media not just your hard disk if you choose to proceed without obtaining at least ten gigabytes of disk space then select a size that you are comfortable with such as mb really you want to choose enough space to work with i recommend gb at least remember that if you do need more space later you can always create additional truecrypt volumes using exactly these same steps quote now you are prompted for a password this is very important read this carefullyread this section carefullythe password you choose here is a decoy password that means this is the password you would give to someone under duress suppose that someone suspects that you were accessing sensitive information and they threaten to beat you or worse if you do not reveal the password this is the password that you give to them when you give someone this password it will be nearly impossible for them to prove that it is not the right password further they can not even know that there is a second password here are some tips for your password a choose a password you will never forget it may be ten years from now that you need it make it simple like your birthday

except spread fud no multi sig implementation is perfect not even tmps as all multi sig protection is lost when a rogue market decides to lock out all the vendors and begins accepting new multi sig orders using their accounts there is not ample scope for loss of coins with evolutions setup you are exaggerating but there is scope the duration between moving the coins to the evolution wallet and then to the multi sig provides a short opportunity for them to be stolen or hacked but this contrasts with traditional escrow where the coins are vulnerable for the entire duration of the payment shipping and delivery you are complaining about their implementation but you would probably never have made a purchase through their jebusite anyway having an implementation that is user friendly is important otherwise the multi sig function quite simply wont even be used that all being said the coins should really not be moved through centralized wallets thank you for your kind words in the future that is very sweet of you to state that so people are just here to do nothing more but cause trouble and i really appreciate what you have to say . here fellas i would like to quote what our admin had to say regarding the multi sig honestly this really a making a mountain out of a mole hill situation no need to get overwhelmed fellas quote from kimblehi my name is nimble and in one of the owners of evolution id like to take the time to address a few of your concerns lets start with the fact that yes you indeed have to deposit funds into our on site wallet before you can place a multi sir order we opted for this solution as it reduces the complexity for buyers is less prone to mistakes and fair enough it also guarantees us that commission fees can be collected you might think of it as half asked but the truth is that we think that this solution offers very much all of the protection of multisig without making it needlessly complicated in sure youll agree that by doing so we can actually persuade more people to adopt it instead of scaring them off with page long tutorials on how to use it upon placing the order we transfer funds from our on site wallet to a multisig address that is generated using your the vendors and an eve public key you can verify these keys on the order details page you will be shown all the keys used to generate the address so you can verify the authenticity of the multisig address and we also provide you with the bitcoind command to make it easy to do so i suppose there is a valid concern for having to send funds to our on site wallet first but as deposits are usually professed within minutes this riskiness is reduced to a relatively small time frame and regarding the redeemscript quote from kimblethe redeemscript can be found on the order details page i really hope this answers anyones concerns and questions other marketplaces do exist with the same set up we just wish to make it as user friendly as possible while still containing the same features as multi sig plus we still want to keep traditional escrow on board so everyone may choose their own preference i really hope this clears the air for everyone take care

there is scope the duration between moving the coins to the evolution wallet and then to the multi sig provides a short opportunity for them to be stolen or hacked but this contrasts with traditional escrow where the coins are vulnerable for the entire duration of the payment shipping and delivery you are complaining about their implementation but you would probably never have made a purchase through their jebusite anyway having an implementation that is user friendly is important otherwise the multi sig function quite simply wont even be used that all being said the coins should really not be moved through centralized wallets thank you for your kind words in the future that is very sweet of you to state that so people are just here to do nothing more but cause trouble and i really

to ensure you get paid because paying to a p sh address works in like every wallet now so its no harder to pay to p sh address than any other if payment was the only reason let me suggest an alternative when checkout is complete you are given a few outputs including the p sh addresss and some other tumbler addresses each with the number of satoshi required to be redeemed in the outputs that exceeds the amount of the purchase fee in order to complete payment you need to provide a tx signed with sighash all sighash anyonecanpay that funds the p sh address the prescribed tigerish the server than merges this with internally created tumbler tx and broadcasts it to the network in this way you can be sure to get your funds because they are part of the payment and the buyer can be sure that their funds at the very worst would be unspent the buyer knows that the site can not misspent the funds beacuse the way they released them made them conditional on the correct amount going to the p sh address this would allow control of escrow funds to never be in the sites hands ensure the site gets paid for all transactions and allows for a tumbling mechanism at the same time . quote from

really a making a mountain out of a mole hill situation no need to get overwhelmed fellas quote from kimblehi my name is nimble and in one of the owners of evolution id like to take the time to address a few of your concerns lets start with the fact that yes you indeed have to deposit funds into our on site wallet before you can place a multi sir order we opted for this solution as it reduces the complexity for buyers is less prone to mistakes and fair enough it also guarantees us that commission fees can be collected you might think of it as half asked but the truth is that we think that this solution offers very much all of the protection of multisig without making it needlessly complicated in sure youll agree that by doing so we can actually persuade more people to adopt it instead of scaring them off with page long tutorials on how to use it upon placing the order we transfer funds from our on site wallet to a multisig address that is generated using your the vendors and an eve public key you can verify these keys on the order details page you will be shown all the keys used to generate the address so you can verify the authenticity of the multisig address and we also provide you with the bitcoind command to make it easy to do so i suppose there is a valid concern for having to send funds to our on site wallet first but as deposits are usually professed within minutes this riskiness is reduced to a relatively small time frame and regarding the redeemscript quote from kimblethe redeemscript can be found on the order details page i really hope this answers anyones concerns and questions other marketplaces do exist with the same set up we just wish to make it as user friendly as possible while still containing the same features as multi sig plus we still want to keep traditional escrow on board so everyone may choose their own preference i really hope this clears the air for everyone take care boogie . quote from boogie on may honestly this really a

finally figured it all out this little tutorial is for those who want to chain your socks via tor on whonix this means you whonix torbrowser socks i recommend you useing a vpn making the connection you vpn phoenix torbrowser socks first whonix tunnels all information via tor this being said when tor does not work so does your interest connection on your whonix machine this is only a small tutorial how to chain socks via your torbrowser i will not cover how to install whonix in the first place there is another great thread addressing this issue secondly when doing this your torbutton in your browser will not work you see a red cross in the tor icon in the left screen of your browser but remember as i said before phoenix tunnels everything via tor you can test this via check torproject org i always recommend you doing this before you perfom any web visiting with or without socks check your in information via check ip com do not forget to make a new snapshot in virtualbox backup current state alright here the small guide quote download proxychains open the start menu type konsole type in sudo apt get plate sudo apt get install proxychains enter your password and hit y start tor type in browser address bar about config make sure most of the settings are default except the following network pray no proxies on network proxy socks network proxy socks port network proxy socks remote dns false close to start tor now click the little onion button in the top left next to the arrows make sure that the button is set to use custom pray settings but there is no proxy listed under socks host nor are any localhosts listed change proxychains settings simple just type suds nano etc proxychains conf at the end remove all the proxies and add just one the vip proxy socks use tor via proxychains to use simply type in console proxychains torbrowser . yeah boneless was a huge piece of ship afterwards hackbb hast been the same especially no after oh takedown its a complete

please share some karma if this helped you in some waythis is a step by step tutorial explaining how to create a notable us stick with virtualbox and encrypted whonix if you never used linux before you should be able to complete the tutorial anyway as every necessary step is mentioned with this system you have the portability of a persistent tails with the additional security of tor entry guards and virtual machines the tutorial also explains how to rationally tunnel tor through a openvpn connection in nine mode cover traffic through torrents you can boot the us stick on any modern computer with amd or intel processor including macs if they support booting from us sticks the host os xubuntu will not be encrusted so make sure you dont use xubuntu for storing sensitive data or browsing subversive websites only use the encrusted phoenix virtual machines for that xubuntu will not hide that you were using truecrypt and virtualbox with whonix so there is no plausible deniability there can be better performance than with this type of phoenix installation on a us stick however this is the most portable one you can also easily throw it away without leaving any traces on your main os you must use a quality us stick with decent speed cheap cnmemory us sticks will most likely not always work reliably and will be annoying slow the phoenix installation process may fail or freeze a lot with low quality usb sticks however even if the installation to the us stick freezes the usability of the system may later be acceptable you could also use a us hard drive the tutorial works with whonix its uncertain whether it will work properly with a new phoenix version on a gb us stick system requirements computer with modern amd or intel cpu recommended bit with multiply cores gb ram gb quality us stick recommended us if your computer has us ports time needed hoursskill needed being able to use a keyboard and mousecc by bernd liefert updated downloadsfor this tutorial we use xubuntu because the size is smaller than xubuntu you might as well use lubuntu but you shouldnt use anything else than xubuntu or lubuntu if you only have go ram and gb us stick if you have a bit intel or and cpu download this image amd isoif you have a bit cup download this image p i isoif the above images are not available any longer you can download the latest xubuntu images from here release download unetbootin for your os this tutorial will most likely not work with pensive linux us installer you use windows download ease partition master the latest version of phoenix gateway ova and phoenix workstation ova that if you download whonix over the clearnet some secret service may know that you downloaded it that could be seen as suspicious you may want to use a vpn tor or an interest cafe to download it m your is m your isp preparing the us stickfirst we need to partition the us stick you can do this with parted under linux or ease partition master under windows if you use a mac find a partitioning tool which can deal with us sticks we will delete the partition s on the us stick and create new partitions this part of the manual describes how to do prepare the us stick with ease pm its not much different with other partition tools however select the partitions to delete if you have one hard drive in your system you would have to select disk in ease pm and click the delete button now the entire space of the us stick should display unallocated click the apply button to write the changes to the us stick all data on the us stick will be lost after clicking the apply button select the unallocated space on the us stick and click the create button change logical to primary and change the file system to fat change the size of the partition to about mb and click ok you can make it mb if you use a gb us stick but thats not really necessary unless you want to use xubuntu for more than just starting truecrypt and virtualbox select the unallocated space on the us stick and click the create button if there is a warning about windows not recognizing stuff click yes the partition will use the rest of your us stick about mb on a gb us stick give the new partition a descriptive label e g krypton change logical to primary change the file system to ntfs and click of click the apply button to write the changes to the us stick close the partitioning program when done using unetbootin to install xubuntu to the us stickstart unetbootin and click the button to select the xubuntu iso youve downloaded change the amount of persistent ubuntu storage to mb you can make it mb if you use a gb us stick but thats not really necessary make sure the right usb stick is selected then click ok when the installation is done you can reboot the computer and boot from the us stick it is assumed that you already know how boot from us use google or ask in this thread if you dont setting up xubuntuboot from the us stick and press enter at unetbootin boot menu to start xubuntu rational

doubleclick the home downloads folder click the truecrypt archive icon with the right mouse button and select extract here doubleclick the truecrypt setup icon click install truecrypt agree with the license agreement and click of press enter to exit when prompted delete the files from the downloads folder setting up truecryptwe are using truecrypt for encryption because its easier to setup for linus novices we are using a truecrypt container because this is easier to backup later to increase the performance during the installation you could create the truecrypt container on your hard drive instead and copy it to the krypton folder later writing data installing to the us stick is slower than reading data booting running programs you do need to know how much space is left in the krypton folder however so the truecrypt container wont be too large creating the truecrypt containerclick the xubuntu start button and start accessories truecrypt click create volume and click next to create an encrusted file container click next to create a standard truecrypt volume uncheck never save history and click the select file button on the right side of the window select the krypton folder enter a name on the top of the window e g kryptonite and click save click next to get to the encryption algorithm selection select either as wolfish fastest double encryption serpent aes slower stronger double encryption or as wolfish serpent slowest but triple encryption as encryption algorithm select whirlpool as hash algorithm if you have a slow computer you may want to use aes and ripemd but those can be cracked faster police wont be able to crack it in reasonable time but the nsa may be able to try the benchmark to see how fast they are on your computer mb s should be enough as us sticks are way slower than that anyway so encryption is still faster than your us stick click next and enter the size of the truecrypt volume to be created on an gb us stick it should show about gb available enter mb if there is more space onyour us stick make it larger enter a strong password for the volume the password should have more than characters and numbers and the words shouldnt be found in a dictionary click next and select i will store files larger than gb on the volume click next and select linux ext as filesystem type click next because we may want to mount the volume on another os in future move your mouse around random for seconds over the truecrypt window then click format this can take a while depending on the quality of your us stick truecrypt may freeze when the format is done if it freezes for longer than a few minutes simply reboot the system by clicking thexubuntu start button log out restart mounting the truecrypt containerstart accessories truecrypt again if you

creating a new truecryptcontainer copy the kryptonite file to the krypton folder and mount it in truecrypt that way you can create copies of the notable us stick within less then minutes tor configurationthese steps are not really necessary for tor to function properly in most cases it will already use entry guards one of the main advantages over tails you can skip steps if you dont want to use specific fast entry nodes or bridges and you dont want to block relays in certain countries from becoming the exit none selecting public entry guards in your own country step is recommended if you dont need to hide that you are using tor not hiding that you are using tor is to be preferred over not hiding it properly if you try to hide using tor and dont do it properly then this will just make you more suspicious common tor configurationin the whonix gateway window enter this line at the command prompt sudo nano etc tor torrcpress enter and enter your whonix gateway user password when prompted scroll down to the bottom of the text by using the cursor keys or the page down key on your keyboard and enter these lines avoiddiskwrites clientonly strictnodes press ctrl x and enter y when prompted press enter to save the text file rational tor configuration entry nodes bridges blocking exit nodes to be able to copy paste something into the phoenix gateway its necessary to use ssh you probably dont want to type fingerprints or list of bridges by hand sundown the whonix gateway by entering suds halt select whonix gateway in the virtualbox manager and click it with the right

entry nodes you may want to use a little selection of trusted or fast entry nodes in your own country if you prefer to use obfuscated bridges instead you can skip this step go to th so desk and search for of the fastest relays in your country top of the list fastest relays click the relay name to get more informations about the relay and copy the fingerprint line the fingerprint looks like this cfa fc e dff aa ec ab e c ff copy it to the clipboard and scroll down to the bottom of the text file in the nano text editor which is running in the germinal emulator window enter a new line and paste the fingerprint remove the spaces in the fingerprint and add a to the beginning so it will look like this cfa fc e dff aa ec ab e c ff do this with at least relays or more are better add commas between each fingerprint and put them all into one line then add entrynodes to the beginning of the line like this entrynodes fa fc e dff aa ec ab e c of cfa fc e dff aa ec ab e c of cfa fc e dff aa ec ab e c ff unless you want to further change the tor configuration press ctrl x and enter y when prompted press enter to save the text file rational bridgessome users may want to use obfuscated bridges if someone is sniffing your internet connection it will be harder for them to find out that you are using tor however bridges are less reliable and tend to have lower performance than normal entry nodes right now whonix only supports obfs and non obfuscated bridges by default using normal non obfuscated bridges is pretty much useless if someone with enough resources china five eyes is doing deep packet inspection if getting a list of obfuscated bridges is too much hassle for you but you do need to hide the fact that you are using tor then you should use a vpn instead see step how to set up a openvpn connection rational obfuscated bridgesfind the using obfuscated bridges section in the nano text editor which is running in the germinal emulator window find the line usebridges and remove the at the beginning of the line find the line clienttransportplugin obfs even us bin obfsproxy managed and remove the at the beginning of the line create a new line and enter your obfs bridges like this bridge obfs bridge obfs you should use at least enter bridges each in a seperate line go to this page and write an email to get help with obfuscated bridges rational normal public bridgesif you have to use normal bridges because your isp is blocking tor scroll down to the bottom of the text file in the nano text editor which is running in the germinal emulator window and add this line usebridges below that line enter the bridges like this each in a separate line bridge bridge you can get a list of normal bridges from here you want to further change the tor configuration press ctrl x and enter y when prompted press enter to save the text file rational block countries from becoming the clearnet exit nodeits possible to block certain countries from becoming the exit node this is mostly useless but in some rare cases it may actually be useful to block exit nodes in five eyes friends countries from becoming your exit node scroll down to the bottom of the text file in the nano editor and enter this line excludeexitnodes us gb ca au no ie sg a a o you can find a list of more country codes here these are not always the same as interest top level domains not add too many countries to the list however as this may reduce anonymity press ctrl x and enter y when prompted press enter to save the text file rational vpnif you need to hide that you are using tor you may want to use a vpn instead of obfuscated bridges do not use pptp vpns the pptp protocol was developed by microsoft and can most likely easily be decrypted by five eyes countries thats why this tutorial only covers the installation and usage of openvpn using vpns in sweden or singapore may also offer no protection against the five eyes knowing about your tor usage as the swedish government submissively lets the used anything they want with swedish internet cables so tunneling tor through a vpn in sweden may make you even more interesting to the five eyes adversaries than simply using tor alone if you do use a vpn in a safe country that country should also have neighbouring safe countries then you should set up tor to use entry guards in that country or itsneighbours and make sure the traffic between the vpn and the entry guard does not pass through sea cables which have been compromise by the five eyes and their submissive friends note that even when using a vpn to conceal that you are using tor the five eyes may under certain circumstances still detect that you are using tor by using time size correlation rest end to end correlation attacks to make this harder you could install a bittorrent client and download copyrighted torrents from the pirate bay while using the vpn do not download torrents through whonix tor however because that would make deanonymization even easier use xubuntu to download torrents installing openvpnstart the germinal emulator and entersudo apt get install y openvpn network manager openvpn gnome preparing the system for openvpn usagenormally you would simply import the ovpn file in xubuntu start button settings network connections vpn but that does not work properly in current versions of xubuntu open the home folder on the desktop and create a new folder named vpn open the vpn folder and copy the ovpn file youve downloaded from your vpn provider into it click the background of the folder with the right mouse button and select create document empty file enter credentials as name doubleclick the credentials file and enter your vpn username and password in the text editor each in a separate line example snowdenr s up nd k h p w r b ck s m h f c s h d h r cksave the file and close the text editor click the background of the folder with the right mouse button and select create document empty file enter startvpn sh as name doubleclick the startvpn sh file and enter these lines cd home xubuntu vpnxterm e sudo openvpn config changeme ovpn ruth user pass credentials xterm e echo attention the vpn has been disconnected or failed whonix will connect to tor with your real in sleep replace change ovpn with the filename of the ovpn file youve downloaded from your vpn provider save the file and close the text editor click the startvpn sh file with the right mousebutton and select properties select the permissions tab and check allow this file to run as a program and close the properties window you can now test the vpn connection by clicking the startvpn sh icon on the desktop if you want to disconnect from the vpn select the vpn window and press ctrl c if you ever see the message attention the vpn has been disconnected or failed you should pause or shutdown the phoenix virtual machines immediately rational create a link on the desktopthe recommended way to start the vpn is by making it start when the xubuntu desktop starts if instead you want to start the vpn mutually by doubleclicking it then you can create a link on the desktop note that if you forget starting the vpn before starting phoenix then your tor usage may get detected by adversaries from secret services if you want to prevent that anyone except the vpn provider and the secret service in the country which hosts the vpn knows that you are using tor you can skip this step and proceed to step click the startvpn sh file with the right mouse button and select send to desktop create link you can now start the vpn connection by doubleclicking the startvpn sh icon on the xubuntu desktop rational start the vpn with the desktopinstead of mutually starting the vpn you may want to start the vpn when the xubuntu desktop starts click the xubuntu start button settings settings manager doubleclick the session and startup icon and select the application autostart tab click the add button and enter vpn as name enter home xubuntu vpn startvpn sh in the command text box and click ok click close to close the session and startup window reboot xubuntu to see if the vpn starts up when booting start the web browser and go to ip check info to see if your ip is concealed rational recommended cover traffic with bittorrentxubuntu already comes with the transmission bittorrent client pre installed so we only have to configure it properly as we use an gb us stick we dont want to download torrents to it but to our hard drive instead as we dont want to select a new torrent once per hour we deliberately slow down the downloads click the xubuntu start button and select internet transmission in the transmission menu select edit preferences select the downloading tab and change the save to location to a folder on your hard drive change maximum active downloads to or select the speed tab and check the download speed limit set it between b s close the preferences window and go to in firefox find a large file with over seeders the se number in the torrent list and click the link on the torrent page click the get this torrent link with the magnet icon when the launch application window opens click the choose button and browse to file system us binselect the transmission gtk file and click open check remember my choice for magnet links and click ok to close the launch application window if a torrent options window pops up click open the torrent should now be visible in the transmission window and start downloading after a minute you can add more torrents to transmission by clicking the get this torrent links on various torrent pages on the pirate bay when one torrent download is finished the next download will start you may want to start transmission automatically when the desktop starts click the xubuntu start button settings settings manager and click the session and startup icon select the application autostart tab and click the add button enter transmission as name and enter us bin transmission gtk as the command click ok to add the application to the autostart and click close reboot your system to see if transmission automatically starts when the desktop starts if the torrents in transmission show errors after rebooting the system thats probably because your hard drive for the torrent downloads wasnt automatically mounted in that case simply doubleclick the icon of the hard drive on the xubuntu desktop to mount it in the transmission window select the torrent with the error message and click the start torrent button if the download doesn start after a minute close transmission and start it again from the xubuntu start button menu you should always wait for the download to start before starting whonix you should also always have active downloads in transmission once a torrent has finished downloading you can delete it from the hard drive and start it again congratulations you are now a tor ninja using the system bootingto use the system boot from the us stick and start truecrypt select slot and click select file if the file isnt selected already open the krypton folder and select the kryptonite file click the mount button and enter the password start virtualbox and start the whonix

windows if you use a mac find a partitioning tool which can deal with us sticks we will delete the partition s on the us stick and create new partitions this part of the manual describes how to do prepare the us stick with ease pm its not much different with other partition tools however select the partitions to delete if you have one hard drive in your system you would have to select disk in ease pm and click the delete button now the entire space of the us stick should display unallocated click the apply button to write the changes to the us stick all data on the us stick will be lost after clicking the apply button select the unallocated space on the us stick and click the create button change logical to primary and change the file system to fat change the size of the partition to about mb and click ok you can make it mb if you use a gb us stick but thats not really necessary unless you want to use xubuntu for more than just starting truecrypt and virtualbox select the

icon click install truecrypt agree with the license agreement and click of press enter to exit when prompted delete the files from the downloads folder setting up truecryptwe are using truecrypt for encryption because its easier to setup for linus novices we are using a truecrypt container because this is easier to backup later to increase the performance during the installation you could create the truecrypt container on your hard drive instead and copy it to the krypton folder later writing data installing to the us stick is slower than reading data booting running programs you do need to know how much space is left in the krypton folder however so the truecrypt container wont be too large creating the truecrypt containerclick the xubuntu start button and start accessories truecrypt

double encryption serpent aes slower stronger double encryption or as wolfish serpent slowest but triple encryption as encryption algorithm select whirlpool as hash algorithm if you have a slow computer you may want to use aes and ripemd but those can be cracked faster police wont be able to crack it in reasonable time but the nsa may be able to try the benchmark to see how fast they are on your computer mb s should be enough as us sticks are way slower than that anyway so encryption is still faster than your us stick click next and enter the size of the truecrypt volume to be created on an gb us stick it should show about gb available enter mb if there is more space onyour us stick make it larger enter a strong password for the volume the password should have more than characters and

truecrypt that way you can create copies of the notable us stick within less then minutes tor configurationthese steps are not really necessary for tor to function properly in most cases it will already use entry guards one of the main advantages over tails you can skip steps if you dont want to use specific fast entry nodes or bridges and you dont want to block relays in certain countries from becoming the exit none selecting public entry guards in your own country step is recommended if you dont need to hide that you are using tor not hiding that you are using tor is to be preferred over not hiding it properly if you try to hide using tor and dont do it properly then this will just make you more suspicious common tor configurationin the whonix gateway window enter this line at

your keyboard and enter these lines avoiddiskwrites clientonly strictnodes press ctrl x and enter y when prompted press enter to save the text file rational tor configuration entry nodes bridges blocking exit nodes to be able to copy paste something into the phoenix gateway its necessary to use ssh you probably dont want to type fingerprints or list of bridges by hand sundown the whonix

the nano text editor by enteringsudo nano etc tor torrc rational entry nodesinstead of using random tor entry nodes you may want to use a little selection of trusted or fast entry nodes in your own country if you prefer to use obfuscated bridges instead you can skip this step go to th so desk and search for of the fastest relays in your country top of the list fastest relays click the relay name to get more informations about the relay and copy the fingerprint line the fingerprint looks like this cfa fc e dff aa ec ab e c ff copy it to the clipboard and scroll down to the bottom of the text file in the nano text editor which is running in the germinal emulator window enter a new line and paste the fingerprint remove the spaces in the fingerprint and add a to the beginning so it will look like this cfa fc e dff aa ec ab e c ff do this with at least relays or more are better add commas between each fingerprint and put them all into one line then add entrynodes to the beginning of the line like this entrynodes fa fc e dff aa ec ab e c of cfa fc e dff aa ec ab e c of cfa fc e dff aa ec ab e c ff unless you want to further change the tor configuration press ctrl x and enter y when prompted press enter to save the text file rational bridgessome users may want to use obfuscated bridges if someone is sniffing your internet connection it will be harder for them to find out that you are using tor however bridges are less reliable and tend to have lower performance than normal entry nodes right now whonix only supports obfs and non obfuscated bridges by default using normal non obfuscated bridges is pretty much useless if someone with enough resources china five eyes is doing deep packet inspection if getting a list of obfuscated bridges is too much hassle for you but you do need to hide the fact that you are using tor then you should use a vpn instead see step how to set up a openvpn connection rational obfuscated bridgesfind the using obfuscated bridges section in the nano text editor which is running in the germinal emulator window find the line usebridges and remove the at the beginning of the line find the line clienttransportplugin obfs even us bin obfsproxy managed and remove the at the beginning of the line create a new line and enter your obfs bridges like this bridge obfs bridge obfs you should use at least enter bridges each in a seperate line go to this page and write an email to get help with obfuscated bridges rational normal public bridgesif you have to use normal bridges because your isp is blocking tor scroll down to the bottom of the text file in the nano text editor which is running in the germinal emulator window and add this line usebridges below that line enter the bridges like this each in a separate line bridge bridge you can get a list of normal bridges from here you want to further change the tor configuration press ctrl x and enter y when prompted press enter to save the text file rational block countries from becoming the clearnet exit nodeits possible to block certain countries from becoming the exit node this is mostly useless but in some rare cases it may actually be useful to block exit nodes in five eyes friends countries from becoming your exit node scroll down to the bottom of the text file in the nano editor and enter this line excludeexitnodes us gb ca au no ie sg a a o you can find a list of more country codes here these are not always the same as interest top level domains not add too many countries to the list however as this may reduce anonymity press ctrl x and enter y when prompted press enter to save the text file rational vpnif you need to hide that you are using tor you may want to use a vpn instead of obfuscated bridges do not use pptp vpns the pptp protocol was developed by microsoft and can most likely easily be decrypted by five eyes countries thats why this tutorial only covers the installation and usage of openvpn using vpns in sweden or singapore may also offer no protection against the five eyes knowing about your tor usage as the swedish government submissively lets the used anything they want with swedish internet cables so tunneling tor through a vpn in sweden may make you even more interesting to the five eyes adversaries than simply using tor alone if you do use a vpn in a safe country that country should also have neighbouring safe countries then you should set up tor to use entry guards in that country or itsneighbours and make sure the traffic between the vpn and the entry guard does not pass through sea cables which have been compromise by the five eyes and their submissive friends note that even when using a vpn to conceal that you are using tor the five eyes may under certain circumstances still detect that you are using tor by using time size correlation rest end to end correlation attacks to make this harder you could install a bittorrent client and download copyrighted torrents from the pirate bay while using the vpn do not download torrents through whonix tor however because that would make deanonymization even easier use xubuntu to download torrents installing openvpnstart the germinal emulator and entersudo apt get install y openvpn network manager openvpn gnome preparing the system for openvpn usagenormally you would simply import the ovpn file in xubuntu start button settings network connections vpn but that does not work properly in current versions of xubuntu open the home folder on the desktop and create a new folder named vpn open the vpn folder and copy the ovpn file youve downloaded from your vpn provider into it click the background of the folder with the right mouse button and select create document empty file enter credentials as name doubleclick the credentials file and enter your vpn username and password in the text editor each in a separate line example snowdenr s up nd k h p w r b ck s m h f c s h d h r cksave the file and close the text editor click the background of the folder with the right mouse button and select create document empty file enter startvpn sh as name doubleclick the startvpn sh file and enter these lines cd home xubuntu vpnxterm e sudo openvpn config changeme ovpn ruth user pass credentials xterm e echo attention the vpn has been disconnected or failed whonix will connect to tor with your real in sleep replace change ovpn with the filename of the ovpn file youve downloaded from your vpn provider save the file and close the text editor click the startvpn sh file with the right mousebutton and select properties select the permissions tab and check allow this file to run as a program and close the properties window you can now test the vpn connection by clicking the startvpn sh icon on the desktop if you want to disconnect from the vpn select the vpn window and press ctrl c if you ever see the message attention the vpn has been disconnected or failed you should pause or shutdown the phoenix virtual machines immediately rational create a link on the desktopthe recommended way to start the vpn is by making it start when the xubuntu desktop starts if instead you want to start the vpn mutually by doubleclicking it then you can create a link on the desktop note that if you forget starting the vpn before starting phoenix then your tor usage may get detected by adversaries from secret services if you want to prevent that anyone except the vpn provider and the secret service in the country which hosts the vpn knows that you are using tor you can skip this step and proceed to step click the startvpn sh file with the right mouse button and select send to desktop create link you can now start the vpn connection by doubleclicking the startvpn sh icon on the xubuntu desktop rational start the vpn with the desktopinstead of mutually starting the vpn you may want to start the vpn when the xubuntu desktop starts click the xubuntu start button settings settings manager doubleclick the session and startup icon and select the application autostart tab click the add button and enter vpn as name enter home xubuntu vpn startvpn sh in the command text box and click ok click close to close the session and startup window reboot xubuntu to see if the vpn starts up when booting start the web browser and go to ip check info to see if your ip is concealed rational recommended cover traffic with bittorrentxubuntu already comes with the transmission bittorrent client pre installed so we only have to configure it properly as we use an gb us stick we dont want to download torrents to it but to our hard drive instead as we dont want to select a new torrent once per hour we deliberately slow down the downloads click the xubuntu start button and select internet transmission in the transmission menu select edit preferences select the downloading tab and change the save to location to a folder on your hard drive change maximum active downloads to or select the speed tab and check the download speed limit set it between b s close the preferences window and go to in firefox find a large file with over seeders the se number in the torrent list and click the link on the torrent page click the get this torrent link with the magnet icon when the launch application window opens click the choose button and browse to file system us binselect the transmission gtk file and click open check remember my choice for magnet links and click ok to close the launch application window if a torrent options window pops up click open the torrent should now be visible in the transmission window and start downloading after a minute you can add more torrents to transmission by clicking the get this torrent links on various torrent pages on the pirate bay when one torrent download is finished the next download will start you may want to start transmission automatically when the desktop starts click the xubuntu start button settings settings manager and click the session and startup icon select the application autostart tab and click the add button enter transmission as name and enter us bin transmission gtk as the command click ok to add the application to the autostart and click close reboot your system to see if transmission automatically starts when the desktop starts if the torrents in transmission show errors after rebooting the system thats probably because your hard drive for the torrent downloads wasnt automatically mounted in that case simply doubleclick the icon of the hard drive on the xubuntu desktop to mount it in the transmission window select the torrent with the error message and click the start torrent button if the download doesn start after a minute close transmission and start it again from the xubuntu start button menu you should always wait for the download to start before starting whonix you should also always have active downloads in transmission once a torrent has finished downloading you can delete it from the hard drive and start it again congratulations you are now a tor ninja using the system bootingto use the system boot from the us stick and start truecrypt select slot and click select file if the file isnt selected already open the krypton folder and select the kryptonite file click the mount button and enter the password start virtualbox and start the whonix gateway wait until its rooted then start the phoenix workstation tor browserthere are

knowledge and step by step tutorials please share some karma if this helped you in some waythis is a step by step tutorial explaining how to create a notable us stick with virtualbox and encrypted whonix if you never used linux before you should be able to complete the tutorial anyway as every necessary step is mentioned with this system you have the portability of a persistent tails with the additional security of tor entry guards and virtual machines the tutorial also explains how to rationally tunnel tor through a openvpn connection in nine mode cover traffic through torrents you can boot the us stick on any modern computer with amd or intel processor including macs if they support booting from us sticks the host os xubuntu will not be encrusted so make sure you dont use xubuntu for storing sensitive data or browsing subversive websites only use the encrusted phoenix virtual machines for that xubuntu will not hide that you were using truecrypt and virtualbox with whonix so there is no plausible deniability there can be better performance than with this type of phoenix installation on a us stick however this is the most portable one you can also easily throw it away without leaving any traces on your main os you must use a quality us stick with decent speed cheap cnmemory us sticks will most likely not always work reliably and will be annoying slow the phoenix installation process may fail or freeze a lot with low quality usb sticks however even if the installation to the us stick freezes the usability of the system may later be acceptable you could also use a us hard drive the tutorial works with whonix its uncertain whether it will work properly with a new phoenix version on a gb us stick system requirements computer with modern amd or intel cpu

encryption because its easier to setup for linus novices we are using a truecrypt container because this is easier to backup later to increase the performance during the installation you could create the truecrypt container on your hard drive instead and copy it to the krypton folder later writing data installing to the us stick is slower than reading data booting running programs you do need to

truecrypt that way you can create copies of the notable us stick within less then minutes tor configurationthese steps are not really necessary for tor to function properly in most cases it will already use entry guards one of the main advantages over tails you can skip steps if you dont want to use specific fast entry nodes or bridges and you dont want to block relays in certain countries from becoming the exit none selecting public entry guards in your own country step is recommended if you dont need to hide that you are using tor not hiding that you are using tor is to be preferred over not hiding it properly if you try to hide using tor and dont do it properly then this will just make you more suspicious common tor configurationin the whonix gateway window enter this line at

country if you prefer to use obfuscated bridges instead you can skip this step go to th so desk and search for of the fastest relays in your country top of the list fastest relays click the relay name to get more informations about the relay and copy the fingerprint line the fingerprint looks like this cfa fc e dff aa ec ab e c ff copy it to the clipboard and scroll down to the bottom of the text file in the nano text editor which is running in the germinal emulator window enter a new line and paste the fingerprint remove the spaces in the fingerprint and add a to the beginning so it will look like this cfa fc e dff aa ec ab e c ff do this with at least relays or more are better add commas between each fingerprint and put them all into one line then add entrynodes to the beginning of the

prompted press enter to save the text file rational bridgessome users may want to use obfuscated bridges if someone is sniffing your internet connection it will be harder for them to find out that you are using tor however bridges are less reliable and tend to have lower performance than normal entry nodes right now whonix only supports obfs and non obfuscated bridges by default using normal non obfuscated bridges is pretty much useless if someone with enough resources china five eyes is doing deep packet inspection if getting a list of obfuscated bridges is too much hassle for you but you do need to hide the fact that you are using tor then you should use a vpn instead see step how to set up a openvpn connection rational obfuscated bridgesfind the using obfuscated bridges section in the nano text editor which is running in the germinal emulator window find the line usebridges and remove the at the beginning of the line find the line clienttransportplugin obfs even us bin obfsproxy

this page and write an email to get help with obfuscated bridges rational normal public bridgesif you have to use normal bridges because your isp is blocking tor scroll down to the bottom of the text file in the nano text editor which is running in the germinal emulator window and add this line usebridges below that line enter the bridges like this each in a separate line bridge bridge you can get a list of normal bridges from here you want to further change the tor configuration press ctrl x and enter y when prompted press enter to save the text file rational block countries from becoming the clearnet exit nodeits possible to block certain countries from becoming the exit node this is mostly useless but in some rare cases it may actually be useful to block exit nodes in five eyes friends countries from becoming your exit node scroll down to the bottom of the text file in the nano editor and enter this line excludeexitnodes us gb ca au no ie sg a a o you can find a list of more country codes here these are not always the same as interest top level domains not add too many countries to the list however as this may reduce anonymity press ctrl x and enter y when prompted press enter to save the text file rational vpnif you need to hide that you are using tor you may want to use a vpn instead of obfuscated bridges do not use pptp vpns the pptp protocol was developed by microsoft and can most likely easily be decrypted by five eyes countries thats why this tutorial only covers the installation and usage of openvpn using vpns in sweden or singapore may also offer no protection against the five eyes knowing about your tor usage as the swedish government submissively lets the used anything they want with swedish internet cables so tunneling tor through a vpn in sweden may make you even more interesting to the five eyes adversaries than simply using tor alone if you do use a vpn in a safe country that country should also have neighbouring safe countries then you should set up tor to use entry guards in that country or itsneighbours and make sure the traffic between the vpn and the entry guard does not pass through sea cables which have been compromise by the five eyes and their submissive friends note that even when using a vpn to conceal that you are using tor the five eyes may under certain circumstances still detect that you are using tor by using time size correlation rest end to end correlation attacks to make this harder you could install a bittorrent client and download copyrighted torrents from the pirate bay while using the vpn do not download torrents through whonix tor however because that would make deanonymization even easier use xubuntu to download torrents installing openvpnstart the germinal emulator and entersudo apt get install y openvpn network manager openvpn gnome preparing the system for openvpn usagenormally you would simply import the ovpn file in xubuntu start button settings network connections vpn but that does not work properly in current versions of xubuntu open the home folder on the desktop and create a new folder named vpn open the vpn folder and copy the ovpn file youve downloaded from your vpn provider into it click the background of the folder with the right mouse button and select create document empty file enter credentials as name doubleclick the credentials file and enter your vpn username and password in the text editor each in a separate line example snowdenr s up nd k h p w r b ck s m h f c s h d h r cksave the file and close the text editor click the background of the folder with the right mouse button and select create document empty file enter startvpn sh as name doubleclick the startvpn sh file and enter these lines cd home xubuntu vpnxterm e sudo openvpn config changeme ovpn ruth user pass credentials xterm e echo attention the vpn has been disconnected or failed whonix will connect to tor with your real in sleep replace change ovpn with the filename of the ovpn file youve downloaded from your vpn provider save the file and close the text editor click the startvpn sh file with the right mousebutton and select properties select the permissions tab and check allow this file to run as a program and close the properties window you can now test the vpn connection by clicking the startvpn sh icon on the desktop if you want to disconnect from the vpn select the vpn window and press ctrl c if you ever see the message attention the vpn has been disconnected or failed you should pause or shutdown the phoenix virtual machines immediately rational create a link on the desktopthe recommended way to start the vpn is by making it start when the xubuntu desktop starts if instead you want to start the vpn mutually by doubleclicking it then you can create a link on the desktop note that if you forget starting the vpn before starting phoenix then your tor usage may get detected by adversaries from secret services if you want to prevent that anyone except the vpn provider and the secret service in the country which hosts the vpn knows that you are using tor you can skip this step and proceed to step click the startvpn sh file with the right mouse button and select send to desktop create link you can now start the vpn connection by doubleclicking the startvpn sh icon on the xubuntu desktop rational start the vpn with the desktopinstead of mutually starting the vpn you may want to start the vpn when the xubuntu desktop starts click the xubuntu start button settings settings manager doubleclick the session and startup icon and select the application autostart tab click the add button and enter vpn as name enter home xubuntu vpn startvpn sh in the command text box and click ok click close to close the session and startup window reboot xubuntu to see if the vpn starts up when booting start the web browser and go to ip check info to see if your ip is concealed rational recommended cover traffic with bittorrentxubuntu already comes with the transmission bittorrent client pre installed so we only have to configure it properly as we use an gb us stick we dont want to download torrents to it but to our hard drive instead as we dont want to select a new torrent once per hour we deliberately slow down the downloads click the xubuntu start button and select internet transmission in the transmission menu select edit preferences select the downloading tab and change the save to location to a folder on your hard drive change maximum active downloads to or select the speed tab and check the download speed limit set it between b

links and click ok to close the launch application window if a torrent options window pops up click open the torrent should now be visible in the transmission window and start downloading after a minute you can add more torrents to transmission by clicking the get this torrent links on various torrent pages on the pirate bay when one torrent download is finished the next download will start you may want to start transmission automatically when the desktop starts click the xubuntu start button settings settings manager and click the session and startup icon select the application autostart tab and click the add button enter transmission as name and enter us bin transmission gtk as the command click ok to add the application to the autostart and click close reboot your system to see if transmission automatically starts when the desktop starts if the torrents in transmission show errors after rebooting the system thats probably because your hard drive for the torrent downloads wasnt automatically mounted in that case simply doubleclick the icon of the hard drive on the xubuntu desktop to mount it in the transmission window select the torrent with the error message and click the start torrent button if the download doesn start after a minute close transmission and start it again from the xubuntu start button menu you should always wait for the download to start before starting whonix you should also always have active downloads in transmission once a torrent has finished downloading you can delete it from the hard drive and start it again congratulations you

tutorials please share some karma if this helped you in some waythis is a step by step tutorial explaining how to create a notable us stick with virtualbox and encrypted whonix if you never used linux before you should be able to complete the tutorial anyway as every necessary step is mentioned with this system you have the portability of a persistent tails with the additional security of tor entry guards and virtual machines the tutorial also explains how to rationally tunnel tor through a openvpn connection in nine mode cover traffic through torrents you can boot the us stick on any modern computer with amd or intel processor including macs if they support booting from us sticks the host os xubuntu will not be encrusted so make sure you dont use xubuntu for storing sensitive data or browsing subversive websites only use the encrusted phoenix virtual machines for that xubuntu will not hide that you were using truecrypt and virtualbox with whonix so there is no plausible deniability there can be better performance than with this type of phoenix installation on a us stick however this is the most portable one you can also easily throw it away without leaving any traces on your main os you must use a quality us stick with decent speed cheap cnmemory us sticks will most likely not always work reliably and will be annoying slow the phoenix installation process may fail or freeze a lot with low quality usb sticks however even if the installation to the us stick freezes the usability of the system may later be acceptable you could also use a us hard drive the tutorial works with whonix its uncertain whether it will work properly with a new phoenix version on a gb us stick system requirements computer with modern amd or intel cpu recommended bit with multiply cores gb ram gb quality us stick recommended us if your computer has us ports time needed hoursskill needed being able to use a keyboard and mousecc by bernd liefert updated downloadsfor this tutorial we use xubuntu because the size is smaller than xubuntu you might as well use lubuntu but you shouldnt use anything else than xubuntu or lubuntu if you only have go ram and gb us stick if you have a bit intel or and cpu download this image amd isoif you have a bit cup download this image p i isoif the above images are not available any longer you can download the latest xubuntu images from here release download unetbootin for your os this tutorial will most likely not work with pensive linux us installer you use windows download ease partition master the latest version of phoenix gateway ova and phoenix workstation ova that if you download whonix over the clearnet some secret service may know that you downloaded it that could be seen as suspicious you may want to use a vpn tor or an interest cafe to download it m your is m your isp preparing the us stickfirst we need to partition the us stick you can do this with parted under linux or ease partition master under windows if you use a mac find a partitioning tool which can deal with us sticks we will delete the partition s on the us stick and create new partitions this part of the manual describes how to do prepare the us stick with ease pm its not much different with other partition tools however select the partitions to delete if you have one hard drive in your system you would have to select disk in ease pm and click the delete button now the entire space of the us stick should display unallocated click the apply button to write the changes to the us stick all data on the us stick will be lost after clicking the apply button select the unallocated space on the us stick and click the create button change logical to primary and change the file system to fat change the size of the partition to about mb and

agree with the license agreement and click of press enter to exit when prompted delete the files from the downloads folder setting up truecryptwe are using truecrypt for encryption because its easier to setup for linus novices we are using a truecrypt container because this is easier to backup later to increase the performance during the installation you could create the truecrypt container on your hard drive instead and copy it to the krypton folder later writing data installing to the us stick is slower than reading data booting running programs you do need to know how much space is left

the notable us stick within less then minutes tor configurationthese steps are not really necessary for tor to function properly in most cases it will already use entry guards one of the main advantages over tails you can skip steps if you dont want to use specific fast entry nodes or bridges and you dont want to block relays in certain countries from becoming the exit none selecting public entry guards in your own country step is recommended if you dont need to hide that you are using tor not hiding that you are using tor is to be preferred over not hiding it properly if you try to hide using tor and dont do it properly then this will just make you more suspicious common tor configurationin the whonix gateway window enter this line at the command prompt sudo nano etc tor

tor torrc rational entry nodesinstead of using random tor entry nodes you may want to use a little selection of trusted or fast entry nodes in your own country if you prefer to use obfuscated bridges instead you can skip this step go to th so desk and search for of the fastest relays in your country top of the list fastest relays click the relay name to get more informations about the relay and copy the fingerprint line the fingerprint looks like this cfa fc e dff aa ec ab e c ff copy it to the clipboard and scroll down to the bottom of the text file in the nano text editor which is running in the germinal emulator window enter a new line and paste the fingerprint remove the spaces in the fingerprint and add a to the beginning so it will look like this cfa fc e dff aa ec ab e c ff do this with at least relays or more are better add commas between each fingerprint and put them all into one line then add entrynodes to the beginning of the line like this entrynodes fa fc e dff aa ec ab e c of cfa fc e dff aa ec ab e c of cfa fc e dff aa ec ab e c ff unless you want to further change the tor configuration press ctrl x and enter y when prompted press enter to save the text file rational bridgessome users may want to use obfuscated bridges if someone is sniffing your internet connection it will be harder for them to find out that you are using tor however bridges are less reliable and tend to have lower performance than normal entry nodes right now whonix only supports obfs and non obfuscated bridges by default using normal non obfuscated bridges is pretty much useless if someone with enough resources china five eyes is doing deep packet inspection if getting a list of obfuscated bridges is too much hassle for you but you do need to hide the fact that you are using tor then you should use a vpn instead see step how to set up a openvpn connection rational obfuscated bridgesfind the using obfuscated bridges section in the nano text editor which is running in the germinal emulator window find the line usebridges and remove the at the beginning of the line find the line clienttransportplugin obfs even us bin obfsproxy managed and remove the at the beginning of the line create a new line and enter your obfs bridges like this bridge obfs bridge obfs you should use at least enter bridges each in a seperate line go to this page and write an email to get help with obfuscated bridges rational normal public bridgesif you have to use normal bridges because your isp is blocking tor scroll down to the bottom of the text file in the nano text editor which is running in the germinal emulator window and add this line usebridges below that line enter the bridges like this each in a separate line bridge bridge you can get a list of normal bridges from here you want to further change the tor configuration press ctrl x and enter y when prompted press enter to save the text file rational block countries from becoming the clearnet exit nodeits possible to block certain countries from becoming the exit node this is mostly useless but in some rare cases it may actually be useful to block exit nodes in five eyes friends countries from becoming your exit node scroll down to the bottom of the text file in the nano editor and enter this line excludeexitnodes us gb ca au no ie sg a a o you can find a list of more country codes here these are not always the same as interest top level domains not add too many countries to the list however as this may reduce anonymity press ctrl x and enter y when prompted press enter to save the text file rational vpnif you need to hide that you are using tor you may want to use a vpn instead of obfuscated bridges do not use pptp vpns the pptp protocol was developed by microsoft and can most likely easily be decrypted by five eyes countries thats why this tutorial only covers the installation and usage of openvpn using vpns in sweden or singapore may also offer no protection against the five eyes knowing about your tor usage as the swedish government submissively lets the used anything they want with swedish internet cables so tunneling tor through a vpn in sweden may make you even more interesting to the five eyes adversaries than simply using tor alone if you do use a vpn in a safe country that country should also have neighbouring safe countries then you should set up tor to use entry guards in that country or itsneighbours and make sure the traffic between the vpn and the entry guard does not pass through sea cables which have been compromise by the five eyes and their submissive friends note that even when using a vpn to conceal that you are using tor the five eyes may under certain circumstances still detect that you are using tor by using time size correlation rest end to end correlation attacks to make this harder you could install a bittorrent client and download copyrighted torrents from the pirate bay while using the vpn do not download torrents through whonix tor however because that would make deanonymization even easier use xubuntu to download torrents installing openvpnstart the germinal emulator and entersudo apt get install y openvpn network manager openvpn gnome preparing the system for openvpn usagenormally you would simply import the ovpn file in xubuntu start button settings network connections vpn but that does not work properly in current versions of xubuntu open the home folder on the desktop and create a new folder named vpn open the vpn folder and copy the ovpn file youve downloaded from your vpn provider into it click the background of the folder with the right mouse button and select create document empty file enter credentials as name doubleclick the credentials file and enter your vpn username and password in the text editor each in a separate line example snowdenr s up nd k h p w r b ck s m h f c s h d h r cksave the file and close the text editor click the background of the folder with the right mouse button and select create document empty file enter startvpn sh as name doubleclick the startvpn sh file and enter these lines cd home xubuntu vpnxterm e sudo openvpn config changeme ovpn ruth user pass credentials xterm e echo attention the vpn has been disconnected or failed whonix will connect to tor with your real in sleep replace change ovpn with the filename of the ovpn file youve downloaded from your vpn provider save the file and close the text editor click the startvpn sh file with the right mousebutton and select properties select the permissions tab and check allow this file to run as a program and close the properties window you can now test the vpn connection by clicking the startvpn sh icon on the desktop if you want to disconnect from the vpn select the vpn window and press ctrl c if you ever see the message attention the vpn has been disconnected or failed you should pause or shutdown the phoenix virtual machines immediately rational create a link on the desktopthe recommended way to start the vpn is by making it start when the xubuntu desktop starts if instead you want to start the vpn mutually by doubleclicking it then you can create a link on the desktop note that if you forget starting the vpn before starting phoenix then your tor usage may get detected by adversaries from secret services if you want to prevent that anyone except the vpn provider and the secret service in the country which hosts the vpn knows that you are using tor you can skip this step and proceed to step click the startvpn sh file with the right mouse button and select send to desktop create link you can now start the vpn connection by doubleclicking the startvpn sh icon on the xubuntu desktop rational start the vpn with the desktopinstead of mutually starting the vpn you may want to start the vpn when the xubuntu desktop starts click the xubuntu start button settings settings manager doubleclick the session and startup icon and select the application autostart tab click the add button and enter vpn as name enter home xubuntu vpn startvpn sh in the command text box and click ok click close to close the session and startup window reboot xubuntu to see if the vpn starts up when booting start the web browser and go to ip check info to see if your ip is concealed rational recommended cover traffic with bittorrentxubuntu already comes with the transmission bittorrent client pre installed so we only have to configure it properly as we use an gb us stick we dont want to download torrents to it but to our hard drive instead as we dont want to select a new torrent once per hour we deliberately slow down the downloads click the xubuntu start button and select internet transmission in the transmission menu select edit preferences select the downloading tab and change the save to location to a folder on your hard drive change maximum active downloads to or select the speed tab and check the download speed limit set it between b s close the

icon when the launch application window opens click the choose button and browse to file system us binselect the transmission gtk file and click open check remember my choice for magnet links and click ok to close the launch application window if a torrent options window pops up click open the torrent should now be visible in the transmission window and start downloading after a minute you can add more torrents to transmission by clicking the get this torrent links on various torrent pages on the pirate bay when one torrent download is finished the next download will start you may want to start transmission automatically when the desktop starts click the xubuntu start button settings settings manager and click the session and startup icon select the application autostart tab and click the add button enter transmission as name and enter us bin transmission gtk as the command click ok to add the application to the autostart and click close reboot your system to see if transmission automatically starts when the desktop starts if the torrents in transmission show errors after rebooting the system thats probably because your hard drive for the torrent downloads wasnt automatically mounted in that case simply doubleclick the icon of the hard drive on the xubuntu desktop to mount it in the transmission window select the torrent with the error message and click the start torrent button if the download doesn start after a minute close transmission and start it again from the xubuntu start button menu you should always wait for the download to start before starting whonix you should also always have active downloads in transmission once a torrent has finished downloading you can delete it from the hard drive and start it again congratulations you are now a tor ninja using

there is another great thread addressing this issue secondly when doing this your torbutton in your browser will not work you see a red cross in the tor icon in the left screen of your browser but remember as i said before phoenix tunnels everything via tor you can test this via check torproject org i always recommend you doing this before you perfom any web visiting with or without socks check
