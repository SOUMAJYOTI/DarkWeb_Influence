shipping updates depending on what version of pgp you use it is extremely easy to change the name and signatures on your public keys and then re unload them have also started to get tons of plaintext orders which i will not tolerate come on people this is life or death freedom or jail shit we are talking here . i am not sure how to do it from gpa but from germinal you could do gpg edit key inanna where inanna is whatever y u put for your pgp nym then do adduid hit enter and you can enter your tmg nym and email address and a comment from there you can use the command remuid to get rid f one of your names or just have both of them on there i am sure it is easy to change from gpa i just do not know how to do it signing a new key would also be an option . the public key would change but would

wallet e commerce script i just found onionshop and i like what they are doing i would like to post a pgp signed mpk on the source forums i operate on and have customers mutually verify the address given at checkout is mine it should be possible to do this no this seems like afoolproof way of doing business through these kind of sites but i dod not know how to put it into practice . did you want to sell btc for money pak if so the only method i can think of to protect both of yall is for the buyer with the mpak to get a vendor account and place a listing for how much btc they want another idea is to have a rd party individual mod trusted vendor so on who is highly trusted to hold on to the funds until the transfer is complete i remember when bmr had its personal btc trade center black bank does it too i hope this my friend . i have been working on setting up a e commerce script that uses a deterministic wallet to create one time use payment addresses i was about to launch it and then i found onionshops which is the same idea but i want to make sure my customers are protected if i for example posted a pgp signed version of my mpk here is there a way that my customers could mutually verify that the deterministic addresses on onionshop actually belonged to me . the only way to check is to start deriving keys and to see if yours shows up you really shouldnt put an electrum mpk out for everybody to see tho with how electrum does it the mpk any child private key is enough to crack the entire wallet getting every key it produces the method used can be found in the
