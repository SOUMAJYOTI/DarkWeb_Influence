new thread there are two main trusted tumblers and a third which was just released that i will post here along with some information about each i will also post an extra free method that you can use on top of tumbling first helix by grams grams started in april of as a simple search engine for products on the markets after a few months they started helix and have since created many useful services such as torads infodesk and gramsflow helix has a regular version which requires a grass account and a light version which does not the full version of helix has more fine tuned controls like delays and sending the clean coins in more than one transaction in the light version you send your coins to the address it gives you and as soon as it gets confirmations it sends the cleaned coins in one transaction to your specific address in the light version it can take up to hours but most transactions are completed within minutes fee maximum withdrawal amount btcmaximum withdrawal amount btchelix account cost not needed for helix light btchelix grams enufi joel onion helixsecond bitblender this service has been around for quite some time and is one of the trusted tumblers bitblender works with a shared coin system one huge wallet sending many small payments while the others seem more sophisticated many wallets bigger than your deposit that will send amounts to the addresses you gave in both cases it should work as far as blockchain analysis goes thanks wilderness bitblender also has a high volume bonus program where if you send btc within days your fee goes down by they also have a referred program where once combined deposits from a user and his her referred users reaches btc in days the referring user will be credited of all deposits fee randomized bitblender bitblendervrfkzr onionthird pay shield by sigaint sigaint has been one of the trusted darknet email service providers for about a year now and has just announced their new tumbler on june i have not had a chance to try it yet but it claims to complete the tumble in minutes whats unique about pay shield is that it has a pay someone with mixed coins feature from their jebusite pay someone with mixed coins is primarily used to pay someone else with maximum privacy simply input the payees blond wig address and the amount they expect and pay shield will generate a mix for you and calculate how much you need to send to make the mix work out to that amount fee randomized pay shield payshld oxbu eft onionnow on to the free method this is not recommended as a stand alone method there are many websites that store a large amount of bitcoins stores casinos exchanges etc i personally use casino websites send in your btc play a few rounds penny slots or youll regret it and send it to your final destination you can also send to your preferred website of choice first before sending it to your tumbler with exchanges its best to find one where you can send your btc and convert to ltc or another currency then back to btc . if you have a sigaint email address youll have gotten this email begin pgp signed message hash sha hello everyone we are pleased to announce the launch of the latest
