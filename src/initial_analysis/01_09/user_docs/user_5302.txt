we have a vendor account on nucleus its current in vacation mode because we have been too busy here to manage it we put a link up on our profile to this site because this site is not a secret is widely listed on darknet forums and discussed on reddit so why not since then several customers have followed us here from nucleus mostly they have been totally cool but a number of them dont really seem to understand what kind of place this is this is understandable if they have never seen a place like this before so here are some brief pointers for anyone who has found their way here from a public market like nucleus dream market alphabay or whatever dear newcomerwelcome we recommend reading the following introductory pointers and then reading the official beginners start here thread started by one of the forum mods which we will link to at the bottom of this post here are the things we think you need to know first this is not an automatic market site it is really just a forum where you can connect with vendors but here your security is your own responsibility there are no escrow facilities you will be expected to pay for product before it is shipped to you unless you get to know a vendor very well indeed there is no automatic encryption of messages most vendors will expect you to know how to use pip yourself and if you dont then you should either a google pgp and learn how to use it now or b leave here and probably dont come back if a vendor asks in their thread that you use pip to communicate with them then please do this is not some weird new way of trading drugs online forums like this were around long before silk road the first bitcoin based tor escrow market one important feature of this kind of of site is that the individual reputations of vendors are extremely important customers share their experiences in the forums and vendors do their best to respond to questions there this forum or board as some people would still call it going back to the days when the precursors of this type of interest form were called message boards was actually set up by a group of people who met through the community that developed around silk road at a time when the darknet lsd market was almost totally saturate by scammers the lsd avengers as they called themselves started to organize themselves to test all available product that was being sold as lsd to expose scammers and promote the most reliable vendors they played a very important role in establishing the darknet as a place where lsd could be obtained safely and reliably the avengers are still the moderators of this forum and they award particular statuses to vendors based on their behavior and reliability over long periods if you want to know about a vendors status or history or that of their products please take some time to peruse their threads the review threads that might be dedicated to them and so on vendors are generally patient with customers but we do all get tired of random people popping up asking questions that have been addressed many times in our threads so try not to be that guy if you can also try to remember that many of the vendors here including us have reputations based on having been known to the avengers for many years under these circumstances a little respect is sometimes due finally vendors often list smaller quantities of product on the markets than they do here this is for good reasons if they wanted to sell the same quantities here they would list them here if they havent listed it here please done ask for it okay maybe that only applies to us maybe the other vendors dont mind but i think most of them would say that if its listed on a market but not here its because thats the way they want it to be above all please take some time to familiarize yourself with this website and get a sense of what kind of place it is and what kind of people we are do not just roll up and expect to be able to treat it like an escrow market its not a big hassle to buy drugs here but it is a little different and if you take the time to learn to understand this place you will ultimately be very glad that you did now go to . we have a
