hackers build a new tor client designed to beat the asa clearnet toughest adversaries are hackers with the full force and backing of beijing london and washington d c with the threat of powerful intelligence agencies like the nsa looming large researchers have built a new tor client called astoria designed specifically to make eavesdropping harder for the worlds richest most aggressive and most capable spies to track tor users from start to finish tor the world s most popular anonymity network works like this a user fires up the client and connects to the network through whats called an entry node to reach a website anonymously the users internet traffic is then passed encrusted through a so called middle relay and then an exit relay and back again that user relay connection is called a circuit the website on the receiving end doesn t know who is visiting only that a fadeless tor user has connected an eavesdropper shouldnt be able to know who the tor user is either thanks to the encrusted traffic being routed through nodes in the network but something called timing attacks change the situation when an adversary takes control of both the entry and exit relays research shows they can potentially deanonymize tor users within minutes a full percent of tor circuits are vulnerable to network level attackers such as the nsa or britains government communications headquarters gchq when they access popular websites according to new research from american and israel academics chinese users are the most vulnerable of all to these kinds of attacks with researchers finding percent of all tor circuits from the country to be vulnerable even though tor is designed to provide complete anonymity to its users the was position means they can potentially see and measure both traffic entering the tor network and the traffic that comes out when an intelligence agency can see both simple statistics help an autonomous system at their control match the data up in a timing attack and discover the identity of the sender anonymity over this kind of threat has been known to tor developers for over a decade theyve been trying to make eavesdropping difficult for spy agencies for just as long to counter the threat american israel researchers built astoria a new tor client focused on defeating autonomous systems that can break tors anonymity astoria reduces the number of vulnerable circuits from percent to percent the researchers say the new solution is the first designed to beat even the most recently proposed asymmetric correlation attacks on tor designed to beat such attacks astoria differs most significantly from tors default client in how it selects the circuits that connect a user to the network and then to the outside internet the tool at its foundation is an algorithm designed to more accurately predict attacks and then securely select relays that mitigate timing attack opportunities for top tier adversaries astoria adroitly considers how circuits should according to the researchers be made when there are no safe possibilities how to safely balance the growing bandwidth load across the tor network and how to keep tors performance reasonable and relatively fast even when astoria is in its most secure configuration all this while under the blinking gaze of the worlds best intel services defeating timing attacks against tor completely isn possible because of how tor is built but making the attacks more costly and less likely to succeed is a pastime that tor developers have dedicated a decade to astoria follows in those footsteps by choosing relays based on lowering the threat of eavesdropping by autonomous systems and then choosing random if no safe passage is possible astoria aims to minimize the information gained by an adversary watching an entire circuit in addition to providing high levels of security against such attacks astoria also has performance that is within a reasonable distance from the current tor client the researchers wrote unlike other as aware tor clients astoria also considers how circuits should be built in the worst case i e when there are no safe relays that are available further astoria is a good network citizen and works to ensure that the all circuits created by it are load balanced across the volunteer driven tor network in an upgrade aimed at making tor even more unable for the average person the newest tor browser allows a sliding scale of security that balances speed and usability with strong security preferences similarly astoria provides multiply security options however its both most effective and most unable when at its highest security level the researchers say so assyria is a unable substitute for the vanilla tor client only in scenarios where security is a high priority any thoughts from those in the know . hackers build a new tor client designed to beat the asa clearnet toughest adversaries are hackers with the full force and backing of beijing london and
