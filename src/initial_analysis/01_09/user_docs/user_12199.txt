myynnit osasto there is possibility to download json or csv file with list of everything in myynnit as well as statusesthis info is great to hunt old sales and negative responsesdoesnt do anything else besides parsing myynnit json into visual table and with possibility to refine contents with regem searchneat was tester for product last whole week we where discussing cleaning sources java and
