i have it on good authority that a forced dismount of a trucrypt container will not leave the password recoverable on the host machine others may have a different view point on that though just repeating what i was told by someone who knows about such things . quote from lysergix on may amquote from zaphod on may amwhy not just use lurks its already built in after all the problem with truecrypt is that even if you manage to get it working and it used to be supported in tails and it isnt any longer that you have no guarantee that something wont break it down the line leaving you holding the bag try it if you want but if or more likely when it breaks you wont get any help or support as far as the signatures go there getting shakier over time zaphodi was under the impression that luks is inferior to truecrypt easier for potential adversaries to crack i thought maybe having a truecrypt container within tails lurks encryption would provide an additional layer of protection for sensitive documents id be relieved to hear that im wrong about lurks being inferior am i while i did manage to get veracrypt installed in tails you were right its buggy and a bit of a pain thanks

inferior to truecrypt in the sense that it relies exclusively on aes as its cipher algorithm whereas in truecrypt you can choose a variety of algorithms including cascading cipher algorithms aes wolfish serpent aes wolfish aes wolfish serpent serpent aes serpent wolfish aes and wolfish serpent the best publicly known attacks to date on aes have reduced its strength by a value of some two bits reducing aes to bits and aes to bits if you dont like aes then truecrypt offers you several alternatives whereas lurks does not i would hasten to point out that pgp relies heavily on aes therefore if aes were ever to be broken then there would be a lot of people shitting a lot of bricks all full disk encryption fde software suffers from a single vulnerability keeping the key s in memory while the volume s are mounted this applies equally to luks truecrypt bitlocker filevault and presumably other software as well all volumes containers are vulnerable as long as they are mounted and the key s are in ram this can not be dressed enough the feds caught ross ulbricht in the library where his back was not against the wall and his containers were mounted the feds went to great lengths to make sure that they caught him with his atop open if he had managed to close his laptop they would have been screwed by their own admission rosss problem in particular what that he did not appear to understand this concept that as long as your volume container drive is mounted then your data in effect can be accesse as if it were not encrusted at all you also appear to be missing the point as well arguing that a truecrypt container might be placed inside a lurks container this is no solution at all in order to be able to access your data in the first place both containers must of necessity be mounted a much better solution would be to have files contained in a lurks truecrypt container encrusted by a second program e g pgp or ccrypt files should only be decrypted while they are in use and re encrusted after you are finished with them if you were to do this then only those files actually decrypted while you were working on them would be vulnerable needless to say this is inconvenient to say the least but the prudent person prizes security over convenience any day needless to say ross was not a prudent person if ross had followed proper security procedures while he might not have avoided jail altogether it is unlikely that he would have been handed two life sentences in many ways he was the author of his own misfortune keeping logs when admonishing his underlings not to do so keeping the pgp passphrase for his employees doxx in a folder for the fbi to find etc the key takeaway here is that convenience is the mortal enemy of security quote from
