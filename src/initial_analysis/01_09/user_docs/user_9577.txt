simple and straightforward and has helped me a lot with understanding it download it and make a key save that key and once that is done put it in your signature box on here so that it is easier for people to contact you and encrypt a message if you plan on buying something here you need that hell if you plan on buying something anywhere on the dw you need that pgp key for your safety and for
