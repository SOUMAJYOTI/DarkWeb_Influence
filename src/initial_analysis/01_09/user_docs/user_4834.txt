variation of things before you can find what tool can help you i have to say that releasing or letting go of all the guilt anger from the past can make a huge difference in moving on sometimes it can creep back up but if you can somehow talk it out or just get to the point where it doesnt effect you anymore it can be a lifesaver you actually feel more lighter too once its out if you believe in energies etc in sure youve felt it on heavy on your chest keep on exploring i hope you dont also get the dont get too deep in psychedelics talk from people it sounds like we are bit on the same page as far as exploration goes where we might not want to leave anything off the table explore new ideas visions etc what might seem crazy to others might lead to other stuff who knows im not saying that anything we view feel in psychedelics might be real but if you look at god knows how many scientists and others that were told that they were batshit insane cause of their theories or inventions and look at how many people believe in gods that they will never be able to talk to or see at least we can view and interact with entities in our psychedelic trips like always i am here to talk to you or anyone else i might not be the most sane person but then again i do think most of us are depressed due to our environment its almost like a reaction to the shifty things in life but just done let using psychedelics be the only thing that make you happy in life i would also say if there are any things that led to big changes in your life that might help others to write that up never know what might help other people . some of you know pieces of my story that i am open about and some do not i will start this off by saying i have had a very tumultuous life that has led me far from any existential questions i was addicted to hard drugs for a long time and for the first year of my sobriety clean minus one relapse it was just a shock to be alive a shock to even be walking and talking and eating and sleeping i was taking psychedelic recreationally and have been a part of this board for a large part of those two years but recently this has turned into something a bit different for me i feel like i have finally reached the point of psychospiritual maturity to actually be involved in these entheogens to the point where i am actually starting to believe that there are things to believe in that there may and almost absolutely is something else going on the synchronisity of everything kind of makes it hard for me to deny that there has to be some kind of mechanism at work they are opening me up to new systems of belief or actually a belief of no systems no religion no boundary they are also opening me up to emotions i have been repressing since childhood of anger and hurt caused by people in my family and the enviroment i was raised in they are starting to help me realize that maybe all of this is not my fault maybe i dont have to completely bash myself with guilt i am guilty for everything i have chosen but at least i know now why i am pre disposed for these choices hallucinogens are really actually helping me do what psychiatrists and therapists have been trying to achieve since i was i am finally making breakthroughs and i am finally becoming the person i want to be i feel i am connecting to the person that existed before drugs to the real intersts and things that made me tick now not all of this is because of psychedelics but it has been because of my spiritual journey that i have found myself on which is very entangled with my psychedelic use and they go hand in hand and lead to many reflections sober and transcendent this is random but knuckles if you randomly read this post im still going to write back to that pm lol . haha well i was just about to log off and random saw this post its very nice to hear that your finding yourself and making positive changes in life sometimes you have to go through a variation of things before you can find what tool can help you i have to say that releasing or letting go of all the guilt anger from the past can make a huge difference in moving on sometimes it can creep back up but if you can somehow talk it out or just get to the point where it doesnt effect you anymore it can be a lifesaver you actually feel more lighter too once its out if you believe in energies etc in sure youve felt it on heavy on your chest keep on exploring i hope you dont also get the dont get too deep in psychedelics talk from people it sounds like we are bit on the same page as far as exploration goes where we might not want to leave anything off the table explore new ideas visions etc what might seem crazy to others might lead to other stuff who knows im not saying that anything we view feel in psychedelics might be real but if you look at god knows how many scientists and others that were told that they were batshit insane cause of their theories or inventions and look at how many people believe in gods that they will never be able to talk to or see at least we can view and interact with entities in our psychedelic trips like always i am here to talk to you or anyone else i might not

the universe is on a journey to find themselves so you are not alone give also found that entheogens can provide some assistance on the path of self knowledge they have the potential to reveal truths about ourselves from the personal to the universal give found that meditation contemplation can also compliment this path beautifullyi feel whatever anyone has been through in the past they can come to realize their true nature ultimately we are the truth we are seeking already if anything believing otherwise is the mistake for that reason i also think like you that believing in a religion or any set philosophy can become another limitation its best to just be open . meekly raises hand this board and the subjects we discuss have helped my grow in immeasurable ways in the last couple of years i

with addiction and for sure psychedelics can have a great positive impact on the mindset of someone with addictive tendencies as human beings we are the inheritors of a biology which ferocious searches for patterns in its environment and in a social aspect looks for ways to connect and create networks with our neighbours in some respects these two factors can work against us when we are trying to achieve specific goals as they can create unnecessary noise in the background information of our perceptions take scientology for example we watched the fantastic documentary going clear and the message we took away from it is that systems of belief and behaviour established by groups of humans which were intended apparently to be helpful to others can eventually turn out to be expressive and highly amazing in its after effects socially we seek to make a tribe from our peer group no matter where we are in the world it doesnt seem to matter what the particular rules of the trial system are if they are given enough importance by the group then new individuals will strive very very hard to fulfil the requirements even when that means destroying ties with family and loved ones psychedelics could be the answer to anyone on a spiritual journey which addicts most definitely are as the pitfalls of human group behaviour in almost all other spiritual or religious aspects pull them into this strange spiral of social primate heirarchical behaviour these entheogenic compunds can free the mind and body from the binding mental aspects of culture and allow the user to see things from a perspective which they would not have during regular therapy or religious contexts something which we think is a fundamental aspect of being a human and being alive so all power to you stay true to what your heart and spirit tells you and be good to yourself above all else in our experience is the importance of self respect when it comes to addiction no one else can tell you where you can find that self respect and you most certainly have to earn it for yourself before you can apply it and learn to rely on it we believe the world will be a better place if people can become self empowered to any extent the more the better and it takes courage and moral fiber to admit to problems like we have in a world addicted to consumerism we hope that doesnt sound too self serving but that we can eventually be of help to those around us if anything should befall them as everyone fundamentally hopes to be useful to anyone in need entheogens can be a step in the journey for those
