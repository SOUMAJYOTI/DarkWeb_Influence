accounts quote got to love this whyusheep has a tendacny for sticking his hand up to any interest imnstability i suggest he has a death wish by the way a great lol . quotewe have taken into consideration the current events and decided to take the servers offline for investigation of the effects of the going do attack we estimate that we need maximum hours for this and everything should be online again at etc agora team signature . you investigating the issue right now if this bug has indeed existed it was due to the server not handling the dos attack properly and must have been a random occurrence with no possibility to exploit purposefully at this time we have made a general asset check and we can confirm that no large sums of money are missing if anything at all was missing due to this we shall account the lost to ourselves since in that case the server should have been more do proof at this time we dont see a reason to shutdown access to the service but we shall update if this changes . wouldnt you think that if he really hacked agora thered be a little more buzz about it though other than people reporting the site is down its been down for more than just day at least thats what ive seen but who knows after all that these dark net sites have been through nothing surprises me anymore i wish there was a way we could really be assured of a sites security there are so many marketplaces on the dark web now some of them could be ran by clowns i miss stexo . quote from pillfirepharmacy on march pmi dont think its do attack i can intermittent log in on agora so seems their not under attack my guess is that its just traffic problems since they have a ton of new users a do attack would allow the odd legitamate user though and a ddos is by definition a traffic problem . i think it is true that message . quote from rumpe foreskin on march amon agoras forum a user posted this with the link why r u sheep ahcked agora this latest post of theirs on pastebin are

for the fuckoffs edit also agora is up for me and asks for a captcha now . quote from paesmem on march am i miss stexo didnt expect to hear anyone say that again . im pretty sure real hackers dont use

intermittent log in on agora so seems their not under attack my guess is that its just traffic problems since they have a ton of new users . what a dick . i had some funds that took over a day to show up on fog in the past three days and agra isnt loading well for me now i dont think these things are related frankly i think agora is just having tor bandwidth issues as its the new premier market i think fog has been having issues and they are aware of it perhaps they are both under ddos attacks from the gubmint but thats pure speculation . has anyone else noticed this i know that bitcoinfog has been very slow releasing peoples deposits this last week in fact many people myself included still have not received their withdrawals from days ago but now both agora and bitcoinfogs websites appear to be down please let me know if anyone else has had any luck getting on either site in the last hour or if you heard any news on this issue thank you everyone . why agora when it does come up do
