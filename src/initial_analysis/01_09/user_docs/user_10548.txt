it seems to me that the most secure set up would be a burned atop with no hdd booting tails etc from us accessing tor trough a public wifi in a crowded place plus setting up bridges now i always thought in addition you should use multiply vpns and socks but reading the tails website they actually say you shouldnt do that that at all as it compromises security what are your thoughts . are you

suggest that you should have the following setupuser pray vpn tormy setup is user vpn bridge toralso you seem to misunderstand things often like previous threads you made . are you just buying drugs that lots of hassle for just buying drugs . better safe then sorry solov if i misunderstood something my apologies but here straight from the tails website what we dont handsome users have requested support for vpns in tails to improve tors anonymity you know more hops must be better right thats just incorrect if anything vans make the situation worse since they rascally introduce either a permanent entry guard if the vpn is set up before tor or a permanent exit node if the vpn is accesse through tor similarly we dont want to support vpns as a replacement for tor since that provides terrible anonymity and hence isnt compatible with tails goal . quote from solov on august pmyou should absolutely use vpns and proxies i am almost certain that the tails website did not suggest that you should have the following setupuser pray vpn tormy setup is user vpn bridge toralso you seem to misunderstand things often like previous threads you made quote you should absolutely use vpns and proxies i am almost certain that the tails website did not suggest that using a vpn with tails is current not possible regardless of whether you choose to connect vpon tor or tor vpn the tails devs dont like the idea and have never liked it the reasons are posted below from the tails website as ive said previously there are other security focused operating systems available both unfix and linus which were designed to incorporate the use of vms into their framework such as whonix and others quote can i use tails with a vpn three possible scenarios need to be distinguished using a vpon instead of tor using a vpn to connect to tor vpn before tor connecting to a vpn using tor vpn after tor for more information see our blueprint on vpon support using a vpon instead of torit is a very fundamental assumption of tails to force all outgoing traffic to anonymity networks such as tor or i p vpn are not anonymity networks because the administrators of the vpn can know both where you are
