ignore dash existence but i think bulk vendor buyers could think of start using them . hi there ioy why nobody use dash nucleus and abraham permit them but i still didn find any user that what to use them to buy stuff i think dash could make more anonymous transactions than btc after you could change them in btc if you think they are easier to trade i tried to stimulate dash offering some discount for who want to use them result any opinion . i got a few dashotis from abraxas from a referred share dont know who used it or which vendor was stimulating it there but i got so little i can not move

any advice most welcome what are you talking about do not fall for the mo trolls they are the oldest hat in the crypto world dash is using a masternode network of servers wordwide run by community members just as mining masternode receive of blockreward got to funding decentralized voting mixing is not just mixing with dash you mix with others over the server network you throw your cash on the table mix it through with others and get your cash back decentralized secure and anonym i am running multiply mns am mixing all the time and no problem at all popsplease someone correct me if i am wrong but darkon uses centralized nodes behind tor to add mixing capabilities to the network they say the cost of centralization is worth the risk for the anonymity it provides from day one at least a

quotedarkcoin is in my opinion more dangerous than mere bitcoin mixing because masternodes can very easily be closed masternodes ip are broadcast in plain text this means that any sufficiently mutilated organisations smo read a lot of money like many government agencies throughout the world the nsa being far from the only one can just buy a lot of drk set up a lot of masternodes and using their massive computing power execute a ddos on the masternodes they dont own until the masternodes owners give up this being done over time to not make the drk user suspicious which is all that easy since masternoding naturally encourages killing the competition since less competition means more money for you much like the poolmining economy once all the other masternodes have given up the remaining ones are the amos masternodes and then the fun begins another possibility is to simply issue a subpoena duces tecum civilist countries have something similar tied to legal interdiction to

prevents detecting a bug exploit until it is much too late also zkp is considered doubtful ring signature is backed by more than ten years of academy research first paper in and the cryptonote implementation which adds stealth addresses on top of ring signatures actually works right here right now cryptonote is decentralised mixing based on output so you dont have to fear servers going rogue or hope to have someone with the same amount of tokens to mix with there are still some edge cases where privacy can be compromise and the monero research lab composed of academy cryptographers
