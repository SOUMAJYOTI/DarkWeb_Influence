is there any danger in mixing opiates like mg oxycodone with me mipt or mixing it with me pcp or mixing all three i know mixing benzos or etizolam with opiates is dangerous but when done right its perfectly fine anyway any info would be helpful because give already searched and cant find anything on the subject im curious in the sense of self harm reduction im interested in knowing if there are any chemical interactions that would create unwonted effects from this before trying it it seems like it would be a cocktail of sorts that should probably be avoided any opinions on these matters are appreciated . i would also think that at higher doses meo could be in that numbing relaxed stage where stuff like oxus arent really needed have you ever tried lava kava perhaps me and kava could be a good relaxing combo instead . this is about mxe which isnt exactly similar to meo pcp but they are both dissociate drugs me depressants this combination potentiates the muscle relaxation sedation and amnesia caused by one another and can lead to unexpected loss of consciousness at high doses there is also an increased risk of vomiting during unconsciousness and death from the resulting suffocation if this occurs users should attempt to fall asleep in the recovery position or have a friend move them into it examples include butanediol bethel butanol benzodiazepines ghb gbl and opioids source sum it up me pcp oxycodone doesnt sound too good on the other hand meo mipt oxycodone should be day even though they could potentiate each others nausea . in advise against any such combination opiates dissociatives is gambling with your life i know of at least one instance where a well known psychedelic author died suddenly from ketamine alone that may be rare but adding opiates into the equation would be inviting disaster . is there any danger in mixing opiates like mg oxycodone with me mipt or mixing it with me pcp or mixing all three i know mixing benzos or etizolam with opiates is

daystep on october paid advise against any such combination opiates dissociatives is gambling with your life i know of at least one instance where a well known psychedelic author died suddenly from ketamine alone that may be rare but adding opiates into the equation would be inviting disaster also i am curious which author was this i want to know more about what happened . marcia moore if so she didnt die of ketamine in the winter of moore disappeared her remains were found two years later in the woods near her washington home it has been hypothesize that on a winter night in the forest moore had infected all the ketamine available to her became unconscious and died of hypothermia . thank you guys for your opinions i will not be doing opiates with dissassociatives i have done benzos and dissassociatives many times with great success low done benzo and i enjoy that and probably unless i was given something reasonable to keep me from doing it stop doing that combo because it makes my me visuals way more intense it keeps my headspace clearer and it makes me feel like im traveling through eternity for hours and hours last night i did small dose beno oxycodone and mg smoked me mipt i wont do that again it was like i bipolar mania one minute dosing off next minute intense stimulation sexual tension pacing back and forth no panic or fear at all but not quite comfortable with slight visuals i would just stick to benzo and mipt or opiate and mipt but all three was way too all over the place . quote from daystep on october paid advise against any such combination opiates
