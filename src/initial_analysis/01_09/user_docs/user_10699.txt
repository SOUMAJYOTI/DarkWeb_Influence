be for i knew anything about anything of tor tails darknet ect i had zero zero opsec for web surfing didnt even have virus or malware protection i googled tor to find it in the first place read about it in an article watched all kinds of movies and tv shows from questionable sources in movie k zmovie project free tv and of course frequented many born sites i had nothing on my computer but some downloaded born pictures movies a couple roms and emulators and the cookbook didnt really care at the time about security i have since moved tor off my hdd i have tails in a usb a usb for a vm and tails together and i have done an out of box factory reset to my machine running windows i read not to long after i downloaded tor that anyone that googled tor would have prying eyes placed on them for this reason i did the reset does anyone out there know if this will delete any malware that may have been place on my hard drive or is there malware out there that can hide from such a thing i plan or doing yet another wipe before i try to buy anything out of well placed paranoia and because it is rather simple and relatively quick to perform i use the computer for school now too so keeping
