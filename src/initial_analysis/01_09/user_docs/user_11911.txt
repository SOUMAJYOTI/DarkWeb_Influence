an admin of a soon to be launched mult sig only drugs only dnm i am posting here today to invite high quality us vendors to beta test our market i realize that some vendors might not want to be part of a multi sig only market because of how tedious and time consuming signing transactions is rest assured our multi sig implementation is such that it allows mufti sig to be secure while still being easy and intuitive to use if you heard the buyers are unwilling to use mufti sig because its difficult and time consuming know that is not a problem with havana in fact from the buyers side of the transaction it feels just like a central crow transaction once you give it a try i am confident you will see the benefits of using our market for your business to become a beat testing vendor you must meet these requirements you must be a vendor on bb agora or have been a vendor on evolution you must have at least a rating you must be locked in the us you must have been a vendor for at least months

showing cannabis and mushroom listings why us only we are starting with havana in the us to make sure our servers can handle the traffic and so that if they can not we can upgrade accordingly if we choose to bring you on i will give you multiply buyer registration codes so that you may invite a few of your loyal customers to help with the beta testing as well as create an account for yourself to

about the similarities between havana absolem and cr alpaca . quote from the other walter on april pm probablefire any official statement about the similarities between havana absolem and cr alpaca im picking up this question for pf tbh id say jack did a good job answering the question but if you want to hear it from me you can the similarities you mention are skin deep every web designer i have ever worked with has borrowed liberally and even stolen wholesale from other sites did we steal page and form designs from alpaca probably because evan and me both considered alpaca the best looking market to date that is just standard operating procedure in this business is your concern that we might be running havana on alpacas compromise code base no were not we dont have access and never did have access to alpacas code page only the screen images if you spent as much time actually using havana as you have spreading fud and questioning the integrity of other people i think that would be pretty obvious fidel castro . quote from the other walter on april pm probablefire any official statement about the similarities between havana absolem and cr alpaca im curious what similarities youre talking about did you do much business on cr or alpaca did you test the havana beta i used to vend on cannabis road and alpaca and tested the havana market last week the way multisig transactions are professed is night and day different between havana and those other two markets alpacas and cr were seamless multisig where the market held private keys havana is true secure multisig from what i can tell are you talking about visual style user interface elements im guessing thats probably got everything to do with using the same web frameworks or css templates probably the same explanation for

cant seem to find the url for absolem anyone able to help me out . for what its worth im as guilty as jackblue for promoting shifty markets we vended on and have acknowledged same in previous posts the problem as always on the darknet is how do you know who what to trust the basin answer is no one but that leaves us all not doing much of anything doesnt it so either you jump in and take some risk or you dont its a personal decision we each have to make i made a foolish decision to support marijuana only markets for a while just because they were marijuana only got burned twice and will not do so again i imagine its easy to think that some of us vendors were in on the scam and of course there is no way to prove otherwise but the fact is that we are growers that is our business and its very foolish to risk our primary income stream for a dubious and impossible to guarantee percentage of profit from an exit scam not to mention that its just not part of our carmi profile to earn our living through theft the reason i am mildly positive about havana absolem is that they have a strong multisig implementation i dont know if they have a tutorial up yet about how vendors and buyers can complete transactions on our own if the market disappears outside the market but they will soon if its not up yet and i will make sure they post it here as well and it should be a method that we can actually test and use while the market is up so we know it works if they do that and finish the other tutorials give asked them to prepare then id say were good to move forward tentative as we must with any new marketplace anyone who has been on the darknet for long has written things they regret it doesn make us scammers it just makes us fallible and human . i cant seem to find the url for
