now this is from inforwars com so take it with a grain of salt because ale jones is a bit out in space that however doesn mean its wrong quote from inforwars comglenn greenwald the journalist who broke the edward snowden revelations has come good on his promise that fresh information on the asa s mass spying would be forthcoming today he reveals that the us government agency routine intercepts computer hardware such as routers switches and servers and fits it with cutting edge surveillance equipment before sending it back on its way in an article for the guardian greenwald notes that the asa tampers with the hardware then repackages it with factory sealing before sending it off to unsuspecting companies who have no idea it has been intercepted greenland notes that the practice constitutes an extreme form of gross hypocrisy given that it has been warning companies around the world not to buy chinese hardware because it may be set up with surveillance technology the revelation again comes from documents leaned to greenwald by former nsa employee edward snowden specifically a june report from the head of the asa s access and target development department states that us made hardware is received by the nsa before it is shipped oversea greenwald writes the agency then implants backdoor surveillance tools repackages the devices with a factory seal and sends them on the asa thus gains access to entire networks and all their users the document gleeful observes that some sigint tradecraft is very hands on literally in one recent case after several months a beacon implanted through supply chain interdiction called back to the asa covert infrastructure this call back provided us access to further exploit the device and survey the network the nsa document reads chinese routers and servers represent not only economic competition but also surveillance competition greenwald writes in a follow up interview with nor greenwald stated that while intercepting equipment known to be on its way to terrorists may be acceptable to some a system has been built without our knowledge that has incredible dangers embedded within and very few controls greenwald notes that the nsa essentially believes it has the right to monitor all communications on the planet he cites an asa plan to tap into conversations originating from airplanes for no particular reason it s just simply the fact that they do not think anybody should be able to communicate anywhere on the earth without they being able to invade it greenwald said greenwald added that he believes the issue today is more pressing than previous asa revelations in because it concerns domination of the internet and globe communications in general with former nsa head michael hayden also making statements such as we kill people based on metadata this sentiment will only be accepted more readily both by critics of the spy agency and everyday americans alike source . quote from ant r on may pmif theres

blockchain wallet then i transfered those coins to bitcoin fog after the network confirmations i was able to submit for a withdrawal request hours is the minimum for bitcoin fog withdrawl so i had it sent to my easy coin wallet went to bed and when i woke up i had all my coins safley on the darkweb in my easy coin wallet yay right so then i learned about electrum so i decided to install it and transfer from easy coin to electrum now that the btc are clean i can put them into office storage right easy coin says they do not take a fee the only fee is the miner fee of btc so i tried to transfer my balance and was confronted with an error saying balance too low it wanted me to leave btc to facilitate the miner fee okay i am fine with that so i take my ballance and subtract btc and try to resubmit error same problem i had to subtract btc to get the transation to process leaving btc in the wallet okay whatever but now i have lost btc to this wallet not impressed so i wasted fogging the coins a prince i am more than willing to pay to mix my coins but then i lost another to the effing wallet no thank you i done mind paying to fog the coins but paying twice no thank you .

actually is true and its kinda old news there are articles a few other places but not much govt does a good job of keeping the good info off the big news outlets asa has us cables with transmitters in them to spyon computers that r office rf freq i think you can barely tell the difference between then you really have to look hard with their budgets i doubt intercepting on a massive scale is feasible yet but a lot of manufacturers have backdoors sometimes in their chipsets now many foreign companies dont because the asa dont have much power over them as with the us corps quoteyeah now i have a question well sort of not but i have a chinese modem and an american router are they going to have conflicting back door issues lmfao no since im sure theyre the same exact exploits hahaquotedoes anyone have any ideas on ways to properly protect themselves from this type of intrusion depending on your knowledge and income not much theres services that willsweep for bugs aaaaaaaaallllll types for k or if u build ur own computers know a lot bout them it can still be very hard but there is some info out there shows what to look for which chipsets firmware brands etc if u build ur own you are most likely safe for now unless high profile if u have a hp dell etc u likely already have it built in but again unless hi profile its highly unlikely so far used to be getting phone tapped mean u were a drug kingpin my ll sisters phone is tapped lol . this actually is true and its kinda old news there are articles a few other places but not much govt does a good job of

in but again unless hi profile its highly unlikely so far used to be getting phone tapped mean u were a drug kingpin my ll sisters phone is tapped lol . this actually is true and its kinda old news there are articles a few other places but not much govt does a good job of keeping the good info off the big news outlets asa has us cables with transmitters in them to spyon computers that r office
