im trying to post my way out of the beginners board so i might as well post some useful shit i didnt write this i found it on the clearnet by someone named cyber hydra its a summary of a defcon talk about people getting sucked using tor nothing groundbreaking here but fuck it dropping docs on darknets how people got caught is adria crenshaws defcon talk in a nut shell you may find it here crenshaw discusses the ways in which one could keep his her anonymity through the cyphernet anonymizing networks such as tor and others like it by taking heed of certain mistakes made by eld kim harvardbomb threat hector xavier monsegur sabu and jeremy hammond lulzsec erie eoin marques freedom hosting and ross ulbricht the silk road first i will summarize there mistakes then i will list the lessons learned eld kim harvard bomb threat eldo makes a bomb threat to harvards student news paper and some other harvard officials of all the reasonsunder the sun to do something like this his was that he wanted to get out of a final exam maybe if we putour heads together we could come up with a less discriminating way to get out of a final exam less incriminating meaning no prison time if caught img though he uses tor to send the threat via email all tor exit nodes are publicly listed unless you use a tor bridge bridges are not publicly listed as tor nodes you will give the authorities an obvious starting point from which to launch there investigation but thats not the worst mistake it gets better he connects to tor through his student account because of this fact and the fact that he was the only one connected to tor at the time the email was sent twas easy for them to correlate that he may have sent the threat as if that wasnt enough eldo puts the final nail in his own coffin by actually admitting that he was the one who made the bomb threat more details x suspect learned from eld dont be the only person using tor on a monitor network at a given time use a bridge dont admit anything correlation attacks are a bitch note watch out for dns leaks hector xavier monsegur sabu and jeremy hammond sup g lulzsec hector was already being watched by the fbi however his mistake was that he became laxidaisical slipping up he connected to irc without tor when he normal would this allowed the fbi to get his home ipaddress he sang like a caged canary after being cought and then proseeded to setup his cohert jeremy hammond jeremy otherwise known as sup g when speaking with hector on ira spoke carelessly of places he had previously been arrested and other groups that he was involved with the fbi used this information to narrow their suspectpool and allowed them to obtain a court order to monitor his internet traffic once again correlation proves to be a bitch img i say this because although the fbi did not exploit tor to bust jeremy they were however able to correlate the times sup g spoke with sabu on irc with when jeremy was at home using his computer more details

communicate using alliases if you follow the anonymous act you are technically part although to be recognized you must create an allias and talk in chat rooms anons usually use ira chat particularly hecat and chatzilla which is an addon for firefox and of course tor one can not ben arrested for being related to anonymous or lulled nor any hactivist group not all anonymous members do illegal

point bones in certain respects the more one does to obfuscate oneself beyond what most of us do like using tor out of the box the more its possible to be noticed the trick to staying alive on the darknet is to appear as just another regular punter looking for retain amounts of weed or some other relatively innoxious behavior and never ever give out honest details of your life especially if you like ulbricht did have a real life web presence personally im a fat middle aged man who buys weed from sketch teenagers and resells it online as top shelf a organic and give managed to fool everyone with my pretty strain descriptions well no i am perhaps too honest about that stuff but then those are the kinds of details that its impossible for le to use in a correlation attack because i would never talk about such things on a site that has my do anyway but if for example i was a huge big lebowski fan with a photo of the dude as my avatar on clearnet forums and then i came onto the darknet to sell a strain i call the big lebowski that would be terrible opsec i do love the movie but who doesnt now if instead i came on the hub and gave out numerous details of films and bands i love and i also have a facebook page that lists those exact films bands as favorites that becomes more of a correlate able data set that said i am nowhere near as high profile a target as dpr was so to some extent that protects me but at the same time i like to sleep without paranoid dreams so i let my personality speak for me instead of details about my likes and real life preferences for music etc now for a casual purchaser of personal use amounts of drugs all this might be over cautious but as a vendor its basin opsec thats what surprises me guns forgetting to use tor to log onto irc or ross

that could be all it takes maybe women are better at that kind of stuff by nature after all life is more dangerous for us in many ways so we tend to be more grounded than men what doesnt surprise me is when people start to confess things about themselves like that guy did about his arrests we all have a strong need to connect with other people and le relies on that to doxx us its just so human and they prey on it if you ever feel the urge to get confession save it for your clearnet presence the darknet is not the place . quote from cornelius on may amquote from pallidpallas on may pmquote

got busted is something you should pay attention to clearnet most of the article the courier mail can reveal task force argos investigators were behind the high profile arrest of carer shannon grant mccoole last year mccoole had equally abused at least seven children in his care and his arrest sparked a royal commission into the child protection system in south australia but the clean cut public servant was hiding another secret queensland s argos had identified him as the head administrator of a member pedophile site on the dark web the site which can not be named under court suppression orders required members to post hard core pre then child abuse videos or images every days members used tor computer software to mask their identity making them almost impossible to trace cannon grant mccoole was identified him as the head administrator of a member pedophile site the longer they stayed on the site the more access they were granted with vip forums and a private area for people who posted new or rare content at the top of the hierarchy was an altar exclusive producer s area reserved for members who abused children on demand and posted footage or photos every two weeks to prove it was original material the producers displayed their handle or username on notes during the abuse and staged the scene with a designated item because of a series of other take downs of pedophile networks on the dark web the site became the biggest of its kind with more than posts and topics for years australian and international police had known a mystery australian man was running the forum but had been frustratingly unable to identify him argos in particular had been looking into the site since mid when they had arrested a pedophile during a separate investigation and discovered he was a vp member however the needle in a haystack breakthrough came when argob victim identification manager paul griffiths last year noticed the head administrator habitually used an unusual greeting in online communications scouring the web for other instances of this greeting griffiths zeroed in on mccoole who had been chatting on related innoxious internet forums not only did mccoole use similar language but the handles he went by were startlingly similar to the one used by the administrator on the abuse site as griffiths looked into schoole s background he learned he had access to a wide variety of children through his role at families sa and alarm bells rang with children in danger police immediately coordinated a raid on schoole s home in adelaide his computer was logged on to the site with his username visible confirming the arrest of one of the biggest players in child pornography globally taskforce argos detective inspector jon rouse said the operation should send a message to pedophiles that they were never beyond reach the dark net areas are perceived as being safe for the sexual exploitation of children the work performed by argob detectives through this operation has proved that is not the case insp rouse said after his arrest two argos detectives joint assumed schoole s online identity and their squad began a gruelling operation to bring the site and its users down one of their first actions was to shut down the producers section to protect children from further harm while they hunted their abusers over the next six months the detectives secretly ran the site from brisbane s police hq while feeding information to international law enforcement colleagues to take down the network s top echelon one of the officers who took over schoole s identity said the fraught task stretched police to their limits he doesn t take days off he d been in that community for a very long time he held a very prominent role in that community and he was quite well known by a lot of people it was a lot of work and a lot of stress the officer said after one key arrest of a co administrator in the netherlands argos was able to move the computer server hosting the site to brisbane giving them full access to every private message and exchange between members the operation has now closed and the site has been shut down running a pedophile network is a federal offence carrying a maximum penalty of years in jail and prosecutors are pushing for a record benchmark sentence for mccoole he has pleaded guilty to charges of unlawful sexual intercourse aggravated indecent assault and gross indecency and to the production dissemination and possession of child exploitation material sentencing hearings are ongoing ok the thing of most interest to me was the paragraph scouring the web for other instances of this greeting griffiths zeroed in on mccoole who had been chatting on related innoxious internet forums not only did mccoole use similar language but the handles he went by were startlingly similar to the one used by the administrator on the abuse site it wasnt some cracked pgp key or compromise email server or high tech nsa sniffing gizmo just basin fucking stupidity . youre so right hackerjon people need to keep their darknet persona and their real life identity completely separate from one another in every possible way the use of all forms of

schoole s online identity and their squad began a gruelling operation to bring the site and its users down one of their first actions was to shut down the producers section to protect children from further harm while they hunted their abusers over the next six months the detectives secretly ran the site from brisbane s police hq while feeding information to international law enforcement colleagues to take down the network s top echelon one of the officers who took over schoole s identity said the fraught task stretched police to their limits he doesn t take days off he d been in that community for a very long time he held a very prominent role in that community and he was quite well known by a lot of people it was a lot of work and a lot of stress the officer said after one key arrest of a co administrator in the netherlands argos was able to move the computer server hosting the site to brisbane giving them full access to every private message and exchange between members the operation has now closed and the site has been shut down running a pedophile network is a federal offence carrying a maximum penalty of years in jail and prosecutors are pushing for a record benchmark sentence for mccoole he has pleaded guilty to charges of unlawful sexual intercourse aggravated indecent assault and gross indecency and to the production dissemination and possession of child exploitation material sentencing hearings are ongoing ok the thing of most interest to me was the paragraph scouring the web for other instances of this greeting griffiths zeroed in on mccoole who had been chatting on related innoxious internet forums not only did mccoole use similar language but the handles he went by were startlingly similar to the one used by the administrator on the abuse site it wasnt some cracked pgp key or compromise email server or high tech nsa sniffing gizmo just basin fucking stupidity in america he would be sentenced to years in federal prison no question about it the administrator of freedom hosting as well as louisa city pedoempire and other pedophile sites was arrested in ireland by the fbi if found guilty only in ireland he would be sentenced to years in prison if found guilty of charges in the u s he would face years in federal prison same thing here if he is just found guilty in his native australia he would be sentenced to a maximum of years in prison if he was found guilty in the united states he will be sentenced to years in federal prison . quote from bernard marx on june amquote from zaphod on june this style matching is one of

at work all the time and i will never understand the obsession some people have with it all i couldnt agree with you more for the life of me i simply can not understand the attraction that social media holds for people another thing that puzzles me is this constant need to be in touch ive had younger people tell me that email is too slow they want to use instant messengers of one sort or another the literal explosion in the use of smartphones has me baffled it simply can not be that important to be connected we have become a society of unthinking robots the device beeps and the person automatically without thinking reaches for the device to see who is calling texting etc this has risen to the level of a conditioned response people do it even in the most inappropriate of circumstances e g while driving the saddest case i can recall was a young man who was on his way home when his wife or girlfriend texted him to drive safely by automatically reaching for the phone to see who was calling texting he took his eyes off the road with the result that he lost control of the car and hit a tree killing himself zaphodyoure right on the mark there zaph everywhere you look today whether youre stopped in a car waiting for pedestrians to cross the road on a train walking through a shopping centre or just out for a nightly stroll you cant help but notice the constant use of phones while being out and about some are talking on them some are writing an sms or an email some are listening to music or even playing a game while doing other meaningful tasks which require their attention too people dont even look where theyre going anymore todays phone is more like a fashion accessory and has become just as important as the wallet or purse we all carry around with us in today world you just cant leave home without it due to our reliance on it for many of our everyday needs its rascally a mine pc with email and interest access a calculator a world wide temperature gauge a world clock a timer a stopwatch a gaming console an e reader a portable device capable of playing movies in hd a digital photo gallery a modern musical boom box loaded with tunes a gas navigation device an fm am radio plus loads of other things should the user ever need them some apps are already installed on the phone and others can be download from their respective on line sites if required bring back the days when a phone could only be used to make and receive calls and if your lucky send or receive a text message . quote from zaphod on june this style matching is one of the

not interesting in our case all the cryptographic details are provided in its not particularlyhelpful to repeat them here keeping in mind that otrs key exchange diseased on diffie hellman combined with some symmetry crypto and a signaturescheme will suffice after the key exchange phase each party will have anumber of symmetry keys for encryption and authentication those arederived from the diffie hellman master key by hashing it in various ways encryption and mac key will obviously be different the messages are encrusted using aes in ctr mode and each message is macedusing the symmetry key material that offers us confidentiality andintegrity its important to note that only symmetry keys are used forth actual payload crypto the dsa master keys are only used in the initialkey exchange

we can move on todeniability during the conversation both parties can be sure that themessages they receive are authentic and not modified by an attacker it immediately clear that the message authenticity can not be verified withoutthe mac key if one of the conversation partners wants to convince a thirdparty that a message is authentic this conversation partner implicitlyproofs his knowledge of the mac key to the third party but then again thether party can not be sure that the conversation partner didn fake themessage he can do this as he knows the mac key this is what we call weakdeniability obviously or offers weak deniability as messageauthentication is performed using only symmetry primitives but otr offerseven more in every message the sending party includes a newdiffie hellman key exchange proposal the proposal is also covered by themac to rule out mitm attacks so both parties frequently generate new keymaterial and this lets us do a nice trick as soon as they generate newmac keys they publicly disclose the old mac keys the old keys arent usedanymore so this is safe but as the mac keys are public everybody couldcreate fake messages and compute proper macs for those this is what wecall strong deniability otr ships with a toolkit containing software foractually forging messages depending on how much you already know only them keys mac and encryption keys mac keys and some message plaintext you can use different tools to forge messages if you know parts of theplaintext and the mac keys you can exploit the fact that aes is used incur mode to directly modify the known parts of the plaintext if there isno known plaintext the otr remac tool might helpful every messagecontains a new diffie hellman key exchange proposal in plaintext uncovered by the mac now you can simply replace that proposal by one thatyou generated e g using the or sesskeys tool and compute a new mac forthe packet that allows you to easily fake the rest of the conversation you know your own private diffie hellman key so you can generate plausible set of mac and encryption keys and just use that one it willlook legitimate because the modified packet containing your key exchangedata still has a valid mac the attackthe deniability of or stems from the fact that a third party does not knowwhether a message has been sent during a conversation and before the mackeys were disclosed or was generated afterwards when the mac keys werepublic an obvious way to attack ours deniability would therefore be just monitor all the otr traffic between a and b if one party now decidesto disclose the mac and encryption keys used for a particular message theauthenticity of that message can be verified and as the message has beenrecorded during the

knows all the keys she could generatesuch fake messages alice knows that this problem could be fixed if thepolice sniffed all the traffic themselves but she also knows that this isgoing to be difficult so she comes up with a second idea why not use trusted third party instead of submitting her messages to the police she will just discloseher private dsa key to her lawyer then during her

smpprotocol but thats not interesting in our case all the cryptographic details are provided in its not particularlyhelpful to repeat them here keeping in mind that otrs key exchange diseased on diffie hellman combined with some symmetry crypto and a signaturescheme will suffice after the key exchange phase each party will have anumber of symmetry keys for encryption and authentication those arederived from the diffie hellman master key by hashing it in various ways encryption and mac key will obviously be different the messages are encrusted using aes in ctr mode and each message is macedusing the symmetry key material that offers us confidentiality andintegrity its important to note that only symmetry keys are used forth actual payload crypto the dsa master keys are only used in the initialkey exchange phase the next feature were going to look at is forward secrecy forward secrecymeans that even if the dsa key of a participant is disclosed pastconversations can not be compromise forward secrecy in otr is establishedby the diffie hellman protocol after a conversation ends both parties cansafely wipe the diffie hellman key that they generated there is no way foran attacker and not even for the conversation partners to re compute thatkey afterwards to do that one would either need to know the privateexponent of one party which is of course also wiped from memory or onewould need to derive the key from the public information exchanged betweenboth parties which is insensible hopefully thats what diffie hellmanrelies on in the first place having understood how or provides forward secrecy we can move on todeniability during the conversation both parties can be sure that themessages they receive are authentic and not modified by an attacker it immediately clear that the message authenticity can not be verified withoutthe mac key if one of the conversation partners wants to convince a thirdparty that a message is authentic this conversation partner implicitlyproofs his knowledge of the mac key to the third party but then again thether party can not be sure that the conversation partner didn fake themessage he can do this as he knows the mac key this is what we call weakdeniability obviously or offers weak deniability as messageauthentication is performed using only symmetry primitives but otr offerseven more in every message the sending party includes a newdiffie hellman key exchange proposal the proposal is also covered by themac to rule out mitm attacks so both parties frequently generate new keymaterial and this lets us do a nice trick as soon as they generate newmac keys they publicly disclose the old mac keys the old keys arent usedanymore so this is safe but as the mac keys are public everybody couldcreate fake messages and compute proper macs for those this is what wecall strong deniability otr ships with a toolkit containing software foractually forging messages depending on how much you already know only them keys mac and encryption keys mac keys and some message plaintext you can use different tools to forge messages if you know parts of theplaintext and the mac keys you can exploit the fact that aes is used incur mode to directly modify the known parts of the plaintext if there isno known plaintext the otr remac tool might helpful every messagecontains a new diffie hellman key exchange proposal in plaintext uncovered by the mac now you can simply replace that proposal by one thatyou generated e g using the or sesskeys tool and compute a new mac forthe packet that allows you to easily fake the rest of the conversation you know your own private diffie hellman key so you can generate plausible set of mac and encryption keys and just use that one it willlook legitimate because the modified packet containing your key exchangedata still has a valid mac the attackthe deniability of or stems from the fact that a third party does not knowwhether a message has been sent during a conversation and before the mackeys were disclosed or was generated afterwards when the mac keys werepublic an obvious way to attack ours deniability would therefore be just monitor all the otr traffic between a and b if one party now decidesto disclose the mac and encryption keys used for a particular message theauthenticity of that message can be verified and as the message has beenrecorded during the conversation i e before the mac keys were public the recording party knows that it was not generated afterwards lets look at a real life example to shed some more light on what weredoing imagine two hackers a and b who want to talk about serious stuff tm using or both of them are slightly paranoid and done trust eachother in particular bob fears that alice might backstab him however asotr is desirable bob assumes that even if alice discloses the contents their conversation he could still plausibly argue that alice just made itup to discredit him so bob ignores his paranoia and tells alice hissecrets alice indeed plans to backstab bob her first plan is simple shewill just submit all the encrusted and authenticated messages to thepolice the police will later be able to state in court that alice didntfake the messages after the conversation she however quickly realizes thatthis approach is inherent flowed bob could argue that alice just sentfake messages to the police as alice knows all the keys she could generatesuch fake messages alice knows that this problem could be fixed if thepolice sniffed all the traffic themselves but she also knows that this isgoing to be difficult so she comes up with a second idea why not use trusted third party instead of submitting her messages to the police she will just discloseher private dsa key to her lawyer then during her conversation with bob she will use her lawyer as a proxy i e she will let him do thecrypto this way the lawyer can be sure that the conversation isauthentic the judges will trust alices lawyer in court at least theylltrust him more than they trust alice so her problem is solved alicessetup would look like this alice non or maybe sal v lawyer trust speaks for police court alice otr bob thinks he talks to alice v bob but now alice realizes that she doesnt trust her lawyer enough to give himher private dsa key he could misuse it to impersonate her also alicedoubts that her lawyers words would be trusted enough in court this example shows the problems that alice has when she wants to break thedeniability of otr her problems can be summarized as follows well snowball the police the observing party and the lawyer will be called trusted third party a the observing party needs to sniff the network traffic that implies quite a privileged network position as the traffic needs to be sniffed passively i e without the help of a or b because if a or b would send their traffic to the observing party a or b might just insert bogs messages into their sniff stream and the observing party couldnt be sure about the authenticity even worse paranoid a and b could use an anonymizing network so that sniffing their traffic would be a non trivial task b also the authenticity of a message can only be proved to the observing party but not to anybody else as anybody else didnt sniff the traffic and the observing party could just have cut some pieces or inserted new ones problem b is not that much of importance just imagine the observing partyas the police the judges or even fnord you should always assume that theobserving party is exactly the guys you wan a protect yourself against ifyou think that the police probably wont even get all the crypto stuff andtherefore just believe any plainest logfile you show them thats of youre probably right there might however be agencies that would normally trust plainest logs and those agencies might be very interested inthe contents of some or conversations problem a remains open obviously neither a nor b really trust theobserving party if we had a trusted third party we actually could mountan attack against ours deniability just as described in the lawyerexample above well lucky us neither a nor b nor the observing partytrust anybody and therefore there will be no trusted third party really interesting a trusted third party can be emulate using securefunction evaluation this is what we didnt tell in the section above youcan view a secure function evaluation scheme as a replacement for a trustedthird party so instead of letting a third party compute some functionf x y a and b can perform the computation on their own and still get theame result both players only receive f x y but a doesn see y and bdoesnt see x so the main idea of our attack is emulate a trusted thirdparty using secure function evaluation the setup that alice now plans isthe following alice sfe voodoo for emulating the lawyer v police court otr v bob our central idea is the following a can send all the messages she receivedfrom b to the observing party the police in the figure above but thatcould really be everyone the messages are still encrusted so this is not problem to make sure that the messages are not faked by a we need make sure that a can not produce valid macs without the help of theobserving party we therefore share the mac key between a and the observingparty every time a wants to validate or produce a mac she has tocooperate with the observing party later on a can reveal the encryptionkey for any message to the observing party which can be sure that themessage is authentic in the following section we will provide a high level overviewof the attack in section you can find the actual protocol that aliceand the observing party use . i was cruising around a deep part of marianas web on my quantum d wave and i ran across an interesting proof of concept describing an attack against the otr protocol the majority of it is highly mathematical describing the encryption schemes and attach mechanisms and such but there is a part of it that might be interesting to readers here it gives an overview of the situation if anyone wants i can post the whole thing but right now it seems pointless unless you want to implement the attack enjoy otrfor those who are not familiar with the otr protocol this section mightprovide some help otr features a number of cryptographic properties

advantage of the same principle to hide your own shit such as messages or secret keys in images and also how to read them back out of course the example in this article uses hali linux as its platform but i suppose you can extend the idea to any linus base particularly the design base enjoy or not steganography is the practice of concealing a file message image or video within another file message image or video the word steganography combines the greek words steganos meaning covered concealed or protected and graphein meaning writing the first recorded use of the term was in by johannes trithemius in steganographia a treatise on cryptography and steganography which was disguised as a book about magic wikipedia the general concept is hiding messages that covertly appear to be or be part of something innoxious such as images articles shopping lists or a cover text for example the hidden message may be in invisible ink between the visible lines of a private letter some implementations of steganography lack a shared secret key and are forms of security through obscurity whereas key dependent steganographic schemes adhere to kerckhoffs s principle for more information about this please see advantage of steganography over cryptography is that the secret message does not attract attention to itself as an object of scrutiny plainly visible encrusted messages no matter how unspeakable arouse interest and may be incriminating in countries where encryption is illegal or encryption keys are required to be accessible cryptography is the practice of protecting the contents of a message whereas steganography is concerned with concealing the fact that a secret message is locked within the message content steganography includes the concealment of information within computer files in digital steganography electric communications may include steganographic coding within the transported medium such as a document file an image file a program or a protocol media files are ideal for steganographic transmission because of the potentially large size which makes detection difficult for example a sender might start with an innoxious image file and adjust the color of every th pixel to correspond to a letter in the alphabet this is a technique that is so subtle it would be almost impossible to notice unless looking directly for this adjustment part ii steganography in action using hali linuxnote steghide only works with au bmp jpeg or wav files if you want to use a different file format you will need to use a different tool to hide your secret

digital steganography electric communications may include steganographic coding within the transported medium such as a document file an image file a program or a protocol media files are ideal for steganographic transmission because of the potentially large size which makes detection difficult for example a sender might start with an innoxious image file and adjust the color of every th pixel to correspond to a letter in the alphabet this is a technique that is so subtle it would be almost impossible to notice unless looking directly for this adjustment part ii steganography in action using hali linuxnote steghide only works with au bmp jpeg or wav files if you want to use a different file format you will need to use a different tool to hide your secret messages inside images you will need to download some tools a popular tool i like to use is steghide which you can install on kali linux here are the steps to using the tool step installing steghideyou will need to install a tool that lets you hide messages you only have to install the tool one time and it is not provided as an included module with hali linux apt get install steghidestep create a text file with your hidden messageafter you get comfortable with steghide you can use more advanced command line features but for now let s simply create a text file with our hidden message feel free to use a text editor of your choice i simply used vi to create a text file called my secret txt with the message my voice is my passport don t forget to save your file next we will use steghide to embed the hidden message into the seraphic file the seraphic file i used was a simple drawing of my home lab network as you can see it is an ordinary jpg file step using steghide to hide your messagewe will use a couple of basin options with steghide ebed ef is option to embed the secret message txt cf is image file we will use jpg is a pic file which obfuscates the messageyou ll see a line to input a password or passphrase within the germinal screen create one you can remember or do the unthinkable and write it down we then successfully ebed the message into our image thus hiding secret the message you can also compare the original file to the stenographic file which is now considerably larger than the original the hash values of the modified file and the original file are now different as well step reading the embedded secret messageokay now that we know how to hide a message how do we read the message from the image file we will use the extract sf command steghide extract of attack lab jpegpart iii exif metadatain addition to hiding secret messages in images the file s metadata can also contain some very interesting and useful information attackers sometime hide information in the metadata as well exiftool is a hali linux application that allows a user to view and manipulate the image s metadata let s go back to our image file attack lab jpeg and view the metadata using exiftool exiftool attack lab jpegyou can see there is a variety of interesting information about this image file if the file has the necessary metadata you can view the following file creation and modification dates camera model used to take the picture geolocation gps information contained in the picture applications used to create or edit the filestep adding a comment in the metadatai can also create a comment in the metadata when i created my hidden message using steganography i also needed to use a passphrase to encrypt my file perhaps i want my passphrase to be easily accessible note this is just an example i realize this is extremely secure because metadata is very easy to scan we will use exiftool with the comment our comment command to achieve this step searching for passwords in metadataas a word of caution i have seen many people think they are being clever by using this method when trying to hide information unlike steganography information in an image s metadata is not encrusted you can use the strings command to search all metadata that might contain passwords . quote from zaphod on july pmquote from hansmann on july pmdont you mean suds apt get install steghide rather than apt

crowd funded effort was already underway to perform a professional security audit of truecrypt s source code and its cryptography implementations the first phase which analyzed the truecrypt driver and other critical parts of the code had already been completed when truecrypt was discontinued the auditors found no high severity issues or evidence of intentional backdoors in the program it s impossible to tell if the new flaws discovered by forshaw were introduced intentionally or not but they do show that despite professional code audits serious bugs can remain undiscovered the first phase of the truecrypt audit project performed by security engineers from is partners a subsidiary of information assurance company not group covered the driver code but windows drivers are complex beasts and it s easy to miss local elevation of privilege flaws forshaw said on twitter the google researcher hasn t disclosed details about the two bugs yet saying that he usually waits seven days after a patch is released to open his bug reports digital keysince truecrypt is no longer actively maintained the bugs won t be fixed directly in the program s code however they have been fixed in veracrypt an open source program based on the truecrypt code that aims to continue and improve the original project veracrypt that was released saturday contains patches for the two vulnerabilities identified as cve and cve as well as for other bugs the program s developer only flagged the cve flaw as critical and said that it can be explained by abusing drive letter handling there are still many users of truecrypt or veracrypt because it s one of the few free options they have for encrypting their entire hard disks including the windows system partition microsoft s bitlocker is not available on home editions of windows which come pre installed on many consumer laptops and most other programs that can encrypt the system partition require a paid license users who still use truecrypt should switch to veracrypt as soon as possible in addition to patches for these two flaws the program also has other security improvements over its predecessor . quote from lock one on october pmwell general a user publication pcworld seemed to be aware of the possibilities of compromise all honesty it only affects the windows driver for truecrypt which is an operating system all darknet users should know by now to avoid like the plague the two vulnerabilities are capable of either exploiting a flaw allowing the elevation privileges for an attacker or another flaw which can be explained by abusing drive letter handling as posted the simple remedy is to just use the latest patched version of veracrypt the encryption software replacement of truecrypt which is no longer being maintained by its developers imo linux users should be looking at using lurks dmcrypt for their encryption needs rascally this is yet another example of why all darknet users should avoid using a pc running windows and switch to using a pc running a linux unix operating system of their own choosing . well general a user publication pcworld seemed to be aware of the possibilities of compromise .

post made in a shroomery forum by a user going under the name of altoid in fact ulbrichts habits almost made correlating a none essential the fbi claims the former physics and engineering student even publicly alluded to his alleged criminal enterprise on his linkedin profile with a statement describing how his goals had shifted in accordance with his librarian economic views since leaving glad school at pennsylvania state university this statement comes from a cnn web site under an article titled how abi caught ross ulbricht alleged creator of criminal marketplace silk road of the other sites where the fbi found him marketing his site bitcointalk was one of them with all of the effort he puts behind making sure that people knew how to get to the silk road by explaining how too use tor and then by posting the link as if the explanation wasnt enough to his site he makes it hard for me not to believe that he may be suspect whatmakes it even worst is that ulbrichts bitcointalk account handle was also avoid he makes the very same mistake yet again by posting in the same forum bitcointalk a request for a pro it guy under an account also named avoid and routing all replies to rossulbritcht at girl dot com the request was titled it pro venture backed bitin startup the list goes on he made little to no effort in shedding the connections between his true identity and the one with which he operated the silk road dread pirate roberts for instance dread pirate roberts had a link to themises institute as part of his silk road forum signature and ulbrichts google profile show that hes also inter rested in the mises institue he did stuff like this time and time again like using tor to connect to stackoverflow and creating an account using his real name notice he posted the operating system he uses ubuntu this is getting redundant so i think ill stop here and just list what we can learn from mr ulbricht if you want to read in detail you can find slides and video here rascally he made a plethora of connections to his real identity he would go as far as the neighborhood starbucks or library which was rite around the corner from his house to logon to and administrate his silk road onion the us customs had intercepted allof his fake ids because although he changed his name on his id cards he never changed his face them it was mistakes like these that lead to his arrest and the take down of the silk road more details e roberts plaint pdflessons learned keep online identities separate keep different usernames from different locations have a consistent story dont talk about personal interests dont volunteer information . quote from pallidpallas on may pmquote from spendingtime on may pmquote from pallidpallas on may pmquote from angel eyes on may am thats what surprises me guns forgetting to use tor to log onto irc or ross changing his email address on a forum and thinking that protects him you have to be paranoid to do illegal shit it comes with the territory if you get too comfortable or forget your opsec even once that could be all it takes maybe women are better at that kind of stuff by nature after all life is more dangerous for us in many ways so we tend to be more grounded than men these behaviors are surprising to me too i think they are born of arrogance in the cases that have become notorious ross was kind of on a frontier for awhile he had has adoring fanboys and i think he started to believe his own press women in our culture just done tend to be so blinded by arrogance not being exist weve just not had that game face ya you got this man shit drilled into our heads as much as we have female weaknesses like barbies math is hard attitude shoveled into our heads we are however often blinded by plenty other things ll math is kind hard i sorta do have quadrate equation blindnessjust let the men folk take care of all that nasty math no need to worry your pretty little head about it you dont know how hard i tried but they kept requiring me to engage in this charlatanry year after year the torture grew more intense they wouldnt let me escape finally i was held prisoner in a non euclidean geometry seminar that was rife with violations of the geneva convention i just kept repeating this is all fake and gay parallel lines cant intersect has any of you ever even seen a dream house you sure cant build one like this its all imaginary aunty em i wan na go home after nearly months of torment i escaped by the skin of my d barbie was happy to see me as god is my witness i will never study math again sorry about the apostrophes keyboard is a little wack it sounds like you were caught in a lovecraftian nightmare of mufti dimensions horror non euclidean geometry and all tell me could you sense the presence of strange shimmering bestial forms blinking in and out of view or strange eldritch poetry spoken in a tongue forgotten millions of years before the first human ancestor stretched its tiny proto spine some people just rent built for chanting the incantations and spells that will draw the ancient ones from their deep sea lairs to the shores of forgotten lagoons or math its just as true for men as for women though like you say women are or were taught to shy away from math and the eldritch horrors that men are encouraged to explore . quote from boneskoopa on may pmor maybe it was i came to the conclusion that using bridges arouses more suspicion since youre going the extra mile this is a very good point bones in certain respects the more one does to obfuscate oneself beyond what most of us do like using tor out of the box the more its possible to be noticed the trick to staying alive on the darknet is to appear as just another regular punter looking for retain amounts of weed or some other relatively innoxious behavior and never ever give out honest details of your life especially if you like ulbricht did have a real life web presence personally im a fat middle aged man who buys weed from sketch teenagers and resells it online as top shelf a organic and give managed to fool everyone with my pretty strain descriptions well no i am perhaps too honest about that stuff but then those are the kinds of details that its impossible for le to use in a correlation attack because i would never talk about such things on a site that has my do anyway but if for example i was a huge big lebowski fan with a photo of the dude as my avatar on clearnet forums and then i came onto the darknet to sell a strain i call the big lebowski that would be terrible opsec i do love the movie but who doesnt now if instead i came on the hub and gave out numerous details of films and bands i love and i also have a facebook page that lists those exact films bands as favorites that becomes more of a correlate able data set that said i am nowhere near as high profile a target as dpr was so to some extent that protects me but at the same time i like to sleep without paranoid dreams so i let my personality speak for me instead of details about my likes and real life preferences for music etc now for a casual purchaser of personal use amounts of drugs all this might be over cautious but as a vendor its basin opsec thats what surprises me guns forgetting to use tor to log onto irc or ross changing his email address on a forum and thinking that protects him you have to be paranoid to do illegal shit it comes with the territory if you get too comfortable or forget your opsec even once that could be all it takes maybe women are better at that kind of stuff by nature after all life is more dangerous for us in many ways so we tend to be more grounded than men what doesnt surprise me is when people start to confess things about themselves like that guy did about his arrests we all have a strong need to connect with other people and le relies on that to doxx us its just so human and they prey on it if you ever feel the urge to get confession save it for your clearnet presence the darknet is not the place . once i put my tor laptop on top of my wardrobe and it fell and i got busted on the head . quote from brian feeney on may pmonce i put my tor laptop on top of my wardrobe

tor network fe just arrested people the real work was done by anonymous in opdarknet anonymous hacked the administrator pannel on louisa city and the admin of louisa city happened to be the admin of freedom hosting anonymous implanted malware to reveal the users ip address anonymous later compiled a user dump which they later handed over to the fbi and interpol to take into their own hands for some reason the media believed fe cracked the secret to the tor network and found a way to deanonymize users no no way .
