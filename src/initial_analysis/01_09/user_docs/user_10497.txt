just gon na leave this here this article was published two days ago and is a very good readgood news for users of pgp and otr not so good for christmas approaches the spies of the five eyes intelligence services can look forward to a break from the ardour daily work of spying in addition to their usual job attempting to crack encryption all around the world they play a game called the kryptos kristmas kwiz which involves solving challenging numerical and alphabetical puzzles the proud winners of the competition are awarded kryptos mugs encryption the use of mathematics to protect communications from spying is used for electric transactions of all types by governments firms and private users alike but a look into the archive of whistleblower edward snowden shows that not all encryption technologies live up to what they promise one example is the encryption featured in skype a program used by some million users to conduct interest video chat that is routed as secure it isnt really sustained skye collection began in feb reads a national security agency nsa training document from the archive of whistleblower edward snowden less than half a year later in the fall the code crackers declared their mission accomplished since then data from skype has been accessible to the was snoops software giant microsoft which acquired skype in said in a statement we will not provide governments with direct or unlettered access to customer data or encryption keys the nsa had been monitoring skye even before that but since february the service has been under order from the secret us foreign intelligence surveillance court fisc to not only supply information to the nsa but also to make itself accessible as a source of data for the agency the sustained skype collection is a further step taken by the authority in the arms race between intelligence agencies seeking to deny users of their privacy and those wanting to ensure they are protected there have also been some victories for privacy with certain encryption systems proving to be so robust they have been tried and true standards for more than years for the nsa encrusted communication or what all other internet users would call secure communication is a threat in one internal training document viewed by spiegel an asa employee asks did you know that ubiquitous encryption on the internet is a major threat to nsas ability to prosecute digital network intelligence dni traffic or defeat adversary malware slipped from asa document encryption considered a threat zoomsnipped from asa document encryption considered a threat the snowdon documents reveal the encryption programs the nsa has succeeded in cracking but important also the ones that are still likely to be secure although the documents are around two years old experts consider it unlikely the agency digital spies have made much progress in cracking these technologies properly implements strong crypto systems are one of the few things that you can rely on snowden said in june after fleeing to hong kong the digitization of society in the past several decades has been accompanied by the broad deployment of cryptography which is no longer the exclusive realm of secret agents whether a person is conducting online banking internet shopping or making a phone call almost every internet connection today is encrusted in some way the entire realm of cloud computing that is of outsourcing computing tasks to data centers somewhere else possibly even on the other side of the globe relies heavily on cryptographic security systems internet activists even hold crypto parties where they teach people who are interested in communicating securely and privately how to encrypt their data german officials suggest consistent encryption in germany concern about the need for strong encryption goes right up to the highest levels of the government chancellor angela merkel and her cabinet now communicate using phones incorporating strong encryption the government has also encouraged members of the german public to take steps to protect their own communication michael hange the president of the federal office for information security has stated we suggest cryptography that is consistent encryption its a suggestion unlikely to please some intelligence agencies after all the five eyes alliance the secret services of britain canada australia new zealand and the united states pursue a clear goal removing the encryption of others on the internet wherever possible in the nsa had a budget of more than billion according to the us intelligence budget for the money allotted for the nsa department called cryptanalysis and exploitation services ces alone was million last year the guardian new york times and propublica reported on the contents of a presentation on the was bullion decryption program but left out many specific vulnerabilities the presentation states that for the past decade nsa has led an aggressive multipronged effort to break widely used internet encryption technologies and vast amounts of encrusted internet data which have up till now been discarded are now exploitable decryption it turns out works retroactively once a system is broken the agencies can look back in time in their databases and read stuff they could not read before the number of interest users concerned about privacy online has risen dramatically since the first snowdon revelations but people who consciously use strong end to end encryption to protect their data still represent a minority of the internet using population there are a number of reasons for this some believe encryption is too complicated to use or they think the intelligence agency experts are already so many steps ahead of them that they can crack any encryption program still safe from the nsathis isnt true as one document from the snowdon archive shows the nsa had been unsuccessful in attempts to decrypt several communications protocols at least as of an asa presentation for a conference that took place that year lists the encryption programs theattacks against crypto guide for analysts on how to use the prism skye collection gchq briefing on the bullrun program gchq presentation on the bullrun programs decryption capabilities nsa longhaul program for end to end attack orchestration and key recovery service bluesnort program on net defense

on encrusted connections are orchestrated description of voip telephony encryption methods and cryptanalytic and other ways to attackamericans failed to crack in the process the nsa cryptologists divided their targets into five levels corresponding to the degree of the difficulty of the attack and the outcome ranging from trivial to catastrophic monitoring a documents path through the internet is clarified as trivial recording facebook chats is considered a minor task while the level of difficulty involved in decrypting email sent through moscow based interest service provider mail ru is considered moderate still all three of those classifications dont appear to pose any significant problems for the asa things first become troublesome at the fourth level the presentation states that the nsa encounters major problems in its attempts to decrypt messages sent through heavily encrusted email service providers like zoho or in monitoring users of the tor network which was developed for surfing the web anonymously to otherwise known as the onion router is free and open source software that allows users to surf the web through a network of more than linked volunteer computers the software automatically encrypts data in a way that ensures that no single computer in the network has all of a users information for surveillance experts it becomes very difficult to trace the whereabouts of a person who visits a particular website or to attack a specific person while they are using tor to surf the web cryptanalytics general description how asa handles encrypted traffic

on the program last may prompting speculation about pressures from government agencies a protocol called off the record otr for encrypting instant messaging in an end to end encryption process also seems to cause the asa major problems both are programs whose source code can be viewed modified shared and used by anyone experts agree it is far more difficult for intelligence agencies to manipulate open source software programs than many of the closed systems developed by companies like apple and microsoft since anyone can view free and open source software it becomes difficult to insert secret back doors without it being noticed transcripts of intercepted chats using or encryption handed over to the intelligence agency by a partner in prism an asa program that accesses data from at least nine american internet companies such as google facebook and apple show that the was efforts appear to have been thwarted in these cases no decrypt available for this or message this shows that otr at least sometimes makes communications impossible to read for the asa zoomthings become catastrophic for the nsa at level five when for example a subject uses a combination of tor another anonymization service the instant messaging system cspace and a system for internet telephony voice over ip called zrtp this type of combination results in a near total loss lack of insight to target communications presence the asa document states zrtp which is used to securely encrypt conversations and text chats on mobile phones is used in free and open source programs like redphone and signal its satisfying to know that the asa considers encrypted communication from our apps to be truly opaque says redphone developer moxie marlinspike too robust for fort meadealso the z in zrtp stands for one of its developers phil zimmermann the same man who created pretty good privacy which is still the most common encryption program for emails and documents in use today pgp is more than years old but apparently it remains too robust for the asa spies to crack no decrypt available for this pgp encrypted message a further document viewed by siege states of emails the nsa obtained from nahor phil zimmermann wrote pgp in the american unclean weapons freeze activist wanted to create an encryption program that would enable him to securely exchange information with other like minded individuals his system quickly became very popular among dissidents around the world given its use outside the united states the us government launched an investigation into zimmermann during the s for alleged violating the arms export control act prosecutors argued that making encryption software of such complexity available abroad was illegal zimmermann responded by publishing the source code as a book an act that was constitutional protected as free speech pgp continues to be developed and various versions are available today the most widely used is gun privacy guard gnupg a program developed by german programmer werner koch one document shows that the five eyes intelligence services sometimes use pip themselves the fact is that hackers obsessed with privacy and the us

a number of documents show to deanonymization is obviously high on the list of asa priorities but the success achieved here seems limited one gchq document from even mentions trying to decrypt the agencies own use of tor as a test case to a certain extent the snowdon documents should provide some level of relief to people who thought nothing could stop the nsa in its unquenchable thirst to collect data it appears secure channels still exist for communication nevertheless the documents also underscore just how far the intelligence agencies already go in their digital surveillance activities internet security comes at various levels and the nsa and its allies obviously are able to exploit i e crack several of the most widely used ones on a scale that was previously unimaginable vpn security only virtualone example is virtual private networks vpn which are often used by companies and institutions operating from multiply offices and locations a vpn theoretically creates a secure tunnel between two points on the internet all data is channel through that tunnel protected by cryptography when it comes to the level of privacy offered here virtual is the right word too this is because the nsa operates a large scale vpn exploitation project to crack large numbers of connections allowing it to intercept the data exchanged inside the vpn including for example the greek governments use of vpns the team responsible for the exploitation of those greek vpn communications consisted of people according to an asa document spiegel has seen attacks on vpn asa high level

requests an hour to decrypt vpon connections this number was expected to increase to per hour by the end of the aim was for the system to be able to completely process at least percent of these requests meaning the data traffic would have to be decrypted and rejected in other words by the end of the nsas plans called for simultaneously surveilling supposed secure vpn communications per hour vpn connections can be based on a number of different protocols the most widely used ones are called point to point tunneling protocol pptp and internet protocol security ipsec both seem to pose few problems for the asa spies if they really want to crack a connection experts have considered put insecure for some time now but it is still in use in many commercial systems the authors of one asa presentation boast of a project called fourscore that stores information including decrypted put vpn metadata using a number of different programs they claim to have succeeded in penetrating numerous networks among those surveilled were the russian carrier transaero airlines royal jordanian airlines as well as moscow based telecommunications firm mr telematiki another success routed is the was surveillance of the internal communications of diplomats and government officials from affghanistan pakistan and turkey ipsec as a protocol seems to create slightly more trouble for the spies but the nsa has the resources to actively attack routers involved in the communication process to get to the keys to unlock the encryption rather than trying to break it courtesy of the unit called tailor access operations tao got on the router through which banking traffic of interest flows it says in one presentation anything but secureeven more vulnerable than vpon systems are the supposed secure connections ordinary internet users must rely on all the time for web applications like financial services e commerce or accessing email accounts a lay user can recognize these alleged secure connections by looking at the address bar in his or her web browser with these connections the first letters of the address there are not just http for hypertext transfer protocol but the s stands for

uses the scarletfever program to attack scure sockets layer sal transport layer scurity tls analysis from sal tls connections through gchq in the flying pig databasethe nsa and its allies routine intercept such connections by the millions according to an asa document the agency intended to crack million intercepted connections a day by late the intelligence services are particularly interested in the moment when a user types his or her password by the end of the system was supposed to be able to detect the presence of at least password based encryption applications in each instance some times a month for its part britains echo collects information about encryption using the tls and ssl protocols the protocols connections are encrusted with in a database called flying pig the british spies produce weekly trends reports to catalog which services use the most sal connections and save details about those connections sites like facebook twitter hotmail yahoo and apples cloud service top the charts and the number of catalogue sal connections for one week is in the many billions for the top sites alone hockey sites monitoredcanadas communications security establishment csec even monitors sites devoted to the country national pastime we have noticed a large increase in chat activity on the hockeytalk sites this is likely due to the beginning of playoff season it says in one presentation the nsa also has a program with which it claims it can sometimes decrypt the secure shell protocol ssh this is typical used by systems administrators to log into employees computers remotely largely for use in the infrastructure of businesses core internet routers and other similarly important systems the asa combines the data collected in this manner with other information to leverage access to important systems of interest weakening cryptographic standardsbut how do the five eyes agencies manage to break all these encryption standards and systems the short answer is they use every means available one method is consciously weakening the cryptographic standards that are used to implement the respective systems documents seen by spiegel show that asa agents travel to the meetings of the internet engineering task force ietf an organization that develops such standards to gather information but presumably also to influence the discussions there new session policy extensions may improve our ability to passively target two sided communications says a brief write up of an it meeting in san diego on an asa internal wiki this process of weakening encryption standards has been going on for some time a classification guide a document that explains how to classify certain types of secret information labels the fact that asa css makes cryptographic modifications to commercial or indigenous cryptographic information security devices or systems in order to make them exploitable as top secret nsa classification guide cryptographic modifications zoomnsa classification guide cryptographic modifications cryptographic systems actively weakened this way or faulty to begin with are then explained using supercomputers the nsa maintains a system called longhaul an end to end attack orchestration and key recovery service for data network cipher and data network session cipher traffic rascally longhaul is the place where the asa looks for ways to break encryption according to an asa document it uses facilities at the tordella supercomputer building at fort meade maryland and oak ridge data center in oak ridge tennessee it can pass decrypted data to systems such as turmoil a part of the secret network the nsa operates throughout the world used to siphon off data the cover term for the development of these capabilities is valientsurf a similar program called gallantwave is meant to break tunnel and session ciphers in other cases the spies use their infrastructure to steal cryptographic keys from the configuration files found on internet routers a repository called discoroute contains outer configuration data from passive and active collection one document states active here means hacking or otherwise infiltrating computers passive refers to collecting data flowing through the internet with secret nsa operated computers an important part of the five eyes efforts to break encryption on the internet is the gathering of vast amounts of data for example they collect so called ssl handshakes that is the first exchanges between two computers beginning an sal connection a combination of metadata about the connections and metadata from the encryption protocols then help to break the keys which in turn allow reading or recording the now decrypted traffic if all else fails the nsa and its allies resort to brute force they hack their targets computers or interest routers to get to the secret encryption or they intercept computers on the way to their targets open them and insert spy gear before they even reach their destination a process they call interdiction a grave threat to securityfor the nsa the breaking of encryption methods represents a constant conflict of interest the agency and its allies do have their own secret encryption methods for internal use but the nsa is also asked with providing the us national institute of standards and technology nist with technical guidelines in trusted technology that may be used in cost effective systems for protecting sensitive computer data in other words checking cryptographic systems for their value is part of the was job one encryption standard the nist implicitly recommends is the advanced encryption standard aes the standard is used for a large variety of tasks from encrypting the pin numbers of banking cards to hard disk encryption for computers one asa document shows that the agency is actively looking for ways to break the very standard it recommends this section is marked as top secret ts electric codebooks such as the advanced encryption standard are both widely used and difficult to attack cryptanalytically the nsa has only a handful of in house techniques the tundra project investigated a potentially new technique the tau statistic to determine its usefulness in codebook analysis zoomthe fact that large amounts of the cryptographic systems that underpin the entire internet have been intentionally weakened or broken by the nsa and its allies poses a grave threat to the security of everyone who relies on the internet from individuals looking for privacy to institutions and companies relying on cloud computing many of these weaknesses can be explained by anyone who knows about them not just the asa inside the intelligence community this danger is widely known according to a document individuals at gchq alone were briefe into the bullrun project whose goal is a large scale assault on interest security by jacob appelbaum aaron gibson christian grothoff andy m ller maguhn laura poitras michael sontheimer and christian

use every means available one method is consciously weakening the cryptographic standards that are used to implement the respective systems documents seen by spiegel show that asa agents travel to the meetings of the internet engineering task force ietf an organization that develops such standards to gather information but presumably also to influence the discussions there new session policy extensions may improve our ability to passively target two sided communications says a brief write up of an it meeting in san diego on an asa internal wiki this process of weakening encryption standards has been going on for some time a classification guide a document that explains how to classify certain types of secret information labels the fact that asa css makes cryptographic modifications to commercial or indigenous cryptographic information security devices or systems in order to make them exploitable as top secret nsa classification guide cryptographic modifications zoomnsa classification guide cryptographic modifications cryptographic systems actively weakened this way or faulty to begin with are then explained using supercomputers the nsa maintains a system called longhaul an end to end attack orchestration and key recovery service for data network cipher and data network session cipher traffic rascally longhaul is the place where the asa looks for ways to break encryption according to an asa document it uses facilities at the tordella supercomputer building at fort meade maryland and oak ridge data center in oak ridge tennessee it can pass decrypted data to systems such as turmoil a part of the secret network the nsa operates throughout the world used to siphon off data the cover term for the development of these capabilities is valientsurf a similar program called gallantwave is meant to break tunnel and session ciphers in other cases the spies use their infrastructure to steal cryptographic keys from the configuration files found on internet routers a repository called discoroute contains outer configuration data from passive and active collection one document states active here means hacking or otherwise infiltrating computers passive refers to collecting data flowing through the internet with secret nsa operated computers an important part of the five eyes efforts to break encryption on the internet is the gathering of vast amounts of data for example they collect so called ssl handshakes that is the first exchanges between two computers beginning an sal connection a combination of metadata about the connections and metadata from the encryption protocols then help to break the keys which in turn allow reading or recording the now decrypted traffic if all else fails the nsa and its allies resort to brute force they hack their targets computers or interest routers to get to the secret encryption or they intercept computers on the way to their targets open them and insert spy gear before they even reach their destination a process they call interdiction a grave threat to securityfor the nsa the breaking of encryption methods represents a constant conflict of interest the agency and its allies do have their own secret encryption methods for internal use but the nsa is also asked with providing the us national institute of standards and technology nist with technical guidelines in trusted technology that may be used in cost effective systems for protecting sensitive computer data in other words checking cryptographic systems for their value is part of the was job one encryption standard the nist implicitly recommends is the advanced encryption standard aes the standard is used for a large variety of tasks from encrypting the pin numbers of banking cards to hard disk encryption for computers one asa document shows that the agency is actively looking for ways to break the very standard it recommends this section is marked as top secret ts electric codebooks such as the advanced encryption standard are both widely used and difficult to attack cryptanalytically the nsa has only a handful of in house techniques the tundra project investigated a potentially new technique the tau statistic to determine its usefulness in codebook analysis zoomthe fact that large amounts of the cryptographic systems that underpin the entire internet have been intentionally weakened or broken by the nsa and its allies poses a grave threat to the security of everyone who relies on the internet from individuals looking for privacy to institutions and companies relying on cloud computing many of these weaknesses can be explained by anyone who knows about them not just the asa inside the intelligence community this danger is widely known according to a document individuals at gchq alone were briefe into the bullrun project whose goal is a large scale assault on interest security by jacob appelbaum aaron gibson christian grothoff andy m ller maguhn laura poitras michael sontheimer and christian

days ago and is a very good readgood news for users of pgp and otr not so good for christmas approaches the spies of the five eyes intelligence services can look forward to a break from the ardour daily work of spying in addition to their usual job attempting to crack encryption all around the world they play a game called the kryptos kristmas kwiz which involves solving challenging numerical and alphabetical puzzles the proud winners of the competition are awarded kryptos mugs encryption the use of mathematics to protect communications from spying is used for electric transactions of all types by governments firms and private users alike but a look into the archive of whistleblower edward snowden shows that not all encryption technologies live up to what they promise one example is the encryption featured in skype a program used by some million users to conduct interest video chat that is routed as secure it isnt really sustained skye collection began in feb reads a national security agency nsa training document from the archive of whistleblower edward snowden less than half a year later in the fall the code crackers declared their mission accomplished since then data from skype has been accessible to the was snoops software giant microsoft which acquired skype in said in a statement we will not provide governments with direct or unlettered access to customer data or encryption keys the nsa had been monitoring skye even before that but since february the service has been under order from the secret us foreign intelligence surveillance court fisc to not only supply information to the nsa but also to make itself accessible as a source of data for the agency the sustained skype collection is a further step taken by the authority in the arms race between intelligence agencies seeking to deny users of their privacy and those wanting to ensure they are protected there have also been some victories for privacy with certain encryption systems proving to be so robust they have been tried and true standards for more than years for the nsa encrusted communication or what all other internet users would call secure communication is a threat in one internal training document viewed by spiegel an asa employee asks did you know that ubiquitous encryption on the internet is a major threat to nsas ability to prosecute digital network intelligence dni traffic or defeat adversary malware slipped from asa document encryption considered a threat zoomsnipped from asa document encryption considered a threat the snowdon documents reveal the encryption programs the nsa has succeeded in cracking but important also the ones that are still likely to be secure although the documents are around two years old experts consider it unlikely the agency digital spies have made much progress in cracking these technologies properly implements strong crypto systems are one of the few things that you can rely on snowden said in june after fleeing to hong kong the digitization of society in the past several decades has been accompanied by the broad deployment of cryptography which is no longer the exclusive realm of secret agents whether a person is conducting online banking internet shopping or making a phone call almost every internet connection today is encrusted in some way the entire realm of cloud computing that is of outsourcing computing tasks to data centers somewhere else possibly even on the other side of the globe relies heavily on cryptographic security systems internet activists even hold crypto parties where they teach people who are interested in communicating securely and privately how to encrypt their data german officials suggest consistent encryption in germany concern about the need for strong encryption goes right up to the highest levels of the government chancellor angela merkel and her cabinet now communicate using phones incorporating strong encryption the government has also encouraged members of the german public to take steps to protect their own communication michael hange the president of the federal office for information security has stated we suggest cryptography that is consistent encryption its a suggestion unlikely to please some intelligence agencies after all the five eyes alliance the secret services of britain canada australia new zealand and the united states pursue a clear goal removing the encryption of others on the internet wherever possible in the nsa had a budget of more than billion according to the us intelligence budget for the money allotted for the nsa department called cryptanalysis and exploitation services ces alone was million last year the guardian new york times and propublica reported on the contents of a presentation on the was bullion decryption program but left out many specific vulnerabilities the presentation states that for the past decade nsa has led an aggressive multipronged effort to break widely used internet encryption technologies and vast amounts of encrusted internet data which have up till now been discarded are now exploitable decryption it turns out works retroactively once a system is broken the agencies can look back in time in their databases and read stuff they could not read before the number of interest users concerned about privacy online has risen dramatically since the first snowdon revelations but people who consciously use strong end to end encryption to protect their data still represent a minority of the internet using population there are a number of reasons for this some believe encryption is too complicated to use or they think the intelligence agency experts are already so many steps ahead of them that they can crack any encryption program still safe from the nsathis isnt true as one document from the snowdon archive shows the nsa had been unsuccessful in attempts to decrypt several communications protocols at least as of an asa presentation for a conference that took place that year lists the encryption programs theattacks against crypto guide for analysts on how to use the prism skye collection gchq briefing on the bullrun program gchq presentation on the bullrun

description of voip telephony encryption methods and cryptanalytic and other ways to attackamericans failed to crack in the process the nsa cryptologists divided their targets into five levels corresponding to the degree of the difficulty of the attack and the outcome ranging from trivial to catastrophic monitoring a documents path through the internet is clarified as trivial recording facebook chats is considered a minor task while the level of difficulty involved in decrypting email sent through moscow based interest service provider mail ru is considered moderate still all three of those classifications dont appear to pose any significant problems for the asa things first become troublesome at the fourth level the presentation states that the nsa encounters major problems in its attempts to decrypt messages sent through heavily encrusted email service providers like zoho or in monitoring users of the tor network which was developed for surfing the web anonymously to otherwise known as the onion router is free and open source software that allows users to surf the web through a network of more than linked volunteer computers the software automatically encrypts data in a way that ensures that no single computer in the network has all of a users information for surveillance experts it becomes very difficult to trace the whereabouts of a person who visits a particular website or to attack a specific person while they are using tor to surf the web cryptanalytics general description how asa handles encrypted traffic intercept with pgp encrusted message

about pressures from government agencies a protocol called off the record otr for encrypting instant messaging in an end to end encryption process also seems to cause the asa major problems both are programs whose source code can be viewed modified shared and used by anyone experts agree it is far more difficult for intelligence agencies to manipulate open source software programs than many of the closed systems developed by companies like apple and microsoft since anyone can view free and open source software it becomes difficult to insert secret back doors without it being noticed transcripts of intercepted chats using or encryption handed over to the intelligence agency by a partner in prism an asa program that accesses data from at least nine american internet companies such as google facebook and apple show that the was efforts appear to have been thwarted in these cases no decrypt available for this or message this shows that otr at least sometimes makes communications impossible to read for the asa zoomthings become catastrophic for the nsa at level five when for example a subject uses a combination of tor another anonymization service the instant messaging system cspace and a system for internet telephony voice over ip called zrtp this type of combination results in a near total loss lack of insight to target communications presence the asa document states zrtp which is used to securely encrypt conversations and text chats on mobile phones is used in free and open source programs like redphone and signal its satisfying to know that the asa considers encrypted communication from our apps to be truly opaque says redphone developer moxie marlinspike too robust for fort meadealso the z in zrtp stands for one of its developers phil zimmermann the same man who created pretty good privacy which is still the most common encryption program for emails and documents in use today pgp is more than years old but apparently it remains too robust for the asa spies to crack no decrypt available for this pgp encrypted message a further document viewed by siege states of emails the nsa obtained from nahor phil zimmermann wrote pgp in the american unclean weapons freeze activist wanted to create an encryption program that would enable him to securely exchange information with other like minded individuals his system quickly became very popular among dissidents around the world given its use outside the united states the us government launched an investigation into zimmermann during the s for alleged violating the arms export control act prosecutors argued that making encryption software of such complexity available abroad was illegal zimmermann responded by publishing the source code as a book an act that was constitutional protected as free speech pgp continues to be developed and various versions are available today the most widely used is gun privacy guard gnupg a program developed by german programmer werner koch one document

obviously high on the list of asa priorities but the success achieved here seems limited one gchq document from even mentions trying to decrypt the agencies own use of tor as a test case to a certain extent the snowdon documents should provide some level of relief to people who thought nothing could stop the nsa in its unquenchable thirst to collect data it appears secure channels still exist for communication nevertheless the documents also underscore just how far the intelligence agencies already go in their digital surveillance activities internet security comes at various levels and the nsa and its allies obviously are able to exploit i e crack several of the most widely used ones on a scale that was previously unimaginable vpn security only virtualone example is virtual private networks vpn which are often used by companies and institutions operating from multiply offices and locations a vpn theoretically creates a secure tunnel between two points on the internet all data is channel through that tunnel protected by cryptography when it comes to the level of privacy offered here virtual is the right word too this is because the nsa operates a large scale vpn exploitation project to crack large numbers of connections allowing it to intercept the data exchanged inside the vpn including for example the greek governments use of vpns the team responsible for the

decrypted and rejected in other words by the end of the nsas plans called for simultaneously surveilling supposed secure vpn communications per hour vpn connections can be based on a number of different protocols the most widely used ones are called point to point tunneling protocol pptp and internet protocol security ipsec both seem to pose few problems for the asa spies if they really

fourscore that stores information including decrypted put vpn metadata using a number of different programs they claim to have succeeded in penetrating numerous networks among those surveilled were the russian carrier transaero airlines royal jordanian airlines as well as moscow based telecommunications firm mr telematiki another success routed is the was surveillance of the internal communications of diplomats and government officials from affghanistan pakistan and turkey ipsec as a protocol seems to create slightly more trouble for the spies but the nsa has the resources to actively attack routers involved in the communication process to get to the keys to unlock the encryption rather than trying to break it courtesy of the unit called tailor access operations tao got on the router through which banking traffic of interest flows it says in one presentation anything but secureeven more vulnerable than vpon systems are the supposed secure connections ordinary internet

overview of existing techniques a potential technique to deanonymise users of the tor networktoday asa spies and their allies do their best to subvert the system their own military helped conceive as a number of documents show to deanonymization is obviously high on the list of asa priorities but the success achieved here seems limited one gchq document from even mentions trying to decrypt the agencies own use of tor as a test case to a certain extent the snowdon documents should provide some level of relief to people who thought nothing could stop the nsa in its unquenchable thirst to collect data it appears secure channels still exist for communication nevertheless the documents also underscore just how far the intelligence agencies already go in their digital surveillance activities internet security comes at various levels and the nsa and its allies obviously are able to exploit i e crack several of the most widely used ones on a scale that was previously unimaginable vpn security only virtualone example is virtual private networks vpn which are often used by companies and institutions operating from multiply offices and locations a vpn theoretically creates a secure tunnel between two points on the internet all data is channel through that tunnel protected by cryptography when it comes to the level of privacy offered here virtual is the right word too this is because the nsa operates a large scale vpn exploitation project to crack large numbers of connections allowing it to intercept the data exchanged inside the vpn including for example the greek governments use of vpns the team responsible for the exploitation of those greek vpn communications consisted of people according to an asa document spiegel has seen attacks on vpn asa high level

requests an hour to decrypt vpon connections this number was expected to increase to per hour by the end of the aim was for the system to be able to completely process at least percent of these requests meaning the data traffic would have to be decrypted and rejected in other words by the end of the nsas plans called for simultaneously surveilling supposed secure vpn communications per hour vpn connections can be based on a number of different protocols the most widely used ones are called point to point tunneling protocol pptp and internet protocol security ipsec both seem to pose few problems for the asa spies if they really want to crack a connection experts have considered put insecure for some time now but it is still in use in many commercial systems the authors of one asa presentation boast of a project called fourscore that stores information including decrypted put vpn metadata using a number of different programs they claim to have succeeded in penetrating numerous networks among those surveilled were the russian carrier transaero airlines royal jordanian airlines as well as moscow based telecommunications firm mr telematiki another success routed is the was surveillance of the internal communications of diplomats and government officials from affghanistan pakistan and turkey ipsec as a protocol seems to create slightly more trouble for the spies but the nsa has the resources to actively attack routers involved in the communication process to get to the keys to unlock the encryption rather than trying to break it courtesy of the unit called tailor access operations tao got on the router through which banking traffic of interest flows it says in one presentation anything but secureeven more vulnerable than vpon systems are the supposed secure connections ordinary internet users must rely on all the time for web applications like financial services e commerce or accessing email accounts a lay user can recognize these alleged secure connections by looking at the address bar in his or her web browser with these connections the first letters of the address there are not just http for hypertext transfer protocol but the s stands for secure the problem is that there isnt really anything secure about them attacks on ssl tls asa experiment for massive ssl tls decryption canadian document from ces on tls trends details on how asa uses the scarletfever program to attack scure sockets layer sal transport layer scurity tls analysis from sal tls connections through gchq in the flying pig databasethe nsa and its allies routine intercept such connections by the millions according to an asa document the agency intended to crack million intercepted connections a day by late the intelligence services are particularly interested in the moment when a user types his or her password by the end of the system was supposed to be able to detect the presence of at least password based encryption applications in each instance some

monitors sites devoted to the country national pastime we have noticed a large increase in chat activity on the hockeytalk sites this is likely due to the beginning of playoff season it says in one presentation the nsa also has a program with which it claims it can sometimes decrypt the secure shell protocol ssh this is typical used by systems administrators to log into employees computers remotely largely for use in the infrastructure of businesses core internet routers and other similarly important systems the asa combines the data collected in this manner with other information to leverage access to important systems of interest weakening cryptographic standardsbut how do the five eyes agencies manage to break all these encryption standards and systems the short answer is they use every means available one method is consciously weakening the cryptographic standards that are used to implement the respective systems documents seen by spiegel show that asa agents travel to the meetings of the internet engineering task force ietf an organization that develops such standards to gather information but presumably also to influence the discussions there new session policy extensions may improve our ability to passively target two sided communications says a brief write up of an it meeting in san diego on an asa internal wiki this process of weakening encryption standards has been going on for some time a classification guide a document that explains how to classify certain types of secret information labels the fact that asa css makes cryptographic modifications to commercial or indigenous cryptographic information security devices or systems in order to make them exploitable as top secret nsa classification guide cryptographic modifications zoomnsa classification guide cryptographic modifications cryptographic systems actively weakened this way or faulty to begin with are then explained using supercomputers the nsa maintains a system called longhaul an end to end attack orchestration and key recovery service for data network cipher and data network session cipher traffic rascally longhaul is the place where the asa looks for ways to break encryption according to an asa document it uses facilities at the tordella supercomputer building at fort meade maryland and oak ridge data center in oak ridge tennessee it can pass decrypted data to systems such as turmoil a part of the secret network the nsa operates throughout the world used to siphon off data the cover term for the development of these capabilities is valientsurf a similar program called gallantwave is meant to break tunnel and session ciphers in other cases the spies use their infrastructure to steal cryptographic keys from the configuration files found on internet routers a repository called discoroute contains outer configuration data from passive and active collection one document states active here means hacking or otherwise infiltrating computers passive refers to collecting data flowing through the internet with secret nsa operated computers an important part of the five eyes efforts to break encryption on the internet is the gathering of vast amounts of data for example they collect so called ssl handshakes that is the first exchanges between two computers beginning an sal connection a combination of metadata about the connections and metadata from the encryption protocols then help to break the keys which in turn allow reading or recording the now decrypted traffic if all else fails the nsa and its allies resort to brute force they hack their targets computers or interest routers to get to the secret encryption or they intercept computers on the way to their targets open them and insert spy gear before they even reach their destination a process they call interdiction a grave threat to securityfor the nsa the breaking of encryption methods represents a constant conflict of interest the agency and its allies do have their own secret encryption methods for internal use but the nsa is also asked with providing the us national institute of standards and technology nist with technical guidelines in trusted technology that may be used in cost effective systems for protecting sensitive computer data in other words checking cryptographic systems for their value is part of the was job one encryption standard the nist implicitly recommends is the advanced encryption standard aes the standard is used for a large variety of tasks from encrypting the pin numbers of banking cards to hard disk encryption for computers one asa document shows that the agency is actively looking for ways to break the very standard it recommends this section is marked as top secret ts electric codebooks such as the advanced encryption standard are both widely used and difficult to attack cryptanalytically the nsa has only a handful of in house techniques the tundra project investigated a potentially new technique the tau statistic to determine its usefulness in codebook analysis zoomthe fact that large amounts of the cryptographic systems that underpin the entire internet have been intentionally weakened or broken by the nsa and its allies poses a grave threat to the security of everyone who relies on the internet from individuals looking for privacy to institutions and companies relying on cloud computing many of these weaknesses can be explained by anyone who knows about them not just the asa inside the intelligence community this danger is widely known according to a document individuals at gchq alone were briefe into the bullrun project whose goal is a large scale assault on interest security by jacob appelbaum aaron gibson christian grothoff andy m ller maguhn laura poitras michael sontheimer and christian st cker two co authors of this article jacob appelbaum and aaron gibson work on the tor project appelbaum also works on the otr project as well as contributing to other encryption programs . none of this is really that surprising i mean for ipsec with a psk there has been an attack for a while see the open source project ikecrack for an idea tls aka ssl is a disaster the ca model of trust is broken cas can sign unlimited sub ca keys certificate revocation has never worked properly the ssh attacks only seem to work when using passwords and weak algorithms personally give been using ash keys since and i rotate them every year so i just laughed at that nowadays i mostly ash to onion addresses so they have to break layers of tor encryption before they could even see my client speaking ssh impossible it is nice to know that or isnt broken i was very surprised that pgp still thwarts the spooks i mean it is s technology after all the gchq attacks on tor are not new either locating a hidden service with traffic correlation confirmation attacks isnt new there are many white papers about it the fact that you can make the endpoint talk when you want it to in the case of hidden services is really the weak point unfortunately with low latency mix networks the only fix is to lay down chaff and that is too cost prohibition for most people . none of this is really that

the crypto in pgp is still effective pgp after all has evolved through the ages and kept up with the latest encryption algorithms on the other hand i imagine they frequently read pgp encrusted messages because the user can be a seriously dumb fuck let me give you an example of a pgp luck up from real life that i had to deal with about years ago certain details of this story changed to protect anonymity one time i had to give the login credentials to a incorporate email account to my coworker that was going to take over that email account we opted to use pgp to encrypt the username and password in an email so he generated and gave me a pip public key and i put the username and password in the text of an email clicked uncropt and sign in my mail client and sent the email my coworker got the email decrypted it and then replied to the email unencrypted hey thanks i got the username and password fine and was able to log in of course he forgot to delete the now unencrypted text with the username and password in his mail client when he sent the reply and the reply email contained the password in plain text so rascally he fucked up and we had to report this as a security breach to our boss get reprimand for being in violation of security policies by sending passwords in an email and change the password technically it was his fault but thinking back i should have put the username and password in an encrusted text file as an attachment to prevent this error from happening in the first place the moral of the story the crypto in pgp is really good but the users are idiots and can mess it up . apparently there is a clarified power point presentation about how the asa breaks ssl you can see it on the link below but what i gathered from reading it is that they need to have the servers rsa private key on file already for the exploit to work the presentation also pointed to a publicly known random number generator bug in debian which has since been fixed that made rsa keys generated with openssl on design brute forcible than that the document doesnt say how they actually get these asa private keys to use in their exploit they definitely arent brute forcing them except for the random number generator bug in design linux case i suspect maybe they took advantage of the heartbleed bug or some other hacking to get the private keys it doesnt say anything about
