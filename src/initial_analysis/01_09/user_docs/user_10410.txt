believe i dont need to present this newspaper to you unfortunately the fact that the journalist who wrote it lament leger lost most of his colleagues and friends in the terrors attack in last january makes his point of view all the more interesting quotemass surveillance exempt from the law the government is playing to the gallery with a bill legalizing forms of espionage that have been in force for ages meanwhile the mass surveillance system set up by frances external intelligence agency the dgse is in no danger of being challenged a former spy told charlie after years of use in the united states there is no evidence that this kind of system has ever prevented a single attack for alain chouet a former top official at the agency the asa mass surveillance program which intercepts billions of telecommunications data points is absolutely futile bear in mind that undifferentiated surveillance is unusable given that the volume of data generated every year exceeds the total amount passed over years the crass conceit of the american program is all too evident and yet the dgse has set up a similar system at least with respect to undifferentiated data collection as reported in le monde the french intelligence services use supercomputers for surveillance and telecommunications data collections abroad this national hub has a threefold objective collecting phone and internet data picking up satellite transmissions and deciphering encrusted messages the supposed top secret system is well known in intelligence circles since the data collected is shared with other intelligence services in the defense interior and finance ministeries and even the justice department when it comes to deciphering oded files and hard drives so how does it work france being a hub for the globe flow of interest data especially between the u s a and the middle east and africa the french intelligence agency has placed underrated cables in all the right places to hoover up data and with its great satellite ears deplored at several points around the globe it adds up to just one thing well listen in and lift everything you exchange on the internet or in phone conversations digital traces of your connections on facebook and twitter text messages and geo location data all of it in a very murky legal fog billions of points that are impossible to digest immediately are distributed for the most part in batches to the intelligence services of the united states canada great britain etc some of charlies interlocutors disclosed that all recent exchanges detected in syria afghanistan and pakistan as well as in two or three sensitive areas of the planet were being picked up by the french intelligence agency perhaps this is how the government is able to put an exact figure on how many french people have gone off to wage jihad trawling for french nationals but all this creates a number of issues what can the understaffed french intelligence agency do with such an avalanche of details even when analyzed by keywords little or nothing perhaps find out that a mobile phone previously tracked in the greater paris area has suddenly related to syria counter terrorism might be able to make use of that at some stage then again one would have to be sure the guy tracked through his mobile phone isnt a travel agent there are still those fool hardy enough to be traipsing around crusader castles these days the second issue is a major one in casting the net abroad they are certain to pick up a lot of personal french data on the rebound and not just about potential terrorists but since only outside espionage i e beyond our borders and targeting foreign citizens escapes french law how can these components be realized the bill examined in parliament last week tries to address the issue but monitoring of these operations is weak in relation to common law already quite dented in terms of civil liberties the time limit for storing and destroying the information will begin not from when it is collected but from when it is used thus potentially years later as for the green light from the monitoring committee it will be given after the surveillance not before meanwhile mass surveillance abroad is authorized de facto with the possibility as stated in impact study that the committee will monitor the surveillance but thats not a certainty in any case the international federation for human rights and the french human rights league will soon file complaints and institute civil action . heres an article i read in charge hebdo i believe i dont need to present this newspaper to you unfortunately the fact that the journalist who wrote it lament leger lost most of his colleagues and friends in the terrors attack in last january makes his point of view all the more interesting quotemass surveillance exempt from the law the government is playing to the gallery with a bill legalizing forms of espionage that have been in force for ages meanwhile the mass surveillance system set up by frances external intelligence agency the dgse is in no danger of being challenged a former spy told charlie after years of use in the united states there is no evidence that this kind of system has ever prevented a single attack for alain chouet a former top official at the agency the asa mass surveillance program which intercepts billions of telecommunications data points is absolutely futile bear in mind that undifferentiated surveillance is unusable given that the volume of data generated every year exceeds the total amount passed over years the crass conceit of the american program is all too evident and yet the dgse has set up a similar system at least with respect to undifferentiated data collection as reported in le monde the french intelligence services use supercomputers for surveillance and telecommunications data collections abroad this national hub has a threefold objective collecting phone and internet data picking up satellite transmissions and deciphering encrusted messages the supposed top secret system is well known in intelligence circles since the data collected is shared with other intelligence services in the defense interior and finance ministeries and even the justice department when it comes to deciphering oded files and hard drives so how does it work france being a hub for the globe flow of interest data especially between the u s a and the middle east and africa the french intelligence agency has placed underrated cables in all the right places to hoover up data and with its great satellite ears deplored at several points around the globe it adds up to just one thing well listen in and lift everything you exchange on the internet or in phone conversations digital traces of your connections on facebook and twitter text messages and geo location data all of it in a very murky legal fog billions of points that are impossible to digest immediately are distributed for the most part in batches to the intelligence services of the united states canada great britain etc some of charlies interlocutors disclosed that all recent exchanges detected in syria afghanistan and pakistan as well as in two or three sensitive areas of the planet were being picked up by the french intelligence agency perhaps this is how the government is able to put an exact figure on how many french people have gone off to wage jihad trawling for french nationals but all this creates a number of issues what can the understaffed french intelligence agency do with such an avalanche of details even when analyzed by keywords little or nothing perhaps find out that a mobile phone previously tracked in the greater paris area has suddenly related to syria counter terrorism might be able to make use of that at some stage then again one would have to be sure the guy tracked through his mobile phone isnt a travel agent there are still those fool hardy enough to be traipsing around crusader castles these days the second issue is a major one in casting the net abroad they are certain to pick up a lot of personal french data on the rebound and not just about potential terrorists but since only

trade instead of banning these accounts permanently you do realize jack that i havent actually message valhalla support i was just taking the piss out of them i was simply replying in jest to an error

thenextbigthing on december amas i said before you are spreading fud with nothing but unfounded speculation i dont know how legitimate the also market is but also certainly has more credibility than you and your idiotic suppositions answer those two questions then did they or did they not choose the sr crypto market forum to make their first public announcement is their multisig safe and or working those are simple yes no questions quote from thenextbigthing on december amanyway neither option for multisig works for me so your last post is just more fed and how is that supposed to make also look less of a scam market they announce themselves as a multisig market on deepdotweb and launch before their multisig is even ready quote from thenextbigthing on december amlets look at the facts you have labelled a market a scam without any legitimate reason my reasons are as legitimate as they come they are sustained by observations facts and logic while you publicly admitted you personally dont have a clue about alas legitimacy quote from thenextbigthing on december am you are desperately attempting to justify your proclamation but since there is no evidence whatsoever that indicates the market is a scam you have twitched to complaining about their unfinished multisig implementation i didnt switch to complaining about their unfinished multisig implementation i added it to the list of indications that something is off with aflao and thats a euphemism talking about desperation what exactly are you trying to achieve by posting your ref links times in the spam to thread did you misread the title or are you trying to look more legitimate by family increasing your post count . theyre working fine for me dream haven been busted or exit scammed . nevermind came through

market called diabolus which then rebranded as silk road and as i said in another post then i took a look at their market the multisig tutorial i find particularly interesting set up key part rascally explains that you can create an address from a password that you enter directly on the site so you rascally have to trust them with the password to your funds whats the point of multisig then theres another safer way to set up a key but unfortunately it doesnt seem to be working summer ah and they also have a vendor on there under the name cultmadeline who sells lemon haze grown in holland looks like support cant tell a scammer when they see one unless theyre already swamped with work they do already have drug listings after all . quote from toongoon on june pmhello noticed you had issue with the withdrawal have you bee able to get back onto the market today had absolutely no luck myself besides getting through to the log in page once in actively looking for info on whats happening over
