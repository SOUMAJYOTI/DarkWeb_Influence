concrete answers thxi done think anyone knows for certain how much the uses pays attention to tracking activity however if they do in fact monitor tracking activity on packages they would certainly be able to identify traffic coming from tor because of the limited number of exit relays in tor network even if they dont monitor tor tracking activity today they could start tomorrow it would certainly raise the profile of the pacakge that you want to keep as low profile as possible as far as tracking from a non tor browser first of all since tor is probably not smart to use for tracking any tracking you do should be from anon public wifi so you cant be identified if a package has been intercepted and discovered to contain contraband you can bet they will be monitoring tracking activity
