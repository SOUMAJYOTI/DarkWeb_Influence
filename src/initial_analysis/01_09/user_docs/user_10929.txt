decide to never use sr again or you can decide to go back and use the marketplace which is now fe only it is entirely up to you also anything other than the official story as confirmed by defcon is just speculation and we will not condemn an established marketplace like sr based on speculation it would be the same way with any of the established marketplaces if anyone has any hard evidence that

about bitcoin and want to believe i can appreciate the hubs desire to appear impartial but remember silk road is not an established market it is a market that took on the name and look of a previously established market which unfortunately got owned by us narcos and feds sr reeks of a con and even worse a honeypot so far s insiders have been able to loot over btc on top of the atrocious commission now they are promoting the most secure possible transaction arrangement in terms of traceability in the blockchain anyone who sticks around for that sideshow will find themselves quickly busted as the

me go a step further and say that if someone created a new topic market it would be even further down the list of possibly established markets trying to cash in on a formerly imputable name is a big red flag a market should be considered established once it has been in operation for at least months has had no strange ripoffs or changes in admin and has a significant enough market share that admins could have but did not run off with several million dollars in bitcoin . agreed all valid points the hub should make a stick thread warning about sr . quote from hypotheticalbananas on february pmagree with these but sr was compromise for what months before the takedown true however some things really cant be predicted all we can hope is that new markets learn from the mistakes of previous markets and do not enter the game if they have been lackadaisical about opsec . the whole thing just stinks to high heaven and is riddled with a host of unanswered questions i was always taught that
