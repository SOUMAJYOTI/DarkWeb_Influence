misappropriated it from the brotherhood of british meth chemists none of this need have happened plate edit feb it was an inside job but not the current staff the same goes for mt gox i believe it is a programmer who coded the mt gox wallets the s wallets and also set up thegaming sites which have been spamming the bitcoin network with micropayments he hacked our investigators facebook in order to message him on feb th which he was investigating before being contracted by us using the name phibbo bit this is the message some background mtgox runs custom wallet software this is a reasonable and common practice for a service of its size and nature getting a wallet implementing right isn t easy as there is very little room for error much like the rest of the bitcoin system some have criticise their use of custom software here but it is a reasonable and common practice for a service of its size and nature the reference client s wallet is rascally suitable for small scale single party use i would not recommend something like mtgox use the reference none wallet at least not without a healthy layer of abstraction on top of it relieving it of duties harder than key management and chain monitoring or otherwise improving it greatly for that matter mtgox s wallet software has caused them fewer concerning problems than some other companies e g some have completely re implements the bitcoin protocol correctly and exposed it to the outside world and suffered numerous local blockchain rejecting glitches though its certainly taken gox a fair amount of time to sort things out i first heard people reporting stuck transactions back in september i looked into it and determined that mtgox was spending immature coins freshly generated bitcoins from mining can not be spend until they are at least blocks deep in the blockchain this prevents the funds from vanishing forever if the chain reorgs i pinged magicaltux and after a couple tries got a hold of him i think they also wasted some time on dead ends trying to resolve this before the actual nature of the problem was brought to their attention e g raising their transaction fees with a mistaken belief that their fees weren t high enough mtgox wasn t tracking if the coins were freshly generated or what their height was in their software including this data would apparently be a non trivial change and for high risk finance software even a trivial change takes a lot of work i suggested a workaround rascally just try to spend the oldest coins and as far as i know they implemented it and it was effective they continued to have problems with stuck transactions after and further analysis revealed that they were producing transactions with excessively padded signatures a minor tangent is required here there is a design flaw in the bitcoin protocol where its possible for a third party to take a valid transaction of yours and mutate it in a way which leaves it valid and functionary identical but with a different transaction id this greatly complicates writing correct wallet software and it can be used abusively to invalidate long chains of unconformed transactions that depend on the non meant transaction since transactions refer to each other by txid this issue arises from several sources one of them being opens s willingness to accept and make sense of signatures with invalid encodings a normal ends signature encodes two large integers the encoding isn t constant length if there are leading zeros you are supposed to drop them it s easy to write software that assumes the signature will be a constant length and then leave extra leading zeros in them in order to eventually remove this malleability flaw we ve been gradually tightening the rules that govern what transactions nodes in the network will consider valid when they relay them or mine them in bitcoin after months of work chasing down software authors to get them to fix their bugs transactions with these invalid encodings were no longer relayed this caused some problems for a few things for example bc i s iphone app bc i itself had been fixed long before but they couldn t update the iphone app without fear of triggering another review by apple eventually this was just worked around on the serve side by mutating the transactions produced by the iphone wallets and is moot now i guess mtgox also had problems with occasionally producing invalid signatures this would normally be a simple fix e g here is an example where i fixed this type of issue in some python wallet code i ve never used but saw a lot of people were copying c ab b fa c b be f but as i said before in high value systems like mtgox even simple fixes aren t simple and it took them quite some time to deploy a fix however i believe that it is actually fixed now my current understanding and inference is that the remaining issues are because while mtgox was producing transactions of the bad form that the network won t relay anymore some people decided to help out by fixing these transactions like bc i did for iphone users making the signatures normal and broadcasting them of course the new transactions while functionary identical have different txids the difference here is that the mtgox wallet software appears to have not handled this case gracefully at all and apparently simply wouldn t notice transactions that it didn t make spending its own coins as a result the mtgox wallet believed some coins were available for spending which really had already been spent and it began double spending those inputs this may have interested particularly poorly with the earlier workaround i mentioned trying to always use the oldest available coins if they did implement that workaround worse some of this may have resulted in users getting paid multiply times and could have been intentionally trigger with that end in mind if someone helpfull fixed some transactions and then noticed they got paid twice i think this is unlikely to have caused large losses before people run off worrying about that both because of the reuse of the oldest inputs and because of the hot wallet cold wallet split at this point they likely have an accounting mess to clean up figuring out who did and didn t get paid now with none of the txids matching cleaning that up will be somewhat tricky e g say there were three payments of mtgox coins to apple in the block chain and three users that attempted to pay apple and mtgox s records thinks that only one went through etc so software will have to be written that matches up transactions with their mutants in order to figure out what went where i am not personally concerned at least not by any of the details here mtgox s slow speed at resolving these sorts of issues and poor communications are not terribly inspiring they seem to be horribly short staffed but competent and trustworthy people in this space may be hard to find the regulatory morass of that business is sure to make many steer clear the claims that the delays indicate insolvency strike me as just hysteria the technical background doesn t support this conclusion and there may be a bit of opportunism at play from people who want to manipulate the market too don t get me wrong i have not seen their books gox may well have financial problems though with their income its hard for me to see how but if any problems like that exist they re not being indicated here of course none of this suggests anyone should be happy with the service mtgox has been providing but our anger should at least be well informed february at am that wasn t the up time it is from a copy saved by another recipient i still think defcon is full of shit with his we will prevail our community shit but i don t think the boy

says about the mtgox theft and other btc hacks turns out this guy pritel was bragging about how he helped code these sites and had found vulnerabilities in the btc protocol he says that he hit bitstamp sr and gox with ddos flooded them with imitated transactions and made a fortune it all sounded well oracle at the time but now this bbmc update has come to light i actually believe this guy pritel is a person of deep interest i have a full uncensored copy of pritel dox and will post a reached version of it below so you can all see the relation and importance but no names or address will be included so mods dont freak out to me this now looks pretty conclusive but only time will tell also not to stir shit but my explanation above still doesnt put defcon in the clear defcon hired pritel after a reccomendation from non other than stexo so it is possible that they could all be sharing the profits behind the scenes hence the repeated call for narco who probably doesnt exist and is likely a dropshpper from spain france redacted dox of pritel will be posted soon quote from blackstar on february amwow have you posted this there this is incredible if true mind if i share it yeah

software this is a reasonable and common practice for a service of its size and nature getting a wallet implementing right isn t easy as there is very little room for error much like the rest of the

completely re implements the bitcoin protocol correctly and exposed it to the outside world and suffered numerous local blockchain rejecting glitches though its certainly taken gox a fair amount of time to sort things out i first heard people reporting stuck transactions back in september i looked into it and determined that mtgox was spending immature coins freshly generated bitcoins from

belief that their fees weren t high enough mtgox wasn t tracking if the coins were freshly generated or what their height was in their software including this data would apparently be a non trivial change and for high risk finance software even a trivial change takes a lot of work i suggested a workaround rascally just try to spend the oldest coins and as far as i know they implemented it and it was effective they continued to have problems with stuck transactions after and further analysis revealed that they were producing transactions with excessively padded signatures a minor tangent is required here there is a design flaw in the bitcoin protocol where its possible for a third party to take a valid transaction of yours and mutate it in a way which leaves it valid and functionary identical but with a different transaction id this greatly complicates writing correct wallet software and it can be used abusively to invalidate long chains of unconformed transactions that depend on the non meant transaction since transactions refer to each other by txid this issue arises from several sources one of them being opens s willingness to accept and make sense of signatures with invalid encodings a normal ends signature encodes two large integers the encoding isn t constant length if there are leading zeros you are supposed to drop them it s easy to write software that assumes the signature will be a constant length and then leave extra leading zeros in them in order to eventually remove this malleability flaw we ve been gradually tightening the rules that govern what transactions nodes in the network will consider valid when they relay them or mine them in bitcoin after months of work chasing down software authors to get them to fix their bugs transactions with these invalid encodings were no longer relayed this caused some problems for a few things for example bc i s iphone app bc i itself had been fixed long before but they couldn t update the iphone app without fear of triggering another review by apple eventually this was just worked around on the serve side by mutating the transactions produced by the iphone wallets and is moot now i guess mtgox also had problems with occasionally producing invalid signatures this would normally be a simple fix e g here is an example where i fixed this type of issue in some python wallet code i ve never used but saw a lot of people were copying c ab b fa c b be f but as i said before in high value systems like mtgox even simple fixes aren t simple and it took them quite some time to deploy a fix however i believe that it is actually fixed now my current understanding and inference is that the remaining issues are because while mtgox was producing transactions of the bad form that the network won t relay anymore some people decided to help out by fixing these transactions like bc i did for iphone users making the signatures normal and broadcasting them of course the new transactions while functionary identical have different txids the difference here is that the mtgox wallet software appears to have not handled this case gracefully at all and apparently simply wouldn t notice transactions that it didn t make spending its own coins as a result the mtgox wallet believed some coins were available for spending which really had already been spent and it began double spending those inputs this may have interested particularly poorly with the earlier workaround i mentioned trying to always use the oldest available coins if they did implement that workaround worse some of this may have resulted in users getting paid multiply times and could have been intentionally trigger with that end in mind if someone helpfull fixed some transactions and then noticed they got paid twice i think this is unlikely to have caused large losses before people run off worrying about that both because of the reuse of the oldest inputs and because of the hot wallet cold wallet split at this point they likely have an accounting mess to clean up figuring out who did and didn t get paid now with none of the txids matching cleaning that up will be somewhat tricky e g say there were three payments of mtgox coins to apple in the block chain and three users that attempted to pay apple and mtgox s records thinks that only one went through etc so software will have to be written that matches up transactions with their mutants in order to figure out what went where i am not personally concerned at least not by any of the details here mtgox s slow speed at resolving these sorts of issues and poor communications are not terribly inspiring they seem to be horribly short staffed but competent and trustworthy people in this space may be hard to find the regulatory morass of that business is sure to make many steer clear the claims that the delays indicate insolvency strike me as just hysteria the technical background doesn t support this conclusion and there may be a bit of opportunism at play from people who want to manipulate the market too don t get me wrong i have not seen their books gox may well have financial problems though with their income its hard for me to see how but if any problems like that exist they re not being indicated here of course none of this suggests anyone should be happy with the service mtgox has been providing but our anger should at

is from a copy saved by another recipient i still think defcon is full of shit with his we will prevail our community shit but i don t think the boy dunnit redbookthe bbmc team there you have it take from it what you will but i still wont be going anywhere near sr xsposer . wow have you posted this there this is incredible if true mind if i share it . done trust thoes nos the truth is delete there . quote from fifty on february pmhas hininguel reappeared with his theories proofs and hired hackers i know he was helping ppl with funds but does his evidence current match up with oracle too i just want this done so people can move on from it and we rebuild rite fifty hiniguel is leaving silk road and while he has been vague it seems obvious that defcon is a scammer and that the site is doomed nightcrawler has also left others are as well but shit almost everyone whom i knew both from sr sr were gone two months ago days left hours ed . after looking at some interesting s forum posts courtesy of gwern and doing some discreet googling the grand wizard may not know exactly who was responsible for the sr scam but i am reasonably certain that glad m r an sr bitcoin scammer and thief friendly with identical to limetless either is part of the game or knows exactly who is i know beyond a reasonable doubt that glad m rs identity is an open secret in the bitcoin community i also know that at least one anglo siberian living in london knows who limetless is and some circumstantial evidence which makes me suspect strongly that glad m r and limetless are the same person and if a talents amateur like the grand wizard can find this with minutes of digging you can expect leo did the same research and came up with the same conclusions . update here it is the reached dox oracle posted of the suspected hacker pritel this information combined with the information from bbmc makes this seem pretty conclusive down to the quarter billion etc wallet we found again make of this what you want but all in all it looks pretty conclusive and pretty damning for pritel and possibly defcon libertas stexo although their exact role in this is less definative for now oracles sr post dox reached of course start quote mods please do not delete this i don t give a fuck about anti doxxing policies and i ve worked very hard paid out of my pocket and have open myself to exposure to put this thieving fuck on blast everyone else quote and take a screen shot immediately incase this gets taken down write real name pxxxxx xxxxxxaddress xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx hey xxxxx hows it feel reading this panic i won t ask you or enter a dialogue xxxxx but i m going to insist you contact deacon silk road admin or one of the moderators and arrange to pay back the money or ask them for an address and if by magic the funds show up you ll probably live out the rest of your life relatively healthy if not there s people who s money you ve taken who will probably make you wish you were in hell understood xxxxx fuck you and your ratfuck thievery i m going to keep this short stexo known money launderer used to be active on sr suspected of being dpr had given laundering advice to some xxxxx during sr who were also shopping around code they claimed to have reached or obtained from gox and btc e don t know if they re legitimate devs or just malicious fucks and it s irrelevant at this point sr s initials back end and engine was oded by one of these guys on contract xxxix libby had thought it would be useful to farm out some of the initials development of sr to one of the xxxxx devs and asked fucking stexo to make an introduction lib libertas one of the arrested silk road forum moderators introduced pxxxxx to defcon in october and he did whatever initials development

time before defcon figured it out or decided to announced it being the incompetent or thief that he is quote from honeyray on march amthat is the most believable of all the options im surprised that a bigger deal hasnt been made of it it is now pretty conclusive that asa pritel was largely involved in this but we are ensure if he acted alone but we have posted all the evidence we have including all the data provided by the bbmc and btva along with oracles dox of pritel on this thread here must say that all of the evidence seen together with oracles dox paints a pretty complying picture and it doesn look good for pritel although we do think stexo and dpr might have played a bigger role in this than previously suspected i will try to update both threads equally in future xsposer . can anyone explain what happen before the million us heist your speaking from december what happend back then i took a break after the s seizure and returned to sr a few days ago . well weird things happen when a guy stays up too late my detective work is evidence of that . spose very weird vibes on the sr forums tonight almost all of the posts replies are pro sr and they are coming from a handful of name no familiar faces and then there is the murmur in the community again bad vibes regarding captainwhitebeard and hiniguel reports of scamming being absent worshipped by some reviled by others some are now of the opinion that it is just one man behind limitless stexo hiniguel dpr defcon hux etc and it is beginning to make sense watching the latest theatrics regarding hiniguel its hard not to see a setup for the next big thing nobody is buying defcons bullshit anymore so hiniguel steps up and saves the day he refunds a bunch of money to people or pretends to using more name all the while denouncing defcon sr he says hes leaving but hints that the market might be re born elsewhere in the future people nominating him as the next leader im comparing name posts and while i have just begun it looks like hiniguel bluegiraffe mdmazing and hes talking to himself consider the following quotes and study them carefully pay attention to the sentence paragraph structure punctuation etc one thing jumps out at me his use of the em dash and semicolon but he represents an em dash thus single hyphen with a space on either side not many people employ these marks of punctuation in their writing or they misuse them furthermore there is a common use of the term mate used by many of these nyms as well as a failure to capitalize the letter i i then there is the overlay content topics threads many sound like they are coming from someone on the s staff take gemma for instance perhaps compiling a list would be in order compare just the following dpr in the admin roles dr defcon the similarity is obvious the numerical lists bold headlines etc and cwb jabbatheslut stealth v hes a goddamned one man band dozens of nyms everywhere but maybe its all in my head because i dont even see how it could be possible yes perhaps give gone around the bend and im not claiming that any of this is true but i wanted to share my thoughts and see what you think is it all really just a goddamned swam quote from hiniguel on february pmwell sr it has been a pleasure to serve you all the way i have for the last years however at this moment in time i am done with this place at least under current leadership i have done much for the community along with other let us not forget but i believe the amatuers at the top running this place have simply taken the name of our previous market to run a market built upon our old leaders solidarity and respect for his community to simply abuse our human nature if coca cola was bought over today yet kept everything the same you will assume that coca cola is no different wouldnt you that is however not the case it could be totally changed the leader is a liar he has good intentions at heart but has proved to you he is willing to lie time and time again to obtain your trust this is not the sr i was proud to be part of i will continue vending until sunday evening i will have some more funds for clu and stealth to distribute also as well as i am going to be personally paying some other members some coins as i feel it my obligation too then i will be gone until march th when i will return to fix the refunds for those several auntie buyers who are claiming no shows i will be online every other day possibly but only to communicate with certain people after that i am gone i hope we find a place we can really call our silk road again at the current state and with the people leading sadly this will not be it quote from hiniguel on february pmquote from bluegiraffe on february pmquote from hiniguel on february pmquote from bluegiraffe on february pmquote from hiniguel on february amquote from tragicallyhip on february amso then who runs owns the hux account defcon created that himself to deceive everyone hiniguel that seems rather sucked up sounds like you guys are all full of bullshiti was told by staff numerous times there was only one developer when chatting and that was deacon hux is a shall account most likely used to make it look like there is more on board than there really is deceiving essentially remember how full of bullshit i am when i am the one funding the community at the moment wealthy or not no one is due a penny from me i do it for two reasons i believe in karma and i want to help others with something i have lots of but done need and because i am going to do everything my power to actually get this moving again so shut the fuck up ill be straight you know nothing defcon isnt a bad person but he is no leader he has lied to us countless times and he needs help with this place he cant be the face of s part of support and the only developer i pmed him before telling him if he told me everything i could fix it and he ignored me had he told me everything i was going to pay him every btc that was taken from the site so he could restore a bit of faith in the community but he never and i was told he outright called me a liar by someone in a pm to them other staff members will confirm i know way more than just a vendor should he cant face the fact he shouldnt be leading if you cant be honest admit mistakes tell your community exactly whats happening then you can not be a leader me club and stealth are doing everything we can to make sure this place is safe that no one is hurt because of sr as thats what we want stopped violence and drug association chemmy may do as well i think cat works behind the scenes though you know why this place is bullshit because now its all about the money dpr led for a cause and a movement we are no movement everyone knows we are here drugs in the mail is now old news a movement progresses what defcon has is a drug empire that he cant handle on his own scammers are rampant because it earns money for the site wallet i believe so they can hedge the escrow still not ethical a market all about money will collapse sooner or later the core needs to have a passion for what they believe in dpr did thats why it ran well shame ross was not the brightest fuck did i read that right hiniguel you offered defcon to pay him all the coin that was stolen from the site and he ignored that offer first it appears from what i am reading here that you are genuinely helping people and doing so out of your own funds if that i be so then you have my deepest respect something i do not give lightly and i need to ask was that offer for real give heard figures like m that has gone missing are you sorted to the degree that that is something you could and would do if thats for real i would like to become your apprentice seriously to learn to work with money in a way i have not yet personally accomplished putting myself in defcons shoes for the moment and assuming for the purposes of this discussion that hes being straight with us and wasnt party to the hack could he trust you how much were you asking him to share with you in exchange for you making it right im trying to feel and understand how he might be thinking in response to your offer bgi never offered outright i was going to had he been honest with me i proved plenty of times i knew things i shouldnt of courtesy of my it team i have busted my ass as a vendor always and always helped the community he offered me a god position fucked me about for weeks then told me it would be actuated in hours i thought great lets fucking fix this place it was never actuated then the money went missing so i launched an investigation it cost a lot i know things a simple vendor should not know i let the community know what i was finding defcon pmed me with a message i simply said that if he told me everything i would fix it by fix it i meant replace the money i guess he didnt know that he ignored me dr shit himself when we talked from what he read of what i was posting on the forum not heard from him since stexo is the reason some of the mods were linked to both accounts from the old forum and the new one stexo made false promises to pay people for things i have proof of this he was dr now where is deacon no where to be fucking seen while me drclu and stealth fix this place if doing what give done doesnt get me a staff position then there is nothing else i can do i mean my it guys could hack the site and fuck around with it until he listened to me but whats the point that is not what sr is about i only opened shop again so i could get coins quicker i keep them office and due to laundering techniques i can only move a day aand it takes hours to get them from me to mods defcon doesnt even have seconds to thank me for helping everyone clu and stealth at the moment dont seem to get told much either and they have been paying people with their own money too i just think its a disgrace there has been little to no sign of the leader since it happened thatll really restore confidence in your community wont it defcon im only going to be able to stay here so long until i go as i cant watch a place i love be treated the way it is i want a staff position if paying nearly grand towards sorting a mess that wasnt mine isnt enough then defcon is either a lunatic or fears to have me on board for some reason if thats the case then ill make sure everyone gets help if they need it then im gone would you make that offer again if deacon were to meet you in your request respect for you sharing as directly as you are beno lets just say i have better things places to spend the money on places where the people in control are better at what they do and will not lie to their community time and time again let alone let people scam just to earn themselves money on commision quote from mdmazing on february amthis is indeed a sad farewell but defiant by far the most honorable one in the history of the road words can not express the kindness of this man hiniguel didnt have to help us the ones who lost money big or small yet he chose to on a massive scale wise this man saved my life and i am a complete stranger to him long story short i placed two large orders for a few guys who i shouldnt of have got involved with days or so prior before the hack had went down i borrowed a total of rough estimate not comfortable giving exact amounts publicly which ended up being stolen along with everyone elses so once these guys heard the news they called me up and gave me a place and time to discuss business all in all i had days to recover their funds or i was a dead man i then read up on hiniguel and seen his generousity via posts of fellow community members and decided to reach out to him for help take note that i havent ever spoken to hiniguel before hand and im not a very big poster aka not very well known on here but ivebeen around since the beginning of the original road and this guy replied back saying he could save my ass this struck me as absolutely incredible way too good to be true he made sure that these guys who i owed to would back off and wait for their payments he sent me a total of btc which i got for at the time and sent me enough goods to pay the full amount nack plus some extra i dont want to get into specifics for security reasons as to what goods are but in sure you guys and gals understand what i mean i ended up being able to rake up roughly for these guys plus the hiniguel sent me which bought me some time until the rest arrives i promised him a full repayment and he will recieve that within days days being the maximum and he didnt even care about repayment however i am a man of my word and i am repaying every cent including anything extra that is left i am a complete stranger to this fellow i even offered to doxx myself being that desperate and he had zero interest in my information he saved my life and i think we all as a community should thank him i really hope you have the best possible life a man could ask for i really do my friend you deserve it i have the utmost respect for you hiniguel and i really hope to see you around again sometime whether it be here or another market forum one last thing imho i believe if anyone should be the captain of this ship it should be you hiniguel we need a leader like you a true libertarian a freedom fighter a captain whose main focus isnt revolved around money a captain who will take great care of his crew if anyone of you share the same opinions as me please post and let hiniguel know in love to see you create a real marketplace or take control of this ship and steer it away from the giant iceberg ahead quote from hiniguel on february pmquote from h unit on february pmback bone of the community my ass no one knows what goes on behind the scenes just cause hiniguel posts up i just spent xxix pounds helping out people and xxxx pounds doing other things l excuses for everything excuses on top of excuses on top of excuses i ve been having strong suspicions that this is actually limitless the cockiness is starting to show a lot more oh and i saw that thread about energy money laundering services having some trouble pretty fucking convenient how hard is it to connect to silkroad for him im calling bullshit on the orders sent out that are going on days days is a problem people need their money now you brag about how you have over a million pounds all the tie but you tie up peoples money no one likes their time being wasted chances are it was never sent or it was sent several weeks later ok mr pounds refund the fucking aussies and be done with it limitless always used to brag about numbers and what he was doing on friday night or just latently giving stupid details like your money launderer energo lost a bunch of money but its ok he just paid me back k who the fuck would say that on an open forum such as this only a met head who doesnt understand how to operate you are cock as shit and it has shown your defense to that situation was rascally you were such a super pro vendor that it wouldnt matter what you said cause leo would have trouble because of some bullshit reason just fucking talk like a real professional you can say all the time that the reason you do those things is because you like to drop misinformation but its getting to a point where it is fucking annoying that you just received pounds but cant refund you vendor orders which by ur calculations is like only of your profits cause you are a huge drug lord in real lifetinfoil hat mode only hearsaylimetless always loved to brag i would be veeeeeerrrrrry careful with these guys these dark markets are home to many psychological operators do not let the post count and karma fool you you need to question everything it is not coincidence that his money laudnerer is having connection problems the week he was supposed to come back with results these guys have excuses for nearly everything you may have most people fooled by i was fortunate enough to be placed in a job environment where i have to critically assess other pals personalities and when i first viewed your career you know what i thought he can be a star if he can try to avoid getting cock god stop worshipping this guy all you did was reading through a small section of a forum drama event stop being sheep time and time again i tell people do not look at numbers or stories that i post take the context of the post and go by that opsec of professionals is to fool people like you in to thinking i am stupid enough to do the things you think i say and do for that all it shows is that i am actually good at what i do quote from dread pirate roberts on december pmthis point has come up a lot recently and although i do not intend to get into any great detail on the subject in public i do need to highlight some issues which this single suggestion encompasses well some of the points i wish to raise are similar to what would be discussed between staff and the very highest echelons of silk road when we consider new ideas im not aware of who first suggested it but there is word spreading that mufti signature addresses are somehow the holy grail on online markets and that it would stop bugs thefts and problems faced from law enforcements but this severely overlooks a lot of the practical problems we face as an online market yes it is true that it is theoretically more secure than the current bitcoin system as it is backed by strong crypto but in practice it does not convert so well given steps must be taken in addition to usual market practices right now as an approximate market figure pip uptake is between and unknown reason for fluctuations but us timezones have the lowest pip uptake of all pgp is a relatively straight forward step towards protecting your privacy and as far as the learning curve goes it is certainly below that of learning to sign mufti signature transactions so the evidence right now to suggest implementing the idea would be more beneficial than harmful is not true as we find preventing customers from having an easy to use interface will drive them to other markets ones which are usually less secure and less trustworthy as we have seen with sheep marketplace do not forget sheep was cast the eye of doubt when it first come about but because it was an easier to use interface it took the lions share of the market above black market reloaded which has a long and stable history another concern highlighted by my fellow staff is that to sign a transaction you have two options local storage or remote services remote services would negate the point of the implementation so for this we shall disregard that consideration leaving us with local storage if a person was to have their hardware seized holding a bitcoin wallet will then tie you in to the block chain which can not be concealed and is certainly one of the strongest pieces of evidence which could be presented against an individual this risk can be significantly mitigate through the use of encryption layers but to the average user it is unlikely they would take such measures and so we are only actually leaving more evidence in less secure places mufti signature transactions will also mean the transaction must be known to all parties and therefore the bitcoin trail faces increased exposure silk road operates and protects users by making it impossible for one party to identify which deposit or withdrawals belongs to which buyer or vendor something not possible with mufti signature transactions it could be argued that mixing services may be employed to mitigate such risks but our research has shown only a fraction of users actually mix their bitcoins reflectively before placing them into our system and so i have no confidence in such a setup as it provides further evidence for honeypot vendors should they ever be set up looking to arrest buyers and it further prevents lazy vendors from being caught if they do not take the proper precautions most users do not mix their bitcoins but an even smaller user share is those who mix their bitcoins without a single point of failure ie use more than company service to mix them and so if law enforcement were to gain leverage over a mixing service or continued their program of legally tapping into such services a credible threat then this brings the risk of huge exposure for tens of thousands of users i hope this has helped clarify at least some of the reasons the administration is reluctant to implement this suggestion in its current form we do have some ideas to counter some of the above ourselves but even with that it is difficult to see this as a step in the right direction just yet we are all for making use of proved technology but at the same time we must make it as accessible as possible to not drive away those who arent comfortable with it just yet quote from defcon on february pmi am deeply thankful for the hundreds of supporting messages ive received i am consistently blown away by how the core of this community come together in times of strife to the multitude of you who lost faith in silk road i still am glad give heard your words i am still devastated that i have failed you and even i have fallen victim to this attack the majority of my personal earnings are completely gone my life is not in danger though and my identity is still protected i m thankful for this so now it s time to share with you our plan to move forward i realize you have no way of knowing whether im telling the truth on anything trying to communicate the authenticity of my true character on the darknet is difficult to say the least and i do not expect any of you to take me at my word but my actions over the next few weeks will speak louder than words ever could and if you stick around you ll realize this silk road is not dead are here to stay and for the most part i believe our values are the same as yours the community s and even though i represent the latest idiot to make a security mistake i am unlike those who simply give in and am determined to use lessons learned to fight for this communitys long term security im focusing on mufti signature transactions as our only safe trading mechanism long term additional i am ready and willing to collaborate with other darknet administrators and utilize our talents penetration testing team to help them to regularly audit their security and although the tinfoil club will probably hate this and continue to tear me to shreds without regard for my actions in december and whether you choose to believe them or not here are the facts i live a very busy and complicated life i take opsec to extreme levels which consume many of my hours per day any time you see me here it means i have completed a checklist which requires over an hour of preparation for me to reposition and reconfigure many things to ensure i leave the most animal trail possible and can safely connect to this place this job will never be safe and it is impossible to be perfectly covert i know what i am facing both from le and from vendors who do not share my opinions of non violence all released announcements were my true plans and all delays were due to anticipated external factors upon which i can not elaborate my staff has been very frustrated at my lack of ability to keep the dev team on time again this is completely my fault and something for which i take complete responsibility i do not trust any developers so i meticulously review anything the dev team sends to me many have criticise me for this and i listened to them had i reviewed the code even more meticulously and delayed the fix to speed up slow withdrawals last month transaction malleability would not have affected us at all this is completely my fault for listening to critics instead of my own sense of caution the public has known that auto finalize has been disabled for a long time and has known that the escrow balance is massive any smart person could deduce that re enabling of auto finalize requires me to move a vast sum from cold storage to the hot storage wallet to ensure adequate fund availability which admitted was too large and one of my biggest failures this month the attack was survival and timed perfectly the reason such a high quantity of coins was stolen was because we were preparing to implement auto finalization and had therefore moved a huge volume from the cold storage to the hot storage to ensure the coins from all auto finalized orders could be withdrawn without a hitch here are as many details on the attack as i can provide i am still investigating and do not want to leak anything which could compromise any other markets transparency in this issue is key however you deserve as granular an explanation as possible as to why this happened s attack investigation results as of feb when withdrawal delays were happening last month we wrote a custom bitcoin implementation using several available libraries a reference and built it on a shared infrastructure to load balance across accounts and provide risk mitigation if ever one server was compromise as this implementation was being written by behind the scenes dev staff a lynch mob was getting exponentially worse in the forums our moderate staff became more and more insisted that it was crucial to fix this problem immediately relaying to me many concerns and threats from the community we cut a corner deciding to watch transactions many community members were reporting missing withdrawals weeks after sending them we implemented a liberal check to the refresh deposit balances link on the account page in essence we allowed it to search deeply for any missing coins rescanning and rescanning one of our team members was familiar with mtgoxs procedures and source code and vouched for the idea our thoughts were that if the largest bitcoin exchange was using this approach to find missing coins it must be commonplace i received her his permission to publish this the transaction malleability bug was published last week at a time when i was disconnected from the internet for an extended period for open reasons i did not become aware of the threat until the attack was already occurring this was a failure on my part to trust more staff with critical access to stop withdrawals the people who did have access to disable withdrawals were terrified of doing it without my permission due to how negatively the community reacts when withdrawals are turned off they knew if they disabled withdrawals then re enabled them there would be a run on the bank and i would need to be online to deposit cold storage into hot storage in effect this was my failure to emphasize to staff that it is always day to lean on the side of caution and hit killswitches as they deem necessary it was also my failure to communicate expectations to the community that sometimes killswitches will have to be hit and it just means were playing it safe this month it is clear we did not play it safe killswitches are pointless if the only person confident enough to hit them is the boss the attacker used an account first registered in early jan to try exploiting the vulnerability looking back at the accounts history indicates that this account has been used to pentest many aspects of our system unsuccessfully every previous attempt to find an attack vector failed due to hardening done by our penetration testing team i had previously seen these attempts in the logs as something to celebrate look our hardening is working this hacker would have won but we put security over features several people suggested disabling the hackers accounts but that is pointless in our business as anyone can simply re register we are still unclean as to the exact approach used to cause our servers perception of transactions to mismatch with reality because we have largely been focusing on preparing for relaunch and building communication to share with you the community over the past day to the best of our understanding the attacker deposited increasingly larger amounts of bitcoins and withdrew them while flooding the blockchain with ddos of similar transactions our system reflected his withdrawals and his account showed as zero the attacker rapidly clicked refresh deposits link until our code assumed that the transaction failed all indications point to malleability as the root case our system re credited his account with the x btc it judged unsuccessfully withdrawn this again due to the liberal rescanning mechanisms added last month see point in reality our servers perceived the transactions accurately and the btc were successfully withdrawn as a result our system accurately represented the users balance as larger than it truly was this allowed the attacker to withdraw coins again the attacker began depositing larger amounts such as btc at a time in order to exploit the vulnerability quickly they then drained our entire hot storage in one bitcoin server shard and tried the attack from one of their other accounts the other account was on a different shard and allowed that hot storage to be drained the attacker continued using different accounts until virtual all of our hot storage shards were drained due to the type of vulnerability our accounting system had an inaccurate perception of bitcoins on hand and therefore did not trigger any alerts until real user withdrawals began failing unexpectedly this was a failure on our part to build a new server alert to check each shard of the new shared bitcoin infrastructure and another symptom of how rushed we were when implementing the new system during a forum lynch mob about slow withdrawals lessons learned so far more staff should have access to killswitches and should not be afraid to use them even if its just because of some news post about on clearnet about some transaction malleability thing killswitches should be used liberally and regularly a community needs to be comfortable with regular downtime especially during periods when community safety and the safety of its money could be threatened a good staff will be responsible paranoid and hitting killswitches as they deem necessary and should not be afraid of their community panicking each time precaution is exercised there s more to web security than rigorous penetration testing it also requires the constant review of external services systems and infrastructures never make assumptions when implementing protocols you did not design had we not trusted magots staff procedures we would have reviewed our approaches with much more rigor just because a large companys procedures are successful does not make them are safe accept that your community will hate you regardless in the darknet you will be crucified by your community if anything ever goes wrong psychologically prepare for everyone to hate you because you inevitably will fail at something and you will need to stay determined no matter what dont let it get to your head and done let it affect your rigor with security we cut corners with our deposit withdrawal speed optimizations because we were afraid of the lynch mob we were foolish in this regard we should have taken the entire site offline for as long as it took to implement a high volume fault tolerant bitcoin server in a well tested rigorous manner this cost us an unspeakable amount of trust that we had saved to build some of us for years this is where were at with as much transparency as this medium allows the worst that could happen did not happen the worst thing that could happen for our communitys finances however did we hate that it occurred under our watch there is nothing we can do to change this all we can do is be transparent about where we are at and move forward to those who will respond here for dramatic effect please consider contributing your energy to the reconstruction of our community if you can not bring yourself to do this then please take your negativity elsewhere this is simple if you have lost faith in silk road i dont blame you in the least i also do not want to read about it in perpetuity trolling is easy trolling during a disaster is cowardice choosing to strengthen rather than troll when trolling is the popular move thats noble i know that i speak for all silk road staff seen and unseen when i speak these words we are going nowhere we will remain rebuilt and move forward toward the greater goal for which we strive by our

that hot storage to be drained the attacker continued using different accounts until virtual all of our hot storage shards were drained due to the type of vulnerability our accounting system had an inaccurate perception of bitcoins on hand and therefore did not trigger any alerts until real user withdrawals began failing unexpectedly this was a failure on our part to build a new server alert to check each shard of the new shared bitcoin infrastructure and another symptom of how rushed we were when implementing the new system during a forum lynch mob about slow withdrawals lessons learned so far more staff should have access to killswitches and should not be afraid to use them even if its just because of some news post about on clearnet about some transaction malleability thing killswitches should be used liberally and regularly a community needs to be comfortable with regular downtime especially during periods when community safety and the safety of its money could be threatened a good staff will be responsible paranoid and hitting killswitches as they deem necessary and should not be afraid of their community panicking each time precaution is exercised there s more to web security than rigorous penetration testing it also requires the constant review of external services systems and infrastructures never make assumptions when implementing protocols you did not design had we not trusted magots staff procedures we would have reviewed our approaches with much more rigor just because a large companys procedures are successful does not make them are safe accept that your community will hate you regardless in the darknet you will be crucified by your community if anything ever goes wrong psychologically prepare for everyone to hate you because you inevitably will fail at something and you will need to stay determined no matter what dont let it get to your head and done let it affect your rigor with security we cut corners with our deposit withdrawal speed optimizations because we were afraid of the lynch mob we were foolish in this regard we should have taken the entire site offline for as long as it took to implement a high volume fault tolerant bitcoin server in a well tested rigorous manner this cost us an unspeakable amount of trust that we had saved to build some of us for years this is where were at with as much transparency as this medium allows the worst that could happen did not happen the worst thing that could happen for our communitys finances however did we hate that it occurred under our watch there is nothing we can do to change this all we can do is be transparent about where we are at and move forward to those who will respond here for dramatic effect please consider contributing your energy to the reconstruction of our community if you can not bring yourself to do this then please take your negativity elsewhere this is simple if you have lost faith in silk road i dont blame you in the least i also do not want to read about it in perpetuity trolling is easy trolling during a disaster is cowardice choosing to strengthen rather than troll when trolling is the popular move thats noble i know that i speak for all silk road staff seen and unseen when i speak these words we are going nowhere we will remain rebuilt and move forward toward the greater goal for which we strive by our

february only fe market with current feedback system scamper s heavenwe are open to suggestions current feedback system what quick improvements would you make to enable fe only to operate safer first introduce a more rigorous probation period for new vendors which can only be lifted after a number of random purchases have been made by a dedicated secret team vendors on probation could for instance face limits on the amount or price of products they can list or the number of transactions they can conduct during the probation period once their integrity has been established by a number of secret transactions by the mystery shoppers the probation period could be lifted as previously stated i firmly believe that the most efficient and effective way to restore confidence in the marketplace is to have all new vendors secretly petted by a team of mystery shoppers these would be to all intents and purposes otherwise remarkable garden variety buyers who from time to time are engaged to purchase from a new vendor and provide a detailed report on the transaction alternately they could be a dedicated team with permanent membership but this could lead to their identities being detected the key is for the identity of the mystery shoppers and the timing or frequency of their transactions to remain unknown thus in theory giving new vendors an incentive to provide a consistent level of service and quality the mystery shoppers would provide detailed feedback on their transaction with a new vendor and this feedback could even appear in a separate category to other buyer feedback to distinguish it from possibly false feedback generated by fake transactions for more conclusive results ongoing quality control and investigation of buyer complaints multiply mystery shopper transactions could be made mystery shoppers could also be used as a way of ongoing quality assurance to randomly review the quality and service of any endor new or veteran the results of their transaction would then determine whether a new vendor should progress beyond the default probation period to prevent the possibility of collusion between mystery shopper and vendor membership of the team could be rotted or multiply mystery shopper purchases could be required to establish the bone fides of any new vendor these two measures a probation period for vendors coupled with random quality assurance provided by a team of mystery shoppers will go a long way to preventing swam vendors setting themselves up with fake feedback from fake transactions and i am confident they could be easily implements wow i really like this idea a mystery shopper thread would be great on the forums a dedicated team testing out the new vendors and rotating the buyers every now and then quote from stealth on march amwow ps someone has had their coffee today the leaders captains owners whatever you choose to call them are the best team on the darknet dangerdan and others blaming all this on defcon referring to him as useless unfit to lead etc you are sorely mistaken but you have the right to be wrong as it were you didnt choose him he didnt choose this job but he has taken the bull by the horns and believe me when i tell you this bs hurt us but it did not kill us it set into motion one of the greatest things i have ever seen the massive amount of people here including every member of staff giving of themselves to help those who lost out i am enjoying the energy in this thread keep it going i would not be here if this was not a cause i was willing to go to prison for and i certainly would not be here if i was not certain of both the moral fiber and capability our leaders but hey im just some anonymous thing from the darker quote from v on february pmquote from ktvstudio on february amthose users write over and over posts like scammmer sr is one big scam and sr is dead go to angora etc i really dont know why theyre doing that i think the reasons are for the most part two fold some users are genuinely concerned about the fact that they consider silk road to be a scam and are trying to get to the bottom of it more often this new general scheme marketplace culture were seeing develop that wasnt around during srs first market stretch is leading people to try and convince others to use their general links in the hope of making moneypeople have a right to voice their concerns and i would never want to stop that from happening where those concerns are genuine but it is counter productive when people are either a flooding the boards with the same message or b doing it to try and ruin the repute of a marketplace in order to promote their own or one they are afflicted with in terms of whether or not silk road is a swam though it will soon become apparent that our admin is a man of his word as users begin to see their pending balances replenished unfortunately however this will only stop those in group from voicing their concerns those in group will continue instead finding a different angle to shout about this is the part that is a shame not the part where people are genuinely concerned vquote from ktvstudio on february pm the core team the admins chief operators system admins forum mods support crew additional mods the mods forum mods business man the vendors vendor forum poster the base the community buyer forum posterthose are the four types of users you can find here the core team is now operating as system admins to implement new features into the system there working hours a day on that system the additional mods are dominated users who should support the core team with their work as forum mods they dont necessary live on the same continent and time zone theyre all volunteers so their online hours are variable but way less than the core team works the only thing those mods can do is forum stuff they probably have no contact to the core team beside this forum the vendors are users which have a economic interest in a working platform they often organize threads to stabilize the market like that trusted endor list and to gain clients help them find trusted vendors so that the scamming risk is lowered the community are users which in most cases just want to buy on the market when the market is not working many of those migrate to another market in fact is this group of users the most annoying group of all four they complain alot they often dont know how this system work they have nothing to loose here so the behaviour of some of them is really bad there are also the kind of users in the community who want to help and assist they explain the beginners how that system work so that they less likely be slammed they answer questions that otherwise a mod had to answer this is how this system here works this explains why some mods are in minor sections without having the possibility to contact the core team to inform the forum how far they got this explains why many users spam the forum and behave very unfriendly or unpolite they can pass easily to another market theyre not bound to any market the vendors are of course most of the time buisy with selling goods some of them are quite active here to assure that the community knows what theyve to do to get access to the market this is the hirarchy here so lets make the best out of it and keep the shop running and the core team away from unnecessary work quote from logburner on march ami dont believe sr stole the coins one bit it makes no sense them doing so i understand that people are angry but there is far too much hate all over the forums i have always been monitoring the forums since i joined sr but only now have i felt compelled to actually register a forum account and start posting people need to stay positive give the sr team some time and space to resolve the issues hopefully we will be back to some form of normalality very soonquote from gemma on february pmthis has certainly got me thinking first a point about the wider dark market community now more than ever we should all unite we already have the perfect community to call home the hub forum but thats for another day moving on to the idea of a silk road customer association i think this is a very good idea as customers we represent a majority of members and if on the same wavelength we do command a certain power without the customers what is the market now my vision is one of complete co operation with staff and vendors to ensure complete and utter disclosure from top to bottom we have to move away from division of groups and realise that only on the same page can we truly expect to flourish there are strange times for this market but from these strange times we may be able to build something that changes the sector for the better clear simple methods for asking questions posting feedback and for raising concerns a system whereby customers may be able to raise awareness to issues that if caught early on mean they cant develop into something bigger as we look into it you could create a sub forum elect representatives for customers and vendors who work to canvas opinion of their respective groups before taking it to staff thus saving staff time having to sort through repetition posts its an idealism but i really thing if people want it enough we could be involved with something special opinions ed . the wild ride continues lol still selling on sr must be a glass is full kinda optimist or something . the wild ride continues lol still selling on sr must be a glass is full kinda optimist or something . maybe you have detected a very few writers have experienced with the myriad possibilities of online self expression in this case im glad people are trying to figure out whats been going on here i dont have the brain energy tonight to try to follow all the above hypothesizing though i do hope we find the truth and appreciate your effort ed . quote from ed from sl on february pmhiniguel is leaving silk road and while he has been vague it seems obvious that defcon is a scammer and that the site is doomed from hiniguels thread i gathered he believes deacon lied but is not a scamper quote from hiniguel at leader is a liar he has good intentions at heart but has proved to you he is willing to lie time and time again to obtain your trust this is not the sr i was proud to be part of . quote from no nugz on march amthe wild ride continues lol still selling on sr must be a glass is full kinda optimist or something i can understand because wildly dissapointingly sr still gets the most traffic dispite all the missing btc and other bullshit they pull but i would be seriously cautious about keeping any coins there even for a few hours . spose very weird vibes on the sr forums tonight almost all of the posts replies are pro sr and they are coming from a handful of name no familiar faces and then there is the murmur in the community again bad vibes regarding captainwhitebeard and hiniguel reports of scamming being absent worshipped by some reviled by others some are now of the opinion that it is just one man behind limitless stexo hiniguel dpr defcon hux etc and it is beginning to make sense watching the latest theatrics regarding hiniguel its hard not to see a setup for the next big thing nobody is buying defcons bullshit anymore so hiniguel steps up and saves the day he refunds a bunch of money to people or pretends to using more name all the while denouncing defcon sr he says hes leaving but hints that the market might be re born elsewhere in the future people nominating him as the next leader im comparing name posts and while i have just begun it looks like hiniguel bluegiraffe mdmazing and hes talking to himself consider the following quotes and study them carefully pay attention to the sentence paragraph structure punctuation etc one thing jumps out at me his use of the em dash and semicolon but he represents an em dash thus single hyphen with a space on either side not many people employ these marks of punctuation in their writing or they misuse them furthermore there is a common use of the term mate used by many of these nyms as well as a failure to capitalize the letter i i then there is the overlay content topics threads many sound like they are coming from someone on the s staff take gemma for instance perhaps compiling a list would be in order compare just the following dpr in the admin roles dr defcon the similarity is obvious the numerical lists bold headlines etc and cwb jabbatheslut stealth v hes a goddamned one man band dozens of nyms everywhere but maybe its all in my head because i dont even see how it could be possible yes perhaps give gone around the bend and im not claiming that any of this is true but i wanted to share my thoughts and see what you think is it all really just a goddamned swam quote from hiniguel on february pmwell sr it has been a pleasure to serve you all the way i have for the last years however at this moment in time i am done with this place at least under current leadership i have done much for the community along with other let us not forget but i believe the amatuers at the top running this place have simply taken the name of our previous market to run a market built upon our old leaders solidarity and respect for his community to simply abuse our human nature if coca cola was bought over today yet kept everything the same you will assume that coca cola is no different wouldnt you that is however not the case it could be totally changed the leader is a liar he has good intentions at heart but has proved to you he is willing to lie time and time again to obtain your trust this is not the sr i was proud to be part of i will continue vending until sunday evening i will have some more funds for clu and stealth to distribute also as well as i am going to be personally paying some other members some coins as i feel it my obligation too then i will be gone until march th when i will return to fix the refunds for those several auntie buyers who are claiming no shows i will be online every other day possibly but only to communicate with certain people after that i am gone i hope we find a place we can really call our silk road again at the current state and with the people leading sadly this will not be it quote from hiniguel on february pmquote from bluegiraffe on february pmquote from hiniguel on february pmquote from bluegiraffe on february pmquote from hiniguel on february amquote from tragicallyhip on february amso then who runs owns the hux account defcon created that himself to deceive everyone hiniguel that seems rather sucked up sounds like you guys are all full of bullshiti was told by staff numerous times there was only one developer when chatting and that was deacon hux is a shall account most likely used to make it look like there is more on board than there really is deceiving essentially remember how full of bullshit i am when i am the one funding the community at the moment wealthy or not no one is due a penny from me i do it for two reasons i believe in karma and i want to help others with something i have lots of but done need and because i am going to do everything my power to actually get this moving again so shut the fuck up ill be straight you know nothing defcon isnt a bad person but he is no leader he has lied to us countless times and he needs help with this place he cant be the face of s part of support and the only developer i pmed him before telling him if he told me everything i could fix it and he ignored me had he told me everything i was going to pay him every btc that was taken from the site so he could restore a bit of faith in the community but he never and i was told he outright called me a liar by someone in a pm to them other staff members will confirm i know way more than just a vendor should he cant face the fact he shouldnt be leading if you cant be honest admit mistakes tell your community exactly whats happening then you can not be a leader me club and stealth are doing everything we can to make sure this place is safe that no one is hurt because of sr as thats what we want stopped violence and drug association chemmy may do as well i think cat works behind the scenes though you know why this place is bullshit because now its all about the money dpr led for a cause and a movement we are no movement everyone knows we are here drugs in the mail is now old news a movement progresses what defcon has is a drug empire that he cant handle on his own scammers are rampant because it earns money for the site wallet i believe so they can hedge the escrow still not ethical a market all about money will collapse sooner or later the core needs to have a passion for what they believe in dpr did thats why it ran well shame ross was not the brightest fuck did i read that right hiniguel you offered defcon to pay him all the coin that was stolen from the site and he ignored that offer first it appears from what i am reading here that you are genuinely helping people and doing so out of your own funds if that i be so then you have my deepest respect something i do not give lightly and i need to ask was that offer for real give heard figures like m that has gone missing are you sorted to the degree that that is something you could and would do if thats for real i would like to become your apprentice seriously to learn to work with money in a way i have not yet personally accomplished putting myself in defcons shoes for the moment and assuming for the purposes of this discussion that hes being straight with us and wasnt party to the hack could he trust you how much were you asking him to share with you in exchange for you making it right im trying to feel and understand how he might be thinking in response to your offer bgi never offered outright i was going to had he been honest with me i proved plenty of times i knew things i shouldnt of courtesy of my it team i have busted my ass as a vendor always and always helped the community he offered me a god position fucked me about for weeks then told me it would be actuated in hours i thought great lets fucking fix this place it was never actuated then the money went missing so i launched an investigation it cost a lot i know things a simple vendor should not know i let the community know what i was finding defcon pmed me with a message i simply said that if he told me everything i would fix it by fix it i meant replace the money i guess he didnt know that he ignored me dr shit himself when we talked from what he read of what i was posting on the forum not heard from him since stexo is the reason some of the mods were linked to both accounts from the old forum and the new one stexo made false promises to pay people for things i have proof of this he was dr now where is deacon no where to be fucking seen while me drclu and stealth fix this place if doing what give done doesnt get me a staff position then there is nothing else i can do i mean my it guys could hack the site and fuck around with it until he listened to me but whats the point that is not what sr is about i only opened shop again so i could get coins quicker i keep them office and due to laundering techniques i can only move a day aand it takes hours to get them from me to mods defcon doesnt even have seconds to thank me for helping everyone clu and stealth at the moment dont seem to get told much either and they have been paying people with their own money too i just think its a disgrace there has been little to no sign of the leader since it happened thatll really restore confidence in your community wont it defcon im only going to be able to stay here so long until i go as i cant watch a place i love be treated the way it is i want a staff position if paying nearly grand towards sorting a mess that wasnt mine isnt enough then defcon is either a lunatic or fears to have me on board for some reason if thats the case then ill make sure everyone gets help if they need it then im gone would you make that offer again if deacon were to meet you in your request respect for you sharing as directly as you are beno lets just say i have better things places to spend the money on places where the people in control are better at what they do and will not lie to their community time and time again let alone let people scam just to earn themselves money on commision quote from mdmazing on february amthis is indeed a sad farewell but defiant by far the most honorable one in the history of the road words can not express the kindness of this man hiniguel didnt have to help us the ones who lost money big or small yet he chose to on a massive scale wise this man saved my life and i am a complete stranger to him long story short i placed two large orders for a few guys who i shouldnt of have got involved with days or so prior before the hack had went down i borrowed a total of rough estimate not comfortable giving exact amounts publicly which ended up being stolen along with everyone elses so once these guys heard the news they called me up and gave me a place and time to discuss business all in all i had days to recover their funds or i was a dead man i then read up on hiniguel and seen his generousity via posts of fellow community members and decided to reach out to him for help take note that i havent ever spoken to hiniguel before hand and im not a very big poster aka not very well known on here but ivebeen around since the beginning of the original road and this guy replied back saying he could save my ass this struck me as absolutely incredible way too good to be true he made sure that these guys who i owed to would back off and wait for their payments he sent me a total of btc which i got for at the time and sent me enough goods to pay the full amount nack plus some extra i dont want to get into specifics for security reasons as to what goods are but in sure you guys and gals understand what i mean i ended up being able to rake up roughly for these guys plus the hiniguel sent me which bought me some time until the rest arrives i promised him a full repayment and he will recieve that within days days being the maximum and he didnt even care about repayment however i am a man of my word and i am repaying every cent including anything extra that is left i am a complete stranger to this fellow i even offered to doxx myself being that desperate and he had zero interest in my information he saved my life and i think we all as a community should thank him i really hope you have the best possible life a man could ask for i really do my friend you deserve it i have the utmost respect for you hiniguel and i really hope to see you around again sometime whether it be here or another market forum one last thing imho i believe if anyone should be the captain of this ship it should be you hiniguel we need a leader like you a true libertarian a freedom fighter a captain whose main focus isnt revolved around money a captain who will take great care of his crew if anyone of you share the same opinions as me please post and let hiniguel know in love to see you create a real marketplace or take control of this ship and steer it away from the giant iceberg ahead quote from hiniguel on february pmquote from h unit on february pmback bone of the community my ass no one knows what goes on behind the scenes just cause hiniguel posts up i just spent xxix pounds helping out people and xxxx pounds doing other things l excuses for everything excuses on top of excuses on top of excuses i ve been having strong suspicions that this is actually limitless the cockiness is starting to show a lot more oh and i saw that thread about energy money laundering services having some trouble pretty fucking convenient how hard is it to connect to silkroad for him im calling bullshit on the orders sent out that are going on days days is a problem people need their money now you brag about how you have over a million pounds all the tie but you tie up peoples money no one likes their time being wasted chances are it was never sent or it was sent several weeks later ok mr pounds refund the fucking aussies and be done with it limitless always used to brag about numbers and what he was doing on friday night or just latently giving stupid details like your money launderer energo lost a bunch of money but its ok he just paid me back k who the fuck would say that on an open forum such as this only a met head who doesnt understand how to operate you are cock as shit and it has shown your defense to that situation was rascally you were such a super pro vendor that it wouldnt matter what you said cause leo would have trouble because of some bullshit reason just fucking talk like a real professional you can say all the time that the reason you do those things is because you like to drop misinformation but its getting to a point where it is fucking annoying that you just received pounds but cant refund you vendor orders which by ur calculations is like only of your profits cause you are a huge drug lord in real lifetinfoil hat mode only hearsaylimetless always loved to brag i would be veeeeeerrrrrry careful with these guys these dark markets are home to many psychological operators do not let the post count and karma fool you you need to question everything it is not coincidence that his money laudnerer is having connection problems the week he was supposed to come back with results these guys have excuses for nearly everything you may have most people fooled by i was fortunate enough to be placed in a job environment where i have to critically assess other pals personalities and when i first viewed your career you know what i thought he can be a star if he can try to avoid getting cock god stop worshipping this guy all you did was reading through a small section of a forum drama event stop being sheep time and time again i tell people do not look at numbers or stories that i post take the context of the post and go by that opsec of professionals is to fool people like you in to thinking i am stupid enough to do the things you think i say and do for that all it shows is that i am actually good at what i do quote from dread pirate roberts on december pmthis point has come up a lot recently and although i do not intend to get into any great detail on the subject in public i do need to highlight some issues which this single suggestion encompasses well some of the points i wish to raise are similar to what would be discussed between staff and the very highest echelons of silk road when we consider new ideas im not aware of who first suggested it but there is word spreading that mufti signature addresses are somehow the holy grail on online markets and that it would stop bugs thefts and problems faced from law enforcements but this severely overlooks a lot of the practical problems we face as an online market yes it is true that it is theoretically more secure than the current bitcoin system as it is backed by strong crypto but in practice it does not convert so well given steps must be taken in addition to usual market practices right now as an approximate market figure pip uptake is between and unknown reason for fluctuations but us timezones have the lowest pip uptake of all pgp is a relatively straight forward step towards protecting your privacy and as far as the learning curve goes it is certainly below that of learning to sign mufti signature transactions so the evidence right now to suggest implementing the idea would be more beneficial than harmful is not true as we find preventing customers from having an easy to use interface will drive them to other markets ones which are usually less secure and less trustworthy as we have seen with sheep marketplace do not forget sheep was cast the eye of doubt when it first come about but because it was an easier to use interface it took the lions share of the market above black market reloaded which has a long and stable history another concern highlighted by my fellow staff is that to sign a transaction you have two options local storage or remote services remote services would negate the point of the implementation so for this we shall disregard that consideration leaving us with local storage if a person was to have their hardware seized holding a bitcoin wallet will then tie you in to the block chain which can not be concealed and is certainly one of the strongest pieces of evidence which could be presented against an individual this risk can be significantly mitigate through the use of encryption layers but to the average user it is unlikely they would take such measures and so we are only actually leaving more evidence in less secure places mufti signature transactions will also mean the transaction must be known to all parties and therefore the bitcoin trail faces increased exposure silk road operates and protects users by making it impossible for one party to identify which deposit or withdrawals belongs to which buyer or vendor something not possible with mufti signature transactions it could be argued that mixing services may be employed to mitigate such risks but our research has shown only a fraction of users actually mix their bitcoins reflectively before placing them into our system and so i have no confidence in such a setup as it provides further evidence for honeypot vendors should they ever be set up looking to arrest buyers and it further prevents lazy vendors from being caught if they do not take the proper precautions most users do not mix their bitcoins but an even smaller user share is those who mix their bitcoins without a single point of failure ie use more than company service to mix them and so if law enforcement were to gain leverage over a mixing service or continued their program of legally tapping into such services a credible threat then this brings the risk of huge exposure for tens of thousands of users i hope this has helped clarify at least some of the reasons the administration is reluctant to implement this suggestion in its current form we do have some ideas to counter some of the above ourselves but even with that it is difficult to see this as a step in the right direction just yet we are all for making use of proved technology but at the same time we must make it as accessible as possible to not drive away those who arent comfortable with it just yet quote from defcon on february pmi am deeply thankful for the hundreds of supporting messages ive received i am consistently blown away by how the core of this community come together in times of strife to the multitude of you who lost faith in silk road i still am glad give heard your words i am still devastated that i have failed you and even i have fallen victim to this attack the majority of my personal earnings are completely gone my life is not in danger though and my identity is still protected i m thankful for this so now it s time to share with you our plan to move forward i realize you have no way of knowing whether im telling the truth on anything trying to communicate the authenticity of my true character on the darknet is difficult to say the least and i do not expect any of you to take me at my word but my actions over the next few weeks will speak louder than words ever could and if you stick around you ll realize this silk road is not dead are here to stay and for the most part i believe our values are the same as yours the community s and even though i represent the latest idiot to make a security mistake i am unlike those who simply give in and am determined to use lessons learned to fight for this communitys long term security im focusing on mufti signature transactions as our only safe trading mechanism long term additional i am ready and willing to collaborate with other darknet administrators and utilize our talents penetration testing team to help them to regularly audit their security and although the tinfoil club will probably hate this and continue to tear me to shreds without regard for my actions in december and whether you choose to believe them or not here are the facts i live a very busy and complicated life i take opsec to extreme levels which consume many of my hours per day any time you see me here it means i have completed a checklist which requires over an hour of preparation for me to reposition and reconfigure many things to ensure i leave the most animal trail possible and can safely connect to this place this job will never be safe and it is impossible to be perfectly covert i know what i am facing both from le and from vendors who do not share my opinions of non violence all released announcements were my true plans and all delays were due to anticipated external factors upon which i can not elaborate my staff has been very frustrated at my lack of ability to keep the dev team on time again this is completely my fault and something for which i take complete responsibility i do not trust any developers so i meticulously review anything the dev team sends to me many have criticise me for this and i listened to them had i reviewed the code even more meticulously and delayed the fix to speed up slow withdrawals last month transaction malleability would not have affected us at all this is completely my fault for listening to critics instead of my own sense of caution the public has known that auto finalize has been disabled for a long time and has known that the escrow balance is massive any smart person could deduce that re enabling of auto finalize requires me to move a vast sum from cold storage to the hot storage wallet to ensure adequate fund availability which admitted was too large and one of my biggest failures this month the attack was survival and timed perfectly the reason such a high quantity of coins was stolen was because we were preparing to implement auto finalization and had therefore moved a huge volume from the cold storage to the hot storage to ensure the coins from all auto finalized orders could be withdrawn without a hitch here are as many details on the attack as i can provide i am still investigating and do not want to leak anything which could compromise any other markets transparency in this issue is key however you deserve as granular an explanation as possible as to why this happened s attack investigation results as of feb when withdrawal delays were happening last month we wrote a custom bitcoin implementation using several available libraries a reference and built it on a shared infrastructure to load balance across accounts and provide risk

more and more insisted that it was crucial to fix this problem immediately relaying to me many concerns and threats from the community we cut a corner deciding to watch transactions many community

was disconnected from the internet for an extended period for open reasons i did not become aware of the threat until the attack was already occurring this was a failure on my part to trust more staff with critical access to stop withdrawals the people who did have access to disable withdrawals were terrified of doing it without my permission due to how negatively the community reacts when withdrawals are turned off they knew if they disabled withdrawals then re enabled them there would be a run on the bank and i would need to be online to deposit cold storage into hot storage in effect this was my failure to emphasize to staff that it is always day to lean on the side of caution and hit killswitches as they deem necessary it was also my failure to communicate expectations to the community that sometimes killswitches will have to be hit and it just means were playing it safe this month it is clear we did not play it safe killswitches are pointless if the only person confident enough to hit them is the boss the attacker used an account first registered in early jan to try exploiting the vulnerability looking back at the accounts history indicates that this account has been used to pentest many aspects of our system unsuccessfully every previous attempt to find an attack vector failed due to hardening done by our penetration testing team i had previously seen these attempts in the logs as something to celebrate look our hardening is working this hacker would have won but we put security over features several people suggested disabling the hackers accounts but that is pointless in our business as anyone can simply re register we are still unclean as to the exact approach used to cause our servers perception of transactions to mismatch with reality because we have largely been focusing on preparing for relaunch and building communication to share with you the community over the past day to the best of our understanding the attacker deposited increasingly larger amounts of bitcoins and withdrew them while flooding the blockchain with ddos of similar transactions our system reflected his withdrawals and his account showed as zero the attacker rapidly clicked refresh deposits link until our code assumed that the transaction failed all indications point to malleability as the root case our system re credited his account with the x btc it judged unsuccessfully withdrawn this again due to the liberal rescanning mechanisms added last month see point in reality our servers perceived the transactions accurately and the btc were successfully withdrawn as a result our system accurately represented the users balance as larger than it truly was this allowed the attacker to withdraw coins again the attacker began depositing larger amounts such as btc at a time in order to exploit the vulnerability quickly they then drained our entire hot storage in one bitcoin server shard and tried the attack from one of their other accounts the other account was on a different shard and allowed that hot storage to be drained the attacker continued using different accounts until virtual all of our hot storage shards were drained due to the type of vulnerability our accounting system had an inaccurate perception of bitcoins on hand and therefore did not trigger any alerts until real user withdrawals began failing unexpectedly this was a failure on our part to build a new server alert to check each shard of the new shared bitcoin infrastructure and another symptom of how rushed we were when implementing the new system during a forum lynch mob about slow withdrawals lessons learned so far more staff should have access to killswitches and should not be afraid to use them even if its just because of some news post

community safety and the safety of its money could be threatened a good staff will be responsible paranoid and hitting killswitches as they deem necessary and should not be afraid of their community panicking each time precaution is exercised there s more to web security than rigorous penetration testing it also requires the constant review of external services systems and infrastructures never

procedures are successful does not make them are safe accept that your community will hate you regardless in the darknet you will be crucified by your community if anything ever goes wrong psychologically prepare for everyone to hate you because you inevitably will fail at something and you will need to stay determined no matter what dont let it get to your head and done let it affect your rigor with security we cut corners with our deposit withdrawal speed optimizations because we were afraid of the lynch mob we were foolish in this regard we should have taken the entire site offline for as long as it took to implement a high volume fault tolerant bitcoin server in a well tested rigorous manner this cost us an unspeakable amount of trust that we had saved to build some of us for years this is where were at with as much transparency as this medium allows the worst that could happen did not happen the worst thing that could happen for our communitys finances however did we hate that it occurred under our watch there is nothing we can do to change this all we can do is be transparent about where we are at and move forward to those who will respond here for dramatic effect please consider contributing your energy to the reconstruction of our community if you can not bring yourself to do this then please take your negativity elsewhere this is simple if you have lost faith in silk road i dont blame you in the least i also do not want to read about it in perpetuity trolling is easy trolling during a disaster is cowardice choosing to strengthen rather than troll when trolling is the popular move thats noble i know that i speak for all silk road staff seen and unseen when i speak these words we are going nowhere we will remain rebuilt and move forward toward the greater goal for which we strive by our running of this marketplace personal freedom and foundation human rights silk road will always rise again code select begin pgp signed message hash sha i am deeply thankful for the hundreds of supporting messages ive received i am consistently blown away by how the core of this community come together in times of strife to the multitude of you who lost faith in silk road i still am glad give heard your words i am still devastated that i have failed you and even i have fallen victim to this attack the majority of my personal earnings are completely gone my life is not in danger though and my identity is still protected i m thankful for this so now it s time to share with you our plan to move forward i realize you have no way of knowing whether im telling the truth on anything trying to communicate the authenticity of my true character on the darknet is difficult to say the least and i do not expect any of you to take me at my word but my actions over the next few weeks will speak louder than words ever could and if you stick around you ll realize this silk road is not dead are here to stay and for the most part i believe our values are the same as yours the community s and even though i represent the latest idiot to make a security mistake i am unlike those who simply give in and am determined to use lessons learned to fight for this communitys long term security im focusing on mufti signature transactions as our only safe trading mechanism long term additional i am ready and willing to collaborate with other darknet administrators and utilize our talents penetration testing team to help them to regularly audit their security and although the tinfoil club will probably hate this and continue to tear me to shreds without regard for my actions in december and whether you choose to believe them or not here are the facts i live a very busy and complicated life i take opsec to extreme levels which consume many of my hours per day any time you see me here it means i have completed a checklist which requires over an hour of preparation for me to reposition and reconfigure many things to ensure i leave the most animal trail possible and can safely connect to this place this job will never be safe and it is impossible to be perfectly covert i know what i am facing both from le and from vendors who do not share my opinions of non violence all released announcements were my true plans and all delays were due to anticipated external factors upon which i can not elaborate my staff has been very frustrated at my lack of ability to keep the dev team on time again this is completely my fault and something for which i take complete responsibility i do not trust any developers so i meticulously review anything the dev team sends to me many have criticise me for this and i listened to them had i reviewed the code even more meticulously and delayed the fix to speed up slow withdrawals last month transaction malleability would not have affected us at all this is completely my fault for listening to critics instead of my own sense of caution the public has known that auto finalize has been disabled for a long time and has known that the escrow balance is massive any smart person could deduce that re enabling of auto finalize requires me to move a vast sum from cold storage to the hot storage wallet to ensure adequate fund availability which admitted was too large and one of my biggest failures this month the attack was survival and timed perfectly the reason such a high quantity of coins was stolen was because we were preparing to implement auto finalization and had therefore moved a huge volume from the cold storage to the hot storage to ensure the coins from all auto finalized orders could be withdrawn without a hitch here are as many details on the attack as i can provide i am still investigating and do not want to leak anything which could compromise any other markets transparency in this issue is key however you deserve as granular an explanation as possible as to why this happened s attack investigation results as of feb when withdrawal delays were happening last month we wrote a custom bitcoin implementation using several available libraries a reference and built it on a shared infrastructure to load balance across accounts and provide risk mitigation if ever one server was compromise as this implementation was being written by behind the scenes dev staff a lynch mob was getting exponentially worse in the forums our moderate staff became

february pmquote from parisproject on february only fe market with current feedback system scamper s heavenwe are open to suggestions current feedback system what quick improvements would you make to enable fe only to operate safer first introduce a more rigorous probation period for new vendors which can only be lifted after a number of random purchases have been made by a dedicated secret team vendors on probation could for instance face limits on the amount or price of products they can list or the number of transactions they can conduct during the probation period once their integrity has been established by a number of secret transactions by the mystery shoppers the probation period could be lifted as previously stated i firmly believe that the most efficient and effective way to restore confidence in the marketplace is to have all new vendors secretly petted by a team of mystery shoppers these would be to all intents and purposes otherwise remarkable garden variety buyers who from time to time are engaged to purchase from a new vendor and provide a detailed report on the transaction alternately they could be a dedicated team with permanent membership but this could lead to their identities being detected the key is for the identity of the mystery shoppers and the timing or frequency of their transactions to remain unknown thus in theory giving new vendors an incentive to provide a consistent level of service and quality the mystery shoppers would provide detailed feedback on their transaction with a new vendor and this feedback could even appear in a separate category to other buyer feedback to distinguish it from possibly false feedback generated by fake transactions for more conclusive results ongoing quality control and investigation of buyer complaints multiply mystery shopper transactions could be made mystery shoppers could also be used as a way of ongoing quality assurance to randomly review the quality and service of any endor new or veteran the results of their transaction would then determine whether a new vendor should progress beyond the default probation period to prevent the possibility of collusion between mystery shopper and vendor membership of the team could be rotted or multiply mystery shopper purchases could be required to establish the bone fides of any new vendor these two measures a probation period for vendors coupled with random quality assurance provided by a team of mystery shoppers will go a long way to preventing swam vendors setting themselves up with fake feedback from fake transactions and i am confident they could be easily implements wow i really like this idea a mystery shopper thread would be great on the forums a dedicated team testing out the new vendors and rotating the buyers every now and then quote from stealth on march amwow ps someone has had their coffee today the leaders captains owners whatever you choose to call them are the best team on the darknet dangerdan and others blaming all this on defcon referring to him as useless unfit to lead etc you are sorely mistaken but you have the right to be wrong as it were you didnt choose him he didnt choose this job but he has taken the bull by the horns and believe me when i tell you this bs hurt us but it did not kill us it set into motion one of the greatest things i have ever seen the massive amount of people here including every member of staff giving of themselves to help those who lost out i am enjoying the energy in this thread keep it going i would not be here if this was not a cause i was willing to go to prison for and i certainly would not be here if i was not certain of both the moral fiber and capability our leaders but hey im just some anonymous thing from the darker quote from v on february pmquote from ktvstudio on february amthose users write over and over posts like scammmer sr is one big scam and sr is dead go to angora etc i really dont know why theyre doing that i think the reasons are for the most part two fold some users are genuinely concerned about the fact that they consider silk road to be a scam and are trying to get to the bottom of it more often this new general scheme marketplace culture were seeing develop that wasnt around during srs first market stretch is leading people to try and convince others to use their general links in the hope of making moneypeople have a right to voice their concerns and i would never want to stop that from happening where those concerns are genuine but it is counter productive when people are either a flooding the boards with the same message or b doing it to try and ruin the repute of a marketplace in order to promote their own or one they are afflicted with in terms of whether or not silk road is a swam though it will soon become apparent that our admin is a man of his word as users begin to see their pending balances replenished unfortunately however this will only stop those in group from voicing their concerns those in group will continue instead finding a different angle to shout about this is the part that is a shame not the part where people are genuinely concerned vquote from ktvstudio on february pm the core team the admins chief operators system admins forum mods support crew additional mods the mods forum mods business man the vendors vendor forum poster the base the community buyer forum posterthose are the four types of users you can find here the core team is now operating as system admins to implement new features into the system there working hours a day on that system the additional mods are dominated users who should support the core team with their work as forum mods they dont necessary live on the same continent and time zone theyre all volunteers so their online hours are variable but way less than the core team works the only thing those mods can do is forum stuff they probably have no contact to the core team beside this forum the vendors are users which have a economic interest in a working platform they often organize threads to stabilize the market like that trusted endor list and to gain clients help them find trusted vendors so that the scamming risk is lowered the community are users which in most cases just want to buy on the market when the market is not working many of those migrate to another market in fact is this group of users the most annoying group of all four they complain alot they often dont know how this system work they have nothing to loose here so the behaviour of some of them is really bad there are also the kind of users in the community who want to help and assist they explain the beginners how that system work so that they less likely be slammed they answer questions that otherwise a mod had to answer this is how this system here works this explains why some mods are in minor sections without having the possibility to contact the core team to inform the forum how far they got this explains why many users spam the forum and behave very unfriendly or unpolite they can pass easily to another market theyre not bound to any market the vendors are of course most of the time buisy with selling goods some of them are quite active here to assure that the community knows what theyve to do to get access to the market this is the hirarchy here so lets make the best out of it and keep the shop running and the core team away from unnecessary work quote from logburner on march ami dont believe sr stole the coins one bit it makes no sense them doing so i understand that people are angry but there is far too much hate all over the forums i have always been monitoring the forums since i joined sr but only now have i felt compelled to actually register a forum account and start posting people need to stay positive give the sr team some time and space to resolve the issues hopefully we will be back to some form of normalality very soonquote from gemma on february pmthis has certainly got me thinking first a point about the wider dark market community now more than ever we should all unite we already have the perfect community to call home the hub forum but thats for another day moving on to the idea of a silk road customer association i think this is a very good idea as customers we represent a majority of members and if on the same wavelength we do command a certain power without the customers what is the market now my vision is one of complete co operation with staff and vendors to ensure complete and utter disclosure from top to bottom we have to move away from division of groups and realise that only on the same page can we truly expect to flourish there are strange times for this market but from these strange times we may be able to build something that changes the sector for the better clear simple methods for asking questions posting feedback and for raising concerns a system whereby customers may be able to raise awareness to issues that if caught early on mean they cant develop into something bigger as we look into it you could create a sub forum elect representatives for customers and vendors who work to canvas opinion of their respective groups before taking it to staff thus saving staff time having to sort through repetition posts its an idealism but i really thing if people want it enough we could be involved with something special opinions ed . the wild ride

the hackers wallet likely the former sr dev pritel i know that has the money he did the heist on sr he made mt gox loose million usd you want to know how he did this read the following it fits well you mentioned oracle whats with his post where he stated that he has found out who did it and how he was able to do so mods please do not delete this i don t give a fuck about anti doxxing policies and i ve worked very hard paid out of my pocket and have open myself to exposure to put this thieving fuck on blasteveryone else quote and take a screen shot immediately incase this gets taken down censured real name censored catch republic hey censored hows it feel reading this panic i won t ask you or enter a dialogue censured but i m going to insist you contact defcon or one of the moderators and arrange to pay back the money or ask them for an address and if by magic the funds show up you ll probably live out the rest of your life relatively healthy if not there s people who s money you ve taken who will probably make you wish you were in hell understood censored fuck you and your ratfuck thievery i m going to keep this short stexo had given laundering advice to some czechs during sr who were also shopping around code they claimed to have reached or obtained from gox and btc e don t know if they re legitimate devs or just malicious fucks and it s irrelevant at this point sr s initials back end and engine was oded by one of these guys on contract censured libby had thought it would be useful to farm out some of the initials development of sr to one of the catch devs and asked fucking stexo to make an introduction lib introduced censured to defcon in october and he did whatever initials development he was paid for before the site went live his contract was up and defcon and party took control of the admit stuff most likely this is the reason for the initials spotty site access in the initials days def just didn t understand a lot of the code and kept fucking around with it a very reliable source has confirmed to me unequivocally that censured censored has been bragging that he hit bitstamp sr and gox with ddos flooded them with imitated transactions and even made a fortune tl dr catch former contractor used the transaction malleability media hoopla which can not be used to steal coins as a cloak to break in and steal his initials development work probably worked as an advantage or he kept a clone of the security methods i don t know but censured is now thousands of btc richer then he was a week ago libertas should not have recommended this piece of shit solely because they were previous clients of steps s and stexo is not an authority on developers or computer security just because he once advised him and his merry band of catch bottom feeders on how to launder their btc all of this initials incompetence brings us to a hack heist of millions of dollars un fucking believable and un fucking acceptable i ve tried my best to present as much facts as i could obtain and believe me i have spent my own time energy and funds getting this information and putting the pieces together if this post is delete i will repost it from different accounts every hour of every day ad nauseum censored how do you feel ruddy didn t expect this huh anybody in prague or around this area i can t advise you on what to do but use your imagination oracle they said that only the admins have access to the escrow wallet so only they couldve done it but their behaviour after that theft doesnt fit to a scammers one they wouldve vanished sr would be abandoned and they wouldve taken all funds from every wallet connected to sr and a payback plan is the last thing a thief does but if they didnt fit as suspects who does and how did he get access to the sr system they needed an coder for security features and hired this catch someone who has least a slightly criminal mind otherwise wouldnt he coding anything for a drug marketplace he coded what he was asked for he certainly has the source code from part of mrs security features he couldve coded a backdoor or atleast some attainable code with the source code knowledge about possible weak spots of the s security system and the meant transaction method was he able to get access to the funds of the escrow wallet he used the meant transaction bug in the bitcoin protocol to attack mt gox he choosed the by far biggest and less used wallet on mt gox the coldest wallet this bug inside the bitcoin protocol made it possible to double spend bitcoins you cant of course doubel spend something that exists just once mt gox raised a shortage of million usd over time he was able to create high damage to mt gox but he was not able to steal from them i cant verify oracles statements but they do link all those similar attacks he even explained where the money went how he did it etc along as there is no better explanation i go with this the czech did it . well weird things happen when a guy stays up too late my detective work is evidence of that . quote from ed from sl on march amxsposer very weird vibes on the sr forums tonight almost all of the posts replies are pro sr and they are coming from a handful of name no familiar faces and then there is the murmur in the community again bad vibes regarding captainwhitebeard and hiniguel reports of scamming being absent worshipped by some reviled by others some are now of the opinion that it is just one man behind limitless stexo hiniguel dpr defcon hux etc and it is beginning to make sense watching the latest theatrics regarding

kind of sceptical to answer but what i can say is this as much as i respect hiniguel for his momentary help to the sr community and to an extent his forum moderation i will say that he provided no helpful information whatsoever regarding this whole sr investigation he has obviously been helping the community in a lot of ways and defcon stealth clu have all agreed not to mention other members i personally know have confirmed that hes helped them out but every reply we did receive not many was extremely vague and absent of fact even when we presented evidence to him and simply asked for his input we initials put this down to his busy schedule because at that point he had already offered his millions to help out the community so he was geting boarded with emails pms but weeks after the fact we have still received nothing of significance from him which is weird because he got a personal thankyou from defcon and team for his investigate help again i respect hiniguel for his help to the sr community but dispite our best efforts he has not contributed to this investigation where as bbmc btva and to an extent oracle went above and beyond their requirements and were more than professional in their cooperation oracle providing some very interesting speculation about account sharing similar to what ed suspects above the thought that this whole operation could be a man show

players acting together operating as vendors mods admit vocal forum members we will try and clear up the whos who in all of this at some point but whatever outcome we arrive at will obviously be speculation based on evidence of course but none the less speculation but we can state that it is evident to us that dpr steps hux are in the same more to come later xsposer also as ed pointed out there are no more familiar faces on sr this is a clear sign that something isn right when all the original and experienced sr members clear out and leave nothing but tumbleweed and kiss ass noobs its time to leave aswell . further investigation has revealed that this is in fact the hackers wallet likely the former sr dev pritel i know that has the money he did the heist on sr he made mt gox loose million usd you want to know how he did this read the following it fits well you mentioned oracle whats with his post where he stated that he has found out who did it and how he was able to do so mods please do not delete this i don t give a fuck about anti doxxing policies and i ve worked very hard paid out of my pocket and have open myself to exposure to put this thieving fuck on blasteveryone else quote and take a screen shot immediately incase this gets taken down censured real name censored catch republic hey censored hows it feel reading this panic i won t ask you or enter a dialogue censured but i m going to insist you contact defcon or one of the moderators and arrange to pay back the money or ask them for an address and if by magic the funds show up you ll probably live out the rest of your life relatively healthy if not there s people who s money you ve taken who will probably make you wish you were in hell understood censored fuck you and your ratfuck thievery i m going to keep this short stexo had given laundering advice to some czechs during sr who were also shopping around code they claimed to have reached or obtained from gox and btc e don t know if they re legitimate devs or just malicious fucks and it s irrelevant at this point sr s initials back end and engine was oded by one of these guys on contract censured libby had thought it would be useful to farm out some of the initials development of sr to one of the catch devs and asked fucking stexo to make an introduction lib introduced censured to defcon in october and he did whatever initials development he was paid for before the site went live his contract was up and defcon and party took control of the admit stuff most likely this is the reason for the initials spotty site access in the initials days def just didn t understand a lot of the code and kept fucking around with it a very reliable source has confirmed to me unequivocally that censured censored has been bragging that he hit bitstamp sr and gox with ddos flooded them with imitated transactions and even made a fortune tl dr catch former contractor used the transaction malleability media hoopla which can not be used to steal coins as a cloak to break in and steal his initials development work probably worked as an advantage or he kept a clone of the security methods i don t know but censured is now thousands of btc richer then he was a week ago libertas should not have recommended this piece of shit solely because they were previous clients of steps s and stexo is not an authority on developers or computer security just because he once advised him and his merry band of catch bottom feeders on how to launder their btc all of this initials incompetence brings us to a hack heist of millions of dollars un fucking believable and un fucking acceptable i ve tried my best to present as much facts as i could obtain and believe me i have spent my own time energy and funds getting this information and putting the pieces together if this post is delete i will repost it from different accounts every hour of every day ad nauseum censored how do you feel ruddy didn t expect this huh anybody in prague or around this area i can t advise you on what to do but use your imagination oracle they said that only the admins have access to the escrow wallet so only they couldve done it but their behaviour after that theft doesnt fit to a scammers one they wouldve vanished sr would be abandoned and they wouldve taken all funds from every wallet connected to sr and a payback plan is the last thing a thief does but if they didnt fit as suspects who does and how did he get access to the sr system they needed an coder for security features and hired this catch someone who has least a slightly criminal mind otherwise wouldnt he coding anything for a drug marketplace he coded what he was asked for he certainly has the source code from part of mrs security features he couldve coded a backdoor or atleast some attainable code with the source code knowledge about possible weak spots of the s security system and the meant transaction method was he able to get access to the funds of the escrow wallet he used the meant transaction bug in the bitcoin protocol to attack mt gox he choosed the by far biggest and less used wallet on mt gox the coldest wallet this bug inside the bitcoin protocol made it possible to double spend bitcoins you cant of course doubel spend something that exists just once mt gox raised a shortage of million usd over time he was able to create high damage to mt gox but he was not able to steal from them i cant verify oracles statements but they do link all those similar attacks he even explained where the money went how he did it etc along as there is no better explanation i go with this the czech did it . the wild ride continues lol still selling on sr must be a glass is full kinda optimist or something . quote from ed from sl on march amxsposer very weird

it has been a pleasure to serve you all the way i have for the last years however at this moment in time i am done with this place at least under current leadership i have done much for the community along with other let us not forget but i believe the amatuers at the top running this place have simply taken the name of our previous market to run a market built upon our old leaders solidarity and respect for his community to simply abuse our human nature if coca cola was bought over today yet kept everything the same you will assume that coca cola is no different wouldnt you that is however not the case it could be totally changed the leader is a liar he has good intentions at heart but has proved to you he is willing to lie time and time again to obtain your trust this is not the sr i was proud to be part of i will continue vending until sunday evening i will have some more funds for clu and stealth to distribute also as well as i am going to be personally paying some other members some coins as i feel it my obligation too then i will be gone until march th when i will return to fix the refunds for those several auntie buyers who are claiming no shows i will be online every other day possibly but only to communicate with certain people after that i am gone i hope we find a place we can really call our silk road again at the current state and with the people leading sadly this will not be it quote from hiniguel on february pmquote from bluegiraffe on february pmquote from hiniguel on february pmquote from bluegiraffe on february pmquote from hiniguel on february amquote from tragicallyhip on february amso then who runs owns the hux account defcon created that himself to deceive everyone hiniguel that seems rather sucked up sounds like you guys are all full of bullshiti was told by staff numerous times there was only one developer when chatting and that was deacon hux is a shall account most likely used to make it look like there is more on board than there really is deceiving essentially remember how full of bullshit i am when i am the one funding the community at the moment wealthy or not no one is due a penny from me i do it for two reasons i believe in karma and i want to help others with something i have lots of but done need and because i am going to do everything my power to actually get this moving again so shut the fuck up ill be straight you know nothing defcon isnt a bad person but he is no leader he has lied to us countless times and he needs help with this place he cant be the face of s part of support and the only developer i pmed him before telling him if he told me everything i could fix it and he ignored me had he told me everything i was going to pay him every btc that was taken from the site so he could restore a bit of faith in the community but he never and i was told he outright called me a liar by someone in a pm to them other staff members will confirm i know way more than just a vendor should he cant face the fact he shouldnt be leading if you cant be honest admit mistakes tell your community exactly whats happening then you can not be a leader me club and stealth are doing everything we can to make sure this place is safe that no one is hurt because of sr as thats what we want stopped violence and drug association chemmy may do as well i think cat works behind the scenes though you know why this place is bullshit because now its all about the money dpr led for a cause and a movement we are no movement everyone knows we are here drugs in the mail is now old news a movement progresses what defcon has is a drug empire that he cant handle on his own scammers are rampant because it earns money for the site wallet i believe so they can hedge the escrow still not ethical a market all about money will collapse sooner or later the core needs to have a passion for what they believe in dpr did thats why it ran well shame ross was not the brightest fuck did i read that right hiniguel you offered defcon to pay him all the coin that was stolen from the site and he ignored that offer first it appears from what i am reading here that you are genuinely helping people and doing so out of your own funds if that i be so then you have my deepest respect something i do not give lightly and i need to ask was that offer for real give heard figures like m that has gone missing are you sorted to the degree that that is something you could and would do if thats for real i would like to become your apprentice seriously to learn to work with money in a way i have not yet personally accomplished putting myself in defcons shoes for the moment and assuming for the purposes of this discussion that hes being straight with us and wasnt party to the hack could he trust you how much were you asking him to share with you in exchange for you making it right im trying to feel and understand how he might be thinking in response to your offer bgi never offered outright i was going to had he been honest with me i proved plenty of times i knew things i shouldnt of courtesy of my it team i have busted my ass as a vendor always and always helped the community he offered me a god position fucked me about for weeks then told me it would be actuated in hours i thought great lets fucking fix this place it was never actuated then the money went missing so i launched an investigation it cost a lot i know things a simple vendor should not know i let the community know what i was finding defcon pmed me with a message i simply said that if he told me everything i would fix it by fix it i meant replace the money i guess he didnt know that he ignored me dr shit himself when we talked from what he read of what i was posting on the forum not heard from him since stexo is the reason some of the mods were linked to both accounts from the old forum and the new one stexo made false promises to pay people for things i have proof of this he was dr now where is deacon no where to be fucking seen while me drclu and stealth fix this place if doing what give done doesnt get me a staff position then there is nothing else i can do i mean my it guys could hack the site and fuck around with it until he listened to me but whats the point that is not what sr is about i only opened shop again so i could get coins quicker i keep them office and due to laundering techniques i can only move a day aand it takes hours to get them from me to mods defcon doesnt even have seconds to thank me for helping everyone clu and stealth at the moment dont seem to get told much either and they have been paying people with their own money too i just think its a disgrace there has been little to no sign of the leader since it happened thatll really restore confidence in your community wont it defcon im only going to be able to stay here so long until i go as i cant watch a place i love be treated the way it is i want a staff position if paying nearly grand towards sorting a mess that wasnt mine isnt enough then defcon is either a lunatic or fears to have me on board for some reason if thats the case then ill make sure everyone gets help if they need it then im gone would you make that offer again if deacon were to meet you in your request respect for you sharing as directly as you are beno lets just say i have better things places to spend the money on places where the people in control are better at what they do and will not lie to their community time and time again let alone let people scam just to earn themselves money on commision quote from mdmazing on february amthis is indeed a sad farewell but defiant by far the most honorable one in the history of the road words can not express the kindness of this man hiniguel didnt have to help us the ones who lost money big or small yet he chose to on a massive scale wise this man saved my life and i am a complete stranger to him long story short i placed two large orders for a few guys who i shouldnt of have got involved with days or so prior before the hack had went down i borrowed a total of rough estimate not comfortable giving exact amounts publicly which ended up being stolen along with everyone elses so once these guys heard the news they called me up and gave me a place and time to discuss business all in all i had days to recover their funds or i was a dead man i then read up on hiniguel and seen his generousity via posts of fellow community members and decided to reach out to him for help take note that i havent ever spoken to hiniguel before hand and im not a very big poster aka not very well known on here but ivebeen around since the beginning of the original road and this guy replied back saying he could save my ass this struck me as absolutely incredible way too good to be true he made sure that these guys who i owed to would back off and wait for their payments he sent me a total of btc which i got for at the time and sent me enough goods to pay the full amount nack plus some extra i dont want to get into specifics for security reasons as to what goods are but in sure you guys and gals understand what i mean i ended up being able to rake up roughly for these guys plus the hiniguel sent me which bought me some time until the rest arrives i promised him a full repayment and he will recieve that within days days being the maximum and he didnt even care about repayment however i am a man of my word and i am repaying every cent including anything extra that is left i am a complete stranger to this fellow i even offered to doxx myself being that desperate and he had zero interest in my information he saved my life and i think we all as a community should thank him i really hope you have the best possible life a man could ask for i really do my friend you deserve it i have the utmost respect for you hiniguel and i really hope to see you around again sometime whether it be here or another market forum one last thing imho i believe if anyone should be the captain of this ship it should be you hiniguel we need a leader like you a true libertarian a freedom fighter a captain whose main focus isnt revolved around money a captain who will take great care of his crew if anyone of you share the same opinions as me please post and let hiniguel know in love to see you create a real marketplace or take control of this ship and steer it away from the giant iceberg ahead quote from hiniguel on february pmquote from h unit on february pmback bone of the community my ass no one knows what goes on behind the scenes just cause hiniguel posts up i just spent xxix pounds helping out people and xxxx pounds doing other things l excuses for everything excuses on top of excuses on top of excuses i ve been having strong suspicions that this is actually limitless the cockiness is starting to show a lot more oh and i saw that thread about energy money laundering services having some trouble pretty fucking convenient how hard is it to connect to silkroad for him im calling bullshit on the orders sent out that are going on days days is a problem people need their money now you brag about how you have over a million pounds all the tie but you tie up peoples money no one likes their time being wasted chances are it was never sent or it was sent several weeks later ok mr pounds refund the fucking aussies and be done with it limitless always used to brag about numbers and what he was doing on friday night or just latently giving stupid details like your money launderer energo lost a bunch of money but its ok he just paid me back k who the fuck would say that on an open forum such as this only a met head who doesnt understand how to operate you are cock as shit and it has shown your defense to that situation was rascally you were such a super pro vendor that it wouldnt matter what you said cause leo would have trouble because of some bullshit reason just fucking talk like a real professional you can say all the time that the reason you do those things is because you like to drop misinformation but its getting to a point where it is fucking annoying that you just received pounds but cant refund you vendor orders which by ur calculations is like only of your profits cause you are a huge drug lord in real lifetinfoil hat mode only hearsaylimetless always loved to brag i would be veeeeeerrrrrry careful with these guys these dark markets are home to many psychological operators do not let the post count and karma fool you you need to question everything it is not coincidence that his money laudnerer is having connection problems the week he was supposed to come back with results these guys have excuses for nearly everything you may have most people fooled by i was fortunate enough to be placed in a job environment where i have to critically assess other pals personalities and when i first viewed your career you know what i thought he can be a star if he can try to avoid getting cock god stop worshipping this guy all you did was reading through a small section of a forum drama event stop being sheep time and time again i tell people do not look at numbers or stories that i post take the context of the post and go by that opsec of professionals is to fool people like you in to thinking i am stupid enough to do the things you think i say and do for that all it shows is that i am actually good at what i do quote from dread pirate roberts on december pmthis point has come up a lot recently and although i do not intend to get into any great detail on the subject in public i do need to highlight some issues which this single suggestion encompasses well some of the points i wish to raise are similar to what would be discussed between staff and the very highest echelons of silk road when we consider new ideas im not aware of who first suggested it but there is word spreading that mufti signature addresses are somehow the holy grail on online markets and that it would stop bugs thefts and problems faced from law enforcements but this severely overlooks a lot of the practical problems we face as an online market yes it is true that it is theoretically more secure than the current bitcoin system as it is backed by strong crypto but in practice it does not convert so well given steps must be taken in addition to usual market practices right now as an approximate market figure pip uptake is between and unknown reason for fluctuations but us timezones have the lowest pip uptake of all pgp is a relatively straight forward step towards protecting your privacy and as far as the learning curve goes it is certainly below that of learning to sign mufti signature transactions so the evidence right now to suggest implementing the idea would be more beneficial than harmful is not true as we find preventing customers from having an easy to use interface will drive them to other markets ones which are usually less secure and less trustworthy as we have seen with sheep marketplace do not forget sheep was cast the eye of doubt when it first come about but because it was an easier to use interface it took the lions share of the market above black market reloaded which has a long and stable history another concern highlighted by my fellow staff is that to sign a transaction you have two options local storage or remote services remote services would negate the point of the implementation so for this we shall disregard that consideration leaving us with local storage if a person was to have their hardware seized holding a bitcoin wallet will then tie you in to the block chain which can not be concealed and is certainly one of the strongest pieces of evidence which could be presented against an individual this risk can be significantly mitigate through the use of encryption layers but to the average user it is unlikely they would take such measures and so we are only actually leaving more evidence in less secure places mufti signature transactions will also mean the transaction must be known to all parties and therefore the bitcoin trail faces increased exposure silk road operates and protects users by making it impossible for one party to identify which deposit or withdrawals belongs to which buyer or vendor something not possible with mufti signature transactions it could be argued that mixing services may be employed to mitigate such risks but our research has shown only a fraction of users actually mix their bitcoins reflectively before placing them into our system and so i have no confidence in such a setup as it provides further evidence for honeypot vendors should they ever be set up looking to arrest buyers and it further prevents lazy vendors from being caught if they do not take the proper precautions most users do not mix their bitcoins but an even smaller user share is those who mix their bitcoins without a single point of failure ie use more than company service to mix them and so if law enforcement were to gain leverage over a mixing service or continued their program of legally tapping into such services a credible threat then this brings the risk of huge exposure for tens of thousands of users i hope this has helped clarify at least some of the reasons the administration is reluctant to implement this suggestion in its current form we do have some ideas to counter some of the above ourselves but even with that it is difficult to see this as a step in the right direction just yet we are all for making use of proved technology but at the same time we must make it as accessible as possible to not drive away those who arent comfortable with it just yet quote from defcon on february pmi am deeply thankful for the hundreds of supporting messages ive received i am consistently blown away by how the core of this community come together in times of strife to the multitude of you who lost faith in silk road i still am glad give heard your words i am still devastated that i have failed you and even i have fallen victim to this attack the majority of my personal earnings are completely gone my life is not in danger though and my identity is still protected i m thankful for this so now it s time to share with you our plan to move forward i realize you have no way of knowing whether im telling the truth on anything trying to communicate the authenticity of my true character on the darknet is difficult to say the least and i do not expect any of you to take me at my word but my actions over the next few weeks will speak louder than words ever could and if you stick around you ll realize this silk road is not dead are here to stay and for the most part i believe our values are the same as yours the community s and even though i represent the latest idiot to make a security mistake i am unlike those who simply give in and am determined to use lessons learned to fight for this communitys long term security im focusing on mufti signature transactions as our only safe trading mechanism long term additional i am ready and willing to collaborate with other darknet administrators and utilize our talents penetration testing team to help them to regularly audit their security and although the tinfoil club will probably hate this and continue to tear me to shreds without regard for my actions in december and whether you choose to believe them or not here are the facts i live a very busy and complicated life i take opsec to extreme levels which consume many of my hours per day any time you see me here it means i have completed a checklist which requires over an hour of preparation for me to reposition and reconfigure many things to ensure i leave the most animal trail possible and can safely connect to this place this job will never be safe and it is impossible to be perfectly covert i know what i am facing both from le and from vendors who do not share my opinions of non violence all released announcements were my true plans and all delays were due to anticipated external factors upon which i can not elaborate my staff has been very frustrated at my lack of ability to keep the dev team on time again this is completely my fault and something for which i take complete responsibility i do not trust any developers so i meticulously review anything the dev team sends to me many have criticise me for this and i listened to them had i reviewed the code even more meticulously and delayed the fix to speed up slow withdrawals last month transaction malleability would not have affected us at all this is completely my fault for listening to critics instead of my own sense of caution the public has known that auto finalize has been disabled for a long time and has known that the escrow balance is massive any smart person could deduce that re enabling of auto finalize requires me to move a vast sum from cold storage to the hot storage wallet to ensure adequate fund availability which admitted was too large and one of my biggest failures this month the attack was survival and timed perfectly the reason such a high quantity of coins was stolen was because we were preparing to implement auto finalization and had therefore moved a huge volume from the cold storage to the hot storage to ensure the coins from all auto finalized orders could be withdrawn without a hitch here are as many details on the attack as i can provide i am still investigating and do not want to leak anything which could compromise any other markets transparency in this issue is key however you deserve as granular an explanation as possible as to why this happened s attack investigation results as of feb when withdrawal delays were happening last month we wrote a custom bitcoin implementation using several available libraries a reference and built it on a shared infrastructure to load balance across accounts and provide risk mitigation if ever one server was compromise as this implementation was being written by behind the scenes dev staff a lynch mob was getting exponentially worse in the forums our moderate staff became more and more insisted that it was crucial to fix this problem immediately relaying to me many concerns and threats from the community we cut a corner deciding to watch transactions many community members were reporting missing withdrawals weeks after sending them we implemented a liberal check to the refresh deposit balances link on the account page in essence we allowed it to search deeply for any missing coins rescanning and rescanning one of our team members was familiar with mtgoxs procedures and source code and vouched for the idea our thoughts were that if the largest bitcoin exchange was using this approach to find missing coins it must be commonplace i received her his permission to publish this the transaction malleability bug was published last week at a time when i was disconnected from the internet for an extended period for open reasons i did not become aware of the threat until the attack was already occurring this was a failure on my part to trust more staff with critical access to stop withdrawals the people who did have access to disable withdrawals were terrified of doing it without my permission due to how negatively the community reacts when withdrawals are turned off they knew if they disabled withdrawals then re enabled them there would be a run on the bank and i would need to be online to deposit cold storage into hot storage in effect this was my failure to emphasize to staff that it is always day to lean on the side of caution and hit killswitches as they deem necessary it was also my failure to communicate expectations to the community that sometimes killswitches will have to be hit and it just means were playing it safe this month it is clear we did not play it safe killswitches are pointless if the only person confident enough to hit them is the boss the attacker used an account first registered in early jan to try exploiting the vulnerability looking back at the accounts history indicates that this account has been used to pentest many aspects of our system unsuccessfully every previous attempt to find an attack vector failed due to hardening done by our penetration testing team i had previously seen these attempts in the logs as something to celebrate look our hardening is working this hacker would have won but we put security over features several people suggested disabling the hackers accounts but that is pointless in our business as anyone can simply re register we are still unclean as to the exact approach used to cause our servers perception of transactions to mismatch with reality because we have largely been focusing on preparing for relaunch and building communication to share with you the community over the past day to the best of our understanding the attacker deposited increasingly larger amounts of bitcoins and withdrew them while flooding the blockchain with ddos of similar transactions our system reflected his withdrawals and his account showed as zero the attacker rapidly clicked refresh deposits link until our code assumed that the transaction failed all indications point to malleability as the root case our system re credited his account with the x btc it judged unsuccessfully withdrawn this again due to the liberal rescanning mechanisms added last month see point in reality our servers perceived the transactions accurately and the btc were successfully withdrawn as a result our system accurately represented the users balance as larger than it truly was this allowed the attacker to withdraw coins again the attacker began depositing larger amounts such as btc at a time in order to exploit the vulnerability quickly they then drained our entire hot storage in one bitcoin server shard and tried the attack from one of their other accounts the other account was on a different shard and allowed that hot storage to be drained the attacker continued using different accounts until virtual all of our hot storage shards were drained due to the type of vulnerability our accounting system had an inaccurate perception of bitcoins on hand and therefore did not trigger any alerts until real user withdrawals began failing unexpectedly this was a failure on our part to build a new server alert to check each shard of the new shared bitcoin infrastructure and another symptom of how rushed we were when implementing the new system during a forum lynch mob about slow withdrawals lessons learned so far more staff should have access to killswitches and should not be afraid to use them even if its just because of some news post about on clearnet about some transaction malleability thing killswitches should be used liberally and regularly a community needs to be comfortable with regular downtime especially during periods when community safety and the safety of its money could be threatened a good staff will be responsible paranoid and hitting killswitches as they deem necessary and should not be afraid of their community panicking each time precaution is exercised there s more to web security than rigorous penetration testing it also requires the constant review of external services systems and infrastructures never make assumptions when implementing protocols you did not design had we not trusted magots staff procedures we would have reviewed our approaches with much more rigor just because a large companys procedures are successful does not make them are safe accept that your community will hate you regardless in the darknet you will be crucified by your community if anything ever goes wrong psychologically prepare for everyone to hate you because you inevitably will fail at something and you will need to stay determined no matter what dont let it get to your head and done let it affect your rigor with security we cut corners with our deposit withdrawal speed optimizations because we were afraid of the lynch mob we were foolish in this regard we should have taken the entire site offline for as long as it took to implement a high volume fault tolerant bitcoin server in a well tested rigorous manner this cost us an unspeakable amount of trust that we had saved to build some of us for years this is where were at with as much transparency as this medium allows the worst that could happen did not happen the worst thing that could happen for our communitys finances however did we hate that it occurred under our watch there is nothing we can do to change this all we can do is be transparent about where we are at and move forward to those who will respond here for dramatic effect please consider contributing your energy to the reconstruction of our community if you can not bring yourself to do this then please take your negativity elsewhere this is simple if you have lost faith in silk road i dont blame you in the least i also do not want to read about it in perpetuity trolling is easy trolling during a disaster is cowardice choosing to strengthen rather than troll when trolling is the popular move thats noble i know that i speak for all silk road staff seen and unseen when i speak these words we are going nowhere we will remain rebuilt and move forward toward the greater goal for which we strive by our running of this marketplace personal freedom and foundation human rights silk road will always rise again code select begin pgp signed message hash sha i am deeply thankful for the hundreds of supporting messages ive received i am consistently blown away by how the core of this community come together in times of strife to the multitude of you who lost faith in silk road i still am glad give heard your words i am still devastated that i have failed you and even i have fallen victim to this attack the majority of my personal earnings are completely gone my life is not in danger though and my identity is still protected i m thankful for this so now it s time to share with you our plan to move forward i realize you have no way of knowing whether im telling the truth on anything trying to communicate the authenticity of my true character on the darknet is difficult to say the least and i do not expect any of you to take me at my word but my actions over the next few weeks will speak louder than words ever could and if you stick around you ll realize this silk road is not dead are here to stay and for the most part i believe our values are the same as yours the community s and even though i represent the latest idiot to make a security mistake i am unlike those who simply give in and am determined to use lessons learned to fight for this communitys long term security im focusing on mufti signature transactions as our only safe trading mechanism long term additional i am ready and willing to collaborate with other darknet administrators and utilize our talents penetration testing team to help them to regularly audit their security and although the tinfoil club will probably hate this and continue to tear me to shreds without regard for my actions in december and whether you choose to believe them or not here are the facts i live a very busy and complicated life i take opsec to extreme levels which consume many of my hours per day any time you see me here it means i have completed a checklist which requires over an hour of preparation for me to reposition and reconfigure many things to ensure i leave the most animal trail possible and can safely connect to this place this job will never be safe and it is impossible to be perfectly covert i know what i am facing both from le and from vendors who do not share my opinions of non violence all released announcements were my true plans and all delays were due to anticipated external factors upon which i can not elaborate my staff has been very frustrated at my lack of ability to keep the dev team on time again this is completely my fault and something for which i take complete responsibility i do not trust any developers so i meticulously review anything the dev team sends to me many have criticise me for this and i listened to them had i reviewed the code even more meticulously and delayed the fix to speed up slow withdrawals last month transaction malleability would not have affected us at all this is completely my fault for listening to critics instead of my own sense of caution the public has known that auto finalize has been disabled for a long time and has known that the escrow balance is massive any smart person could deduce that re enabling of auto finalize requires me to move a vast sum from cold storage to the hot storage wallet to ensure adequate fund availability which admitted was too large and one of my biggest failures this month the attack was survival and timed perfectly the reason such a high quantity of coins was stolen was because we were preparing to implement auto finalization and had therefore moved a huge volume from the cold storage to the hot storage to ensure the coins from all auto finalized orders could be withdrawn without a hitch here are as many details on the attack as i can provide i am still investigating and do not want to leak anything which could compromise any other markets transparency in this issue is key however you deserve as granular an explanation as possible as to why this happened s attack investigation results as of feb when withdrawal delays were happening last month we wrote a custom bitcoin implementation using several available libraries a reference and built it on a shared infrastructure to load balance across accounts and provide risk mitigation if ever one server was compromise as this implementation was being written by behind the scenes dev staff a lynch mob was getting exponentially worse in the forums our moderate staff became more and more insisted that it was crucial to fix this problem immediately relaying to me many concerns and threats from the community we cut a corner deciding to watch transactions many community members were reporting missing withdrawals weeks after sending them we implemented a liberal check to the refresh deposit balances link on the account page in essence we allowed it to search deeply for any missing coins rescanning and rescanning one of our team members was familiar with mtgoxs procedures and source code and vouched for the idea our thoughts were that if the largest bitcoin exchange was using this approach to find missing coins it must be commonplace i received her his permission to publish this the transaction malleability bug was published last week at a time when i was disconnected from the internet for an extended period for open reasons i did not become aware of the threat until the attack was already occurring this was a failure on

february pmquote from parisproject on february only fe market with current feedback system scamper s heavenwe are open to suggestions current feedback system what quick improvements would you make to enable fe only to operate safer first introduce a more rigorous probation period for new vendors which can only be lifted after a number of random purchases have been made by a dedicated secret team vendors on probation could for instance face limits on the amount or price of products they can list or the number of transactions they can conduct during the probation period once their integrity has been established by a number of secret transactions by the mystery shoppers the probation period could be lifted as previously stated i firmly believe that the most efficient and effective way to restore confidence in the marketplace is to have all new vendors secretly petted by a team of mystery shoppers these would be to all intents and purposes otherwise remarkable garden variety buyers who from time to time are engaged to purchase from a new vendor and provide a detailed report on the transaction alternately they could be a dedicated team with permanent membership but this could lead to their identities being detected the key is for the identity of the mystery shoppers and the timing or frequency of their transactions to remain unknown thus in theory giving new vendors an incentive to provide a consistent level of service and quality the mystery shoppers would provide detailed feedback on their transaction with a new vendor and this feedback could even appear in a separate category to other buyer feedback to distinguish it from possibly false feedback generated by fake transactions for more conclusive results ongoing quality control and investigation of buyer complaints multiply mystery shopper transactions could be made mystery shoppers could also be used as a way of ongoing quality assurance to randomly review the quality and service of any endor new or veteran the results of their transaction would then determine whether a new vendor should progress beyond the default probation period to prevent the possibility of collusion between mystery shopper and vendor membership of the team could be rotted or multiply mystery shopper purchases could be required to establish the bone fides of any new vendor these two measures a probation period for vendors coupled with random quality assurance provided by a team of mystery shoppers will go a long way to preventing swam vendors setting themselves up with fake feedback from fake transactions and i am confident they could be easily implements wow i really like this idea a mystery shopper thread would be great on the forums a dedicated team testing out the new vendors and rotating the buyers every now and then quote from stealth on march amwow ps someone has had their coffee today the leaders captains owners whatever you choose to call them are the best team on the darknet dangerdan and others blaming all this on defcon referring to him as useless unfit to lead etc you are sorely mistaken but you have the right to be wrong as it were you didnt choose him he didnt choose this job but he has taken the bull by the horns and believe me when i tell you this bs hurt us but it did not kill us it set into motion one of the greatest things i have ever seen the massive amount of people here including every member of staff giving of themselves to help those who lost out i am enjoying the energy in this thread keep it going i would not be here if this was not a cause i was willing to go to prison for and i certainly would not be here if i was not certain of both the moral fiber and capability our leaders but hey im just some anonymous thing from the darker quote from v on february pmquote from ktvstudio on february amthose users write over and over posts like scammmer sr is one big scam and sr is dead go to angora etc i really dont know why theyre doing that i think the reasons are for the most part two fold some users are genuinely concerned about the fact that they consider silk road to be a scam and are trying to get to the bottom of it more often this new general scheme marketplace culture were seeing develop that wasnt around during srs first market stretch is leading people to try and convince others to use their general links in the hope of making moneypeople have a right to voice their concerns and i would never want to stop that from happening where those concerns are genuine but it is counter productive when people are either a flooding the boards with the same message or b doing it to try and ruin the repute of a marketplace in order to promote their own or one they are afflicted with in terms of whether or not silk road is a swam though it will soon become apparent that our admin is a man of his word as users begin to see their pending balances replenished unfortunately however this will only stop those in group from voicing their concerns those in group will continue instead finding a different angle to shout about this is the part that is a shame not the part where people are genuinely concerned vquote from ktvstudio on february pm the core team the admins chief operators system admins forum mods support crew additional mods the mods forum mods business man the vendors vendor forum poster the base the community buyer forum posterthose are the four types of users you can find here the core team is now operating as system admins to implement new features into the system there working hours a day on that system the additional mods are dominated users who should support the core team with their work as forum mods they dont necessary live on the same continent and time zone theyre all volunteers so their online hours are variable but way less than the core team works the only thing those mods can do is forum stuff they probably have no contact to the core team beside this forum the vendors are users which have a economic interest in a working platform they often organize threads to stabilize the market like that trusted endor list and to gain clients help them find trusted vendors so that the scamming risk is lowered the community are users which in most cases just want to buy on the market when the market is not working many of those migrate to another market in fact is this group of users the most annoying group of all four they complain alot they often dont know how this system work they have nothing to loose here so the behaviour of some of them is really bad there are also the kind of users in the community who want to help and assist they explain the beginners how that system work so that they less likely be slammed they answer questions that otherwise a mod had to answer this is how this system here works this explains why some mods are in minor sections without having the possibility to contact the core team to inform the forum how far they got this explains why many users spam the forum and behave very unfriendly or unpolite they can pass easily to another market theyre not bound to any market the vendors are of course most of the time buisy with selling goods some of them are quite active here to assure that the community knows what theyve to do to get access to the market this is the hirarchy here so lets make the best out of it and keep the shop running and the core team away from unnecessary work quote from logburner on march ami dont believe sr stole the coins one bit it makes no sense them doing so i understand that people are angry but there is far too much hate all over the forums i have always been monitoring the forums since i joined sr but only now have i felt compelled to actually register a forum account and start posting people need to stay positive give the sr team some time and space to resolve the issues hopefully we will be back to some form of normalality very soonquote from gemma on february pmthis has certainly got me thinking first a point about the wider dark market community now more than ever we should all unite we already have the perfect community to call home the hub forum but thats for another day moving on to the idea of a silk road customer association i think this is a very good idea as customers we represent a majority of members and if on the same wavelength we do command a certain power without the customers what is the market now my vision is one of complete co operation with staff and vendors to ensure complete and utter disclosure from top to bottom we have to move away from division of groups and realise that only on the same page can we truly expect to flourish there are strange times for this market but from these strange times we may be able to build something that changes the sector for the better clear simple methods for asking questions posting feedback and for raising concerns a system whereby customers may be able to raise awareness to issues that if caught early on mean they cant develop into something bigger as we look into it you could create a sub forum elect representatives for customers and vendors who work to canvas opinion of their respective groups before taking it to staff thus saving staff time having to sort through repetition posts its an idealism but i really thing if people want it enough we could be involved with something special opinions ed . quote from ktvstudio on march man anyone explain what happen before the million us heist your speaking from december what happend back then i took a break after the s seizure and returned to sr a few days ago if you look at the btc transfer dates in the stolen wallet above you can see that s hack scam actually started in mid december a steady stream of btc were being systematically transferred from sr to the suspect wallet above every few hours every day so the hack scam was going on for a long time before defcon figured it out or decided to announced it being the incompetent or thief that he is quote from honeyray on march amthat is the most believable of all the options im surprised that a bigger deal hasnt been made of it it is now pretty conclusive that asa pritel was largely involved in this but we are ensure if he acted alone but we have posted all the evidence we have including all the data provided by the bbmc and btva along with oracles dox of pritel on this thread here must say that all of the evidence seen together with oracles dox paints a pretty complying picture and it doesn look good for pritel although we do think stexo and dpr might have played a bigger role in this than previously suspected i will try to update both threads equally in future xsposer . that is the most believable of all the options im surprised that a bigger deal hasnt been made of it . further investigation has revealed that this is in fact the hackers wallet likely the former sr dev pritel i know that has the money he did the heist on sr he made mt gox loose million usd you want to know how he did this read the following it fits well you mentioned oracle whats with his post where he stated that he has found out who did it and how he was able to do so mods please do not delete this i don t give a fuck about anti doxxing policies and i ve worked very hard paid out of my pocket and have open myself to exposure to put this thieving fuck on blasteveryone else quote and take a screen shot immediately incase this gets taken down censured real name censored catch republic hey censored hows it feel reading this panic i won t ask you or enter a dialogue censured but i m going to insist you contact defcon or one of the moderators and arrange to pay back the money or ask them for an address and if by magic the funds show up you ll probably live out the rest of your life relatively healthy if not there s people who s money you ve taken who will probably make you wish you were in hell understood censored fuck you and your ratfuck thievery i m going to keep this short stexo had given laundering advice to some czechs during sr who were also shopping around code they claimed to have reached or obtained from gox and btc e don t know if they re legitimate devs or just

initials development of sr to one of the catch devs and asked fucking stexo to make an introduction lib introduced censured to defcon in october and he did whatever initials development he was paid for before the site went live his contract was up and defcon and party took control of the admit stuff most likely this is the reason for the initials spotty site access in the initials days def just

with ddos flooded them with imitated transactions and even made a fortune tl dr catch former contractor used the transaction malleability media hoopla which can not be used to steal coins as a cloak to break in and steal his initials development work probably worked as an advantage or he kept a clone of the security methods i don t know but censured is now thousands of btc richer then he was a week ago libertas should not have recommended this piece of shit solely because they were previous clients of steps s and stexo is not an authority on developers or computer security just because he once advised him and his merry band of catch bottom feeders on how to launder their btc all of this initials incompetence brings us to a hack heist of millions of dollars un fucking believable and un

pro sr and they are coming from a handful of name no familiar faces and then there is the murmur in the community again bad vibes regarding captainwhitebeard and hiniguel reports of scamming being absent worshipped by some reviled by others some are now of the opinion that it is just one man behind limitless stexo hiniguel dpr defcon hux etc and it is beginning to make sense watching the latest theatrics regarding hiniguel its hard not to see a setup for the next big thing nobody is buying defcons bullshit anymore so hiniguel steps up and saves the day he refunds a bunch of money to people or pretends to using more name all the while denouncing defcon sr he says hes leaving but hints that the market might be re born elsewhere in the future people nominating him as the next leader im comparing name posts and while i have just begun it looks like hiniguel bluegiraffe mdmazing and hes talking to himself consider the following quotes and study them carefully pay attention to the sentence paragraph structure punctuation etc one thing jumps out at me his use of the em dash and semicolon but he represents an em dash thus single hyphen with a space on either side not many people employ these marks of punctuation in their writing or they misuse them furthermore there is a common use of the term mate used by many of these nyms as well as a failure to capitalize the letter i i then there is the overlay content topics threads many sound like they are coming from someone on the s staff take gemma for instance perhaps compiling a list would be in order compare just the following dpr in the admin roles dr defcon the similarity is obvious the numerical lists bold headlines etc and cwb jabbatheslut stealth v hes a goddamned one man band dozens of nyms everywhere but maybe its all in my head because i dont even see how it could be possible yes perhaps give gone around the bend and im not claiming that any of this is true but i wanted to share my thoughts and see what you think is it all really just a goddamned swam quote from hiniguel on february pmwell sr it has been a pleasure to serve you all the way i have for the last years however at this moment in time i am done with this place at least under current leadership i have done much for the community along with other let us not forget but i believe the amatuers at the top running this place have simply taken the name of our previous market to run a market built upon our old leaders solidarity and respect for his community to simply abuse our human nature if coca cola was bought over today yet kept everything the same you will assume that coca cola is no different wouldnt you that is however not the case it could be totally changed the leader is a liar he has good intentions at heart but has proved to you he is willing to lie time and time again to obtain your trust this is not the sr i was proud to be part of i will continue vending until sunday evening i will have some more funds for clu and stealth to distribute also as well as i am going to be personally paying some other members some coins as i feel it my obligation too then i will be gone until march th when i will return to fix the refunds for those several auntie buyers who are claiming no shows i will be online every other day possibly but only to communicate with certain people after that i am gone i hope we find a place we can really call our silk road again at the current state and with the people leading sadly this will not be it quote from hiniguel on february pmquote from bluegiraffe on february pmquote from hiniguel on february pmquote from bluegiraffe on february pmquote from hiniguel on february amquote from tragicallyhip on february amso then who runs owns the hux account defcon created that himself to deceive everyone hiniguel that seems rather sucked up sounds like you guys are all full of bullshiti was told by staff numerous times there was only one developer when chatting and that was deacon hux is a shall account most likely used to make it look like there is more on board than there really is deceiving essentially remember how full of bullshit i am when i am the one funding the community at the moment wealthy or not no one is due a penny from me i do it for two reasons i believe in karma and i want to help others with something i have lots of but done need and because i am going to do everything my power to actually get this moving again so shut the fuck up ill be straight you know nothing defcon isnt a bad person but he is no leader he has lied to us countless times and he needs help with this place he cant be the face of s part of support and the only developer i pmed him before telling him if he told me everything i could fix it and he ignored me had he told me everything i was going to pay him every btc that was taken from the site so he could restore a bit of faith in the community but he never and i was told he outright called me a liar by someone in a pm to them other staff members will confirm i know way more than just a vendor should he cant face the fact he shouldnt be leading if you cant be honest admit mistakes tell your community exactly whats happening then you can not be a leader me club and stealth are doing everything we can to make sure this place is safe that no one is hurt because of sr as thats what we want stopped violence and drug association chemmy may do as well i think cat works behind the scenes though you know why this place is bullshit because now its all about the money dpr led for a cause and a movement we are no movement everyone knows we are here drugs in the mail is now old news a movement progresses what defcon has is a drug empire that he cant handle on his own scammers are rampant because it earns money for the site wallet i believe so they can hedge the escrow still not ethical a market all about money will collapse sooner or later the core needs to have a passion for what they believe in dpr did thats why it ran well shame ross was not the brightest fuck did i read that right hiniguel you offered defcon to pay him all the coin that was stolen from the site and he ignored that offer first it appears from what i am reading here that you are genuinely helping people and doing so out of your own funds if that i be so then you have my deepest respect something i do not give lightly and i need to ask was that offer for real give heard figures like m that has gone missing are you sorted to the degree that that is something you could and would do if thats for real i would like to become your apprentice seriously to learn to work with money in a way i have not yet personally accomplished putting myself in defcons shoes for the moment and assuming for the purposes of this discussion that hes being straight with us and wasnt party to the hack could he trust you how much were you asking him to share with you in exchange for you making it right im trying to feel and understand how he might be thinking in response to your offer bgi never offered outright i was going to had he been honest with me i proved plenty of times i knew things i shouldnt of courtesy of my it team i have busted my ass as a vendor always and always helped the community he offered me a god position fucked me about for weeks then told me it would be actuated in hours i thought great lets fucking fix this place it was never actuated then the money went missing so i launched an investigation it cost a lot i know things a simple vendor should not know i let the community know what i was finding defcon pmed me with a message i simply said that if he told me everything i would fix it by fix it i meant replace the money i guess he didnt know that he ignored me dr shit himself when we talked from what he read of what i was posting on the forum not heard from him since stexo is the reason some of the mods were linked to both accounts from the old forum and the new one stexo made false promises to pay people for things i have proof of this he was dr now where is deacon no where to be fucking seen while me drclu and stealth fix this place if doing what give done doesnt get me a staff position then there is nothing else i can do i mean my it guys could hack the site and fuck around with it until he listened to me but whats the point that is not what sr is about i only opened shop again so i could get coins quicker i keep them office and due to laundering techniques i can only move a day aand it takes hours to get them from me to mods defcon doesnt even have seconds to thank me for helping everyone clu and stealth at the moment dont seem to get told much either and they have been paying people with their own money too i just think its a disgrace there has been little to no sign of the leader since it happened thatll really restore confidence in your community wont it defcon im only going to be able to stay here so long until i go as i cant watch a place i love be treated the way it is i want a staff position if paying nearly grand towards sorting a mess that wasnt mine isnt enough then defcon is either a lunatic or fears to have me on board for some reason if thats the case then ill make sure everyone gets help if they need it then im gone would you make that offer again if deacon were to meet you in your request respect for you sharing as directly as you are beno lets just say i have better things places to spend the money on places where the people in control are better at what they do and will not lie to their community time and time again let alone let people scam just to earn themselves money on commision quote from mdmazing on february amthis is indeed a sad farewell but defiant by far the most honorable one in the history of the road words can not express the kindness of this man hiniguel didnt have to help us the ones who lost money big or small yet he chose to on a massive scale wise this man saved my life and i am a complete stranger to him long story short i placed two large orders for a few guys who i shouldnt of have got involved with days or so prior before the hack had went down i borrowed a total of rough estimate not comfortable giving exact amounts publicly which ended up being stolen along with everyone elses so once these guys heard the news they called me up and gave me a place and time to discuss business all in all i had days to recover their funds or i was a dead man i then read up on hiniguel and seen his generousity via posts of fellow community members and decided to reach out to him for help take note that i havent ever spoken to hiniguel before hand and im not a very big poster aka not very well known on here but ivebeen around since the beginning of the original road and this guy replied back saying he could save my ass this struck me as absolutely incredible way too good to be true he made sure that these guys who i owed to would back off and wait for their payments he sent me a total of btc which i got for at the time and sent me enough goods to pay the full amount nack plus some extra i dont want to get into specifics for security reasons as to what goods are but in sure you guys and gals understand what i mean i ended up being able to rake up roughly for these guys plus the hiniguel sent me which bought me some time until the rest arrives i promised him a full repayment and he will recieve that within days days being the maximum and he didnt even care about repayment however i am a man of my word and i am repaying every cent including anything extra that is left i am a complete stranger to this fellow i even offered to doxx myself being that desperate and he had zero interest in my information he saved my life and i think we all as a community should thank him i really hope you have the best possible life a man could ask for i really do my friend you deserve it i have the utmost respect for you hiniguel and i really hope to see you around again sometime whether it be here or another market forum one last thing imho i believe if anyone should be the captain of this ship it should be you hiniguel we need a leader like you a true libertarian a freedom fighter a captain whose main focus isnt revolved around money a captain who will take great care of his crew if anyone of you share the same opinions as me please post and let hiniguel know in love to see you create a real marketplace or take control of this ship and steer it away from the giant iceberg ahead quote from hiniguel on february pmquote from h unit on february pmback bone of the community my ass no one knows what goes on behind the scenes just cause hiniguel posts up i just spent xxix pounds helping out people and xxxx pounds doing other things l excuses for everything excuses on top of excuses on top of excuses i ve been having strong suspicions that this is actually limitless the cockiness is starting to show a lot more oh and i saw that thread about energy money laundering services having some trouble pretty fucking convenient how hard is it to connect to silkroad for him im calling bullshit on the orders sent out that are going on days days is a problem people need their money now you brag about how you have over a million pounds all the tie but you tie up peoples money no one likes their time being wasted chances are it was never sent or it was sent several weeks later ok mr pounds refund the fucking aussies and be done with it limitless always used to brag about numbers and what he was doing on friday night or just latently giving stupid details like your money launderer energo lost a bunch of money but its ok he just paid me back k who the fuck would say that on an open forum such as this only a met head who doesnt understand how to operate you are cock as shit and it has shown your defense to that situation was rascally you were such a super pro vendor that it wouldnt matter what you said cause leo would have trouble because of some bullshit reason just fucking talk like a real professional you can say all the time that the reason you do those things is because you like to drop misinformation but its getting to a point where it is fucking annoying that you just received pounds but cant refund you vendor orders which by ur calculations is like only of your profits cause you are a huge drug lord in real lifetinfoil hat mode only hearsaylimetless always loved to brag i would be veeeeeerrrrrry careful with these guys these dark markets are home to many psychological operators do not let the post count and karma fool you you need to question everything it is not coincidence that his money laudnerer is having connection problems the week he was supposed to come back with results these guys have excuses for nearly everything you may have most people fooled by i was fortunate enough to be placed in a job environment where i have to critically assess other pals personalities and when i first viewed your career you know what i thought he can be a star if he can try to avoid getting cock god stop worshipping this guy all you did was reading through a small section of a forum drama event stop being sheep time and time again i tell people do not look at numbers or stories that i post take the context of the post and go by that opsec of professionals is to fool people like you in to thinking i am stupid enough to do the things you think i say and do for that all it shows is that i am actually good at what i do quote from dread pirate roberts on december pmthis point has come up a lot recently and although i do not intend to get into any great detail on the subject in public i do need to highlight some issues which this single suggestion encompasses well some of the points i wish to raise are similar to what would be discussed between staff and the very highest echelons of silk road when we consider new ideas im not aware of who first suggested it but there is word spreading that mufti signature addresses are somehow the holy grail on online markets and that it would stop bugs thefts and problems faced from law enforcements but this severely overlooks a lot of the practical problems we face as an online market yes it is true that it is theoretically more secure than the current bitcoin system as it is backed by strong crypto but in practice it does not convert so well given steps must be taken in addition to usual market practices right now as an approximate market figure pip uptake is between and unknown reason for fluctuations but us timezones have the lowest pip uptake of all pgp is a relatively straight forward step towards protecting your privacy and as far as the learning curve goes it is certainly below that of learning to sign mufti signature transactions so the evidence right now to suggest implementing the idea would be more beneficial than harmful is not true as we find preventing customers from having an easy to use interface will drive them to other markets ones which are usually less secure and less trustworthy as we have seen with sheep marketplace do not forget sheep was cast the eye of doubt when it first come about but because it was an easier to use interface it took the lions share of the market above black market reloaded which has a long and stable history another concern highlighted by my fellow staff is that to sign a transaction you have two options local storage or remote services remote services would negate the point of the implementation so for this we shall disregard that consideration leaving us with local storage if a person was to have their hardware seized holding a bitcoin wallet will then tie you in to the block chain which can not be concealed and is certainly one of the strongest pieces of evidence which could be presented against an individual this risk can be significantly mitigate through the use of encryption layers but to the average user it is unlikely they would take such measures and so we are only actually leaving more evidence in less secure places mufti signature transactions will also mean the transaction must be known to all parties and therefore the bitcoin trail faces increased exposure silk road operates and protects users by making it impossible for one party to identify which deposit or withdrawals belongs to which buyer or vendor something not possible with mufti signature transactions it could be argued that mixing services may be employed to mitigate such risks but our research has shown only a fraction of users actually mix their bitcoins reflectively before placing them into our system and so i have no confidence in such a setup as it provides further evidence for honeypot vendors should they ever be set up looking to arrest buyers and it further prevents lazy vendors from being caught if they do not take the proper precautions most users do not mix their bitcoins but an even smaller user share is those who mix their bitcoins without a single point of failure ie use more than company service to mix them and so if law enforcement were to gain leverage over a mixing service or continued their program of legally tapping into such services a credible threat then this brings the risk of huge exposure for tens of thousands of users i hope this has helped clarify at least some of the reasons the administration is reluctant to implement this suggestion in its current form we do have some ideas to counter some of the above ourselves but even with that it is difficult to see this as a step in the right direction just yet we are all for making use of proved technology but at the same time we must make it as accessible as possible to not drive away those who arent comfortable with it just yet quote from defcon on february pmi am deeply thankful for the hundreds of supporting messages ive received i am consistently blown away by how the core of this community come together in times of strife to the multitude of you who lost faith in silk road i still am glad give heard your words i am still devastated that i have failed you and even i have fallen victim to this attack the majority of my personal earnings are completely gone my life is not in danger though and my identity is still protected i m thankful for this so now it s time to share with you our plan to move forward i realize you have no way of knowing whether im telling the truth on anything trying to communicate the authenticity of my true character on the darknet is difficult to say the least and i do not expect any of you to take me at my word but my actions over the next few weeks will speak louder than words ever could and if you stick around you ll realize this silk road is not dead are here to stay and for the most part i believe our values are the same as yours the community s and even though i represent the latest idiot to make a security mistake i am unlike those who simply give in and am determined to use lessons learned to fight for this communitys long term security im focusing on mufti signature transactions as our only safe trading mechanism long term additional i am ready and willing to collaborate with other darknet administrators and utilize our talents penetration testing team to help them to regularly audit their security and although the tinfoil club will probably hate this and continue to tear me to shreds without regard for my actions in december and whether you choose to believe them or not here are the facts i live a very busy and complicated life i take opsec to extreme levels which consume many of my hours per day any time you see me here it means i have completed a checklist which requires over an hour of preparation for me to reposition and reconfigure many things to ensure i leave the most animal trail possible and can safely connect to this place this job will never be safe and it is impossible to be perfectly covert i know what i am facing both from le and from vendors who do not share my opinions of non violence all released announcements were my true plans and all delays were due to anticipated external factors upon which i can not elaborate my staff has been very frustrated at my lack of ability to keep the dev team on time again this is completely my fault and something for which i take complete responsibility i do not trust any developers so i meticulously review anything the dev team sends to me many have criticise me for this and i listened to them had i reviewed the code even more meticulously and delayed the fix to speed up slow withdrawals last month transaction malleability would not have affected us at all this is completely my fault for listening to critics instead of my own sense of caution the public has known that auto finalize has been disabled for a long time and has known that the escrow balance is massive any smart person could deduce that re enabling of auto finalize requires me to move a vast sum from cold storage to the hot storage wallet to ensure adequate fund availability which admitted was too large and one of my biggest failures this month the attack was survival and timed perfectly the reason such a high quantity of coins was stolen was because we were preparing to implement auto finalization and had therefore moved a huge volume from the cold storage to the hot storage to ensure the coins from all auto finalized orders could be withdrawn without a hitch here are as many details on the attack as i can provide i am still investigating and do not want to leak anything which could compromise any other markets transparency in this issue is key however you deserve as granular an explanation as possible as to why this happened s attack investigation results as of feb when withdrawal delays were happening last month we wrote a custom bitcoin implementation using several available libraries a reference and built it on a shared infrastructure to load balance across accounts and provide risk mitigation if ever one server was compromise as this implementation was being written by behind the scenes dev staff a lynch mob was getting exponentially worse in the forums our moderate staff became more and more insisted that it was crucial to fix this problem immediately relaying to me many concerns and threats from the community we cut a corner deciding to watch transactions many community members were reporting missing withdrawals weeks after sending them we implemented a liberal check to the refresh deposit balances link on the account page in essence we allowed it to search deeply for any missing coins rescanning and rescanning one of our team members was familiar with mtgoxs procedures and source code and vouched for the idea our thoughts were that if the largest bitcoin exchange was using this approach to find missing coins it must be commonplace i received her his permission to publish this the transaction malleability bug was published last week at a time when i was disconnected from the internet for an extended period for open reasons i did not become aware of the threat until the attack was already occurring this was a failure on my part to trust more staff with critical access to stop withdrawals the people who did have access to disable withdrawals were terrified of doing it without my permission due to how negatively the community reacts when withdrawals are turned off they knew if they disabled withdrawals then re enabled them there would be a run on the bank and i would need to be online to deposit cold storage into hot storage in effect this was my failure to emphasize to staff that it is always day to lean on the side of caution and hit killswitches as they deem necessary it was also my failure to communicate expectations to the community that sometimes killswitches will have to be hit and it just means were playing it safe this month it is clear we did not play it safe killswitches are pointless if the only person confident enough to hit them is the boss the attacker used an account first registered in early jan to try exploiting the vulnerability looking back at the accounts history indicates that this account has been

panicking each time precaution is exercised there s more to web security than rigorous penetration testing it also requires the constant review of external services systems and infrastructures never make assumptions when implementing protocols you did not design had we not trusted magots staff procedures we would have reviewed our approaches with much more rigor just because a large companys procedures are successful does not make them are safe accept that your community will hate you regardless in the darknet you will be crucified by your community if anything ever goes wrong psychologically prepare for everyone to hate you because you inevitably will fail at something and you will need to stay determined no matter what dont let it get to your head and done let it affect your rigor with security we cut corners with our deposit withdrawal speed optimizations because we were afraid of the lynch mob we were foolish in this regard we should have taken the entire site offline for as long as it took to implement a high volume fault tolerant bitcoin server in a well tested rigorous manner this cost us an unspeakable amount of trust that we had saved to build some of us for years this is where were at with as much transparency as this medium allows the worst that could happen did not happen the worst thing that could happen for our communitys finances however did we hate that it occurred under our watch there is nothing we can do to change this all we can do is be transparent about where we are at and move forward to those who will respond here for dramatic

make assumptions when implementing protocols you did not design had we not trusted magots staff procedures we would have reviewed our approaches with much more rigor just because a large companys procedures are successful does not make them are safe accept that your community will hate you regardless in the darknet you will be crucified by your community if anything ever goes wrong psychologically prepare for everyone to hate you because you inevitably will fail at something and you will need to stay determined no matter what dont let it get to your head and done let it affect your rigor with security we cut corners with our deposit withdrawal speed optimizations because we were afraid of the lynch mob we were foolish in this regard we should have taken the entire site offline for as long as it took to implement a high volume fault tolerant bitcoin server in a well tested rigorous manner this cost us an unspeakable amount of trust that we had saved to build some of us for years this is where were at with as much transparency as this medium allows the worst that could happen did not happen the worst thing that could happen for our communitys finances however did we hate that it occurred under our watch there is nothing we can do to change this all we can do is be transparent about where we are at and move forward to those who will respond here for dramatic effect please consider contributing your energy to the reconstruction of our community if you can not bring yourself to do this then please take your negativity elsewhere this is simple if you have lost faith in silk road i dont blame you in the least i also do not want to read about it in perpetuity trolling is easy trolling during a disaster is cowardice choosing to strengthen rather than troll when trolling is the popular move thats noble i know that i speak for all silk road staff seen and unseen when i speak these words we are going nowhere we will remain rebuilt and move forward toward the greater goal for which we strive by our running of this marketplace personal freedom and foundation human rights silk road will always rise again begin pgp signature iqicbaebcgagbqjs m

february pmquote from parisproject on february only fe market with current feedback system scamper s heavenwe are open to suggestions current feedback system what quick improvements would you make to enable fe only to operate safer first introduce a more rigorous probation period for new vendors which can only be lifted after a number of random purchases have been made by a dedicated secret team vendors on probation could for instance face limits on the amount or price of products they can list or the number of transactions they can conduct during the probation period once their integrity has been established by a number of secret transactions by the mystery shoppers the probation period could be lifted as previously stated i firmly believe that the most efficient and effective way to restore confidence in the marketplace is to have all new vendors secretly petted by a team of mystery shoppers these would be to all intents and purposes otherwise remarkable garden variety buyers who from time to time are engaged to purchase from a new vendor and provide a detailed report on the transaction alternately they could be a dedicated team with permanent membership but this could lead to their identities being detected the key is for the identity of the mystery shoppers and the timing or frequency of their transactions to remain unknown thus in theory giving new vendors an incentive to provide a consistent level of service and quality the mystery shoppers would provide detailed feedback on their transaction with a new vendor and this feedback could even appear in a separate category to other buyer feedback to distinguish it from possibly false feedback generated by fake transactions for more conclusive results ongoing quality control and investigation of buyer complaints multiply mystery shopper transactions could be made mystery shoppers could also be used as a way of ongoing quality assurance to randomly review the quality and service of any endor new or veteran the results of their transaction would then determine whether a new vendor should progress beyond the default probation period to prevent the possibility of collusion between mystery shopper and vendor membership of the team could be rotted or multiply mystery shopper purchases could be required to establish the bone fides of any new vendor these two measures a probation period for vendors coupled with random quality assurance provided by a team of mystery shoppers will go a long way to preventing swam vendors setting themselves up with fake feedback from fake transactions and i am confident they could be easily implements wow i really like this idea a mystery shopper thread would be great on the forums a dedicated team testing out the new vendors and rotating the buyers every now and then quote from stealth on march amwow ps someone has had their coffee today the leaders captains owners whatever you choose to call them are the best team on the darknet dangerdan and others blaming all this on defcon referring to him as useless unfit to lead etc you are sorely mistaken but you have the right to be wrong as it were you didnt choose him he didnt choose this job but he has taken the bull by the horns and believe me when i tell you this bs hurt us but it did not kill us it set into motion one of the greatest things i have ever seen the massive amount of people here including every member of staff giving of themselves to help those who lost out i am enjoying the energy in this thread keep it going i would not be here if this was not a cause i was willing to go to prison for and i certainly would not be here if i was not certain of both the moral fiber and capability our leaders but hey im just some anonymous thing from the darker quote from v on february pmquote from ktvstudio on february amthose users write over and over posts like scammmer sr is one big scam and sr is dead go to angora etc i really dont know why theyre doing that i think the reasons are for the most part two fold some users are genuinely concerned about the fact that they consider silk road to be a scam and are trying to get to the bottom of it more often this new general scheme marketplace culture were seeing develop that wasnt around during srs first market stretch is leading people to try and convince others to use their general links in the hope of making moneypeople have a right to voice their concerns and i would never want to stop that from happening where those concerns are genuine but it is counter productive when people are either a flooding the boards with the same message or b doing it to try and ruin the repute of a marketplace in order to promote their own or one they are afflicted with in terms of whether or not silk road is a swam though it will soon become apparent that our admin is a man of his word as users begin to see their pending balances replenished unfortunately however this will only stop those in group from voicing their concerns those in group will continue instead finding a different angle to shout about this is the part that is a shame not the part where people are genuinely concerned vquote from ktvstudio on february pm the core team the admins chief operators system admins forum mods support crew additional mods the mods forum mods business man the vendors vendor forum poster the base the community buyer forum posterthose are the four types of users you can find here the core team is now operating as system admins to implement new features into the system there working hours a day on that system the additional mods are dominated users who should support the core team with their work as forum mods they dont necessary live on the same continent and time zone theyre all volunteers so their online hours are variable but way less than the core team works the only thing those mods can do is forum stuff they probably have no contact to the core team beside this forum the vendors are users which have a economic interest in a working platform they often organize threads to stabilize the market like that trusted endor list and to gain clients help them find trusted vendors so that the scamming risk is lowered the community are users which in most cases just want to buy on the market when the market is not working many of those migrate to another market in fact is this group of users the most annoying group of all four they complain alot they often dont know how this system work they have nothing to loose here so the behaviour of some of them is really bad there are also the kind of users in the community who want to help and assist they explain the beginners how that system work so that they less likely be slammed they answer questions that otherwise a mod had to answer this is how this system here works this explains why some mods are in minor sections without having the possibility to contact the core team to inform the forum how far they got this explains why many users spam the forum and behave very unfriendly or unpolite they can pass easily to another market theyre not bound to any market the vendors are of course most of the time buisy with selling goods some of them are quite active here to assure that the community knows what theyve to do to get access to the market this is the hirarchy here so lets make the best out of it and keep the shop running and the core team away from unnecessary work quote from logburner on march ami dont believe sr stole the coins one bit it makes no sense them doing so i understand that people are angry but there is far too much hate all over the forums i have always been monitoring the forums since i joined sr but only now have i felt compelled to actually register a forum account and start posting people need to stay positive give the sr team some time and space to resolve the issues hopefully we will be back to some form of normalality very soonquote from gemma on february pmthis has certainly got me thinking first a point about the wider dark market community now more than ever we should all unite we already have the perfect community to call home the hub forum but thats for another day moving on to the idea of a silk road customer association i think this is a very good idea as customers we represent a majority of members and if on the same wavelength we do command a certain power without the customers what is the market now my vision is one of complete co operation with staff and vendors to ensure complete and utter disclosure from top to bottom we have to move away from division of groups and realise that only on the same page can we truly expect to flourish there are strange times for this market but from these strange times we may be able to build something that changes the sector for the better clear simple methods for asking questions posting feedback and for raising concerns a system whereby customers may be able to raise awareness to issues that if caught early on mean they cant develop into something bigger as we look into it you could create a sub forum elect representatives for customers and vendors who work to canvas opinion of their respective groups before taking it to staff thus saving staff time having to sort through repetition posts its an idealism but i really thing if people want it enough we could be involved with something special opinions ed . maybe you have detected a very few writers have experienced with the myriad possibilities of online self expression in this case im glad people are trying to figure out whats been going on here i dont have the brain energy tonight to try to follow all the above hypothesizing though i do hope we find the truth and appreciate your effort ed . quote from ed from sl on march amxsposer very weird vibes on the sr forums tonight almost all of the posts replies are pro sr and they are coming from a handful of name no familiar faces and then there is the murmur in the community again bad vibes regarding captainwhitebeard and hiniguel reports of scamming being absent worshipped by some reviled by others some are now of the opinion that it is just one man behind limitless stexo hiniguel dpr defcon hux etc and it is beginning to make sense watching the latest theatrics regarding hiniguel its hard not to see a setup for the next big thing nobody is buying defcons bullshit anymore so hiniguel steps up and saves the day he refunds a bunch of money to people or pretends to using more name all the while denouncing defcon sr he says hes leaving but hints that the market might be re born elsewhere in the future people nominating him as the next leader im comparing name posts and while i have just begun it looks like hiniguel bluegiraffe mdmazing and hes talking to himself consider the following quotes and study them carefully pay attention to the sentence paragraph structure punctuation etc one thing jumps out at me his use of the em dash and semicolon but he represents an em dash thus single hyphen with a space on either side not many people employ these marks of punctuation in their writing or they misuse them furthermore there is a common use of the term mate used by many of these nyms as well as a failure to capitalize the letter i i then there is the overlay content topics threads many sound like they are coming from someone on the s staff take gemma for instance perhaps compiling a list would be in order compare just the following dpr in the admin roles dr defcon the similarity is obvious the numerical lists bold headlines etc and cwb jabbatheslut stealth v hes a goddamned one man band dozens of nyms everywhere but maybe its all in my head because i dont even see how it could be possible yes perhaps give gone around the bend and im not claiming that any of this is true but i wanted to share my thoughts and see what you think is it all really just a goddamned swam very very interesting ed i wish i could give you a you definitely deserve it weve also noticed the similarities of certain major accounts on sr and we even have screenshots of some posts which show an obvious correlation of writing styles between the main players of sr but i wanted to restrain from adding my own speculations to this saga as not to bias any of the impartial evidence we have posted above that being said i will comment on the hiniguel situation just to clear things up as many people have been asking on this forum and others and i have been kind of sceptical to answer but what i can say is this as much as i respect hiniguel for his momentary help to the sr community and to an extent his forum moderation i will say that he provided no helpful information whatsoever regarding this whole sr investigation he has obviously been helping the community in a lot of ways and defcon stealth clu have all agreed not to mention other members i personally know have confirmed that hes helped them out but every reply we did receive not many was extremely vague and absent of fact even when we presented evidence to him and simply asked for his input we initials put this down to his busy schedule because at that point he had already offered his millions to help out the community so he was geting boarded with emails pms but weeks after the fact we have still received nothing of significance from him which is weird because he got a personal thankyou from defcon and team for his investigate help again i respect hiniguel for his help to the sr community but dispite our best efforts he has not contributed to this investigation where as bbmc btva and to an extent oracle went above and beyond their requirements and were more than professional in their cooperation oracle providing some very interesting speculation about account sharing similar to what ed suspects above the thought that this whole operation could be a man show while not that outrageous unless give been up too late and have gone round the bend with you lol is not consistent with our findings it seems to be more likely a couple of very experienced old school players acting together operating as vendors mods admit vocal forum members we will try and clear up the whos who in all of this at some point but whatever outcome we arrive at will obviously be speculation based on evidence of course but none the less speculation but we can state that it is evident to us that dpr steps hux are in the same more to come later xsposer also as ed pointed out there are no more familiar faces on sr this is a clear sign that something isn right when all the original and experienced sr members clear out and leave nothing but tumbleweed and kiss ass noobs its time to leave aswell . quote from no nugz on march amthe wild ride continues lol still selling on sr must be a glass is full kinda optimist or something i can understand because wildly dissapointingly sr still gets the most traffic dispite all the missing btc and other bullshit they pull but i would be seriously cautious about keeping any coins there even for a few hours . well weird things happen when a guy stays up too late my detective work is evidence of that . yeah that prague dude . quote from ed from sl on
