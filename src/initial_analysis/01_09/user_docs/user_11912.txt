freedom is ravished by silk road and our fellow elusive dark net companions silk road is for revolutionaries it embodies our resentment of those intent on our destruction the mantle we hide behind is systematically strengthened and tested now we are powering on all cylinders so to speak silk road is a monster that should be revered by men so close minded they are deserving of pity the end of silk road is an augury that our resurgence will face dark days but we will rise again and again in sempiternal apotheosis with our teeth and claws prime and ready i will not deceive you into thinking we

i expect the carders on evolution to understand but i presume that deep down we share sentiments about the original silk road and how ross believed in more than simply power and wealth defcon despite
