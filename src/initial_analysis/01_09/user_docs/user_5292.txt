get comfortable with the term economic civil disobedience spread the idea that the state is not magic it is nothing more than a collection of your neighbors no more ethical and noble than the later next door learn how to find the false assumptions in arguments most public lies sound okay if you dont find their unspoken assumptions if they pass too quickly find the written version and search for the lie it contains learn how to disagree with kindness accept the fact that most people are confused and are just barely hanging on to their last shreds of self esteem understand that state intellectuals like this condition as it makes people easier to keep in line a little shame goes a long way done waste your energy on the political crisis de jour busy your mind with more substantial things daily political dramas are a time sink and the statists like it stop following their script use jurisdiction arbitrage to deprive the state of your money work with friends if the setup costs are too large for you learn to defend yourself your family your neighbors and your town no state means no military until you take this upon yourself your plans will always have a gaping hole in their middle there is no free lunch here either get weapons and be mental prepared to use them decide in advance how and when you would use them do not leave it to the emotion of the moment that will make a shipwreck of the whole venture learn how to use them safely do something nice for your neighbor the people who live near you are a far more important part of your environment than any other help people who suffer undeservedly no state means you are responsible for charity sure it will be much easier when the state isnt stealing all your extra money or chasing you in hope of theft but do what you can now and get used to the process watch over your friends notice when they are having a bad day show some kindness and concern if they are overlooked carry some of their burden we all have bad times and your bad day may come too help one another restore one another . hello family i found this somewhere in the deepweb at an anarchyst library i wanted to share with you what do you think fifty
