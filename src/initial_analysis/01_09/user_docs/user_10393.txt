im happy whenever i read anything pro privacy because shit is depressing lately i found this today and its a kinda low tech approach that was a different perspective to consider for me at least it wouldnt really apply to most of our communication since our most important communications take place but since we were talking about the forum being scraped by bots would something like this help

like this that make me glad that im an old man it seems as though zaphod is right once again the story about the nsa secretly backdooring almost every hdd is very worryings indeed below is an article i recently read online which seems to back up what zaphod has already posted either way its certainly a potentially worryings development with huge implications for all concerned if its proven to be accurate quote according to an in depth report from security company kapersky labs the national security agency nsa could be planting advanced malware in hdd firmware giving the nsa unprecedented access to computers from all over the world cyber espionage group equation is reported responsible for creating the malware which uses previously undiscovered techniques to plant malware on hdds so that its undetectable and current is virtual impossible to get rid of even formatting the drive or using software such as dban to wipe it clean wont do the trick the malware takes advantage of exploits identified in hdds from almost every known major manufacturer to rascally reprogram the drives existing firmware creating secret sectors that are only accessible through an ai application programming interfere equation uses a toolset thats remarkably similar to what the nsa has used in the past based on leaned documents from while kapersky lambs cant say uprightly that the nsa is involved the report certainly insinuates it one has to wonder how the nsa has managed to get access to the hdd manufacturers firmware . quote from taylor on april amquotep s its time like this that

broadband cable severed oopsy quotenew zealands interest connection to the united states has survived a cable cut in oregon on the us west coast southern cross cable network confirmed a segment of its cable network was cut at about am new zealand time when a contractor working for the states transport department in the town of klamath falls cut through it with a digger spokeswoman rosemary foot said the cable was repaired in a little under nine hours southern cross network is configured as a figure of eight centred on hawaii the design means there is always one back up route if a section of the cable is cut the land based e segment of the cable that runs between oregon and san jose that was cut has an addition terrestrial back up but foot said its first choice was to instead switch circuits across its international links traffic that would usually run between the us and australia was diverted via new zealand foot said new zealand customers of southern cross had not been affected by the cable cut and nor had other customers who had paid for capacity via a back up route however the outage had some impact on customers outside new zealand who had not paid for protected circuits she said southern cross cable network confirmed the incident several hours after it was first approached by stuff for comment foot said it advised customers of the cable cut within minutes but does not make public releases about operation issues we reiterate there was no loss of service to any protected services and there was no impact to any new zealand originating or terminating service she said foot revealed there had been another cut on the same link in february when a boring machine cut through its fibre optic cable near sacramento several attempts have been made to build a business case for an additional fibre optic cable that would link new zealand to the us and reduce the countrys reliance on southern cross hawaiki cable secured a carrier licence in april from communications minister amy adams for its proposed subsea cable that would run between sydney whangarei and oregon however it has yet to confirm it has secured the us million m in funding that it needs to begin construction foot said the significant advantage of southern cross was that it was a dual cable network stuff source how perfect is it that there was a boring machine in sacramento so boring it severed an international telecommunications conduit nevermind im just tired and punch sorry sacramento you nilla wafer of a town of so this is a thing that has happened twice mere months after the ceo of southern cross said emphasis mine quote i can tell you quite categorically there is no facility by the nsa the gcsb or anyone else on the southern cross cable network let s be quite blunt to do
