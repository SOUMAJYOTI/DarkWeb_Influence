you trust the markets to not rob your money these people also have no real way to extort you anyhow what are they gon na say give us one meelion dollars or ill tell the popo you mailed something that was probably illegalthey have no idea what the fuck it is your mailing and you could not be arrested for buying stamps the only real way this service could harm you other than them being le is from packages being seized it would be quite a stretch to plan extortion based on that and if they dont keep logs which if they arent le and rent extorting they have no reason to then le have pretty much nothing if they were to ever bust these guys for selling stamps so the risk is low i agree were also making people sign in with an account theres no record of who bought what just an email address to
