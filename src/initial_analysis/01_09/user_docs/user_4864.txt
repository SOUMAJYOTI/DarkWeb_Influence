im gon na be degrading my opsec to tails on us and ill most likely be using public wi fi since i dont have my own on whatever atop comes my way obviously vpon and other things like that arent an option so is there anything else i need . quote from oh m ra on june pmhey unclean i would reccommend using a separate us key cd dvd microsd for keys and other sensitive things that you need to have encrusted persistent volumes never sit well with me take this analogy i see all these cell phone cases that double as wallets holding credit card ids money etc if someone were to steal your cell phone they would now have access to your complete identity since tails is amnesic if you do not use the persistent volume you will be able to keep all your other files separate tails itself is not illegal one more thing an s card is extremely easy to destroy chew microwave swallow the possibilites are endles if you have any other questions feel free to ask cthanks friend im not really good with this kinda stuff it took me forever to figure out how to install tails on us i wish there was just one single package you can just install and all your opsec needs are taken care of i guess tails is the closest thing to that but it seems like there are a million other things when you go around the deep web and see what everyone else talks about . quote from unclean on june pmwhen you are giving your email to someone how should you write the part that comes after the for example lets say i m using sigaint and my user name is estrangeddesperado do write it as estrangeddesperado sigaint org or estrangeddesperado sigaintevyh row onion i ve seen it done both ways but which one is the right one also this applies to other email providers as well use estrangeddesperado sigaint org the other will work but only for other sigaint accounts if you try to use the sigaintevyh rzvw onion address anyone who tries to send you email to that address from any other email provider will get an error message spitfire . tails on a us disk is pretty good the only problem is that as the system partition is suitable an attacker could tamper your system when using a dvd on each reboot you know that you have a clean system as long as you used a clean image when burning the cd you then can have an encrusted partition to store your files on a us disk or a microsd youd then have to open it mutually and work with text files or mutually link folders youd need during your cession you can always have a better opsec tails on a dvd for interest access and a second offline computer to encrypt and decrypt documents software isolation or physical isolation to protect your tor process tor over vpn over anonymous wifi live dvd software isolation on top of some physical isolation on a system that cant be tempered with possibilities are endless its up to you to decide if its worth it or not if youre a small time buyer dont worry tails is pretty good as it is if you have fun working your opsec up are a paranoid geek or a high profile target this might not be enough for you if not youll probably fine on your vpon question it will be needed only if you feel the need to hide the fact that you are using tor to your isp that will do nothing more if you use an anonymous wifi connection you probably dont need it remember done tell too much on your setup we dont need to know if you use a tireless connection or your own dsl router that might help an attacker find who you are and what are the weaknesses of your setup . quote from unclean on june pmwhen you are giving your email to someone how
