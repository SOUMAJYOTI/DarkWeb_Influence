darknet is still in good shape on our end it s not like le is busting people left and right and tor and pgp have been compromise the only problems have been issues of trust and scamming technically and on paper the darknet is fine like anything you just need to surround yourself with the right people the darknet is huge there could be another place like tmg where there are or so members and only they know the uri the possiblities are endless on the deepweb . guys i m astounded and disappointed it seems fairly certain black bank has excited via scam rascally they ve been down for roughly a week and now this message was posted via reddit on their blackbank team account i know you re afraid and i m afraid too that mdparity will never ever come backbut to answer all of your questionsmy messages here aren t usually pgp signed but there are only persons who have credentials for this profilei can t believe mdparity has decided to exit swam now if he has done it i m astonished but i believe he hasn t done it some might have happened to him since he s not answering my messagesi will give him until the first day of june before declaring blackbank dead so let s wait toghethermrdoe fortunately this won t affect me very much but nonetheless i m sad with ross about to be put away and the dnms becoming so flakes the future seems so uncertain i am privately quite proud to be a small part of this movement i rejoiced and cheered silently when several markets stepped up to fill the depressing gap left by the s takedown i followed the rise of trustworthy vendors who put their freedom on the line to keep this whole thing alive i know that for many market admins and vendors money is the key motivator that s fine i like money too i like money alot i love the feel and smell of fresh bills and those new bills are so cool looking however if there s anywhere i want my cash to go is to the honest vendors who keep this thing going many of those vendors are here at tmg i m so grateful to all of you honest vendors i ll support you when i can . yes it looks like they have most certainly exit scammed really sad about that actually i didn t lose anything but i did receive an order that was in escrow and now theres no way for the vendor to receive the coins i feel even worse for the vendors that are going to be put out of business this is one of the reasons i love communicating with people directly on here there are still tons of other marketplaces to choose from so i wouldn t say the dnet is in trouble or even close to dead agora is back up current and who knows maybe they have
