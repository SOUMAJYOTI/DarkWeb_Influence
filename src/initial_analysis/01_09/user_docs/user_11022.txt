quote from hackerjon on june pmi must express my dislike for krebs he is a liar and a hype master i have posted on his forum a couple of times and he always deletes my posts he prevents information from flowing freely and refuses to allow constructive criticism of his articles with that said i am not advocating carding just criticizing the author dont take it as an ad hominem attack either his information is flighty sometimes thanks for the feedback i suspect that krebs is coming from a position where he has an rather intense dislike for hackers carders and the like i suspect that this extends to those whom he thinks support them their methods or their goals if i am not mistaken some criminal groups have tried to have him swathed a couple of times so this likely has added to his dislike paranoia etc zaphod . i must express my dislike for krebs he is a liar and a hype master i have posted on his forum a couple of times and he always deletes my posts he prevents information

would be welcome i did some research but you never know enough firsthand experiences are the best thankssorry if its the wrong section . wow thanks for your fast reply i decided i will listen to your advice and will no longer continue with my cc research and everything around it too hard and too much risk the article you posted i have to say quite impressive from secret service i thought they were more behind in this area and years even passed since that article credit cards seemed like a fast and easy way in getting some cash are there any other shortcuts to making a or that done involve drugs weapons or similar thanks again . quote from thesilent on june pmare there any other shortcuts to making a or that done involve drugs weapons or similar thanks againhave you considered getting a job .

of people even the bad guys are really sloppy about choosing good passwords armed with the computing power provided by dna and a treasure trove of data about a suspects personal life and interests collected by field agents secret service computer forensics experts often can discover encryption key passwords in each case in which dna is used the secret service has plenty of plaintext or unencrypted data resident on the suspects computer hard drive that can provide important clues to that persons password when that data is fed into dna the system can create lists of words and phrases specific to the individual who owned the computer lists that are used to try to crack the suspects password dna can glean word lists from documents and e mails on the suspects pc and can scour the suspects web browser cache and extract words from web sites that the individual may have frequented if were got a suspect and we know from looking at his computer that he likes motorcycle web sites for example we can pull words down off of those sites and create a unique dictionary of passwords of motorcycle terms the secret services lewis said dna was developed under a program founded by the technical support working group a federal office that coordinates research on technologies to combat terrorism accessdatas various offerings are current used by nearly every federal agency that does computer forensics work according to hansen and executives at pasadena calif based guidance software another major player in the government market for forensics technology hansen said accessdata has learned through feedback with its customers in law enforcement that between and percent of the time investigators can crack an encryption key by creating word lists from content at sites listed in the suspects internet browser log or web site bookmarks most of the time this happens the password is some quick word related to the suspects area of interests or hobbies happen said hansen recalled one case several years ago in which police in the united kingdom used accessdatas technology to crack the encryption key of a suspect who frequently worked with horses using custom lists of words associated with all things equine investigators quickly zeroed in on his password which hansen says was some obscure word used to describe one component of a stirrup having the ability to craft custom dictionaries for each suspects computer makes it exponentially more likely that investigators can crack a given encryption code within a timeframe that would be useful in prosecuting a case said david mcnett president of distributed net created in as the worlds first general purpose distributed computing project if you have a whole hard drive of materials that could be related to the encryption key youre trying to crack that is extremely beneficial mcnett said in the world of encrusted microsoft windows drives and encrypted zip files four thousand machines is a stable force to bring to bear it took dna just under three hours to crack one file encrusted with winzip a popular file compression and encryption utility that offers bit and bit key encryption that attack was successful mainly because investigators were able to build highly target word lists about the suspect who owned the seized hard drive other encrypted files however are proving far more stubborn in a high profile investigation last fall code named operation firewall secret service agents infiltrated an internet crime ring used to buy and sell stolen credit cards a case that yielded more than arrests but also huge amounts of encrusted data dna is still toiling to crack most of those codes many of which were created with a formidable grade of bit encryption relying on a word list approach to crack keys becomes far more complex when dealing with suspects who communicate using a mix of languages and alphabets in operation firewall for example several of the suspects routine communicated online in english russian and ukrainian as well as a mishmash of the cyrillic and roman alphabets the secret service also is working on adapting dna to cope with emergent data secrecy threats such as an increased criminal use of steganography which involves hiding information by embedding messages inside other seemingly innoxious messages music files or images the secret service has deplored dna to percent of its internal computers at a rate of a few pcs per week and plans to expand the program to all of its systems by the end of this summer ultimately the agency hopes to build the network out across all federal agencies that comprise the department of homeland security it current holds a license to deploy the network out to systems unlike other distributed networking programs such as the search for extra terrestrial intelligence project which graphically display their number crunching progress when a host computers screen saver is actuated dna works silently in the background completely hidden from the user lewis said the secret service chose not to call attention to the program concerned that employees might remove it computer users often experience system lockups that are often inexplicable and many users will uninstall programs they dont understand lewis said as the user base becomes more educated with the program and how it functions we certainly retain the ability to make it more visible in the meantime the agency is looking to partner with companies in the private sector that may have computer processing power to spare though lewis declined to say which companies the secret service was approaching such a partnership would not endanger the secrecy of their operations lewis said because any one partner would be given only tiny snippets of an entire encrusted message or file distributed nets mcnett said he understands all too well the agencys desire for additional computing power there will be such a thing as too much computing power as soon as you can crack a key too quickly which is to say never in the secret services case sidebar how dan worksfrom washingtonpost com at amthe secret services distributed networking attack program consists of computers linked together and configured to try different password combinations against a series of encryption keys the network is organized hierarchically according to each computers processing power and function with each segment of the network named with a decidedly equine theme the machine that tells each segment of the network what to work on is called shadowfax named after the horse in j r r tolkiens lord of the rings series underneath shadowfax are several blackhorse machines that assign jobs to dna computers in secret service field offices around the country the computers that actually do most of the computations are called packhorses dna scours a suspects hard drive for words and phrases locked in plaintext and fetches words from internet sites listed in the computers web browse logs dna technicians then load the suspects encrusted data into the system while shadowfax tells the blackhorse computers how to distribute the workload of testing the keys against the word lists and execute any subsequent brute force attacks against the target encryption keys brian krebs . hey guys i have a couple of questions some are about carding and i know you guys are allegoric to it but bare with me if you go on nucleus market fraud related cc and ccv there are some vendores selling some stuff does anyone have any experience with it and the following vendors thinkingforward paypalz magnus alexdelarge these can cards those are credit card information for buying stuff online right those are not physical plastic ones i know they almost dont exist on the markets right are they repaid cards or active accounts any more info on this topic would be welcome i did some research but you never know enough firsthand experiences are the best thankssorry if its the wrong section . quote from hackerjon on june pmi must express my dislike for krebs he is a liar and a hype master i have posted on his forum a couple of times and he always deletes my posts he prevents information from flowing freely and refuses to allow constructive criticism of his articles with that said i am not advocating carding just criticizing the author dont take it as an ad hominem attack either his information is flighty sometimes thanks for the feedback i suspect that krebs is coming from a position where he has an rather intense dislike for hackers carders and the like i suspect that this extends to those whom he thinks support them their methods or their goals if i am not mistaken some criminal groups have tried to have him swathed a couple of times so this likely has added to his dislike paranoia etc zaphod . quote from thesilent on june pmare there any other shortcuts to making a or that done involve drugs weapons or similar thanks againhave you
