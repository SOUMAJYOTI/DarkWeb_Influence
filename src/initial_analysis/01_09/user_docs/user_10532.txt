model in an attempt to shift the risk carried by supporters to the developers of the project instead of asking interested parties to fund the development of the software the developers decided to pool funds together and carry the project to completion before making it public the consensus was that this is an ethical path given the realities of funding software development due to the fact that the developers alone carry the risk of the project failing whereas in the past potential users were expected to pay for coins before any code was written we felt this was unjust the development of decred was founded by company and from the pockets of its developers individually the cost of developing the project in terms of developer pay totals to approximate us which company paid to developers an additional amount of approximate us has been allotted for unpaid work and individual purchases by developers we felt that the most suitable way to handle compensation for these expenses was to perform a small premine as part of the project launch the model is unusual in that no developer received any amount of coins for free all coins owned by developers will either be purchased at a rate of us per coin from their own pockets or exchanged for work performed at the same rate the premine consists of of the total supply of million coins meaning the premine consists of million coins rather than allocating the entire premine to the bring up costs we decided to split the premine equally between compensation for bring up and an airdrop where we freely give an equal amount of coins to a number of airdrop participants this means company and its developers will have put roughly us into the bring up since april and receive of the total supply coins at us per coin the remaining will be spread evenly across a list of airdrop participants as part of an effort to build the decree network and decentralize its distribution coins held by company will be used to fund its going work on open source projects such as decree and btcsuite giving away these coins in an airdrop allows us to accomplish several things at once for the project enlarge the decree network further help decentralize the distribution of coins and allow us to get coins into the hands of people who are interested in participating in the project decred is fundamentally about technological progress so the airdrop will target individuals that have made contributions to advance technology in its various forms the maximum number of airdrop participants is clapped at individuals so we recommend registering sooner rather than later these coins will be given away unconditionally and there is zero expectation of decree receiving anything from you in return for these coins sign up for the airdrop is current open but the airdrop registration will commence on january th people who have been selected to participate in the airdrop will receive an email that contains a link to a web registration form this form

ecosystem that welcomes and empowers participants who want to build new functionality and improve on existing features any party can submit feature proposals and developers are paid for work to
