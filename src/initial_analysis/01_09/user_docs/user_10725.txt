i am looking at my options to create a wallet and buy btc after reading jolly rogers security thread for beginners i have some questions and thought we could expand on the thread by discussing our options and experiences here does it really matter if we initially fund or wallet through an exchange since we can use mixers would it matter if i bought btc there and used bitcoinfog a bunch of times and always transferred the untainted btc to a different address when should we use a mixer before after or both before and after a transaction such as a purchase how did you first do it what would you have done differently . yeah i honestly think that now it is best you use a market all but one that you can create a new wallet i after each transaction is safe enough for small buyers . my opinion on the matter is that its mostly unnecessary blockchain analysis is most likely done by le but it isnt an easy thing as far as i know le would have to have previously identified the wallet you sent coins to as a darknet market wallet aside from that i cant imagine it ever being used for a conviction they would have to explain how the blockchain network works to a judge i think and i dont see that happening judge judy aint got time for no cryptography lesson also mixing coins is adds another point of possibly having your coins stolen that being said if i were to buy very large purchase or sell a very large amount of something and or something that is super illegal i would mix my coins it is always good to be on the safe side but for small to medium purchases of drugs i say fuck it . i am

easy thing as far as i know le would have to have previously identified the wallet you sent coins to as a darknet market wallet aside from that i cant imagine it ever being used for a conviction they would have to explain how the blockchain network works to a judge i think and i dont see that happening judge judy aint got time for no cryptography lesson also mixing coins is adds another point of possibly having your coins stolen that being said if i were to buy very large purchase or sell a very large amount of something and or something that is super illegal i would mix my coins it is always good to be on the safe side but for small to medium purchases of drugs i say fuck it that threat model assumes that blockchain analysis will always be as difficult as it is right now give it time .

server was imaged and surveilled in real time from july until it was taken down on october of last year we still dont know how le identified the server it could have been a luck up by ross or it could have been a deanonymization attack like the relay early attack that we saw recently or some other spoil traffic confirmation attack or application layer exploit you should assume that your favorite dnm is compromise and they can link etc addresses to market accounts that makes it easy to follow the cointrail back to an exchange as for mixing services what makes you sure they havent identified the bitcoin fog servers and have been surveilling them in real time like they did the sr servers when coins coming out of the mixer can be linked through user accounts to coins coming into the mixer the mixing functionality is useless given the not insignificant possibility of these scenarios anonymously purchasing coins is the safest way to go . remember that the sr server was imaged and
