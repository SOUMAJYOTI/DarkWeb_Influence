spin up a new vm download your encrusted files and open them then shut it down delete that vm and expect no forensics left behind it will leak all over the system which is why a live os running on a backbones system is desirable so nothing is kept to find for anybody who doesnt know qubes is rascally hardened xen theres a root system where you launch numerous vms at the same time such as your bank browser vm which is configured for security for banking or your browse malicious sites vm where javascript is disabled the idea is to keep contacts and other private information in seperate vms from ones that are exposed to outside connections browsers it works great for joe blow business guy or a professional bitcoin or stock trader you can make your own qubes os with alpine linux and men kernel too if you wanted while you make some valid points fred in all honesty there is no fail safe highly secure operating system one could use its a combination of factors which when used in conjunction with each other can offer the end user a much lower risk of being owned its all about minimizing your risks so that the chances of you ever being de anonymized are as low as they can possibly be which is why i believe isolation particularly physical isolation is finally important in ones setup as well as hardening the os you intend to use thus reducing your attack surface cornelius fantasy may have inspired many real world applications however in relation to protecting your anonymity and privacy from prying eyes i for one will be sticking with evidence based proved techniques only in the real world its much easier to turn dreams into reality when there are no potential life changing legal repercussions to contend with however in the world of the deep web turning a dream into a secure functions reality is a more complex time consuming task than one would face if creating something similar and legal to use on the clearnet such as an e commerce site rascally what im trying to say is going from the early conception of an idea through to a thoroughly tested secure and functions application is not as simple as some may think especially when there is a lot to loose if users could potentially de anonymized as a result of using such an application improving on things already being used is another option available which can also lead to the creation and development of new ideas . quote from fredgarvin maleprostitute on april pmdj bernstein uses tubes according to his twitter as he wanted to spin up new vms without giving them access to the internal mic and that guy is probably the prominent security researcher on earth right now problem with qubes is its not a live system you have to install it and if you live in the uk or other despotism regime where you can be forced to hand over crypto keys youre screwed vms leave all kinds of metadata lying around in memory swap everywhere you cant just spin up a new vm download your encrusted files and
