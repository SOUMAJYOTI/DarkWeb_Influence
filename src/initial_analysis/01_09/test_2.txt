technical terms tor provides privacy by separating identity from routing online in a normal session online you re browsing from your computer or a router that s assigned its own ip address every request you send out carries that address and information is returned there when you use to instead of your chat message or the uri you type going directly to its destination it s routed through tor s network of volunteer nodes moving through at least three of them before exiting the network and proceeding to the endpoint the website that receives it doesn t know what your ip address is nor does any point in the tor circuit except for the entry relay for most users a tor session does not feel different from going on the web with the firefox browser but all the winding through relays does slow things down and the default settings disable some functions for security reasons including plugins that allow videos but they can be turned back on syverson and other researchers have written voluminously about tor s weaknesses the network operates within the wider web and the way users behave and configure their computers outside tor is one of the biggest sources of insecurity one way the nsa found to get around tor s software and spy on users was an attack called egotisticalgiraffe exploiting a vulnerability in the firefox browser another approach was to try to reconstruct the encrusted path to find the identity of a tor user by monitoring relays according to the tor stinks presentation success with this approach was eligible because all three hops in the circuit had to be part of the set nsa could monitor and the agency had access to few of them there is a deeper layer of tor where information is hasted called hidden services these sites are ragged with the extension onion and can only be accesse using tor a regular internet user s traffic goes through at least three hops hidden services traffic goes through at least six italian activists during the green movement protests in maintained blogs and websites using hidden services according to lewman the drug bazaar silk road operated as a hidden service you couldn t find and use silk road with a goggle search its

network and therefore communications stay encrusted therefore if a relay node is comprised the only information available will be the source not necessarily you it as its more likely to be the previous tor relay and the destination however in the case of accessing a clear net site the final tor relay node will act as what is known as the exit node if the original data you sent is not encrusted for example a standard http site then once this data leaves the exit node it will be in its unencrypted state again this means if the tor relay that is used an exit node is comprised then all unencrypted data is susceptible to being captured in an interpretable state i think any tor relay node can be an exit node and this is chosen during your connection to the tor circuit on each connection and probably when you use the new identity button the intelligence agencies probably host a lot of tor nodes in the hope of intercepting your data it would make sense to at least . hidden

forums are unsafe to visit because they compromise anoniminity . it probably came from pasting the link as you said the referrer is not necessarily a trail it can be added after clicking a link and merely contains the info about what page the link is clicked on the point of the referrer is so the site can make sure that you have visited the home page first or some other check to ensure that you followed the link from where the site wants you to come from it was originally intended for diagnosing problems in a site but designers started adding referrer checks to make sure that you may have

infernal supercaptcha lol i noticed the captcha was something that reminded me of them old school comics where you had to wear some red tinted glasses to see the image d sorta it worked i guess ppl were posting less cause it was near impossible to get it right the st time what i wondered though was a bot doesnt use human eyes to figure out the captcha so what does making it near impossible to read do to stop the bots from figuring it out because the coding required for pattern recognition is very very difficult and requires a lot of computing power i bet what they are using for the captchas are de captcha services whereby they grab the image and send it over to the aforementioned services where they have bunches of people actually solving them and sending them back usually in places like india where they hire kids to work hour weeks and pay them next to nothing also some of the newer services use a combination of ocr and human labor to get them solved making the captcha infernally difficult to figure out slows them down but will not stop them the only solution is having a mod in the forum which evidently they dont want to do . i did some shopping for bots lol will buy you one that will crack anything they put up with or support if the captchas are modified it does indeed take computer power though and i guarandamntee you that exactly why the forums have slowed

where i cant hardly even log on much less submit a postlol how did you ever find your way to the darknet do you really think a bots decapthca routine somehow runs on the forums server using up its processor time or do you just have no understanding whatsoever of a client server relationship let it be known indian never has used decapthca service in china or india or anywhere else unnecessary the flooders like tes gaylordfaulker could be causing the poor performance and timeouts indian respects abraxas and would not overload the server with requests alternatively it could be a deliberate ddos by someone like nightfox who has sworn to get bots banned at all costs endianchief is right that the computing load is placed on the server performing the decaptha service not being either his or abraxas hes also right his bots are code the right way so as not to overwhelm the forums with traffic and not flooding the forums with topics pushing people out fo the way in the interest of full disclosure he gave me a boost for a while on one of his bots i did not ask for this help he graciously offered it without asking for anything back so in grateful for his brief help however i dont know

thought the site was free for anyone to enter . if anyone is in need to an invite to dhl pm me on here ill send over the link with the demise of abraxas it might be time to start looking at direct deal market to stop the exit scams so far i have been impressed with del think they may be around for some time xxmiaxx . nah they locked it down for a while not sure why never had that much interest in joining multiply markets . lol captcha was globular tea time teaser solved . you have to keep in mind agora in the upper left corner still calls out the sites in beta dhl has made an accelerated push sine june to officially go live i still hope agora re opens as they have been a dnm bench mark due to the security and longevity this take nothing away from backcopy and bmr as they ran an above

about red links cause i thought the site was free for anyone to enter . i do not use much the markets i preffer direct orders by email this days and avoid the all ordeal of seeing your funds disappear but ive been looking around for a few new vendors lately and give been browsing the markets for it and i have to say i am thoroughly impressed with del give been registered for some time but never logged on much before however every time i do they seem to be implemeting new features and actively showing work done their layout is really nice and simple they have a superb if limited selection of vendors and several great features such as automatic encryption of all messages requiring to sign a new pgp key if changed javascript enabled alert possibility of direct pay with discount etc and very important for me is the fact that it is exclusively dedicated to the commerce of drugs i am really put off by other markets that allow goods and services such as fire arms scamming and fraud i just

anyone remember dutch green club lol . quote from kmf on february pmalso ovdb didnt shut down before sr it shut down some time into s remember sr made a subforum for ovdb after it shut down the first drug forum i was ever on was called sandoz labs in before that there was the hive which i wasnt on but i believe it had a small private market associated with it but it is even further removed from the current markets of today than the classical forums were in that it was more informed than organized there was also the rcml research chemical mailing list that was before sand labs and i also was not on that i think sand labs was essentially the oldest forum that can be said as being part of the lineage leading up to ovdb it went more or lesssandoz labs the bible research chemicals net follow

drained of btc to which the stock standard response from the mods is youve been wished end of discussion i know a lot of people do get wished especially given how the methods of stealing peoples bitcoin has evolved but some of these people claim to have fa actuated so unless they are all lying id say thats one good reason to avoid it give heard it rumored that admins will target vulnerable accounts with no fa and just steal deposits also the place is run by scammers and thieves so i think its a pretty safe bet to say that they will exit scam just a matter of when many people will continue to use it though regardless because they are happy to take the risk of potentially losing their coins for the convenience of having a stable market which makes no sense to me when there are far more safer alternatives out there . quote from trust in us on march pmtl drto trust such a place is pure idiocymuch lovetrusttrust . i figured out what happened in the end i didnt read the fine

obviously bmr came after sr ovdb pretty soon after though i think backopy bmr admin was inspired by dprs project sr the first darkness drug market im aware of was private it was a public rc forum then became private clearnet rc forum invites required then moved to a onion named to skunk forum and allowed all drugs to be sold traded this conversion to a dnm was in feb at the latest the next one im aware of dsr started as a private clearnet all drugs allowed forum in or that moved to onion some time in late that private forum was one of the forums whos members became the vendors and admit s of ovdb in ovdb was conceived in possibly earlier was under development in late was deplored in just barely after sr became the first to deploy open dnm sr may have been conceived before ovdb was i say this because of sr s revolutionary format it must have taken quite some time to put together but i have some doubt about that dpr was an unknown character not involved on any of the private forums as far as anyone knows it was pretty difficult to get on private forums unless you were already on at least one speaking of over one of the big acid vendors there was a guy from belgium called tarpaulin he ripped off so many people for so much money and was banned from over funny that tarpaulin has appeared at tmg recently and is active he must really like that name see on there was another also private all drugs allowed clearnet forum called drug friends which required invites from topic people when it was established as a org late df eventually became a onion private forum spring at the earliest and dec at the latest my memory is not great on this one pip then pip after pip died were learned private all drugs allowed forum from many years ago pip eventually moved to a onion july and became pit it was hasted at freedomhosting and went offline when the feds took that server down in august there were a few other scattered small private darkness drug forums that started in i dont know any of those that still exist there was a rc only forum that went onion in i think early it didnt last long at all scams and mismanagement and scams by management ripped it apart quote from emmet on february pmfarmers market was around before bmr ovdb more of a forum was around before fm and bmr thats right farmers market tfm was around way before most other drug markets as a clearnet forum that was open to the public they moved to a onion a little too late they were already being investigated anyway though busted in april the wikipedia article says tfm moved to a onion in that may be so but it must have been late because i remember other forums had already moved to onions most were of course glad to see that tfm was taking their security more seriously some users gave up because it was too hard for them to use or too slow most got on board maybe is when adamflowers started as the dea seems to assert it could have been earlier if anyone really wants to know go to and put in the search bar and look at it so see when adamflowers first vendor ad appeared quotebut if we actually want to go back to the first real bitcoin market then the answer is budmail biz or topics comi done

both in development at the same time though but it shut down about half a year into sr since there was no reason to run it when sr was blowing up anyway in certain ovdb was in operation before sr first launched for how long im not sure but it was definitely up and running before sr first begun . over open vendor database had subforums based on the type of drugs offered for sale by vendors plus threads dedicated to certain trusted vendors as well it shut down early on into the beginning of sr it didnt end well from memory kmfkewm just one of his many name perhaps better known from the sr forum to some was the site admin . ramp russian anonymous marketplace would be the oldest if its still running its even older than sr only in russian though no idea how it works . valhalla . valhalla

believe it had a small private market associated with it but it is even further removed from the current markets of today than the classical forums were in that it was more informed than organized there was also the rcml research chemical mailing list that was before sand labs and i also was not on that i think sand labs was essentially the oldest forum that can be said as being part of the

im not sure but it was definitely up and running before sr first begun it must have been just before sr launched then because i remember reading ross talking about it on the bitcoin forum while ovdb was in the process of being set up in not too sure but it was operation prior to sr there were some great vendors on ovdb offering some amazingly cheap prices for top quality products . anyone
